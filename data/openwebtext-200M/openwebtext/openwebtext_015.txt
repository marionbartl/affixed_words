Recycling
Is Garbage
AS THEY PUT ON PLASTIC GLOVES FOR THEIR first litter hunt , the third graders knew what to expect .
They knew their garbage .
It was part of their science curriculum at Bridges Elementary , a public school on West 17th Street in Manhattan .
They had learned the Three R's - Reduce , Reuse , Recycle - and discussed how to stop their parents from using paper plates .
For Earth Day they had read a Scholastic science publication , " Inside the World of Trash . "
For homework , they had kept garbage diaries and drawn color - coded charts of their families ' trash .
So they were primed for the field experiment on this May afternoon .
" We have to help the earth , " Natasha Newman explained as she and her classmates dashed around the school collecting specimens .
Their science teacher , Linnette Aponte , mediated disputes - " I saw that gum wrapper first ! " - and supervised the subsequent analysis of data back in the classroom .
The students gathered around to watch her dump out their bags on the floor .
" Do you see any pattern as I 'm emptying it ? " Miss Aponte asked .
" Yeah , it stinks . "
" Everybody 's chewing Winterfresh . "
" A lot of paper napkins . "
" It 's disgusting . "
They 're throwing away a folder .
That 's a perfectly good folder ! "
" It 's only half a folder . "
" Well , they could find the other half and attach them together . "
Miss Aponte finished emptying the last bag .
" We 've been learning about the need to reduce , reuse and recycle , " she said , and pointed at the pile .
" How does all this make you feel ? "
" Baaaad , " the students moaned .
Miss Aponte separated out two bottles , the only items in the pile that could be recycled .
She asked what lesson the students had learned .
The class sentiment was summarized by Lily Finn , the student who had been so determined to save the half folder : " People should n't throw away paper or anything .
They should recycle it :
And they should n't eat candy in school Lily 's judgment about candy sounded reasonable , but the conclusion about recycling seemed to be contradicted by the data on the floor .
The pile of garbage included the equipment used by the children in the litter hunt : a dozen plastic bags and two dozen pairs of plastic gloves .
The cost of this recycling equipment obviously exceed value of the recyclable items recovered .
The equipment also seemed to be a greater burden on the environment , because the bags and gloves would occupy more space in a landfill than the two bottles .
Without realizing it , the third graders had beautifully reproduced the results of a grand national experiment begun in 1987 - the year they were born , back when the Three R's had nothing to do with garbage .
That year a barge named the Mobro 4000 wandered thousands of miles trying to unload its cargo of Long Islanders ' trash , and its journey had a strange effect on America .
The citizens of the richest society in the history of the planet suddenly became obsessed with personally handling their own waste .
Believing that there vas no more room in landfills , Americans concluded that recycling was their only option .
Their intentions were good and their conclusions seemed plausible .
Recycling does sometimes makes sense - for some materials in some places at some times .
But the simplest and cheapest option is usually to bury garbage in an environrnentally safe landfill .
And since there 's no shortage of landfill space ( the crisis of 1987 was a false alarm ) , there 's no reason to make recycling a legal or moral imperative .
Mandatory recycling programs are n't good for posterity .
They offer mainly short - term benefits to a few groups - politicians , public relations consultants , environmental organizations , waste - handling corporations - while diverting money from genuine social and environmental problems .
Recycling may be the most wasteful activity in modern America : a waste of time and money , a waste of human and natural resources .
The obvious temptation is to blame journalists , who did a remarkable job of creating the garbage crisis , often at considerable expense to their own employers .
Newspaper and magazine publishers , whose products are a major component of municipal landfills , nobly led the crusade against trash , and they 're paying for it now through regulations that force them to buy recycled paper - a costly handicap in their struggle against electronic rivals .
It 's the first time that an industry has conducted a mass - media campaign informing customers that its own product is a menace to society .
But the press is n't solely responsible for recycling fervor ; the public 's obsession would n't have lasted this long unless recycling met some emotional need .
Just as the third graders believed that their litter run was helping the planet , Americans have embraced recycling as a transcendental experience , an act of moral redemption .
We 're not just reusing our garbage ; we 're performing a rite of atonement for the sin of excess .
Recycling teaches the themes that previous generations of schoolchildren learned from that Puritan classic , " The Pilgrim 's Progress . "
John Bunyan 's 17th - century allegory features a character not unlike the garbage barge that left Long Island : a man dressed in rags who flees the City of Destruction , desperate to find a place he can unload the " great burden upon his back . "
Guided by the Evangelist , the pilgrim wanders the world trying to reach the Celestial City .
His worst trial occurs in Vanity Fair , a village market founded by Beelzebub and inhabited by noblemen named Lord Luxurious and Sir Having Greedy .
The market offers tempting wares , but the pilgrim bravely practices the first R- reduce - by shunning the products of the " merchandizers " and continuing on to the Celestial City .
Today 's schoolchildren , though , might be confused by one character encountered on Bunyan 's road to salvation : a man , the source of our word " muckraker , " who is busy raking together a compost pile .
This recycler of household waste is n't presented as a role model for the pilgrim .
He 's a symbol of moral blindness because , instead of looking up to see the heavenly rewards awaiting him , he " could look no way but downwards , with a muck - rake in his hand . "
In Bunyan 's time , it would have been hard to imagine that pilgrims would one day be taught to search for salvation right down there in the muck .
All I 've been thinking about all week is garbage .
I mean , I just can't stop thinking about it ....
I 've just gotten real concerned over what 's gonna happen ....
I started feeling this way ... when that barge was stranded .
" - Opening lines of the 1989 film " Sex , Lies and Videotape , " spoken to a psychiatrist by a woman whose real problems - sexual and marital unhappiness - have nothing to do with municipal solid waste .
AT THE TIME AMERICANS BECAME RACKED WITH GARBAGE GUILT , businesses were already recycling millions of tons of trash a year .
They were voluntarily - and profitably - recycling newsprint , office paper , cardboard , aluminum and steel .
But the barge 's plight convinced everyone that voluntary enterprise was not enough .
As Newsweek noted , the Mobro 's saga was " to the trash crisis what the sinking of the Lusitania was to World War I . "
The magazine 's cover story , titled " Buried Alive , " warned : ' With rare exceptions during wartime , Americans have not been adept at making individual sacrifices for the common good .
That mentality will have to change .
Otherwise , the dumps will cover the country coast to coast and the trucks will stop in everybody 's backyard . "
Suddenly , just as central planning was going out of fashion in eastern Europe , America devised a national five - year plan for trash .
The Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a " Waste Hierarchy " that ranked trash disposal options : recycling at the top , composting and waste - to - energy incinerators in the middle , landfills at the bottom .
The E.P.A.'s five - year goal , to recycle 25 percent of municipal trash , was announced in a speech in early 1988 by J. Winston Porter , an assistant administrator of the agency .
Even as Porter was setting the goal , he realized that it was presumptuous for a bureaucrat in Washington to tell everyone in America what to do with their trash .
" After all the publicity about the barge , " Porter recalls , " I sat down with some engineers in my office to estimate how much municipal waste could be recycled .
At that time , about 10 percent was being recycled .
We looked at the components of waste , made a few quick calculations and figured that it was reasonable to reach a level of 25 percent within five years .
It was n't a highly quantified thing .
Some of the staff did n't even want me to mention a figure .
But I thought it would be good to set a target , as long as it was strictly voluntary and did n't involve a lot of regulations . "
Politicians across the country had bigger ideas .
State and city officials enacted laws mandating recycling and setting arbitrary goals even higher than the E.P.A.'s .
Most states set rigid quotas , typically requiring that at least 40 percent of trash be recycled , often even more - 50 percent in New York and California , 60 percent in New Jersey , 70 percent in Rhode Island .
Industries were pressured to set their own goals .
Municipalities followed the Waste Hierarchy by building waste - to - energy incinerators and starting thousands of curbside recycling programs - all in the belief that it would be cheaper than landfilling .
But the incinerators turned out to be disastrously expensive , and the recycling programs produced a glut of paper , glass and plastic that no one wanted to buy .
So recycling devotees hit on a new solution : if people are n't willing to buy our precious garbage , we 'll force them .
The Federal Government and dozens of states passed laws that required public agencies , newspapers and other companies to purchase recycled materials .
These regulations , along with a wide variety of tax breaks and subsidies , have pushed the national rate of recycling up to Porter 's goal of 25 percent - an expensive achievement , since the programs lose money .
But that 's still not enough .
Environmental groups are pressuring local governments to expand their recycling programs to meet the goals set in law - goals that , according to the official who helped start the whole movement , are impossible to reach .
" People in New York and other places are tilting at recycling windmills , " says Porter , who left the E.P.A. in 1989 and is now president of a consulting firm , the Waste Policy Center in Leesburg , Va .
" There are n't many more materials in garbage that are worth recycling . "
Porter has been advising cities and states to abandon their unrealistic goals , but politicians are terrified of coming out against recycling .
How could they explain to the voters ?
How could they explain it to their children ?
AFTER THE LITTER HUNT IN MISS APONTE'S SCIENCE classroom , it was time for a guest lecturer on garbage .
A fifth - grade class was brought in to hear Joanne Dittersdorf , the director of environmental education for the Environmental Action Coalition , a nonprofit group based in New York .
Her slide show began with a 19th - century photograph of a street in New York strewn with garbage .
" Why ca n't we keep throwing out garbage that way ? " Dittersdorf asked .
" It 'll keep piling up and we wo n't have any place to put it . "
" The earth would be called the Trash Can . "
The garbage will soon , like , take over the whole world and , like , kill everybody . "
Dittersdorf asked the children to examine their lives .
" Does anyone here ever have takeout food ? "
A few students confessed , and Dittersdorf gently scolded them .
" A lot of garbage there . "
She showed a slide illustrating New Yorkers ' total annual production of garbage : a pile big enough to fill 15 city blocks to a height of 20 stories .
' There are a lot of landfills in New York City , " Dittersdorf said , " but we 've run out of space . "
Showing a slide of Flushing Meadows , a former landfill that 's now a park , she asked , " Would you want to live on top of one of these landfills ? "
The place did n't look too bad , actually , but Dittersdorf explained that toxic threats could be hidden in a landfill .
" Have you ever heard of a place called Love Canal ?
It was an old landfill that belonged to a chemical company , and they sold it to build a school on , and everyone who went to that school got very sick .
There was poison in the dirt underneath . "
A supermarket package of red apples appeared on the screen .
" Look at the plastic , the Styrofoam or cardboard underneath , " Dittersdorf said .
" Do you need this much wrapping when you buy things ? " " Noooo . "
Every week , " Dittersdorf said , " 75,000 trees are cut to make the Sunday New York Times . "
The children were appalled .
A few glanced reproachfully at me sitting in the back of the room .
I did n't try to justify my - or your - role in this weekly tree - slaying , garbage - generating , earth - defiling ritual .
The children were in no mood for heresy .
Dittersdorf had masterfully reinforced the mythical tenets of the garbage crisis :
We 're a wicked throwaway society .
Plastic packaging and fast - food containers may seem wasteful , but they actually save resources and reduce trash .
The typical household in Mexico City buys fewer packaged goods than an American household , but it produces one third more garbage , chiefly because Mexicans buy fresh foods in bulk and throw away large portions that are unused , spoiled or stale .
Those apples in Dittersdorf 's slide , protected by plastic wrap and foam , are less likely to spoil .
The lightweight plastic packaging requires much less energy to manufacture and transport than traditional alternatives like cardboard or paper .
Food companies have switched to plastic packaging because they make money by using resources efficiently .
A typical McDonald 's discards less than two ounces of garbage for each customer served - less than what 's generated by a typical meal at home .
Plastic packaging is routinely criticized because it does n't decay in landfills , but neither does most other packaging , as William Rathje , an archaeologist at the University of Arizona , has discovered from his excavations of landfills .
Rathje found that paper , cardboard and other organic materials - while technically biodegradable - tend to remain intact in the airless confines of a landfill .
These mummified materials actually use much more landfill space than plastic packaging , which has steadily been getting smaller as manufacturers develop stronger , thinner materials .
Juice cartons take up half the landfill space occupied by the glass bottles they replaced ; 12 plastic grocery bags fit in the space occupied by one paper bag .
Our garbage will bury us .
The Mobro 's saga was presented as a grim harbinger of future landfill scarcity , but it actually represented a short - lived scare caused by new environmental regulations .
As old municipal dumps were forced to close in the 1980's , towns had to send their garbage elsewhere and pay higher prices for scarce landfill space .
But the higher prices , predictably , encouraged companies to open huge new landfills , in some regions creating a glut that set off price - cutting wars .
Over the past few years , landfills in the South and Middle West have been vying for garbage from the New York area , and it has become cheaper to ship garbage there than to bury it locally .
America today has a good deal more landfill space available than it did 10 years ago .
Landfills are scarce in just a few places , notably the Northeast , partly because of local economic realities ( open land is expensive near cities ) but mainly because of local politics .
Environmentalists have prevented new landfills from opening by propounding another myth ....
Our garbage will poison us .
By mentioning Love Canal , Dittersdorf made landfills sound like the Slough of Despond , Bunyan 's dread swamp .
But it 's not fair to compare modern municipal - trash landfills with Love Canal , an old industrial dump filled with large concentrations of toxic chemicals that seeped into the ground when a school was , stupidly , built on the site .
( Even so , it 's not clear that any of the schoolchildren were poisoned .
Exhaustive scientific studies around Love Canal have n't detected any increase in cancer rates . )
Today 's landfills for municipal trash are filled mostly with innocuous materials like paper , yard waste and construction debris .
They contain small amounts of hazardous wastes , like lead and mercury , but studies have found that these poisons stay trapped inside the mass of garbage even in the old , unlined dumps that were built before today 's stringent regulations .
So there 's little reason to worry about modern landfills , which by Federal law must be lined with clay and plastic , equipped with drainage and gas - collection systems , covered daily with soil and monitored regularly for underground leaks .
The small - time operators who ran the old municipal dumps can't afford to provide these safeguards , which is why corporations have moved in , opening huge facilities that might serve half a state , typically in a rural area with few neighbors .
It 's a prudent environmental strategy and it provides jobs for rural communities , which is why some of them have been competing to attract new landfills .
But the availability of landfill space in the countryside has created an awkward situation for cities committed to more expensive alternatives like recycling programs and incinerators .
Environmentalists have responded with a mythical imperative ....
We must achieve garbage independence .
When Dittersdorf told the children that New York City was running out of landfill space , she was technically right .
Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki have promised Staten Island that its municipal landfill will close in five years , and there 's no logical place in town to put a new one .
But why should the city have to use a local landfill ?
Why assume that New Yorkers have a moral obligation to dispose of their garbage near home ?
Most of the stuff was shipped to the city from factories and farms elsewhere .
What 's wrong with shipping it back out to be buried in places with open land ?
" I do n't understand why anyone thinks New York City has a garbage crisis because it can't handle all its own waste , " says James DeLong , an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington .
" With that kind of logic , you 'd have to conclude that New York City has a food crisis because it can't grow all the vegetables its people need within the city limits , so it should turn Central Park into a farm and ration New Yorkers ' consumption of vegetables to what they can grow there . "
Some politicians in other states have threatened to stop the importing of New York 's garbage - it 's an easy way to appeal to some voters ' chauvinism - but in the unlikely event that they succeeded , they would only be depriving their own constituents of jobs and tax revenue .
We 're cursing future generations with our waste .
Dittersdorf's slide showing New Yorkers ' annual garbage output - 15 square blocks , 20 stories high - looked frightening because the trash was sitting , uncompressed , in the middle of the city .
But consider a different perspective - a national , long - term perspective .
A. Clark Wiseman , an economist at Gonzaga University in Spokane , Wash. , has calculated that if Americans keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 years , and if all their garbage is put in a landfill 100 yards deep , by the year 3000 this national garbage heap will fill a square piece of land 35 miles on each side .
This does n't seem a huge imposition in a country the size of America .
The garbage would occupy only 5 percent of the area needed for the national array of solar panels proposed by environmentalists .
The millennial landfill would fit on one - tenth of 1 percent of the range land now available for grazing in the continental United States .
And if it still pains you to think of depriving posterity of that 35 - mile square , remember that the loss will be only temporary .
Eventually , like previous landfills , the mounds of trash will be covered with grass and become a minuscule addition to the nation 's 150,000 square miles of parkland .
We 're squandering irreplaceable natural resources .
Yes , a lot of trees have been cut down to make today 's newspaper .
But even more trees will probably be planted in their place .
America 's supply of timber has been increasing for decades , and the nation 's forests have three times more wood today than in 1920 .
" We 're not running out of wood , so why do we worry so much about recycling paper ? " asks Jerry Taylor , the director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute .
" Paper is an agricultural product , made from trees grown specifically for paper production .
Acting to conserve trees by recycling paper is like acting to conserve cornstalks by cutting back on corn consumption . "
Some resources , of course , do n't grow back , and it may seem prudent to worry about depleting the earth 's finite stores of metals and fossil fuels .
It certainly seemed so during the oil shortages of the l970's , when the modern recycling philosophy developed .
But the oil scare was temporary , just like all previous scares about resource shortages .
The costs of natural resources , both renewable and nonrenewable , have been declining for thousands of years .
They 've become less scarce over time because humans have continually found new supplies or devised new technologies .
Fifty years ago , for instance , tin and copper were said to be in danger of depletion , and conservationists urged mandatory recycling and rationing of these vital metals so that future generations would n't be deprived of food containers and telephone wires .
But today tin and copper are cheaper than ever .
Most food containers do n't use any tin .
Phone calls travel through fiber - optic cables of glass , which is made from sand - and should the world ever run out of sand , we could dispense with wires together by using cellular phones .
The only resource that has been getting consistently more expensive is human time : the cost of labor has been rising for centuries .
An hour of labor today buys a larger quantity of energy or raw materials than ever before .
To economists , it 's wasteful to expend human labor to save raw materials that are cheap today and will probably be cheaper tomorrow .
Even the Worldwatch Institute , an environmental group that strongly favors recycling and has often issued warnings about the earth 's dwindling resources , has been persuaded that there are no foreseeable shortages of most minerals .
" In retrospect , " a Worldwatch report notes , " the question of scarcity may never have been the most important one . "
It is better to recycle than to throw away .
This is the most enduring myth , the one that remains popular even among those who do n't believe in the garbage crisis anymore .
By now , many experts and public officials acknowledge that America could simply bury its garbage , but they object to this option because it diverts trash from recycling programs .
Recycling , which was originally justified as the only solution to a desperate national problem , has become a goal in itself - a goal so important that we must preserve the original problem .
It 's as if the protagonist of " Pilgrim 's Progress , " upon being informed that he could drop his sinful burden right there on the road , insisted on clinging to it just so he could continue the pilgrimage to get rid of it .
Why is it better to recycle ?
The usual justifications are that it saves money and protects the environment .
These sound reasonable until you actually start handling garbage .
The 1992 Plan projected that the City would realize net savings from recycling .
The Department 's experience to date in implementing the recycling program diverges from the assumptions of the Plan. - 1996 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan of the New York City Department of Sanitation .
EVERY TIME A SANlTATlON DEPARTMENT CREW PICKS UP
A load of bottles and cans from the curb , New York City loses money .
The recycling program consumes resources .
It requires extra administrators and a continual public relations campaign explaining what to do with dozens of different products - recycle milk jugs but not milk cartons , index cards but not construction paper .
( Most New Yorkers still do n't know the rules . )
It requires enforcement agents to inspect garbage and issue tickets .
Most of all , it requires extra collection crews and trucks .
Collecting a ton of recyclable items is three times more expensive than collecting a ton of garbage because the crews pick up less material at each stop .
For every ton of glass , plastic and metal that the truck delivers to a private recycler , the city currently spends $ 200 more than it would spend to bury the material in a landfill .
City officials hoped to recover this extra cost by selling the material but the market price of a ton has never been anywhere near $ 200 .
In fact , it has rarely risen as high as zero .
Private recyclers usually demand a fee because their processing costs exceed the eventual sales price of the recycled materials .
So the city , having already lost $ 200 collecting the ton of material typically has to pay another $ 40 to get rid of it .
The recycling program has been costing $ 50 million to $ 100 million annually , and that 's just the money coming directly out of the municipal budget .
There 's also the labor involved .
the garbage - sorting that millions of New Yorkers do at home every week .
How much would the city have to spend if it could n't rely on forced labor ?
True , some people would probably be glad to do the work for free because they regard garbage sorting as a morally uplifting activity for the whole family .
But many others have refused to follow the law .
They seem to have a more traditional view of garbage sorting : an activity done only for money , and then only by the most destitute members society .
I tried to estimate the value of New Yorkers ' garbage sorting by financing an experiment by a neutral observer ( a Columbia University student with no strong feelings about recycling ) .
He kept a record of the work he did during one week complying with New York 's recycling laws .
It took him eight minutes during the week to sort , rinse and deliver four pounds of cans and bottles to the basement of his building .
If the city paid for that work a typical janitorial wage ( $ 12 per hour ) , it would pay $ 792 in home labor costs for each ton of cans and bottles collected And what about the extra space occupied by that recycling receptacle in the kitchen ?
It must take up at least a square foot , which in New York costs at least $ 4 a week to rent .
If the city had to pay for this space , the cost per ton of recyclable would be about $ 2,000 .
That figure plus the home labor costs , added to what the city already spends on its collection program , totals more than $ 3,000 for a ton of scrap metal , glass and plastic .
For that price , you could find a one - ton collection of those materials at a used - car lot -a Toyota Tercel for instance - and drive home in it .
LAST YEAR , A SURGE in the market price for recycled materials prompted a spate of recycling - has - finally - arrived articles .
At one point , New York was selling its old newspapers for $ 150 per ton , which was almost enough to offset the extra costs of the paper recycling program .
But newsprint prices have since plummeted back to familiar levels ; New York is once again paying recyclers to take its newspapers , and city officials are resigned to losing money on recycling .
As a result of a lawsuit by City Council members and the Natural Resources Defense Council , the city has been under court order to collect increasing amounts of recyclable material to meet goals set in law .
City officials have promised to comply by expanding the recycling program and promoting a separate program in the public schools , but they 've been stalling because they do n't want to increase the budget deficit .
Officials in some cities claim that curbside recycling programs are cheaper than burying the garbage in a landfill , which can be true in places where the landfill fees are high and the collection costs are n't as exorbitant as in New York .
But officials who claim that recycling programs save money often do n't fully account for the costs .
" A lot of programs , especially in the early years , have used funny money economics to justify recycling , " says Chaz Miller , a contributing editor for Recycling Times , a trade newspaper .
" There 's been a messianic zeal that 's hurt the cause .
The American public loves recycling , but we have to do it efficiently .
It should be a business , not a religion . "
Recycling programs did n't fare well in a Federally financed study conducted by the Solid Waste Association of North America , a trade association for municipal waste - management officials .
The study painstakingly analyzed costs in six communities ( Minneapolis ; Palm Beach Fla . ; Seattle ; Scottsdale , Ariz ; Sevierville , Tenn. , and Springfield , Mass . ) .
It found that all but one of the curbside recycling programs , and all the composting operations and waste - to - energy incinerators , increased the cost of waste disposal .
( The exception was Seattle 's curbside program , which was slightly cheaper - by one tenth of 1 percent - than putting the garbage in a landfill . )
Studies in European cities have reached similar conclusions .
Recycling has been notoriously unprofitable in Germany , whose national program is even less efficient than New York's .
" We have to recognize that recycling costs money , " says William Franklin , an engineer who has conducted a national study of recycling costs for the not - for - profit group Keep America Beautiful
He estimates that , at today 's prices , a curbside recycling program typically adds 15 percent to the costs of waste disposal - and more if communities get too ambitious .
Franklin and other researchers have concluded that recycling does at least save energy - the extra fuel burned while picking up recyclables is more than offset by the energy savings from manufacturing less virgin paper , glass and metal .
" The net result of recycling is lower energy consumption and lower releases of air and water pollutants , " says Richard Denison , a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund , which has calculated the ecological benefits of recycling .
But there are much more direct - and cheaper - ways to reduce pollution .
Recycling is a messy way to try to help the environment .
Consider a few questions whose answers would seem obvious to the environmentally aware : Does a S - cent deposit on a soft - drink can help the environment ?
Mandatory deposits encourage recycling and reduce litter , but these programs typically spend $ 500 for every ton of cans and bottles collected , which makes curbside recycling look like a bargain .
States without mandatory deposits - like Texas and Washington - have proven that the most efficient way to reduce litter is to hire clean - up crews , which pick up a lot more than just bottles and cans .
Recycling takes money that could be used for other clean - up efforts : when New York 's Sanitation Department started its recycling program , it cut back on street cleaning .
Are reusable cups and plates better than disposables ?
A ceramic mug may seem a more virtuous choice than a cup made of polystyrene , the foam banned by ecologically conscious local governments .
But it takes much more energy to manufacture the mug , and then each washing consumes more energy ( not to mention water ) .
According to calculations by Martin Hocking , a chemist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia , you would have to use the mug 1,000 times before its energy - consumption per-use is equal to the cup .
( If the mug breaks after your 900th coffee , you would have been better off using 900 polystyrene cups . )
A more immediate environmental impact has been demonstrated by studies in restaurants : the average number of bacterial organisms on reusable cups , plates and flatware is 20 times greater than on disposable ones .
Should you recycle today 's newspaper ?
Saving a tree is a mixed blessing .
When there 's less demand for virgin wood pulp , timber companies are likely to sell some of their tree farms - maybe to condominium developers .
Less virgin pulp means less pollution at paper mills in timber country , but recycling operations create pollution in areas where more people are affected : fumes and noise from collection trucks , solid waste and sludge from the mills that remove ink and turn the paper into pulp .
Recycling newsprint actually creates more water pollution than making new paper : for each ton of recycled newsprint that 's produced , an extra 5,000 gallons of waste water are discharged .
Cost - benefit analyses for individual products become s o confusing that even ardent environmentalists give up .
After years of studies and debates about the environmental merits of cloth versus disposable diapers , some environmental organizations finally decided they could n't decide ; parents were advised to choose whichever they wanted This sensible advice ought to be extended to other products .
It would not only make life simpler for everyone , but would probably benefit the environment .
When consumers follow their preferences , they are guided by the simplest , and often the best , measure of a product 's environmental impact : its price .
Polystyrene cups are cheap because they require so little energy and material to manufacture - without reading a chemist 's analysis , you could deduce from the cup's low price that it's an efficient use of natural resources .
Similarly , the prices paid for scrap materials are a measure of their environmental value as recyclables .
Scrap aluminum fetches a high price because recycling it consumes so much less energy than manufacturing new aluminum .
The low price paid for scrap tinted glass tells you that you wo n't be conserving valuable resources by recycling it .
While price is hardly a perfect measure of environmental impact , especially in countries where manufacturers are free to pollute , an American product 's price usually reflects the cost of complying with strict environmental regulations .
It 's generally a more reliable guide than intuitive moral judgments or abstract theories about what 's good for the planet .
A theorist could logically argue that you have an obligation to recycle not just the paper in this magazine but also the staples .
As a nonrenewable resource , is n't the steel theoretically even more precious than the paper ?
Should n't you take each staple to a scrap - metal dealer or , better yet , reuse it in your own stapler ?
But if you look at the low price of new staples - and the fact that scrap dealers are n't scurrying to buy used staples - you can see that it 's a waste of time to worry about posterity running out of staples .
Recycling devotees have too often ignored such signals , preferring programs based on rules instead of prices , and they 've hurt their own cause .
They 've missed the obvious solution to America 's garbage problems - a solution they should have recognized from one of their seminal ecological texts .
THE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNING of the modern environmental movement can be found in " The Tragedy of the Commons , " a 1968 essay by the ecologist Garrett Hardin .
It is a parable about a village 's public pasture , the commons , that is open free of charge to everyone 's cattle .
Because no villager has a personal incentive to restrict the size of his herd , the herds keep growing , and eventually their overgrazing destroys the commons .
The parable is a useful model for the many environmental problems in which the common good is damaged by individuals acting out of rational self - interest ( like overfishing of the oceans or pollution of the atmosphere ) .
It applies nicely to the garbage situation in the many communities where a free town dump has historically been treated as a commons .
There are two ways to avert the Tragedy of the Commons , as Hardin 's essay explains .
The first is to convert the commons to private property , dividing up the land so that every herdsman owns a piece of pasture and has a personal incentive not to destroy it .
The second is to make rules limiting the number of cattle on the commons .
This approach , government regulation , is the most obvious solution to some complex environmental problems , especially ones involving global commons like the oceans or the atmosphere .
But garbage is not one of these complex problems .
The Tragedy of the Dump is a simple problem better resolved with the first approach : private responsibility .
Your trash is already your private property .
You should be responsible for getting rid of it .
You should have to pay to get rid of it - and you should pay whatever price it takes to insure that your garbage does n't cause environmental problems for anyone else .
Paying for residential garbage collection sounds like a radical idea in New York and other cities where these costs are hidden in property taxes , but it 's already being done in thousands of communities , including cities like Minneapolis , San Francisco and Seattle .
It 's also standard practice for commercial establishments in New York and elsewhere .
Some cities charge according to volume - the number of bags or cans that you fill - and some have begun experimenting with charging by the pound .
Once people switch to this pay - as - you - throw system , they throw away less - typically at least 10 to 15 percent less .
Some shop differently , some take their names off junk - mail lists ; some recycle .
Instead of following ( or ignoring ) arcane rules and targets set by politicians , they 're personally motivated to figure out what 's worth paying to discard and what 's worth diverting to a recycling bin .
Those who want to recycle for spiritual reasons can do so ; others can recycle whatever makes economic sense to them .
If the pay - as - you - throw system became common everywhere , there would be no need for recycling laws and goals and moral exhortations .
" In a purely market - driven situation , people would still recycle according to what makes sense in their area , " says Lynn Scarlett , the vice president of research at the Reason Foundation , which has studied pay - as - you - throw systems .
" In most places it would pay to recycle aluminum cans , corrugated cardboard and office paper .
A lot of newspapers and some clear glass would be recycled .
But people would n't meet the high targets set by laws .
They would n't bother with some of the things being mandated today , like mixed paper and certain plastics . "
Environmentalists do n't necessarily oppose free - market reforms for garbage - they 've supported some pay - as - you - throw systems - but they spend much of their energy crusading for government recycling programs and regulations .
They have instinctively chosen Hardin 's second solution .
This is partly because of their ideology - many environmentalists trust government regulations more than market forces - but there 's also another reason .
The leaders of the recycling movement derive psychic and financial rewards from recycling .
Environmental groups raise money and attract new members through their campaigns to outlaw " waste " and prevent landfills from opening .
They get financing from public and private sources ( including the recycling industry ) to research and promote recycling .
By turning garbage into a political issue , environmentalists have created jobs for themselves as lawyers , lobbyists , researchers , educators and moral guardians .
Environmentalists may genuinely believe they 're helping the earth , but they have been hurting the common good while profiting personally , just like the village 's herdsmen .
This is the real Tragedy of the Dump : the waste of public funds on recycling programs , the needless public alarm about landfills .
Fortunately , though , not every community has been afflicted .
For those seeking the truth about garbage , there 's a mountain 300 miles south of New York that 's worth a pilgrimage .
THE MOST SENSIBLE COMMENT
I 've heard on the subject of garbage was uttered by Linny Miles as we were looking at a mountain of it near his farm .
Miles grows wheat and raises Thoroughbreds in Charles City County , Va , which has 6,000 residents and one stoplight .
Next to his farm , 20 miles southeast of Richmond , is a landfill that accepts 4,000 tons of trash a day , much of it from the New York area .
Private carters deliver trash from Manhattan restaurants ; sealed rail cars bring municipal waste from suburban New Jersey .
The trash is surprisingly hard to spot .
I got lost on the way to the landfill and drove around the perimeter of the wooded property without realizing there was garbage hidden back there .
I finally got a view of it from Miles 's house , which sits on a rise 200 yards from the edge of the landfill 's property .
He pointed to a brown ridge rising above the pine trees .
The ridge was maybe 75 yards high , and the lower slopes were already covered w ith grass .
Miles said he was occasionally bothered by odors and noise from the unloading operations , but overall he thought the landfill was good for the county .
When I asked if he objected to New Yorkers using Charles City as a dumping ground , Miles shook his head and explained his reasoning in one sentence : " They brought something to the party . "
Ten years ago , Charles City County had much in common with New York today .
It had no money to fix its decrepit schools .
Its economy was stagnant , its tax rate was among the state 's highest and it was being ordered to shut down its old dump .
Now , thanks to its new landfill , the county has lower taxes , better - paid teachers and splendid schools .
The landfill 's private operator , the Chambers Development Company , pays Charles City County fees totaling $ 3 million a year - as much as the county takes in from all its property taxes .
The landfill has created jobs , as have the new businesses that were attracted by the lower taxes and new schools .
The 80 - acre public - school campus has three buildings with central air conditioning and fiber - optic cabling .
The library has 10,000 books , laser disks and CD - ROM's ; every classroom in the elementary school has a telephone and a computer .
The new auditorium has been used by visiting orchestras and dance companies , which previously had no place to perform in the county .
If you are heavy with garbage and guilt , Charles City is the place to lay down your burden .
There you can see garbage the way Linny Miles regards it : not as a moral issue but as an economic commodity .
New Yorkers get rid of their garbage cheaply , Charles City 's children get new schools .
Why should New Yorkers spend extra money to recycle so they can avoid this mutually beneficial transaction ?
Why make harried parents feel guilty about takeout food ?
Why train children to be garbage sorters ?
Why force the Bridges school to spend money on a recycling program when it still does n't have a computer in the science classroom ?
Several weeks after Dittersdorf 's lecture there , I told her about Charles City 's schools and asked if recycling needed to be so important to New Yorkers ' education .
" I wish we spent more money on other things in the schools here , " Dittersdorf said , " and I do n't think recycling has a higher priority than things like computers or art classes .
But I 'd put it equal .
Sure , kids should have time for other things , for reading and writing and dreaming .
But recycling can be a wonderful project for kids and parents to do together .
It inspires creative work and teaches valuable lessons . "
Maybe she 's right .
Maybe parents and children correctly see the intangible value of recycling lessons .
But as children pursue their moral education , as they learn to ponder the fate of the earth , it would n't hurt for them to also study , once again , that recycling scene in " Pilgrim 's Progress . "
If Bunyan were an administrator in today 's schools , he might call it a lesson in prioritizing .
The thrifty muckraker , intent on his compost pile , does n't notice a figure hovering overhead , offering to trade him a golden celestial crown for his rake .
This scene is observed by the pilgrim , who consults a helpful guide named the Interpreter .
" This is a figure of a man of this world , is it not , good sir ? " the pilgrim asks .
" Thou hast said the right , " the Interpreter replies , " and his muckrake doth show his carnal mind . "
The Interpreter points out the waste on the ground and sadly explains that , for the muckraker , " Things here are counted the only things substantial . "
The muckraker has forgotten that there is more to life than hoarding natural resources .
His recycling has become the most primitive form of materialism : the worship of materials .
" Earthly things , when they are with power upon men's minds , quite carry their hearts away from God , " the Interpreter says .
The pilgrim cries out in horror .
" O! deliver me from this muckrake . "
The creation and growth of communities requires a degree of cooperation among citizens .

What 's best for the individual and what 's best for society are often not the same thing -- this predicament is the premise for the famous " prisoner 's dilemma " game .
However , healthy societies depend on individuals cooperating for the common good , even at the risk of personal loss .
In theory , individuals should choose what 's in their own best self - interest , but the reality is that many people -- and even animals -- instead choose to cooperate , to the puzzlement of many professionals who study sociology , game theory and other disciplines .
Physicist Matjaž Perc of the University of Maribor in Slovenia has recently developed a model for the evolution of cooperation that provides a more realistic description for the altruistic behavior of individuals than previous explanations do .
In a recent issue of the New Journal of Physics , Perc explained how selfish individuals are more likely to cooperate in a prisoner 's dilemma game version which accounts for certain extrinsic factors .
For instance , individuals often change their connections , engage in long - distance interaction that bridges gaps , and sometimes experience lesser risk and greater benefit for cooperating than those of the average outcome .
" External influences are omnipresent in everyday life , " Perc explained to PhysOrg.com .
" So far , the framework of evolutionary game theory , in which the evolution of cooperation is often studied , has not yet been supplemented by external factors .
Thus , the payoffs of players ( for example , humans , animals , firms , etc. ) were considered as being fully deterministic ( known in advance ) .
In reality , however , unpredictable expenses , originating , for example , from accidents , fines , small violations of law we did n’t really intend to do can hardly be discarded as being irrelevant .
It is interesting to see that under such real - life motivated conditions , cooperation thrives best . "
The basic premise of the prisoner 's dilemma is that two suspects are placed in two different rooms , and each is asked separately whether or not his partner is guilty .
Prison sentences depend on how each suspect responds : if both remain true to each other , they each serve only six months .
If both betray each other , they both serve two years .
If one betrays and one stays silent , the silent / cooperative partner serves 10 years while his betrayer goes scot - free .
As one of the suspects , if you choose to betray , you will have better results , either serving two years or going free .
If you choose to cooperate , you 're in the cooler for either six months or 10 years .
With those odds , most people should betray , even though the best result for everyone would be full cooperation .
As others have done , Perc studied a version of the prisoner 's dilemma that includes many individuals and repeats the game numerous times , called an iterative prisoner 's dilemma .
In contrast with earlier models , however , he did not impose certain restrictions on the players , allowing them to commence or terminate connections , as often happens in real life .
Perc also recognized that although outcomes average out " fairly " ( e.g. the set prison sentences ) , sometimes individuals may reap better or worse results at any instance of the game , which he calls random payoff variation .
For example , the risk of cooperation is not always equivalent to 10 years behind bars — sometimes , it might be eight , or six , or four .
Also , sometimes the single betrayer does n't go free , but actually serves more than six months , meaning that two cooperators will benefit more individually as well as overall .
Depending on the scale of fluctuations of pre-determined “ average payoffs , ” it can be rarer for the risk of cooperation to increase , or for the benefits of mutual cooperation to decrease , Perc found .
So overall , a certain degree of payoff variations encourages cooperative strategies .
Perc determined critical values for the variable payoffs , as well as for changing and long - term connections , and found that accounting for these two factors — what he calls the " double resonance " phenomenon — results in greater cooperation between individuals .
In particular , cooperators survive by forming clusters so as to protect themselves against being exploited by defectors .
Cooperators located in the interior of such clusters enjoy the benefits of mutual cooperation and are therefore able to survive despite the constant exploitation by defectors along the cluster boundaries .
However , as the temptation to defect exceeds a threshold value , cooperators die out .
" In reality , humans often form alliances not just with their immediate neighbours , but also with others that are physically far away , " said Perc .
" On the other hand , however , the introduction of shortcuts hinders cluster formation and enables defectors to exploit clustered cooperators not just along the cluster boundaries but also from within .
Thus there exists an optimal fraction of shortcuts among players that still enables at least some long - range connections among distant cooperators , but at the same time does not hinder large cluster formation in the spatial domain .
In simpler terms , it is good if firms expand , and form alliances with foreign partners , but at the same time they must always maintain a healthy and solid core — a central facility , the Fort Knox , if you will — upon which everything is based and which holds everything together . "
Another real - life situation involving the benefits of cooperation is an arms race between two countries that spend billions of dollars on making weapons for fear that their enemy may be investing in the same defensive strategy .
Both lose , considering that the money could have been spent on more productive means .
According to Perc 's results , countries who can take the risk of forming and trusting allies will aid one another through cooperation .
They can more readily cooperate , according to the double resonance phenomenon , by beginning to cooperate during instances of decreased risk , as well as by taking advantage of currently existing long - distance bonds that provide a mechanism for cooperative alliances across the globe .

As a follow up to yesterday 's web - based desktop communication engine , I wanted to comment on a few ideas that we have been bouncing around .
Clearly the HTTP end - points on desktop applications would be useful to invoke an arbitrary set of methods on each application .
I envision a system in which we can remotely manipulate desktop applications through HTTP .
The same idea that I pitched a few years ago on top of CORBA .
The difference this time is that writing the client code is trivial , unlike the previous attempt where writing the client code to talk to a CORBA server was very difficult .
But in addition to this HTTP - based RPC interface , it would be nice to make the GNOME desktop Web - Aware .
Let me explain with a few use cases that we have been discussing at Novell :
Photo Sharing : A common household issue that I face is when I import pictures from a party into my F - Spot photo management program .
Here is where the problem arises : people want to look at the pictures right away , or they want copies of the pictures , or they want me to tag them or annotate them .
All of those at once .
I hear you say " Post them to Flickr " , well that would be fine except that the informed in the audience will demand a full resolution version .
They will hand you an email address and demand that a bunch of pictures be emailed .
Emailing is a drag , because more than a handful of high - resolution pictures is a drag as they typically bounce .
I could export to a folder and then scp the files over , but thats just because am a beautiful and unique snowflake .
Other non -hacker types might not be able to pull the scp trick .
A few people have suggested to use the photo sharing protocol that iPhoto has .
The problem is that a custom protocol for photo sharing requires photo - sharing - aware applications .
And these applications are not as ubiquitous as a web browser is .
The Solution : F - Spot coult have a " File / Web Share " which would basically run an HTTP server .
In the particular case of F - Spot it can just embed our embeddable web server and expose the pictures with an ASP.
NET application .
By doing this , my wife and friends can use their laptops to browse the pictures , email them , print them or send them around right there .
Music Playback : Today I use Banshee as my media player .
I have it available at home on my large music repository and on my laptop with a few songs that I carry with me .
Again , I would like to have a " File / Web Share " option that I could use at home to play music from any room in the house from a laptop .
Or when am traveling let others listen to interesting music from my laptop .
For this particular case , a general purpose web interface can be cooked , and the media playback could be a Flash - based MP3 player ( these are very easy to produce with FlashMX ) .
Web Serving
It is not necessary for the applications to embed a web server .
If embedding a web server is complicated they can just launch an external web server .
Mono based applications have a couple of choices : they can embed a raw HTTP server using HttpListener ( available in the 2.x profile on trunk ) or they can embed directly XSP which would let them host ASP .
NET pages with little or no work .
Multiplexor :
In both cases the HTTP - based multiplexing system that I described before can be used by remote users .
As far as they know the url will always be " http://machinename:123/application / frontend " or something like that .
The routing system will merely send an HTTP 303 redirect to the correct port .
The multiplexing system is not required , is merely cute .
Summary : a Web - ready GNOME desktop would have applications expose two HTTP - based interfaces : an HTML one for users and a raw HTTP interface for applications .
A web - aware desktop is not tremendously revolutionary , but it adds a little bit of convenience .
A set of HTTP - accessible interfaces will make our desktop more scriptable than it currently is .

TMZ has obtained a lawsuit filed by Reese Witherspoon claiming Star Magazine invaded her privacy by publishing a " fictional " story that the actress was pregnant .
In the lawsuit , filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court , the Academy Award - winning actress claims the magazine published a false story that she was pregnant " in a callous effort to boost the tabloid 's sagging sales . "
" Contrary to the fabricated Cover Story , " the lawsuit says , " the true facts are that [ Reese ] is not pregnant , does not have a ' baby bump ' and has not otherwise gained weight such that she has had to resort to wearing ' Empire - waist dresses , ' ' baggy clothing , ' or an 'old - fashioned 1920 's bathing suit . ' "
Reese also alleges in the suit that " this fabricated tall tale was brazenly published as a prominent and conspicuous cover story for the purpose of garnering the maximum attention to the tabloid ... "
The lawsuit claims the story was a violation of Reese 's privacy and portrays her in a false light .
It seeks unspecified damages .
Mike Kahane , General Counsel for American Media , told TMZ , " It is a frivolous lawsuit .
It has no legal merit and we intend to vigorously defend it and have every confidence that we will prevail . "
We asked Kahane if Star believes Witherspoon is pregnant .
He said , " The article asks the question as to whether or not she is pregnant based on her physical appearance and clothing that she was wearing and we believe we have every right to ask that question . "
The speed of learning will depend on the way you formulate the material .
The same material can be learned many times faster if well formulated !
The difference in speed can be stunning !
The rules are listed in the order of importance .
Those listed first are most often violated or bring most benefit if complied with !
There is an underlying assumption that you will proceed with learning using spaced repetition , i.e. you will not just learn once but you will repeat the material optimally ( as in SuperMemo ) .
The 20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning
The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is
Do not neglect the basics .
Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time !
Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little .
Better err on the safe side .
Remember that usually you spend 50 % of your time repeating just 3 - 5 % of the learned material [ source ]!
Basics are usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time .
However , each memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly !
The picture of the learned whole ( as discussed in Rule 2 : Learn before you memorize ) does not have to be complete to the last detail .
Just the opposite , the simpler the picture the better .
The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better .
Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass .
You can always build upon them later on .
Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts !
First read a chapter in your book that puts them together ( e.g. the principles of the internal combustion engine ) .
Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers ( e.g .
What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine ? ) , etc .
Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules , you need to build an overall picture of the learned knowledge .
Only when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure , will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time .
This is closely related to the problem comprehension mentioned in Rule 1 : Do not learn if you do not understand .
A single separated piece of your picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history .
The German history book example is an extreme .
However , the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of comprehension .
Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you believe " it will be useful some day " .
If you are not a speaker of German , it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German .
The book can be crammed word for word .
However , the time needed for such " blind learning " is astronomical .
Even more important :
The value of such knowledge is negligible .
If you cram a German book on history , you will still know nothing of history .
Trying to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost nonsense .
Still , an amazing proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension .
Very often they have no other choice !
The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable .
Here is a striking example :
A : Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan .
Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth 's surface , averaging 396 m below sea level .
It is 74 km long .
It is seven times as salty ( 30 % by volume ) as the ocean .
Its density keeps swimmers afloat .
Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters
You might want to experiment and try to learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is brought by minimum information principle .
This is particularly visible in the long perspective , i.e. the longer the time you need to remember knowledge , the more you benefit from simplifying your items !
Note in the example above how short the questions are .
Note also that the answers are even shorter !
We want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition !
We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible !
You will notice that the knowledge learned in the ill - structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well - structured formulation .
For example , although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat , you may forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place !
Additionally , rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information .
These can be remedied by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise .
You will also lose the ability to fluently recite the description of the Dead Sea when called up to the blackboard by your teachers .
I bet , however , that shining in front of the class is not your ultimate goal in learning .

Cloze deletion is easy and effective Cloze deletion is a sentence with its parts missing and replaced by three dots .
Cloze deletion exercise is an exercise that uses cloze deletion to ask the student to fill in the gaps marked with the three dots .
For example , Bill ...[ name ] was the second US president to go through impeachment .
If you are a beginner and if you find it difficult to stick to the minimum information principle , use cloze deletion !
If you are an advanced user , you will also like cloze deletion .
It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can be subject to learning based on spaced repetition .
Cloze deletion makes the core of the fast reading and learning technique called incremental reading .

Use imagery Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli are interpreted .
It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we say one picture is worth a thousand words .
Indeed if you look at the number of details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them , you will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power .
The same refers to memory .
A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile .
Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple question - and - answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image .
This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning material .
Well - employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy , geography , geometry , chemistry , history , and many more .
The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan 's mind maps is so popular .
A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts .

Use mnemonic techniques Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make remembering easier .
They are often amazingly effective .
For most students , a picture of a 10 - year - old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young genius .
It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose of training .
These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills !
Before you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting , be warned that the true bottleneck towards long - lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing knowledge !
This is indeed the easier part .
The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for months , years or for lifetime !
To accomplish the latter you will need SuperMemo and the compliance with the 20 rules presented herein .
There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic techniques .
Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected .
You can search the web for keywords such as : mind maps , peg lists , mnemonic techniques , etc .
Experience shows that with a dose of training you will need to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1 - 5 % of your items .
With time , using mnemonic techniques will become automatic !

Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion Graphic deletion works like cloze deletion but instead of a missing phrase it uses a missing image component .
For example , when learning anatomy , you might present a complex illustration .
Only a small part of it would be missing .
The student 's job is to name the missing area .
The same illustration can be used to formulate 10 - 20 items !
Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image .
Graphic deletion works great in learning geography !
Exemplary graphic deletion : SuperMemo 2000 / 2002 SuperMemo 99
This is how you can quickly generate graphic deletion using a picture from the clipboard : Press Shift +
Ins to paste the picture to SuperMemo Press Ctrl + Shift + M and choose Occlusion template to apply graphic deletion template SuperMemo 2000 only : Choose Ctrl + Shift +F2 to impose and detach the Occlusion template Fill out the fields and place the occlusion rectangle to cover the appropriate part of the picture ( use Alt + click twice to set the rectangle in the dragging mode )
In SuperMemo 99 you will need a few more steps : Create an item containing the following components : question text :
What is the name of the area covered with the red rectangle ?
empty answer text ( click Answer on the component menu )
on the component menu ) your illustration ( use Import file on the image component menu )
on the image component menu ) red rectangle component ( choose red color with Color on the rectangle component menu ) Choose Duplicate on the element menu ( e.g. by pressing Ctrl + Alt+U )
Ctrl+click the rectangle component twice to place it in the dragging mode Drag and size the red rectangle to cover the area in question Type in the answer in the answer field Press PgUp to go back to the original element created in Step 1 Go to Step 2 to add generate more graphic deletions
Note that you could also paint covering rectangles or circles on the original image but this would greatly increase the size of your collection .
The above method makes sure that you reuse the same image many times in all items of the same template .
For example , the collection Brain Anatomy available from >
SuperMemo Library and on SuperMemo MegaMix CD - ROM uses the above technique A more detailed recipe for creating occlusion tests is presented in : Flow of knowledge
Avoid sets A set is a collection of objects .
For example , a set of fruits might be an apple , a pear and a peach .
A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks for the list of the members of a set .
For example : What countries belong to the European Union ?
You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining memories based on sets .
If sets are absolutely necessary , you should always try to convert them into enumerations .
Enumerations are ordered lists of members ( for example , the alphabetical list of the members of the EU ) .
Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided .
However , the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order .
An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order .
Paradoxically , despite containing more information , enumerations are easier to remember .
The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the minimum information principle : you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition .
In the case of sets , listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory .
It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques , enumeration , grouping , etc .
Despite this claim , you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go around this problem .
Those techniques , however , will fail you all too often .
For that reason : Avoid sets !
If you need them badly , convert them into enumerations and use techniques for dealing with enumerations Ill - formulated knowledge - Sets are unacceptable !
Q : What countries belong to the European Union ( 2002 ) ?
A : Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , and the United Kingdom Well - formulated knowledge - Converting a set into a meaningful listing Q : Which country hosted a meeting to consider the creation of a European Community of Defence in 1951 ?
A : France Q : Which countries apart from France joined the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 ?
A : Germany , Italy and the Benelux Q : What countries make up the Benelux ?
A : Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands Q : Whose membership did Charles de Gaulle oppose in the 1960s ?
A : that of UK Q : Which countries joined the EEC along the UK in 1973 ?
A : Ireland and Denmark Q : Which country joined the EEC in 1981 ?
A : Greece Q : Which countries joined the EEC in 1986 ?
A : Spain and Portugal Q : Which countries joined the EU in 1995 ?
A : Austria , Sweden and Finland Q : What was the historic course of expansion of the European Union membership ?
A : (1 ) France and ( 2 ) Germany , Italy and the Benelux , ( 3 ) UK and ( 4 ) Ireland and Denmark , ( 5 ) Greece , ( 6 ) Spain and Portugal and ( 7 ) Austria , Sweden and Finland Note that in the example above , we converted a 15 - member set into 9 items , five of which are 2 - 3 member sets , and one is a six member enumeration .
Put it to your SuperMemo , and see how easy it is to generate the list of the European Union members using the historic timeline !
Note the tricks used with France and the UK .
They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to simplify the learning process .
Note also that the sum of information included in this well - formulated approach is far greater than that of the original set .
Thus along simplicity , we gained some useful knowledge .
All individual items effectively comply with the minimum information principle !
You could go further by trying to split the Germany - Italy - Benelux set or using mnemonic techniques to memorize the final seven - member enumeration ( i.e. the last of the questions above ) .
However , you should take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the proposed set in memory .
Avoid enumerations Enumerations are also an example of classic items that are hard to learn .
They are still far more acceptable than sets .
Avoid enumerations wherever you can .
If you cannot avoid them , deal with them using cloze deletions ( overlapping cloze deletions if possible ) .
Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion :
Hard to learn item Q :
What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet ?
A : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Easy to learn items Q :
What three letters does the alphabet begin with ?
A : ABC Q : Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet A ... ... ... E
A : B , C , D Q : Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet B ... ... ... F
A : C , D , E Q : Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet C ... ... ... G
A : D , E , F The above items will make learning the alphabet much faster .
The greatest advantage of the above approach is that is it easier for psychological reasons : the student does not have to stop repetitions to recite the whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material .
Still it is recommended that he recite the whole alphabet after making the repetition .
However , once all individual pieces are well remembered , reciting the whole should be a pleasant and speedy action that produces little frustration .
The cloze deletion used above is an overlapping cloze deletion , i.e. the same parts of the enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items ( for example , the sequence C - D will be needed to recall the second and the third item ) .
This redundancy does not contradict the minimum information principle because the extra information is added in extra items .
You can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets ( see the European Union example ) but cloze deletions should be simpler and should suffice in most cases .
Learning poems is an example of learning enumerations ( all words and sentences have to be uttered in a predefined sequence ) ; however , due to strong semantic connections , the rhyme and the rhythm , it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion and without the frustration of forgetting small subcomponents again and again .
However , once you notice you stumble with your poem , you should dismember it using cloze deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast , easy , effective and pleasurable A poem that is hard to remember Q :
The credit belongs ... ( Teddy Roosevelt ) A : The credit belongs to the man who 's actually in the arena , whose face is marred by dust and sweat ; a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions , who spends himself in a worthy cause , who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement , so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat A poem split into easy items Q :
The credit belongs ... ( Teddy Roosevelt )
A : to the man who 's actually in the arena Q :
The credit belongs to the man who 's actually in the arena ...
A : whose face is marred by dust and sweat ( a man who knows the great enthusiasm ) Q : whose face is marred by dust and sweat ... ( The credit belongs )
A : a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions ( who spends himself in a worthy cause ) Q : a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions ... ( The credit belongs )
A : who spends himself in a worthy cause ( who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement ) Q : who spends himself in a worthy cause ... ( The credit belongs )
A : who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement ( so that his place shall never be ) , etc. etc .
Does it all sound artificial ?
It does !
But you will never know how effective this approach is until you try it by yourself !
Combat interference
When you learn about similar things you often confuse them .
For example , you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words historic and historical .
This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of numbers , e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy .
If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item , we have a case of memory interference .
You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either !
For example , if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela , Suriname and Brazil is Guyana , you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with just a couple of repetitions .
However , once you add similar items asking about the location of all these countries , and French Guyana , and Colombia and more , you will suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting .
In simple terms : you will get confused about what is what .
Interference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo .
You can never be sure when it strikes , and the only hermetic procedure against it is to detect and eliminate .
In other words , in many cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge .
Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana , Guyard and Guyenne , as well as Guyana , kayman and ... aspirin .
It may work differently for you and for your colleague .
It very hard to predict .
Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it takes its toll .
This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable .
Here are some tips : make items as unambiguous as possible
stick to the minimum information principle ( many of the remaining rules in this text are based on avoiding interference ! )
eliminate interference as soon as you spot it , i.e. before it becomes your obsession ( e.g. as soon as you see the word inept you think " I know the meanings of inept and inapt but I will never know which is which ! " )
you think " I know the meanings of and but I will never know which is which ! " )

Optimize wording
The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up .
This will reduce error rates , increase specificity , reduce response time , and help your concentration .
Less optimum item : cloze deletion that is too wordy Q : Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker .
Aldus had little competition for years , and so failed to improve .
Then Denver - based ... blew past .
PageMaker , now owned by Adobe , remains No. 2
A : Quark Better item : fewer words will speed up learning Q : Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker but failed to improve .
Then ... blew past ( PageMaker remains No. 2 )
A : Quark Or better : Q : Aldus invented desktop publishing with PageMaker but failed to improve .
It was soon outdistanced by ...
A : Quark Or better : Q : PageMaker failed to improve and was outdistanced by ...
A : Quark Or better : Q : PageMaker lost ground to ...
A : Quark Note that the loss of information content in this item is inconsequential .
During repetition you are only supposed to learn the name : Quark .
You should not hope that the trailing messages on the ownership of PageMaker and the year of its development will somehow trickle to your memory as a side effect .
You should decide if the other pieces of information are important to you and if so , store them in separate items ( perhaps reusing the above text , employing cloze deletion again and optimizing the wording in a new way ) .
Otherwise the redundant information will only slow down your learning process !
Refer to other memories Referring to other memories can place your item in a better context , simplify wording , and reduce interference .
In the example below , using the words humble and supplicant helps the student focus on the word shamelessly and thus strengthen the correct semantics .
Better focus helps eliminating interference .
Secondly , the use of the words humble and supplicant makes it possible to avoid interference of cringing with these words themselves .
Finally , the proposed wording is shorter and more specific .
Naturally , the rules basics - to - details and do not learn what you do not understand require that the words humble and supplicant be learned beforehand ( or at least at the same time )
Item subject to strong interference Q : derog : adj : shamelessly conscious of one 's failings and asking in a begging way
A : cringing Item that uses interfering memories to amplify the correct meaning Q : derog : adj : shamelessly humble and supplicant
A : cringing
Personalize and provide examples
One of the most effective ways of enhancing memories is to provide them with a link to your personal life .
In the example below you will save time if you use a personal reference rather than trying to paint a picture that would aptly illustrate the question Harder item Q :
What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back ?
A : divan Easier item Q : What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back ?
( like the one at Robert 's parents )
A : divan
If you remember exactly what kind of soft bed can be found in Robert 's parents ' apartment you will save time by not having to dig exactly into the semantics of the definition and / or looking for an appropriate graphic illustration for the piece of furniture in question .
Personalized examples are very resistant to interference and can greatly reduce your learning time
Rely on emotional states
If you can illustrate your items with examples that are vivid or even shocking , you are likely to enhance retrieval ( as long as you do not overuse same tools and fall victim of interference ! ) .
Your items may assume bizarre form ; however , as long as they are produced for your private consumption , the end justifies the means .
Use objects that evoke very specific and strong emotions : love , sex , war , your late relative , object of your infatuation , Linda Tripp , Nelson Mandela , etc .
It is well known that emotional states can facilitate recall ; however , you should make sure that you are not deprived of the said emotional clues at the moment when you need to retrieve a given memory in a real - life situation Harder item Q : a light and joking conversation
A : banter Easier item Q : a light and joking conversation ( e.g. Mandela and de Klerk in 1992 )
A : banter If you have vivid and positive memories related to the meetings between Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk , you are likely to quickly grasp the meaning of the definition of banter .
Without the example you might struggle with interference from words such as badinage or even chat .
There is no risk of irrelevant emotional state in this example as the state helps to define the semantics of the learned concept !
A well - thought example can often reduce your learning time several times !
I have recorded examples in which an item without an example was forgotten 20 times within one year , while the same item with a subtle interference - busting example was not forgotten even once in ten repetitions spread over five years .
This is roughly equivalent to 25 - fold saving in time in the period of 20 years !
Such examples are not rare !
They are most effectively handled with the all the preceding rules targeted on simplicity and against the interference
Context cues simplify wording
You can use categories in SuperMemo 2000 / 2002 , provide different branches of knowledge with a different look ( different template ) , use reference labels ( Title , Author , Date , etc. ) and clearly label subcategories ( e.g. with strings such as chem for chemistry , math for mathematics , etc. ) .
This will help you simplify the wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need to specify the context of your question .
In the example below , the well - defined prefix bioch : saves you a lot of typing and a lot of reading while still making sure you do not confuse the abbreviation GRE with Graduate Record Examination .
Note that in the recommended case , you process the item starting from the label bioch which puts your brain immediately in the right context .
While processing the lesser optimum case , you will waste precious milliseconds on flashing the standard meaning of GRE and ... what is worse ... you will light up the wrong areas of your brain that will now perhaps be prone to interference !
Wordy item can cause accidental lapses through interference Q :
What does GRE stand for in biochemistry ?
A : glucocorticoid response element Context - labeled items increase success rate Q : bioch : GRE
A : glucocorticoid response element
Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle Redundancy in simple terms is more information than needed or duplicate information , etc .
Redundancy does not have to contradict the minimum information principle and may even be welcome .
The problem of redundancy is too wide for this short text .
Here are some examples that are only to illustrate that minimum information principle cannot be understood as minimum number of characters or bits in your collections or even items : passive and active approach : if you learn a foreign language , e.g. Esperanto , you will often build word pairs such as phone - telefono , language - lingvo , hope - esperanto , etc .
These pairs require active recall of the foreign word .
Active recall does not , however , guarantee passive recognition and you may fail with telefono - phone , lingvo - language , or esperanto - hope .
Adding new elements with swapped questions and answers may in some cases be redundant but it does not contradict the minimum information principle !
Your items are still as simple as possible .
You just get more of them Duplicate ( Ctrl+ Alt+D ) and Swap ( Ctrl + Shift +S )
In SuperMemo 2000 / 2002 , you can quickly generate swapped word - pair items with ( Ctrl + Alt+D ) and ( Ctrl + Shift+S )
: if you learn a foreign language , e.g. Esperanto , you will often build word pairs such as phone - telefono , language - lingvo , hope - esperanto , etc .
These pairs require active recall of the foreign word .
Active recall does not , however , guarantee passive recognition and you may fail with telefono - phone , lingvo - language , or esperanto - hope .
Adding new elements with swapped questions and answers may in some cases be redundant but it does not contradict the minimum information principle !
Your items are still as simple as possible .
You just get more of them reasoning cues : you will often want to boost your reasoning ability by asking about a solution to the problem .
Instead of just memorizing the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps ( e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation ) and generate the answer .
In such a case , providing the hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions

For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read : Roots of genius and creativity , as well as more specific : Derivation , reasoning and intelligence multiple semantic representation : very often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles .
Memorizing different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value .
This will increase the expected recall rate ( beyond that specified with the forgetting index ) !
: very often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles .

This will increase the expected recall rate ( beyond that specified with the forgetting index ) !
flexible repetition : if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices .
For example , if you learn a language , it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept .
It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer ( e.g. a mark made by ink spilt on sth = blot / blob / blotch )
: if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices .
For example , if you learn a language , it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept .
It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer ( e.g. a mark made by ink spilt on sth = blot / blob / blotch ) more
Provide sources Except for well - tested and proven knowledge ( such as 2+2=4 ) , it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge .
In real - life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge .
Sources can come to your rescue .
You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source .
You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources .
Without SuperMemo , those discrepancies are often difficult to notice : before you encounter the new fact , the old one is often long forgotten .
With sources provided , you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable .
Adding reliability labels may also be helpful ( e.g . Watch out ! , Other sources differ ! , etc. ) .
Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge ( unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked ) .
Provide Knowledge can be relatively stable ( basic math , anatomy , taxonomy , physical geography , etc. ) and highly volatile ( economic indicators , high - tech knowledge , personal statistics , etc. ) .
It is important that you provide your items with time stamping or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence .
In case of statistical figures , you might stamp them with the year they have been collected .
When learning software applications , it is enough you stamp the item with the software version .
Once you have newer figures you can update your items .
Unfortunately , in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated .
Date stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge ; however , you will rarely want to memorize stamping itself .
If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time ( e.g. GNP figures over a number of years ) , the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself .
Prioritize
You will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to master .
That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long - term .
The way you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in .
This will also affect the speed of learning ( e.g. see : learn basics first ) .
There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place ; only few are relevant to knowledge representation , but all are important : Prioritizing sources - there will always be a number of sources of your knowledge .
If you are still at student years : these will most likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects .
Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals , Internet , TV , newspapers , encyclopedias , dictionaries , etc .
It is always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied sources .
As you progress with learning , you will quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others Extracting knowledge - unless you are about to pass an important exam , it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles .
You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge .
You can do it by ( 1 ) marking paragraphs in a book or journal , ( 2 ) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo , ( 3 ) pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo , ( 4 ) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo notes , etc .
You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master .
Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to use incremental reading tools Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo - you may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo .
However , you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material .
Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items .
If formulation requires more knowledge , more time , comparing with other sources , etc. you can just import .
Otherwise , if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds , formulate it Formulating items - make sure that explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the most important part of the item .
The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context Using forgetting index - you can use the forgetting index to prioritize pending items .
The sequence of repetitions will naturally be determined by SuperMemo ; however , you can request higher retention level for items that are more important and lower retention level for items of lower priority Learning - the process of prioritizing does not end with the onset of repetitions .
Here are the tools you can use to continue setting your priorities while the learning process is under way : Remember ( Ctrl+ M ) - re-memorize items of high priority that have changed or which are extremely important to your knowledge at a given moment .
If you choose Ctrl + M you will be able to determine the next interval for the currently reviewed item ( its repetition counter will be reset to zero ) .
It is recommended that you always re-memorize items whose content has changed significantly Reschedule ( Ctrl+J ) - manually schedule the date of the next repetition Execute repetition ( Ctrl + Shift + R ) - manually execute a repetition even before the repetition 's due date ( e.g. when reviewing particularly important material ) Forget ( Ctrl+R ) - remove the current item from the learning process and place it at the end of the pending queue Dismiss ( Ctrl+D ) - ignore the current item in the learning process altogether Delete ( Ctrl + Shift + Del ) - remove the current item from your collection Change the forgetting index of memorized items or change the ordinal of pending items ( Ctrl + Shift + P )
Summary
Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge .
You will notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple !
Some of the rules strongly overlap .
For example : do not learn if you do not understand is a form of applying the minimum information principle which again is a way of making things simple :

Ten things I hate about local TV news : 1. ) “ Coming up next …. ” – a catchy headline that can easily suck you in to watching 30 minutes of bad reporting .
This headline is announced just before every commercial break yet they do n’t get to the story until the last few minutes .
And when they do the story is so stupid you end up cursing at yourself – I missed a rerun of Seinfeld for this !
I have to admit I still fall for this one occasionally .
2. )
“ The vague Michigan connection ” - a lame attempt to connect us with every major catastrophe or event worldwide .
Example :
The roof collapses at a Costco in Rhode Island .
What is the Michigan connection …… some frumpy suburban housewife with a heavy Michigan accent and a perm has a sister who was shopping at that very Costco the day before .
The reporter listens intently and nods as the lady describes her sister ’s near brush with death .3. )
" The dumb - ass witness " - Possibly the most entertaining part of local news .
They find some yocal who may or may not have seen the incident , but you get his incomprehensible story anyway .
“ he drove up dare see den turned around and came back to where I was standin ’ at …. then started firin at the man , bam - bam bam see ” .
The best ones are from places like Melvindale or Taylor .
Oh and do n’t forget the brother who ends every sentence with “ know what I ’m sayin ’ ” , know what I ’m sayin ’ .4. )
" Live on location " - This is where they unnecessarily send a cameraman and a reporter to broadcast live on location .
This is most ridiculous during the 11 o’clock news .
Usually it ’s a reporter standing in an empty parking lot in front of a sign .
Example , earlier in the day Ford announces the layoff of 500 salaried workers .
Where do they report this from , the empty parking lot in front of Ford headquarters at 11:10 PM while it is raining .
Without that shot of the big blue oval I do n’t think I would believe it .
But man , they ’re out there getting the story for us .
5 . )
" Weather sensationalizing " – 15 degrees is n’t cold enough for these idiots .
They have to calculate the “ real feel ” “ today ’s high will only be 15 degrees but it will actually feel like minus 52 ” Their real feel is going to be lower than the other stations guaranteed , no one else has the Weatherforce Calculator II .
Same with snow accumulation .
A few days before a snow storm the hype starts .
At first it is 1 to 3 inches .
The day before it changes to 4 to 6 and not to be outdone by other stations “ we could be looking at 6 to 8 inches of snow ” .
This becomes THE story of the night , interviews with plow truck drivers , the State Police , ect .
How will you survive Mother Nature ’s fury ?
You usually wake up the next morning and guess what , an inch and a half of snow on your car , turn on the wipers and drive away .
These idiots do n’t get it .
This is Detroit , it snows here in the winter .
This kind of sensationalizing can lead to …… … 6 . )
" The expert advice " - This can be tied in to a huge story like 1 to 3 inches of snow .
They find some “ expert ” , a doctor , a coast guard officer or someone else with a title and have them give their advice on things like , how to avoid frostbite or how to keep warm .
Remember exposed skin in freezing temperatures can lead to frostbite so wear gloves and a hat .
The best ones are for weight loss .
To lose weight , reduce calorie intake and exercise regularly .
Fast food can be unhealthy so try to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables .
Groundbreaking !7. )
File footage .
Film footage to go along with their lame stories .
This footage is rarely up to date and most of the time was filmed somewhere else for some other purpose .
If you watch closely sometimes you can see things like a Pearl Jam concert shirt or acid washed jeans .
The best ones are the ones for obesity .
They always show fat people shot from the neck down holding things like ice cream cones or Doritos bags .
8. )
The stupid poll - This is just plain filler .
They come up with some poll or have some useless statistics like : 92 % of 8th graders would rather play video games than do their homework or 77.3 % of the U.S. workforce hates their job .
Who fucking cares !
This is always used with file footage .
8A . ) " The recent study " -
This is a variation of the poll or useless statistics but with the appearance of a little more credibility because it comes from “ researchers in Belgium ” or “ a study by Southwest Delaware State University ” .
You can almost always file this under “ well no shit ” .
These profound discoveries may include : Drinking while using power tools increases your risk of an accident by up to 60 % or studies have shown that children who consume soft drinks with caffeine were less likely to have a restful nights sleep .
The recent study is always accompanied by file footage .9 . )
" The idiot behind the reporter making faces " - Enough said10 . ) " The cant go up north this 4th of July because of gas prices " -
This one always gets me .
Every summer – surprise ! , the price of gas goes up right before the holiday weekend .
What does the news do ?
They go to a gas station and interview some loser through the window of his $ 35,000 F250 .

Kampfsport - Superstar Conor McGregor steht vor einer spektakulären Rückkehr in den Box - Ring - mit dem Hauptarbeitgeber ist derweil ein heftiger öffentlicher Streit ausgebrochen .
Parallel zu der Ankündigung des Kampfs mit Floyd Mayweathers altem Rivalen Manny Pacquiao hat der Ire eine Reihe private Chatverläufe veröffentlicht , in denen er sich mit UFC - Boss Dana White ausgetauscht hatte .
Es geht um Instagram - Nachrichten , in denen die beiden über McGregors nächsten Kampf verhandelten .
McGregor wollte damit belegen , dass White Gespräche falsch dargestellt hätte .
White reagierte - wenig überraschend - sehr verärgert .
Conor McGregor zu Dana
White : " Hör auf zu lügen ! " " Jeder weiß , dass es der Männer - Ehre widerspricht , auch die Ladys .
So etwas tut man nicht " , sagte White auf der Pressekonferenz nach der Kampfshow UFC 253 am Wochenende in Abu Dhabi .
Warum auch immer
White davon ausgeht , dass für Frauen weniger verständlich sein könnte , dass die Veröffentlichung privater Nachrichten ein unfreundlicher Akt ist : McGregor reagierte unbeeindruckt .
" Die Ehre wurde gebrochen , als du gelogen und behauptet hast , dass ich Kämpfe abgelehnt hätte , Kumpel " , twitterte McGregor .
Zudem widersprach er Whites Behauptung , über den Pacquiao - Kampf nicht im Bilde zu sein : " Die anwaltlichen Briefe liegen hier .
Hör auf zu lügen ! "
McGregor legte Plan für Rückmatch gegen Khabib vorDer Hintergrund des Streits : Nach seinem jüngsten Octagon - Comeback mit einem Sieg über " Cowboy " Donald Cerrone bei UFC 243 im Januar konnte der " Notorious One " sich mit White auf keinen weiteren Fight einigen .
Im Juni verkündete McGregor darauf trotz eines laufenden Vertrags - zum wiederholten Mal - seinen Rücktritt aus dem MMA - Gewerbe an.DAZN gratis testen und UFC und andere Kampfsport - Highlights live & auf Abruf erleben| ANZEIGEMcGregor und White gaben sich an dem Zerwürfnis gegenseitig die Schuld .
Nun offenbaren die geleakten Chats den Lauf der Dinge .
Im Februar - bevor die Corona - Pandemie zuschlug - unterbreitete McGregor White den Vorschlag : " Ein Kampf in L.A. Ende Mai .
Ich und Diego in Dublin im August .
Rückkampf des Jahres Ende des Jahres . Boom . " Mit Diego ist der Liga - Veteran Diego Sanchez gemeint , der " Rückkampf des Jahres " sollte die Neuauflage des von McGregor verlorenen Skandal - Fights gegen Leichtgewichts - Champion Khabib Nurmagomedov sein .
Justin Gaethje bekommt bei UFC 254 seine ChanceWhite schlug zunächst den Kampf gegen Sanchez in den Wind ( " Bro. Wenn wir den Kampf machen , sollte man uns die Promoter - Lizenz aberkennen " ) , dann teilte er McGregor mit , dass er ihm frühestens am 11 .
Juli einen
Fight anbieten könnte - ein Kampf im Mai wäre nicht lohnenswert , weil da nur Kampfabende in " kleinen Märkten " gebucht seien .
Auf die Aufforderung , umzuplanen und im Mai einen Event in Los Angeles oder einer anderen Metropole anzusetzen - unter anderem brachte er noch Justin Gaethje als möglichen Gegner ins Spiel - , ging
White nicht ein , der Chat endete ergebnislos .
Gaethje wird nun anstelle von McGregor der nächste Khabib - Gegner sein , die beiden werden bei UFC 254 am 25 .
Oktober auf " Fight Island " in Abu Dhabi aufeinandertreffen .
Er verdiente sich die Gelegenheit durch einen Sieg über Tony Ferguson bei UFC 249 im Mai in Brooklyn .
Damals sollte Ferguson eigentlich Khabib herausfordern , der aber sagte wegen der Corona - Lage ab , die UFC änderte die Planungen .
White warf McGregor später vor , dass auch McGregor hätte einspringen können , sich aber geweigert hätte , weil er " kein Ersatzkämpfer " sei .
Corona verkompliziert die LageMcGregor und sein
Boss liegen nicht zum ersten Mal über Kreuz , immer wieder gab es Krach wegen Uneinigkeiten über Kampfansetzungen und vor allem wegen des Geldes .
Der Dauerkonflikt wurde durch die Corona - Krise weiter verkompliziert .
Die allgemeine Deutung ist , dass
White kein Interesse hat , McGregor zurückzubringen , ehe er wieder große Arenas füllen kann und damit auch die Vor -Ort - Einnahmen abstauben kann .
Darauf bezieht sich auch McGregor in einem weiteren
Tweet , in dem er erklärt : " Als Covid kam und die Rede davon war , dass ich auf die Rückkehr des Publikums warten sollte , habe ich die Situation hinter mir gelassen .
" McGregors Rücktritt wurde allerdings kaum ernst genommen , zumal er sich auch nicht aus dem verpflichtenden Anti-Doping - Programm der Liga zurückzog - ein Schritt , der sein Comeback verzögern würde , weil er dann erst in den Testpool der Anti-Doping - Agentur USADA zurückkehren müsste und Zeit verlieren würde .
Inzwischen hat das McGregor - Lager auch deutlich gemacht , dass es nach dem Kampf gegen Pacquiao zurück zur UFC gehen soll .
Weitere Streitigkeiten sind vorprogrammiert - aber trotz allem wohl kein endgültiger Bruch : Zugpferd McGregor ist für die UFC schlicht zu wertvoll .
Leaders visit ; front - line troops say , ' Yeah , so ? '
By Arwa Damon

On the Scene Iraq Baghdad or or Create Your Own BALAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made their surprise visits to Baghdad on Wednesday , many of the troops stationed north of Baghdad , in Balad and Dujail , say either they did n't know about it or did n't care .
" I 'd ask him for a plane ticket home to see my wife .
I have barely seen her in the last two years , " said a young sergeant , who did not want to be identified .
Like many of the soldiers with the 4th Infantry Division , he is on his second deployment to Iraq .
Some joked that whenever VIP 's come to visit they just go to the main bases and meet the " fobbits , " the nickname given to troops who do not go outside the barbed wire .
" They have to get out to see the people that are doing the jobs they are making them do .
If they did n't they would not be very good leaders , " said Maj .
Michael Humphreys , one of the few soldiers here willing to tell journalists some of his opinions on senior leadership .
At the time he was asked , he did n't know Rumsfeld and Rice were visiting .
He was too preoccupied with his mission -- trying to set up a local paper for the Tribal Council in Dujail .
Rumsfeld and Rice were visiting to show support for Iraq 's movement toward a new government .
And for many of the troops with the 3rd Battalion , 29th Field Artillery Regiment and 4th Infantry Division stationed in Balad and Dujail , they might just as well not have visited at all .
As we discussed the visit , a tip came through -- a suspected leader of a cell dedicated to making " IED's , " or improvised explosive devices -- military - speak for homemade bombs -- would be at a certain location at 1400 hours .
The chase was on .
Bumping along the dusty back roads to avoid insurgents , a VIP visit was the furthest thing from these troops ' minds .
For them , the priority is the mission .
On this day they were following a lead , chasing a vehicle trying to escape as they approached the target house , and trying to find bits of intelligence from residents unwilling to talk .
A top priority is getting themselves and their fellow soldiers home alive , and we are told that priority does not change -- no matter who visits .

Protesters in Tehran burned Israeli flags
Attending an anti-Israel rally in Tehran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his remarks were " just " - and the criticism did not " have any validity " .
His initial comment provoked anger from many governments , and prompted Israel to demand Iran 's expulsion from the UN .
Egypt said they showed " the weakness of the Iranian government " .
A Palestinian official also rejected the remarks .
Defiant rally
Tens of thousands of Iranians took part in the rally in Tehran which Iran organises every year on the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan to show solidarity with the Palestinian struggle .
Shouting " Death to Israel , death to the Zionists " , the protesters dragged Israeli flags along the ground and then set them on fire .
Palestinians recognise the right of the state of Israel to exist and I reject his comments
Saeb Erekat
Chief Palestinian negotiator
Iran comments :
Your views
Many carried posters and placards sporting the slogan " Israel should be wiped off the map " .
Joining the protest , Mr Ahmadinejad said : " My words were the Iranian nation 's words .
" Westerners are free to comment , but their reactions are invalid , " Mr Ahmadinejad told the official Irna news agency .
Some demonstrators wore white shrouds in a symbolic gesture expressing readiness to die for their cause .
" Ahmadinejad talks on behalf of all Iranians .
We are ready to die for Palestine , " Mohammad Mirzayi , a member of a volunteer Shia militia group , told the Reuters news agency .
' Inexperience '
While most Muslim and Arab capitals have remained silent on the president 's remarks , a few have spoken out - including Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat .
" Palestinians recognise the right of the state of Israel to exist and I reject his comments , " he told the BBC News website .
" What we need to be talking about is adding the state of Palestine to the map and not wiping Israel from the map , " he said .
Tehran says the West 's reaction is linked to its nuclear plans
Egypt , which has signed a peace treaty with Israel , also rejected the Iranian line .
" In principle , we are way beyond this type of political rhetoric that shows the weakness of the Iranian government , " said an official at the Egyptian embassy in London .
Turkey 's prime minister called on the Iranian president " to display political moderation " .
Our world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds says that the UK Foreign Office does not regard President Ahmadinejad 's statement on Israel as a new policy but more as a sign of his inexperience and the very local focus of his government .
UK officials suspect that he has held such views for years and that what is happening is that ideologues like him are now in power and are having their views exposed , he adds .
While there is no sense that Iran is backing down , there are Iranians who are concerned that their country could become increasingly isolated under this new ultra- conservative government , reports the BBC Frances Harrison in Tehran .
Diplomatic drive
Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom meanwhile said Israel would call for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council .
" We have decided to open a broad diplomatic offensive , " Mr Shalom said .
So far no action has been taken at the UN , but Secretary General Kofi Annan took the unusual step of rebuking Iran for the comments .
Iran has dismissed the international furore as a means of pressing Iran to compromise on its nuclear programme .
Negotiations have stalled between the EU and Iran over attempts to persuade Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions .

Mr Maduro says his detention was a breach of international law
The US state department has apologised to Nicolas Maduro who was detained for 90 minutes at New York 's JFK airport as he travelled home .
He had been attending this week 's UN General Assembly meeting .
He said he was verbally abused and strip - searched in what he said was a " flagrant breach of international law " .
President Hugo Chavez described Mr Maduro 's detention as a provocation .
Our correspondent Pascale Harter says the apology has done little to ease the tense relations between the two countries .
Mr Maduro said the US apology was not enough .
" We were detained during an hour and a half , threatened by police with being beaten , " he told reporters at Venezuela 's mission to the UN .
" We hold the US government responsible . "
US authorities initially denied Mr Maduro had been detained and his documents seized , saying he had simply been asked to go through a second security screening .
The US state department later confirmed the incident had taken place and apologised .
" The state department can confirm there was an incident with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro at JFK airport in New York , " a spokesman said .
" The state department regrets this incident .
The United States government apologised to Foreign Minister Maduro and the Venezuelan government . "
Coup questions
President Chavez earlier said Mr Maduro had been questioned about his alleged role in a failed Venezuelan coup attempt in 1992 , led by Mr Chavez .
US officials said airport security had questioned him , and diplomatic security was then sent to resolve the issue .
This latest episode shows that even small difficulties between the two governments are likely to trigger full - blown diplomatic rows , says the BBC's Greg Morsbach in Caracas .
HOW TO MAKE A KILLING WITH PS3 + EBAY :
immediately
Okay , okay .
I know that Squirrel recently reposted his guidelines on how he made $ 3,600 off his Xbox 360s on eBay last Xmas season and I have received a lot of email regarding how I made $ 16,000 .
However , many of the comments basically boiled down to two things :
First of all , how do you get your hands on the consoles and secondly , will this happen with the upcoming PS3 launch ?
Well , the answer to both questions are simple and since Squirrel basically is on vacation right now , I am going to handle it .
First , some background .
Unless you are late to the game , you know that XBOX 360s were extremely scarce and thus induced a crazed ' aftermarket ' for the gaming consoles .
Many XBOX 360 consoles sold for over $ 1,000 just days after its release , mostly due to the fact that nobody could get one and it did n't look like it was getting any better any time soon .
And it has n't gotten much better .
To this day , more than 2 months after launch , you STILL CANNOT simply walk into a Target or GameStop and buy an XBOX 360 .
For those lucky people who were able to get an XBOX 360 , they made a killing .
Doubling your money on ANYTHING is good .
So it is no surprise that many people are gearing up for the upcoming PlayStation 3 launch with hopes of repeating these past feats .
Squirrel made a cool $ 3,600 and I sold 33 XBOX 360s on eBay at an average profit of $ 510 .
That is $ 16,830 profit .
And I am sure others made more .
So , back to the questions .
How did Squirrel ( and myself ) get our hands on the XBOX 360s in the first place .
Well , Squirrel had some inside information .
Basically , he had an inside contact who got him a * large * quantity of XBOXs at retail price .
If you do n't have an inside contact , you 're not out of luck .
Me , having to be a bit more resourceful , had to rely on online stores .
I feel this was actually * easier * than running around all day to B&M stores .
I signed up for an online tracking service ( for $ 49 ) and my email box was constantly getting alerts when the XBOX 360 was in stock at Amazon , Walmart , etc ...
I would simply buy them online and get them shipped to my home .
I would even post these on eBay as soon as I confirmed that they shipped .
Flipping these on eBay was easy -- the demand was unlike anything I 've seen .
You just have to watch out for deadbeat bidders and non-payers .
However , PayPal and eBay make it easy and safe to deal with this and overall , even if you have a dead auction , I was able to just start another .
All of my auctions were 3 - day auctions , low reserve - - do n't worry .
They will sell .
Depending on which ' bundle ' I auctioned , I made anywhere between 1.5 to 3 times my cost .
Not bad for a day 's work .
So , on to question 2 ... will the PS3 launch be the same ?
Undoubtedly , yes .
Sony has learned a lot of lessons from Microsoft with this previous launch , such as how to spin " low inventory levels " into a media PR event .
In short , Microsoft gained worldwide publicity from this craziness .
Perhaps Microsoft could have met demand and let 's assume they did .
If everybody was able to walk into a WalMart and buy the XBOX on launch day with no problem , we would not be talking about it now .
In fact , nobody besides gamers would even hear about it outside of that first week .
However , there was all this news about people camping out , XBOX 360s on eBay for more than $ 1,000 , scam artists selling ' XBOX 360 boxes ' , etc. that virtually every man , woman and child knew how ' hot ' the XBOX 360s were .
Do you think your non-gaming neighbor heard about it ?
You bet they did .
And they might even buy one if they saw one on a shelf today .
Sony is in tight competition with Microsoft on the gaming front so they are thirsty for this kind of publicity too .
They would love the PS3 to enjoy such high demand .
So they just * MIGHT * make things a bit scarce early on and this WILL create the same crazy aftermarket .
This means that PS3s will be selling for thousands of dollars on eBay , etc .
So , you can bet I am getting ready to snap up AS MANY PS3s AS I CAN .
Now , many will criticize this move , saying it ruins it for the average gamer making prices so high .
However , I am a true gamer and I will be keeping one for myself ( and any other friends that want one ) .
However , I wo n't be a victim of the aftermarket .
It WILL happen .
PS3s will be priced sky - high and I do n't want to pay $ 1,500 for a PS3 or campout overnight .
I 'd rather be on the other side of this deal .
I originally bought multiple XBOX 360s just so I could make a small profit and pay for my own XBOX 360 .
In actuality , I was able to pay for my own and all the games plus some cash leftover .
It 's easy if you know how to .
#1 ) Sign up for an inventory tracking service .
There is no way around this .
Amazon.com , WalMart.com , Target Online , etc. all sell out within minutes whenever they get stock .
An online tracking service will notify youwhen the PS3 is in stock online .
I used XTnTracker for my XBOX 360s and will use them again to get my PS3s ... go toand sign up .
I believe the introductory special of $ 19.95 is still going on .
THIS IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN MAKE OFF YOUR FIRST eBay SALE .
I sold my first XBOX 360 for a $ 450 profit .
#2 ) When you get an alert , go and buy as many as possible as QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE .
Have your account created , your credit card handy , etc .
These units sell out in minutes , literally .
Do n't worry if they are ' bundles ' -- a game console with games , or extra controllers , etc .
You can get rid of these very easily , either by auctioning them off individually or as a bundle .
Or , you can even try to return these to local stores for credit / cash .
#3 ) Repeat steps 1 and 2 .
With 40,000 XBOX 360s going through eBay , there is a lot of room for anybody willing to put some effort into it .
I just kept getting email stock alerts and just kept buying as many as I could ... Thanks , Squirrel for the info and thanks to everybody who sent me emails .
Hopefully this clears up some of your questions .
This is not really any big secret and with 40,000 units on eBay ( possibly more for the PS3 ) things simply will not change with a few more sellers .
There are only a defined number of PS3s available -- you just need to be smart about how to get your piece of the pie and capitalize on it .++++++++++++++++++++ Some links regarding consoles , eBay and the XBOX 360 :
I got an email over the weekend from a friend of mine who 's leaving Microsoft .
I was n't surprised to see him leave Microsoft , given that the every project he 's worked on at Microsoft has either been cancelled mid-project or end of lifed in that release .
After being at Microsoft for five years , I 've now begun to see the signs that a project is likely to crash and burn early on .
Below is a top five list of signs your software project is in trouble I compiled as part of my ' parting career advice ' to my intern .
Schedule Chicken :
This is typically a sign that the project 's schedules are unrealistic .
A project with unrealistic schedule is either an indication of poor communication between layers in the product team or even worse , bad management that punishes the messenger when there is bad news ( e.g. poor initial estimation of project length ) .
The main problem with schedule chicken is that you can be " date driven " or you can be " quality driven " , you can't be both .
Scope Creep : Requirements changing as a software project progresses are natural .
They can change due to feedback from the customer after they get to try out a prototype , due to changes in the competitive landscape or because the original requirements had hidden conditions which were not discovered until after implementation .
When things get bad is when the goals of a project are changed or increased significantly without a corresponding significant change to the expected timeframe for delivery .
WinFS merging with Object Spaces is my canonical example of scope creep at Microsoft .
Underresourced :
You do n't bring a knife to a gun fight .
So you should n't expect that 3 developers and $ 50,000 will be able to compete with the Googles and Microsofts of the world .
Similarly , if you work at a big company and you have a handful of folks working on a product where competitors have large teams or entire companies working on the same problem space , you 're probably in over your head .
Second System Syndrome :
Once you ship a software application , it instantly becomes legacy code .
To a developer this means there is something newer and sexier that can solve the same problem in a more elegant way .
Eventually a project is started which is intended to replace the existing product which customers are finding useful .
This is often a double whammy .
The new project is hamstrung out of the gate by having to meet customer expectations on backwards compatibility , performance and new features in comparison to the old product .
This burden is often a crushing weight on the second system which eventually collapses under the strain .
In addition , the old project is often abandoned or at best put in " maintenance mode " with only a skeleton crew working on it even though it pays the bills .
Running More Productive Meetings Merlin Mann | Feb 21 2006
I very much enjoyed Ethan 's recent post about avoiding " vampire meetings " and thought I 'd share a few of my own tips for getting the most out of your meetings -- primarily from the perspective of being the organizer and facilitator .
For the love of God , please respect your poor colleagues ' time .
Circulate an agenda -
An agenda should show the planned steps that get the meeting from " here " to " there . "
It helps the participants prepare appropriately and anticipate the kind of information they might need to produce .
Most importantly , it works as a contract with the participants : " here 's why this is a great use of your time for n minutes . "
Have a theme - Meetings should n't be meandering tours of each participant 's frontal lobe ( unless -- well -- unless that 's the actual agenda ) .
Make it clear why this meeting is happening , why each person is participating at a given time , and then use your agenda to amplify how the theme will be explored or tackled in each section of the meeting .
Set ( and honor ) times for beginning , ending , and breaks - There 's nothing worse than a rudderless meeting that everyone knows will just prattle on until its leader gets tired of hearing himself talk .
You own your meeting by putting up walls -- provide structure and be firm about respecting everyone 's time .
Give short bio and email breaks on a regular schedule .
Honor the time walls .
No electronic grazing .
Period . - Laptops closed .
Phones off .
Blackberries left back in the cube .
You 're either at the meeting or you 're not at the meeting , and few things are more distracting or disruptive than the guy who has to check his damned email every five minutes .
Schedule breaks for people to fiddle with their toys , but fearlessly enforce a no grazing rule once the meeting 's back in session .
Emergency call to take or make ?
They have to leave the room .
No exceptions .
If you 're too busy to be at the meeting everyone else has made firewalled time for , just leave .
Schedule guests -
Do not put thirty people in a room for three hours if twenty of them will have nothing to do for all but the last ten minutes .
In your agenda , make it clear when people will be needed and you 'll encourage best use of everyone 's time .
It 's also extra incentive ( or even an excuse ) to tick off agenda items in a timely manner .
( " Well , it looks like Henderson is here to share his sales report , so let 's move on . " )
Be a referee and employ a time - keeper - If you can afford it , have one person in the meeting be the slavish time - keeper so you , as the leader , can focus on facilitating , summarizing , clarifying , and just keeping things moving .
Working closely with the time - keeper , you should not be afraid to announce things like " Okay , we have three minutes left for this , so let 's wrap up with any questions you have for Alice , then move on . "
Stay on target -
Any item that can be resolved between a couple people offline or that does not require the knowledge , consent , or input of the majority of the group should be scotched immediately .
Close ratholes .
As soon as the needed permission , notification , or task assignment is completed , just move on to the next item .
Follow up -
If you have been utilizing a project manager or note taker ( and God knows you should ) , be sure to use a few minutes at the end for him or her to review any major new projects or action items that were generated in the meeting .
Have the PM email the list of resolved and new action items to all the participants .
Be consistent - Take any of these tips that work for you -- and many certainly may not -- but understand one thing above all ; meetings do not run themselves , and if you have any desire to make best use of valuable people 's time , you 'll need a firm hand and a lot of thoughtful planning .
Set a pattern of being the one whose meetings do n't suck and you 'll start seeing the productivity , tone , and participation in your meetings consistently improve .
Aside : Understand -- this is coming from a man who often was compelled to spend the better part of one day a week on a bi-coastal video conference call with two dozen people .
Staring .
Wishing death .
Listening to the CTO opine at length about how exciting it would be to build and sell a national yellow pages app from scratch .
If there had been cyanide capsules on the table instead of M&Ms , I do n't think I would have hesitated to indulge .
" Boil the ocean " business models and long meetings are the cocktail for making Merlin wish harm upon himself .

As thousands of people sat on the streets of New Orleans , having spent their fourth day waiting to be rescued , the city fell deeper into chaos , with gangs roaming the city and corpses rotting in the sun .
Kathleen Blanco , the Democrat governor of Louisiana , threatened looters with a shoot - to - kill policy .
" These troops are battle - tested .
They have M16s and are locked and loaded , " she said .
" These troops know how to shoot and kill and I expect they will . "
Plumes of thick black smoke rose after an explosion rocked an industrial area hit hard by Katrina and an apartment complex in the city centre was also in flames .
The explosion was later said to have taken place in a chemical storage facility .
Stunned residents stumbled around bodies that lay rotting and untouched .
Others trudged along flooded and debris - strewn streets toward the Superdome football stadium where they hoped to be bussed to safety .
Calling for the immediate deployment of regular combat troops in New Orleans , David Vitter , a Louisiana Republican senator said : " My guess is that it [ the death toll ] will start at 10,000 , but that is only a guess . "
He said this estimate was not based on any official death toll or body count .
Even before he set off , Mr Bush was forced to admit that the relief effort had been inadequate : " The results are not acceptable , " he said .
Later he said : " I am not looking forward to this trip .
It 's as if the entire Gulf coast were obliterated by the worst kind of weapon you can imagine . "
An emergency military convoy of aid supplies arrived in New Orleans yesterday to help in the relief of tens of thousands of refugees made desperate in the aftermath of the hurricane .
Live television broadcasts showed a queue of military vehicles loaded with crates making their way through the flooded streets .
Troops with rifles rode in the convoy .
In another sign of aid finally getting through , commercial aircraft carrying supplies were arriving at an increased rate of four per hour at New Orleans international airport , the department of transport said .
The planes were evacuating displaced residents and would continue until evening .
New Orleans has descended into anarchy since it was devastated by Katrina on Monday .
Standing alongside the Republican governors of Alabama and Mississippi at his first stop in Mobile , Alabama , Mr Bush said : " We have a responsibility to clean up this mess .
What is not working right , we 're going to make it right . "
He then went on to Biloxi , Mississippi , where he spoke to victims before heading to New Orleans .
Yesterday the US Congress broke away from its holiday to implement a $ 10.5 bn ( £ 5.6bn ) aid package , while the Pentagon promised 1,400 national guardsmen a day to stop looting in the city .
But these moves did little to quell the mounting anger of the hurricane 's victims and local officials , particularly in New Orleans .
At the increasingly unsanitary convention centre , the crowds swelled to about 25,000 as people sought food , water and attention , while dead bodies lay in wheelchairs or wrapped in sheets both inside and outside the centre .
At the city 's Charity hospital , the dead were stacked up on the stairways .
New Orleans airport was transformed into a huge field hospital , with fleets of military and coastguard helicopters ferrying the sick for treatment .
Ray Nagin , the mayor of New Orleans , broke down in tears on Thursday during an interview on local radio , saying that federal officials " do n't have a clue what 's going on " .
" I keep hearing that this is coming , that is coming , " he said , referring to federal aid .
" And my answer to that today is ... where is the beef ?
" Let 's figure out the biggest crisis in the history of our country , " he continued .
After September 11 , he said , the president had been given " unprecedented powers " to send aid to New York .
The same response should be applied in this case , too , he said .
" Get off your asses and let 's do something . "
At a news conference in Washington yesterday , the Congressional Black Caucus criticised the rescue effort and the failure to assist many of the mostly poor and black victims .
" I 'm ashamed of America .
I 'm ashamed of our government , " said a Democrat congresswoman , Carolyn Kilpatrick , from Michigan .
" I 'm outraged by the lack of response ... "
The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , Michael Brown , defended his record , but said he understood the irritation .
He said there was " a continuous flow of commodities " , into the Superdome in New Orleans , where thousands of people are taking refuge in crowded conditions .
Lieutenant General Steven Blum , chief of the National Guard Bureau , said 2,600 further national guardsmen would be deployed by tonight , bringing the total number of troops in New Orleans to 7,000 .
" We understand the recovery is not going to be an overnight recovery , " he said .
" This is a catastrophe of enormous magnitude . "
The additional troops would be getting into areas that were previously inaccessible .
Asked why the civil unrest continued , Gen Blum said : " There are not enough police and soldiers to be everywhere all the time . "
But as troops arrived yesterday they were told to point their guns downward , to avoid any comparison with Iraq .
The movement of thousands of refugees from the Superdome to the Astrodome in Houston was halted late on Thursday , after it was feared that the Astrodome was becoming a fire hazard .
They are being transported to other shelters in Houston .

Today I stumbled upon VGMix.com , an online community of amateur musicians who make recordings of video - game music .
This sounded fun to me , so I spent some time recording a guitar version of the Super Mario Bros 2 level - one theme , in the style of Django Reinhardt ( gypsy jazz ) .
After I spent a while recording and mixing this , though , it was just my luck to find out VGMix.com is n't accepting new registrations , so I can't actually post the song to the site .
I guess I 'll just post it here :
Gypsy jazz Super Mario Bros. 2 by Adrian Holovaty
It was recorded on a small computer microphone , so the sound quality could be a lot better .
Hope somebody gets a kick out of it .
UPDATE : By popular request , I 've posted the chords for my arrangement .
The first thing any .
Net programmer wants to know , after finishing the toy examples , is how do I connect to Sql Server and do some real work with Seaside .
Yes , I said Sql Server !
No other database is in wide use in the .
Net community .
No one , and by that I mean very few , uses MySql , PostgresSql , Oracle , FireBird , or any other database you can think of .
90 % or more .
Net programmers use Sql Server exclusively , it 's just what 's done .
I 'm not against other databases , or object databases , and have used Goods and MySql a bit myself , but if Squeak and Seaside want a foothold in the .
Net community , it must play nicely with Sql Server , PERIOD !
This is a problem , a huge problem , because Squeak does n't have native Sql Server drivers .
Squeak 's only access is via ODBC , which uses Squeak 's Foreign Function Interface ( FFI ) .
ODBC works reasonably well , and seems reasonably fast , however , the FFI locks the VM when in use effectively making all access to Sql Server single threaded .
Yes , some of these other database have native drivers that do n't lock the VM , but I 'm not talking about them .
Yes , you could use Visual Works and Seaside , which has native access , but I 'm not talking about it either .
I 'm only talking about Squeak and Seaside , I prefer them , because they 're free .
In Squeak , it 's ODBC or nothing , and ODBC simply can't scale .
You can do small sites in it , but tying a multi - threaded server , the web server , to a single threaded interface to the database ( FFI ) , simply can't work in production if you expect any sort of heavy load .
It 's unacceptable to have one web request waiting for another to finish a query , while blocking the user .
Now , this might seem like a show stopper , I almost thought so myself , but it 's not .
If you set your architecture up right , you can avoid the need to access Sql from Seaside , and avoid the issues that ODBC and FFI create .
You simply have to change your approach , and consider Seaside as an addition to your existing .
Net infrastructure , rather than a replacement .
If you have a site large enough to be too big for ODBC , there 's a good chance you 're going to have multiple web servers load balancing the traffic .
If you have a site large enough to need to load balance the traffic , there 's a good chance you may have already broken your application up into tiers .
This is the perfect place to combine the strengths of Squeak and Seaside , with the strengths of .
Net .
Break your application up into two tiers , a presentation tier , and service tier .
Have the service tier consist of .
Net based web services , and the presentation tier consist of Seaside based sites that consume those services via Squeaks SoapClient library .
You can host the application tier , on the same boxes as the web servers , or on their own boxes , if you have the traffic to justify load balanced application servers as well .
SoapClient has recently been made compatible with .
Net after I did a little begging and pleading with the author , Masashi Umezawa , to make a few changes to accommodate .
Net 's quirks .
He was totally cool , and made the necessary fixes in less than a day , I can't thank him enough .
. Net is perfectly sufficient , and actually quite nice , for running queries against a Sql Server database and handing it out via web services .
.
Net 's weaknesses lie in its poor web framework .
I should n't even say poor ... from the Seaside point of view , it 's simply old fashioned .
If you think of Seaside as just the presentation layer , which it excels at , you 'll find it quite a nice division of labor .
.
Net can hand back real objects to Squeak , which can use them quite easily , either as dictionaries of associations , or if you register a real object with SoapClient , can de-serialize directly to a real business object containing all the necessary rules biz objects contain .
You also gain the benefit of forcing yourself to create services that you will likely find other uses for .
Maybe you have other clients who'd like access to those same services .
Maybe you can take advantage of this architecture to have your .
Net guy building web services while you Seaside guy plugs away building the front end .
Your Seaside guy can fake the services and build the front end while he 's waiting for the real ones to be build , should that be necessary .
Be careful when using SoapClient against a service , there are some security issues with Squeak 's SoapClient .
Make sure you control the server , and trust all data coming from it , else someone could execute arbitrary code in your image by returning some bad data .
For the same reason , I would n't host any web services in Squeak , I 'd use .
Net , or whatever your favorite provider is .
But for accessing in house web services , that you trust , I see no problems using Soap as the leverage point to introduce Seaside and Squeak into the world of .
Net. Seaside royally kicks ASP .
Net 's ass , and can make building your web applications an order of magnitude faster and easier , and that counts for a lot .
I 've been using this approach for a couple of months , and so far , it 's working quite well .
I will continue doing so , and write about any issues I run into , as I run into them .
In the mean time , I 'd love to hear from anyone doing anything similar .
Just another fun night out with LL and her mom .
Seriously what is going on here ?

Wiesenthal passed away in his sleep at his home in Vienna , Austria , Rabbi Marvin Hier , the dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles , said .
" I think he 'll be remembered as the conscience of the Holocaust , " Mr Hier said .
" When the Holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember .
" He did not forget .
He became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
Wiesenthal , who was an architect before the second world war , dedicated himself to tracking down Nazi war criminals and being a voice for the 6 million Jews who died during the Holocaust .
He lost 89 relatives in the atrocity .
" The task was overwhelming , " Mr Hier added .
" The cause had few friends .
The Allies were already focused on the cold war , the survivors were rebuilding their shattered lives - and Simon Wiesenthal was all alone , combining the role of both prosecutor and detective at the same time . "
Wiesenthal spent more than 50 years hunting Nazi war criminals , speaking out against neo -Nazism and racism and remembering the Jewish experience as a lesson for humanity .
Through his work , he said , around 1,100 Nazi war criminals were brought to justice .
" With much energy and astonishing persistence , he refused to let the perpetrators of the single greatest crime of man against man go unjudged , unpunished , forgotten , " Britain 's chief rabbi , Sir Jonathan Sacks , said .
" In the early years , his was a lonely and much misunderstood mission , yet he continued to insist that what he sought was justice , not vengeance .
" The sheer scale of the task he undertook was immense .
His moral clarity and courage were unfailing .
All those who fight hate are in his debt . "
The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , said Wiesenthal would " forever be rightly credited " with ensuring justice for some of the worst crimes in history was done .
" He was tireless in his efforts , and he gave the Jewish communities in the UK and around the world a lifetime of service .
Future generations will forever be indebted to him , " Mr Straw said .
Wiesenthal 's quest began after the US liberated the Mauthausen death camp in Austria , where he was a prisoner , in May 1945 .
It was the fifth among the dozen Nazi camps in which he was imprisoned , and he weighed just 45 kgs ( 99lbs ) when he was freed .
" When history looks back , I want people to know the Nazis were n't able to kill millions of people and get away with it , " he once said .
He said he quickly realised " there is no freedom without justice " , and decided to dedicate " a few years " to seeking justice .
" It became decades , " he added .

NOT even in the lowest moments of the Third Reich , or of the gulag , or of Mao's " Great Leap Forward " was there a time when all the subjects of the system were actually enslaved .
In North Korea , every person is property and is owned by a small and mad family with hereditary power .
Every minute of every day , as far as regimentation can assure the fact , is spent in absolute subjection and serfdom .
The private life has been entirely abolished .
One tries to avoid cliche , and I did my best on a visit to this terrifying country in the year 2000 , but George Orwell 's 1984 was published at about the time that Kim Il - Sung set up his system , and it really is as if he got hold of an early copy of the novel and used it as a blueprint ( " Hmmm - good book .
Let 's see if we can make it work " ) .
Actually , North Korea is rather worse than Orwell 's imagined world .
There would be no way , in the capital city of Pyongyang , to wander off and get lost in the slums , let alone to rent an off - the - record love nest in a room over a shop .
Everybody in the city has to be at home and in bed by curfew time , when all the lights go off ( if they have n't already failed ) .
A recent night - time photograph of the Korean peninsula from outer space shows something that no " free - world " propaganda could invent : a blaze of electric light all over the southern half , stopping exactly at the demilitarised zone and becoming an area of darkness in the north .
Concealed in that pitch - black night is an imploding state where the only things that work are the police and the armed forces .
The situation is actually slightly worse than indentured servitude .
The slave owner historically promises , in effect , at least to keep his slaves fed .
In North Korea , this compact has been broken .
It is a famine state as well as a slave state .
Partly because of the end of favourable trade relations with , and subsidies from , the former USSR , but mainly because of the lunacy of its command economy , North Korea broke down in the 1990s and lost an unguessable number of people to sheer starvation .
The survivors , especially the children , have been stunted and malformed .
Even on a tightly controlled tour - North Korea is almost as hard to visit as it is to leave - my robotic guides could n't prevent me from seeing people drinking from sewers and picking up grains of food from barren fields ( I was reduced to eating a dog , and I was a privileged " guest " ) .
Film shot from over the Chinese border shows whole towns ruined and abandoned .
It seems mines in the north of the country have been flooded beyond repair .
Kim Jong-il and his fellow slave masters are trying to dictate the pace of events by setting a timetable of nuclearization , based on a crash program wrung from their human property .
But why should it be assumed that their failed state and society are permanent ?
Another timeline , orientated to liberation and regime change , is what the dynasty most fears .
It should start to fear it more .
In general all the great ideas are the simple ones .
Many times we see a great idea in practice and we wander why did n’t we thought of that before ?
It is just so simple …
The first time I have seen the knockd project I liked it instantly .
The idea is so simple , and though so effective .
Knockd is a port - knocking application that silently runs on a server passively listening to network traffic .
Once it will see a port sequence it has an action configured for it , it will run that action .
We can see this as a remote control to our server : once we hit the right button it will take the appropriate action !
How does a port knocker work ?
we install the port knocker daemon on our server ( knockd )
we configure some port sequences ( tcp , udp , or both ) , and the appropriate actions for each sequence .
the knockd daemon will be running in the background , at low level passively on the network interface .
It is completely stealth and it will not open any ports on the server .
once it will see a port sequence it will run the configured action for the sequence .
To exemplify its power I will show a scenario with a server running a firewalled ssh port that allows connections only from one static management IP .
All the IPs are private ones for the sake of the example .
Using knockd we will be able to connect to the server from another location that would be normally blocked .
Installing knockd
First you will need to install the knockd daemon .
See the project home page for the program sources ( or rpm , and debs ) that the author provides : http://www.zeroflux.org/cgi-bin/cvstrac.cgi/knock/wiki
On Debian ( as my test server ) we can just install it from the main debian repositories :
apt - get install knockd
Our closed firewall setup : we will use a closed SSH setup that allows connections only from 192.168.0.100 to our server .
The respective iptables rules look like :
iptables - L -n Chain INPUT ( policy DROP ) target prot opt source destination ACCEPT tcp -- 192.168.0.100 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22 DROP tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22
These iptables rules will allow me to connect to the server from my management station using ssh , but will drop any other ssh connection .
Now if I need to connect to the server from another location I have a problem … what choices do I have ?
( besides knockd of course ) :
either ask someone to disable the firewall from the console ( sucks ) or add my IP to the allowed rules ( better , but what if there is no one to help me with this ? )
either I have some way to connect to my management station from my location ( let ’s say I do n’t ) .
So you see how useful knockd can be in this situation … if I had configured my knockd daemon with the following rules ( I will use the default port sequence for this example ; you should never use this sequence , and choose your own port sequence ) :
/etc/knockd.conf : [ openSSH ] sequence = 7000,8000,9000 seq_timeout = 5 command = / sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT tcpflags = syn [ closeSSH ] sequence = 9000,8000,7000 seq_timeout = 5 command = /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT tcpflags = syn
In this case I can just send the port sequence ( I will be using the knock client ) .
You can send knocks to the server using other tools like : netcat , sendip , packit , hping or even telnet .
knock -v 192.168.0.102 7000 8000 9000
This has added the rule that will allow me to connect to the server from my current location using the configured iptables rule from above :
iptables - L -n Chain INPUT ( policy DROP ) target prot opt source destination ACCEPT tcp -- 192.168.0.103 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22 ACCEPT tcp -- 192.168.0.100 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22 DROP tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22
Now I can safely connect to the server using ssh from my location ( 192.168.0.103 ) .
Once I am finished I will send the knock to close the whole in the firewall , and return to my original rules :
knock -v 192.168.0.102 9000 8000 7000
Automatically close rules :
If our firewall rules permit this approach we can automatically close the holes opened in the firewall .
This can be useful because we might forget to send the closing knock , and leave the rules open in the firewall .
Now in order to use this our firewall needs to allow established ssh connections and only block new ( syn ) ssh connections .
For example our ssh related iptables rules might look like this :
iptables - L -n Chain INPUT ( policy DROP ) target prot opt source destination ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22 state ESTABLISHED ACCEPT tcp -- 192.168.0.100 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22 DROP tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22
Our knockd configurations looks like :
/etc/knockd.conf : [ opencloseSSH ] sequence = 7000,8000,9000 seq_timeout = 5 tcpflags = syn , ack start_command = /usr / sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- syn -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT cmd_timeout = 25 stop_command = /usr/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- syn -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT
In this case once we send the sequence we will have 25 seconds to establish our ssh connection .
After that the rule will be deleted .
Security implications
The knockd daemon runs passively listening to network traffic without opening any network ports .
Even though it is practically impossible to an attacker to see that we are running knockd on the server , and try to guess the knock sequences we have configured , here are some general common sense security rules :
NEVER use default sequences .
I have included in my example for this reason the default 7000,8000,9000 sequence to not create another default pattern .
Choose your own port sequences .
.
I have included in my example for this reason the default 7000,8000,9000 sequence to not create another default pattern .
Choose your own port sequences .
Use at least 3 ports in the sequence .
If you are paranoic you can use as many ports as you like .
.
If you are paranoic you can use as many ports as you like .
Mix tcp ports ( default , if you do not specify the protocol ) with udp ports : 9000 : tcp,8000:udp,7000:tcp
Even if someone might hit by mistake the configured sequences try to prevent any damage : choose proper timeouts for running the command , use strong passwords , etc .
Other usages : port knocking is not limited to firewall rules as I have exemplified above .
You can use it to run any command you might need .
Just keep in mind the security implications for each of your defined port sequences ( like there is a big difference if someone will hit by mistake a sequence that opens the ssh port for 25 seconds - that will still require to have a proper user and password , and for example a command that will reboot the server - that will start the command once seen the sequence ) .
I hope that you found this information useful and it will help you make your improve the security of your server ( you can close those ports you left open because you were roaming and use port knocking to safely connect to your server ) .
Note : the project page ( and the default installed config file ) contain references to add the iptables rules with - A .
As you can see in my setup this would have been useless ( it would have added the rule after the DROP rule , thus doing nothing ) , so I have used the - I switch ( that will insert the iptables rule at the beginning of the firewall rules ) :
command = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP % -p tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT
Also you in case you are using a different chain for ssh traffic in your iptables rules ( like most peoples will probably do ) you will want to change the commands to fit your setup .

The Origin of Life
Provided by
In modern organisms , there is a division of labour between two kinds of molecule : DNA , which stores and transmits genetic information , and proteins , which do all the work .
They are connected by the ' genetic code ' , whereby DNA specifies what kinds of proteins can be made .
This process of translation is well understood , but it is far too complicated to have arisen by chance in the primitive oceans .
How can this apparent paradox be resolved ?

Pump Seriousness Into Energy Policy
By Charles Krauthammer
WASHINGTON -- Thank God for $ 3.50 gasoline .
True , we had it for only a brief shining moment , and there is not much good to be said about the catastrophic hurricanes that caused it .
But the price was already inexorably climbing as a result of 2.3 billion Chinese and Indians industrializing .
Their increased demand is what brought us to the energy knife 's edge and makes us so acutely vulnerable to supply disruptions .
Yet , the Senate is attacking the problem by hauling oil executives to hearings on ``price gouging . ''
Even by Senate standards , the cynicism here is breathtaking .
Everyone knows what the problem really is .
It 's Economics 101 : increasing demand and precariously tight supply .
Yet for three decades we have done criminally little about it .
Conservatives argued for more production , liberals argued for more conservation , and each side blocked the other 's remedies -- when even a child can see that we need both :
Demand .
Just yesterday we were paying $ 3.50 at the pump and ready to pay $ 4 or $ 5 if necessary .
No blessing has ever come more disguised .
Now that we have lived with $ 3.50 gasoline , $ 3 seems far less outrageous than , say , a year ago .
We have a unique but fleeting opportunity to permanently depress demand by locking in higher gasoline prices .
Put a floor at $ 3 .
Every penny that the price goes under $ 3 should be recaptured in a federal gas tax so that Americans pay $ 3 at the pump no matter how low the world price goes .
Why is this a good idea ?
It is the simplest way to induce conservation .
People will alter their buying habits .
It was the higher fuel prices of the 1970s and early ' 80s that led to more energy - efficient cars and appliances -- which induced such restraint on demand that the world price of oil ultimately fell through the floor .
By 1986 , oil was $ 11 a barrel .
Then we got profligate and resumed our old habits , and oil is now $ 60 .
Surprise .
The worst part is that much of this $ 60 goes overseas to foreigners who wish us no good : Wahhabi Saudi princes who subsidize terrorists ; Hugo Chavez , the mini-Mussolini of the Southern Hemisphere ; and ( through the fungibility of oil ) the nuclear - hungry , death - to - America Iranian mullahs .
This is insanity .
It makes infinitely more sense to reduce consumption , drive the world price down and let the premium we force ourselves to pay at the pump ( which begins the conservation cycle ) go to the U.S. Treasury .
If the price drops to $ 2 , plow that $ 1 tax right back into the American economy by immediately reducing , say , Social Security or income taxes .
The beauty of a gas tax at $ 3 is that it obviates the waste and folly of an army of bureaucrats telling auto companies what cars in which fleets need to meet what arbitrary standards of fuel efficiency .
Abolish all the regulations and let the market decide .
Consumers are not stupid .
Within weeks of Katrina , SUV sales were already in decline and hybrids were flying off the lots .
Supply .
For decades we 've been dithering over drilling in a tiny part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Look , I too love the caribou .
They are sweet , picturesque and reputedly harmless .
But dire predictions about the devastation that Prudhoe Bay oil development would visit upon the caribou proved false .
They have thrived .
Let 's get serious .
We live at the edge of oil shortages and in perpetual vulnerability to oil blackmail .
We have soldiers dying in the oil fields of the Middle East , yet we leave untouched the largest untapped oil field in North America so that Lower - 48 ers can enjoy an image of pristine Arctic purity .
This is an indulgence bordering on decadence .
As is our refusal to drill on the continental shelf .
Offshore drilling technology is far safer and more efficient than it was decades ago when this prohibition was passed .
We 're starving ourselves .
The same logic applies to refineries .
We have not built a new one since 1976 .
Gasoline does n't grow on trees .
The U.S. refining industry operates at 96 percent capacity .
That is unsustainable .
We need the equivalent of the military - base closing commission , whereby outside experts decide which bases should be closed in the national interest .
A refinery commission that would situate 15 new refineries scattered throughout the U.S. ( some perhaps on Army bases scheduled for closing ) would spread the pain , depoliticize the process and arm us against future shortages .
With these simple steps , we could within a decade finally escape the oil noose .
But do n't hold your breath .
The Senate just loved its little oil - executive inquisition .
The House Wednesday night stripped out the ANWR drilling provision .
And there is not a single national politician who dares propose raising gas taxes by even a penny .
We are criminally unserious about energy independence and we will pay the price .

Here are a few important things to note , along with some initial impressions :
And that 's not much of an exaggeration .
Even better , this " beat iTunes over the head with a hammer " app is completely free , and completely cross-platform ( courtesy of being built on the Mozilla XULRunner Platform ) .
It will even theoretically be able to talk to your iPod ( and other portable devices ) .
More information regarding Version 0.2 can be found at the release notice page
Here are a few important things to note , along with some initial impressions :
This is a development release .
It is not a production release .
Do n't expect it to be a viable and worthy iTunes - crusher yet .
It is buggy , prone to crashing , and has some quirks .
Note the version number .
It is still a long ways away from 1.0 .
Do n't expect 1.0 performance from a 0.2 product .
If you 're a Mozilla Sunbird user , you 're intimately familiar with this .
Songbird is currently a resource - gobbler .
While building a music library , it consumed all available CPU resources .
Initial memory usage was pretty chunky ( ~ 20 megs ) , continued to grow , and seemed to top out somewhere around 60ish megs .
There are likely a few reasons for this ... see both the above and below points .
The program runs on XULRunner .
Yes , it is a platform that has evolved from Mozilla 's Gecko rendering - engine thing .
Yes , it has a solid history of webpage - rendering awesomeness ( * points at Firefox * ) .
No , XULRunner is not ready for prime - time .
A good friend of mine is developing a small GTD app in XUL , and attests to this .
The above notes on performance can probably be attributed as much to the current version of XULRunner as it can to Songbird 's code .
Firefox 3 will be running on XULRunner , so expect to see some major improvements here in the near future .
Considering what I 've noted so far , Songbird is AMAZING .
Yes , it barfs here and there , but the app is mature enough at this point to get a decent look at what these guys are going for .
There 's some good stuff happening here .
One word : " EXTENSIONS " .
This really could become the Firefox of music players .

Angelina Jolie 's estranged father Jon Voight sent a shout out to his grandkids Saturday , but it seems like absence makes the memory grow weaker -- he royally screwed up one of the names .
At the fourth annual BAFTA Tea Party ( BAFTA is the Oscars for Brits ) , Voight was talking with a reporter on the red carpet when he decided to send birthday wishes to Maddox , Angelina 's five - year - old child .
That went well , but then things took an ugly turn .
Voight also sent well - wishes to " Shakira " -- problem is , he was talking about Angelina 's 1 1/2 - year - old daughter .
Shakira is considerably older -- 29 .
The correct name -- Zahara .
Close , but no cigar .
Actors are famous for always getting another chance , and take two was perfect .
Sir Isaac
Newton once said that if he had achieved anything with his work , such as his laws of motion and gravity , it was " by standing on the shoulders of giants . "
The scientific vision and achievements of those before brought Newton metaphorically to a higher ground that allowed him to " see " further into the nature of the physical world .
Newton's " giants " probably included Aristotle and Rene Descartes , among others .
Few scientists are in Newton 's class .
Among them was Albert Einstein .
And sure enough , a couple of centuries later , one of the many things Einstein puzzled over included how to reconcile Newton 's law of gravity with special relativity , which describes the motion of objects at high speeds .
The result , after eight years of work , was his theory of general relativity .
Einstein consulted during this time with such greats as physicist Max Planck and mathematicians David Hilbert and Tullio Levi-Civita , who contributed much to calculus and other fields .
Giants hanging out with giants .
The reality is that behind many scientific geniuses , there is at least one other genius , and often a number of them .
Nicolaus Copernicus , who theorized heretically in the early 1500s that the Earth orbited the Sun , not vice - versa , had a huge influence on astronomers Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei , as well as Newton .
Some shoulders are bigger than others .
Some scientific stars practically orbit one another , says John Galbraith Simmons , author of " The Scientific 100 " ( Citadel Press , 2000 ) .
For instance , Charles Darwin brought a copy of Charles Lyell 's foundational book on geology with him on his 5 - year journey to the Galapagos and beyond .
Without the insight that the rocks of today developed over time due to a succession of physical events , Darwin would have struggled dearly to arrive at his theory of evolution , which explains how life as we see it now also developed over time .
Another binary scientific setup is Michael Faraday , who was the first to conceptualize electromagnetic fields , and James Clerk Maxwell , who explicitly started out with Faraday 's insights and spent his life developing them into laws that quantify and explain how electricity works .
Francis Crick and James Watson , co-discoverers of the structure of DNA , were following up on a suggestion made just a couple years earlier by chemist Linus Pauling about the general helical nature of large protein molecules .
It takes much more than a genius pal or predecessor , however , to do great science , according to Simmons .
Scientific advances emerge from social , economic and political conditions .
" The idea of a lone genius who changes the world with his ideas is essentially flawed , " Simmons told LiveScience .
" Copernicus came up with a brilliant idea , and it would have been strictly limited without Kepler 's work .
But the social background — the Reformation — played a major role in how all this work was conceived and received .
Society creates the conditions for scientists to be creative and productive — or not . "

BBC One 's Whistleblower
My boss congratulates me on getting an offer on a flat that has been overvalued by £ 60,000 .
The newly - wed young couple viewing the property are stretched to their financial limit .
But my manager is happy .
He takes me aside and explains how to convince a surveyor that the flat in London 's fashionable Notting Hill is worth more than it is .
He calls it " slightly simmering " - I call it cooking the books .
The scenario is not uncommon , in fact the manager himself boasts : " This kind of s*** happens all the time ... that 's why we estate agents are here . "
That night I head to the weekly sales meeting at Sloane Square .
It 's held at 7 pm on a Friday night - when other people are relaxing in the pub .
Heckled
Under - performers are heckled and those who have done the most deals are applauded and given champagne and £ 50 .
Young agents in Foxtons exchange high - fives as they swap tales of gazumping and over - valuing .
I 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when I tell one of the directors that failure is not an option , he looks thrilled
The ambitious young graduates in sharp suits are full of bravado as they discuss their equally sharp practices while their sales figures are projected onto a giant screen .
But I can't stop thinking back to the hard - working young family who dream of getting on the property ladder and have wasted their money unnecessarily .
For BBC One 's Whistleblower programme , I spent eight months investigating the murky world of the estate agent .
This involved spending time in five very different agencies and within days , I got a shocking glimpse inside this largely unregulated industry .
Going to war
During the investigation I saw the depths to which some agents will sink to get a deal - not only offering a house and a mortgage , but also a fake British passport .
An estate agent was also able to obtain a false passport
Together with a BBC colleague , Emma Clarke , I spent three months in Foxtons .
Londoners will know the brand by its ubiquitous fleet of branded Minis and the trendy high - street offices that look more like wine bars than estate agencies .
But behind the stylish facade it is easy to see why the company has made its owner Jon Hunt one of the wealthiest estate agents in Britain .
I 'm told he encourages his agents to adopt the mantra : " Our clients expect us to go to war for them ! " - so it 's hardly surprising the lengths his staff will go to keep the deals coming in .
According to the Sunday Times Rich List , Jon Hunt is worth £ 345 m and also owns independent mortgage brokers Alexander Hall .
Unlawful
I soon discovered his mortgage brokers work closely with Foxtons ' agents .
They openly discuss potential buyers ' budgets so they can squeeze as much money out of them as possible .
Jon Hunt , head of Foxtons , where the undercover reporter worked
Some buyers have no idea that the Foxtons agents showing them around properties already know exactly what they can afford .
After an excruciatingly intense two - hour job interview and presentation with 20 other young hopefuls - I got the job .
I have a cover story but I 'm still nervous when I 'm quizzed for 20 minutes about my work history and squirm as I reel off what I think they want to hear .
I 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when I tell one of the directors that " failure is not an option " , he looks thrilled .
Two days later I got the job .
Pressure
I was posted to the Notting Hill branch , a former pasta restaurant where Jon Hunt started his Foxtons empire 24 years ago .
I was convinced my cover could be blown at any time as I worked round the corner from where I live .
My friends did n't know about my new day job , and I felt exposed as I zipped around my neighbourhood in my Foxtons Mini .
It 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable
Working undercover is exhausting .
I have to start at dawn , making sure my cameras are working and well - hidden .
Estate agents are a well - turned - out bunch and it's a struggle to make sure my two cameras are concealed .
Life as an estate agent is arduous .
We work six days a week , 12 hours a day .
We work together and socialise together , but we are also pitted against one another as we battle for deals .
It 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable .
Some Foxtons agents earn a basic salary of £ 10,000 - nowhere near enough to live in this trendy hub of west London populated by City high - fliers and celebrities .
The company demand that you live close to your office and they tell you it should take no longer than 40 minutes to get to work .
Clinching a deal is a necessity if you are to survive , and some agents will do whatever it takes .
Faking documents
In another Foxtons office , lettings staff jump up and down in delight after they successfully fake a signature on an absent landlord 's paperwork .
Faking documents is something of a habit in the St John 's Wood office , where Emma Clarke worked undercover in the lettings department .
I was shocked when she played me her secret footage which showed staff cutting , pasting and gluing signatures onto contracts .
They call it " chop chop " .
Relentless
Nothing prepared me for working at Foxtons .
It 's not just a job - it 's a way of life .
Rewards include booze - filled weekends away with management and a weekly breakfast club where you have the dubious pleasure of dining at 7.30 am with your bosses .
The staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car
The pressure is relentless and even on your one day off , your company mobile buzzes as head office texts you new property details .
Staff turnover is high and new recruits quickly burn out .
The staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car .
I spoke to a number of former employees who told me about the intense pressure and how it made agents behave .
Only one former employee would help us with our investigation , and even he refused to waive his anonymity because he too feared reprisals .
When we revealed our findings to Jon Hunt , his lawyers threatened Emma and me with personal lawsuits and even hand - delivered letters to our homes .
If they thought this would deter us from showing how his company works , they were wrong .
Lying
The undercover team also worked in a very different agency called Time2 Move .
The company 's three small offices are a far cry from the upmarket locations favoured by Jon Hunt .
But some of the practices are not dissimilar .
The maverick owner of T2M , Bruce Burkitt , was fined last year by the Office of Fair Trading after he failed to disclose that a member of his family had purchased a property .
So I went to see if the agency had cleaned up its act .
I got a job and within an hour of joining T2M , I was shown exactly how they sold their properties .
It was simple .
Once they value a property and get the owner to use their services , they then lie about offers they have n't had .
Then after a while , when the owner is utterly desperate to sell , they make up false offers well below the original valuation so the owner reduces the price .
The manager called it " price reduction hour " and " vendor care " - everyone else calls it lying .
There was no way I could join in with this " vendor care " and I was n't sure how long I would be able to maintain my cover .
T2 M were on high alert .
Something had made the manager jumpy and when I questioned the need to lie , he got suspicious and asked what newspaper I worked for .
His paranoia led to him reading one of my text messages - this time I was sacked .
Backhanders
I then joined ranks with a property developer who taught me some other tricks of the trade .
It was n't long before I found agents asking for cash backhanders in return for cheating owners out of tens of thousands of pounds .
He told me lots of agents would take a cash bung in return for getting properties at knock - down prices .
After just a few days trawling the high street agencies , we found one unscrupulous agent who asked for a £ 10,000 backhander to cheat a pensioner out of more than £ 50,000 .
The manager of a Chard estate agency branch in Fulham , west London , showed us round a flat worth more than £ 190,000 .
Yet if our developer was happy to grease his palm to the tune of £ 10,000 , he'd tell the owner to take the offer of £ 140,000 .
Deception
Months later , we found an agent willing to go to even further .
I was totally shocked when we were offered a fake identity in order to get a fraudulent mortgage .
We visited Primetime Mortgage and Property in north London and within minutes of our meeting we were offered a fake British passport , P60 forms and forged utility bills .
I still was n't convinced that he'd be able to come through with the passport .
But after one more meeting and £ 550 , we had a fake British passport in my name .
Perhaps , like in the United States , estate agents should be required to have a qualification
When we embarked upon the investigation , I would never have suspected that an estate agent would go to such lengths to make a sale .
There are more than 12,000 registered estate agencies in the UK , and not all of them are as murky as the ones I came across .
But during my eight - month investigation , I discovered a litany of dishonesty , deception , deceit and outright criminality .
The industry desperately needs better regulation and perhaps , like in the United States , estate agents should be required to have a qualification other than a sharp suit .
In response to the reports of the Whistleblower programme , Foxtons said : " Foxtons Limited and Alexander Hall Limited pride themselves on the professionalism and transparency of their respective businesses and has the utmost respect for the needs of its client and will always act in the client 's best interest .
" Foxtons has in place a rigorous training process , during which its employees are told repeatedly of their statutory and contractual duties , and the high standards expected of them . "
The programme also contacted Time2 Move about their manager .
He said : " I have no knowledge of your accusations and I have not acted inappropriately " .
He also stated that T2 M does not , and has never held a " price reduction hour " .
The Chard estate agency said : " We are shocked at these allegations and are grateful to the BBC for bringing them to our attention .
On learning of them , we 've taken immediate action to question the individual involved and then to suspend him .
We are now conducting a full investigation of the circumstances . "
A spokesman for Primetime Mortgage and Property said that a member of staff had been suspended while the matter was being fully investigated , and that they were not aware of any illegal practices .
He said the company prided itself on providing an efficient , honest and high standard of service to its clients .
Whistleblower is broadcast on BBC One , Tuesday 21 March , 2100 GMT .
I have worked as a mortgage broker and I was appalled at the practices estate agents use to secure sales and their own income .
As a mortgage broker I could literally have been imprisoned for not looking after the interests of my clients , so how come estate agents can get away with it ?
In this day and age , unregulated estate agency is a complete anomaly and it's time the government took action !
The Mortgage Man , Chatham
Having been in estate agency in London for over eight years , I can confirm that this sort of thing goes on a hell of a lot in the industry .
During my time I have come across numerous negotiators who will happily sit on the phone and blatantly lie about what interest their property has been getting , putting forward ridiculously low offers that do n't exist in order to bring the price down and eventually achieve a quick and undervalued deal .
Managers too have happily condoned this approach , and in some cases have often over - valued a property to give false hope to the owner and to beat the opposition to the property , only for them to then focus on offers in some cases 40 % less than the asking price .
Mr Smith , London
I too have been at the sharp end of estate agent malpractice .
Had my father not personally known the owner of the property I now own , we would never have known the estate agent was withholding our offer .
This same estate agent had also conspired to defraud a friend years ago , withholding offers .
She only found out when she got a friend to put in a fake offer and it was n't passed on .
I also have a builder friend who told me it is common practice for estate agents to take ' bungs ' to lower the price on a property .
I will never trust an estate agent again .
Chris , Hartlepool
An agent tried to get more money out of me after finding out what mortgage I was getting from " independent " financial advisor who worked at the same office .
Steve , Exeter
When I sold my London flat I got four estate agents to value it .
There was a 22 % difference between the lowest and highest quotes which made me quite suspicious of some of the methods which might be employed by the company at the expensive end of the scale .
I still have sleepless nights thinking about the poor person who eventually bought it as I know they paid far too much .
But as long as the industry continues to largely unregulated what is the individual to do , other than attempt to protect their own interests ?
Ian , Kingston
Seems to me that a complete overhaul of the way in which we buy and sell property is needed with a view to eliminating the involvement of the estate agent from the financial elements of the transaction .
Martin Stanton , Lutterworth
It 's incredible that in Britain consumers have more rights when they buy a toaster than they do when they buy a house - probably the biggest purchase they will ever make .
The industry needs reforming and regulating and fraudulent practices must be punished with prison sentences just like any other sort of fraud .
Hopefully the investigation done by Anna and Emma will bring this about very soon .
Michael Jamieson
I worked for a large , nationwide chain of estate agents for a number of years .
There was always rigourous training and , to my knowledege , none of the above scams were carried out .
The industry needs regulating with stiff fines for non-compliers .
Sam , Hull
The behaviour in this " self regulated " industry can only be changed through punitive fines because it is all about money for the agents .
Recently had my accepted offer gazumped through the activity of unscrupulous estate agent .
Gazumped , Reading
As a first time buyer I was unfortunate to have experienced the way estate agents operate .
They acted more like con-men rather than estate agents .

The creators of the South Park cartoon series are unrepentant about a new episode that shows Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin attending a party in Hell with a stingray barb protruding from his chest .
Irwin died just eight weeks ago when a stingray barb pierced his heart as he was filming off the north Queensland coast .
The South Park episode , which had been scheduled for broadcast in the US on Wednesday , is expected to upset Irwin fans and his family - wife Terri and children Bindi and Bob .

Every year , millions of people use services like eHarmony and Match.com hoping to find romance by answering a questionnaire and spending a little cash .
If all goes well , the computer will serve as Cupid and maybe you ’ll find happiness with that someone special .
The road to today ’s computer assisted matchmaking began much earlier than most people realize⁠ — in the 1960s .
Two Harvard undergraduates were talking on a dateless Saturday night over a few drinks .
Jeff Tarr and Vaughn Morrill came up with a far - out idea : use a newfangled computer to arrange compatible dates .
Thus was born Operation Match , and as Tarr recalls , “ The goal was not to make money but to have some fun and to meet some attractive ladies ”
David Crump and Douglas Ginsburg ( a future Supreme Court nominee ) aided Tarr and Morrill in creating a questionnaire .
The questionnaire ran several pages and asked everything from height and weight statistics to how a person would react to a hypothetical situation .
Here ’s a sample of one of the questions :
Your roommate gets you a blind date for the big dance .
Good - looking your roommate says .
When you meet your date , you are sure it ’s your roommate who is blind – your date is friendly , but embarrassingly unattractive .
You :
(1) Suggest going to a movie instead
(2) Monopolize your roommate ’s date leaving your roommate with only one noble alternative .
(3) Dance with your date , smiling weakly , but end the evening as early as possible .
(4) Act very friendly the whole time and run the risk of getting trapped into a second date .
The group believed that opposites do n’t attract , that attitudinal likenesses do attract and physical looks that are consistent with expectations also attract .
The questionnaire they wrote was both scientific and whimsical and billed as fun to fill out .
Respondents paid $ 3 to participate .
The students knew nothing about computers .
Tarr paid $ 100 to a computer science student to write program code designed to match up questionnaires .
Being 1966 , all the data from the questionnaires were transferred to punch cards .
The team then rented a room - sized computer , an Avco 1790 , on which they were allowed to work with from 2 am to 4 am .
It took six weeks to produce a match list .
Questionnaire respondents then received a letter saying who they were matched to , with phone numbers .
The idea of using a computer for romance worked positively and negatively in the mid 60s .
There was a belief that using computers would take all of the romance out of dating .
But the use computers at that time seemed very modern and very cutting - edge .
The questionnaire evolved over the years with the toughest question to deal with always being : “ How good looking are you ? ” .
Ugly people tended to say they were good looking , and good looking people would say they were ugly .
Thanks to publicity in Look Magazine and appearances on a few television shows Operation Match continued to grow .
The first year the service ended up with 7,800 respondents from Harvard , Vassar , Smith and Mt. Holyoke .
Every letter contained the $ 3 matchmaking fee .
By 1968 Operation Match had solicited more a million respondents and mail was coming from colleges nationwide .
But the service was not making a profit .
Eventually Operation Match ( and its parent company Compatibility Research Inc. ) were bought up by investors who used the technology to match up college roommates .
Jeff
Tarr went on to become the chairman of a New York risk - arbitrage firm and Vaughn Morrill went on to a 31 year career as a science teacher in St. Louis .
The idea of computer dating was an idea before its time .
When the personal computer became commonplace people were less resistant to electronic matchmaking .
The introduction of the Internet also accelerated the creation of many new dating services with customers numbering in the tens of millions .
They all run on essentially the same principles as Operation Match only with more sophistication … and no punch cards .
The document , a transcript of a meeting with Tony Blair in April 2004 , is already the subject of an unprecedented official secrets prosecution in Britain , against an aide to one of the MPs and another man .
David Keogh , a Cabinet Office employee , is charged with leaking information damaging to international relations to Leo O'Connor , researcher to Tony Clarke , former MP for Northampton South .
The two are due to appear in court today for committal hearings .
The document was obtained by Mr Clarke , who in turn consulted his parliamentary colleague , Peter Kilfoyle .
The two politicians later decided to pass on part of the contents to a contact in the US .
Mr Kilfoyle , MP for Liverpool Walton and a former defence minister , said last night : " It 's very odd we have n't been prosecuted .
My colleague Tony Clarke is guilty of discussing it with me and I have discussed it with all and sundry . "
Asked if he had broken the act , he said : " I do n't know .
But I 'd be very pleased if Her Majesty 's finest approached me about it . "
Mr Clarke said : " I believe my ex-employee did little wrong . "
The two MPs decided in October 2004 to reveal the key information in the transcript to John Latham , a Democrat supporter living in San Diego , California .
They hoped to influence the impending 2004 US election , Mr Kilfoyle said .
In San Diego , Mr Latham , 71 , a retired electrical engineer and a " contributing member " to the Democrat national committee , told the Guardian : " I was kind of amazed and concerned when I heard about it . "
The MPs also wanted him to send letters with the information to newspapers in Los Angeles and New York , he added .
At a Commons meeting , he had been introduced to Mr Clarke by Mr Kilfoyle .
Mr Latham , a British expatriate , and Mr Kilfoyle had attended the same school .
Mr Latham said he had never met Mr Clarke before .
" He mentioned that the document was a transcript of a meeting in Washington DC between Bush and Blair .
There had been a proposal to take military action against al - Jazeera at their headquarters in Qatar .
This was defused by Colin Powell , US secretary of state , and Tony Blair , thank goodness . "
Mr Latham was appalled .
" I thought that President Bush must be in the early stages of paranoia . "
But it was decided not to write to US newspapers at the time .
It is understood Democrats feared Mr Bush 's behaviour , if exposed , might win him votes , rather than lose them .
As a result , the facts remained secret for more than a year .
Within days of the charges being brought against Mr Keogh and Mr O'Connor , however , information in the memo was published by the Daily Mirror .
Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , threatened other newspapers with the Official Secrets Act if they re-published .
Mr Kilfoyle says Mr Clarke - then still a Labour MP - consulted him after first receiving the transcript .
" He told me what was in it .
He agonised and was very nervous .
He decided the right thing to do was to return it to Downing Street . "
But police then arrested Mr O'Connor and the two politicians decided they should try to reveal the memo's contents in the US .
The Bush - Blair meeting took place when Whitehall officials , intelligence officers , and British military commanders were expressing outrage at the scale of the US assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja , in which up to 1,000 civilians are feared to have died .
Pictures of the attack shown on al - Jazeera had infuriated US generals .
A second , Foreign Office , document leaked in May 2004 , exposed the misgivings within the British government .
That memo said : " Heavy - handed US military tactics in Falluja and Najaf some weeks ago have fuelled both Sunni and Shi'ite opposition to the coalition , and lost us much public support inside Iraq . "
In 1971 , Defense Secretary Melvin Laird punctuated his plea to Congress for more cold war appropriations with a graphic display of information that revealed the nation on guard with 54 Titan and 1,000 Minuteman nuclear missiles , plus 30 strategic bomber squadrons .
In making his case , Mr. Laird exemplified the idea that a little transparency is no drawback in a democracy .
Thirty - five years later , the Bush administration , which has consistently demonstrated an extraordinary mania for secrecy , is blacking that public information out of history .
That ’s right : it has reclassified the number of missiles and bombers from the Nixon era as some fresh national security secret , even though historians and officials in the old Soviet Union long have had it available on their research shelves .
What strange compulsion drives such “ silly secrecy , ” as it is aptly described by officials of the National Security Archive , a nonprofit research library at George Washington University ?
The archive published a report on how retroactive the administration has become in its obsession with creating secrets out of interesting information .
The blacked - out missile and defense policy information dates to the 1960’s .
Soviet numbers are left untouched on the open record , while the old American armada is freshly cloaked .
What ’s next ?
Classifying Civil War ironclads and cannons ?
The missile blackout is the latest symptom of a deepening government illness .
National security has become the excuse for efforts to crack down on whistle - blowers and journalists dealing in such vital disclosures as the illicit eavesdropping on Americans .
Last spring the director of the National Archives objected to a reclassifying initiative undertaken by intelligence officials that caused 55,000 decades - old pages to vanish from the public record .
The process itself was labeled an official secret .
Celebrities often use their time in the public eye to bring awareness to important issues .
Ecorazzi exists to highlight the people making this effort for the environment and other causes .
At the same time , we get to have fun following celebrity gossip , with a " green " twist !
" There is no doubt that green is hot right now .
Hybrids and organic are the ' in thing ' , " said Ecorazzi co-founder Michael d'Estries .
" Celebrities are helping spread the message by incorporating ' green ' into their everyday lives and working to help others .
By highlighting their efforts , we are hoping to bring the green message to a more mainstream audience . "
Rebecca added , " It 's also just a great way to have fun .
We do n't need to take ourselves so seriously all of the time .
The environment is an important topic , but let 's face it , it can be boring or sometimes even depressing .
By taking the topic and mixing it up with celebrity gossip , we 're trying to give readers the best of both worlds . "
Monorail Modeling -
Puppy Mover Monorail
Page one of two
Model and Photos courtesy of James Horecka , January 2006 ( updated May 2007 )
Behold , the Puppy Mover Monorail !
This is certainly one of the most unique models we have ever featured , is n't it ?
It all started as a joke idea from the whacky , yet creative mind of TMS member James Horecka , while enjoying lunch on a Friday afternoon .
James thought it would be funny to make a PRT , or Puppy Rapid Transit vehicle , and send a picture to TMS headquarters for a laugh .
Quickly the concept grew beyond a single car PRT vehicle into a monorail train full of puppies !
By 3 PM that afternoon , parts were being purchased for the project .
James is one of those rare people that actually takes his inventive ideas and builds something with them .
That same Friday , from 5 PM to 10 PM , James built the entire train and track .
Here we are in the beam fabrication yard .
That 's funny , it looks very similar to the vehicle assembly plant , does n't it ?
That 's Shirley helping James laminate a curved piece of track .
On Saturday the train went through an extensive painting process .
As you 'll see in James ' own words below , on average the train has eight coats of paint !
On Sunday lettering was applied to the train and time had arrived for the photo shoot .
Volunteer Parker helps place one of the trains on the beam while bellows are attached .
The photo shoot took place around noon on Sunday , a mere two days after conception !
Native American Indian
Dogs were put into place and voila , another famous monorail was born .
This image shows minimal passengers per car , where the one at the top of this page shows crush - loading .
The following is a " How To " summary courtesy of the model 's creator : I threw the " Puppy Mover Monorail " together Friday and Saturday .
I did it " Hollywood style " ( only what would be " in camera " is finished .
So the whole thing is pretty much a " prop . "
If you were to look at it from the back side , you 'd see a few " boxes " made of scrap wood stuck atop a couple of stakes .
The goal was to knock something out quick and dirty , stuff it with the last five puppies before they shipped out , and then shoot it ( we started with ten puppies , now down to five , and they 're gettin ' bigger by the day ) .
We have only two photos with the five puppies ; the very first one was a hit .
Here 's a quick summary of the parts .
It 's basically just a few fence palings , some scrap wood and paint :
Monorail train bodies : Total of three pieces of 1x6 " x 6 ' long redwood dog -eared fence boards .
Monorail train skirts : Two pieces total of 1x4 " x 6 ' long cedar dog -eared fence boards .
A third piece was used for the transoms .
Bellows between cars : Cardstock ( same as index cards , only 8.5 " x 11 " sheets ) , folded , hit with gray primer and stuck on with masking tape .
Lettering : 1 " vinyl " mailbox " letters ( which I 'd bought a few days before to letter my rural mailbox ) .
TMS Logo : JPG image printed out and stuck on with a glue stick ( used with permission of TMS ) .
Beamway : Five pieces of redwood benderboard , left over from edging my rose garden in 1988 , sprung into an arc with a nylon strap tie and then screwed together with pairs of drywall screws 4 " o.c. ( and a bunch o' screws near each end just in case ) .
Pylons : Scrap 2x2s , 4 ' long each , ends pointed and driven into the ground .
Only two faces were painted , of course .
Miscellaneous : Scrap tin for connectors and such .
Auto body filler .
A couple of strips of bevel - cut mat board to trim the beamway .
Various screws and such ( mostly drywall screws , a few Tek screws , some pneumatic brads ) .
The concept sketches were laid down over lunch on Friday .
They were pretty darn funny , so we laughed and went with it .
All the basic design , fabrication and construction of the wood train and track was done after work on Friday .
All painting was done on Saturday .
About eight coats average , perhaps a dozen in some places .
Lots of sanding , too , of course .
Most coats of paint were quick - dry sandable primers ( two types ) .
The body is a gloss white enamel ( two coats ) .
The skirting is hammered - finish galvanizing paint .
The accent stripe is gloss hunter green .
Masking was done with a fast - mask tool ( tape / paper combo ) .
The camera angle was decided at the very beginning , before construction .
So everything that would not show on film was left raw and unfinished .
In fact , the " back sides " are pretty gnarly , including some cutting errors , a few piles of sheet metal shims , tape , thumb tacks , knot holes , cracked wood , crooked screws and even bent nails !
This is similar to the techniques used for stage sets and props for film .
These tricks cut total fabrication time to just a matter of hours .

Architect April 2006 Update :
Puppy Mover Monorail grows !
Mr. Horecka has expanded the Puppy Mover Monorail to a larger five - car train .
He 's also added some track for the display .
Here 's a fresh batch of puppies onboard the new train .
James tells us that it 's quite an experience setting up a shot with " active " puppies !
As always , James does quality work !
Note the upgraded paint job detailing .

Middle Class Squeeze Continues
I 've been discussed the declining middle class for some time now -- see The Disconnect and Economic Classes for a more detailed chat on the subject .
I 'll have more on this later in the week -- but for now , I wanted to throw up some charts up .
I always snicker when I hear a politico scratch their head about why the opinion polls are so negative , despite " good growth and low unemployment . "
Aside from the fact those stats are somewhat " gamed , " we also know there are additional issues .
Consider our modern bad habits -- excess consumption , too much debt , too little security -- of all types .
Its no wonder much of the middle class is less than enthralled with the present environment :

And of course , there is this picture of the relative share of aggregate income received my the middle 60 % of households versus the top fifth ( the bottom fifth is a rounding error ; ah , poverty ) .
There is a discontinuity in the series ; look around it .
It results from the census raising its cap on recorded incomes to $ 1 m .

Ashlee Simpson appeared on the July cover of Marie Claire magazine extolling the virtues of appreciating one ’s body as it is — then she had a nose job .
Marie Claire readers erupted in fury at what they said was Ms. Simpson ’s hypocrisy and the magazine ’s “ cluelessness . ”
They wrote 1,000 letters in protest to the magazine , according to Joanna Coles , the new editor of the magazine .
And she agreed with them .
In the first issue ( due Aug. 15 ) over which she exercises full editorial control , Ms. Coles gives expanded space in the letters column to readers to vent against Ms. Simpson .
Ms. Coles adds in a note : “ We ’re dazed and confused — and disappointed — by her choice , too ! ”
Rare is the day when the editor of a women ’s magazine will openly criticize a celebrity .
But Ms. Coles is planting a flag : A new Marie Claire is in town and it is making a clean break with its past .
No girly goo , no teeny - bopper covers , no blind obedience to the traditional rules of the road .
After reading this article on the earth running out of resources , I discovered another article from the archives of the Coyote Broadsheet , a predecessor of this blog written by one of my distant relatives , dated April 17 , 1870 :
As the US Population reaches toward the astronomical total of 40 million persons , we are reaching the limits of the number of people this earth can support .
If one were to extrapolate current population growth rates , this country in a hundred years could have over 250 million people in it !
Now of course , that figure is impossible - the farmland of this country could n't possibly support even half this number .
But it is interesting to consider the environmental consequences .
Take the issue of transportation .
Currently there are over 11 million horses in this country , the feeding and care of which constitute a significant part of our economy .
A population of 250 million would imply the need for nearly 70 million horses in this country , and this is even before one considers the fact that " horse intensity " , or the average number of horses per family , has been increasing steadily over the last several decades .
It is not unreasonable , therefore , to assume that so many people might need 100 million horses to fulfill all their transportation needs .
There is just no way this admittedly bountiful nation could support 100 million horses .
The disposal of their manure alone would create an environmental problem of unprecedented magnitude .
Or , take the case of illuminant .
As the population grows , the demand for illuminant should grow at least as quickly .
However , whale catches and therefore whale oil supply has leveled off of late , such that many are talking about the " peak whale " phenomena , which refers to the theory that whale oil production may have already passed its peak .
250 million people would use up the entire supply of the world 's whales four or five times over , leaving none for poorer nations of the world .

We 've also been asked to demonstrate , as well as present a paper , at the Joint European Networking Conference ( JENC3 ) in Innsbruck , Austria , in May .

Using an electronic scanner , the researchers found that the monks were producing a very strong pattern of gamma waves , a synchronized oscillation of brain cells that is associated with concentration and emotional control .
A group of 10 college students who were learning to meditate produced a much weaker gamma signal .
Taken together , the studies suggest that " human qualities like compassion and altruism may in some sense be regarded as skills which can be improved through mental training , " said Dr. Davidson , who is director of the Laboratory for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin .
Yet the neuroscientists who have signed the petition say that there are several problems with this research .
First , they say , Dr. Davidson and some of his colleagues meditate themselves , and they have collaborated with the Dalai Lama for years .
Dr. Davidson said he helped persuade the spiritual leader to accept the society 's invitation to speak , and was with him when he received the request .
The critics also point out that there are flaws in the 2004 experiment that the researchers have acknowledged :
The monks being studied were 12 to 45 years older than the students , and age could have accounted for some of the differences .
The students , as beginners , may have been anxious or simply not skilled enough to find a meditative state in the time allotted , which would alter their brain wave patterns .
And there was no way to know if the monks were adept at generating high gamma wave activity before they ever started meditating .
" This paper has not tested the idea whether meditation promotes compassion or any kind of positive emotion , " Dr. Yi Rao , a neuroscientist at Northwestern University who helped draft the petition and was one of the sharpest critics , said in an e-mail message .
" Nonetheless , advocates of Buddhism and meditation have confused the public with the claim that this idea has received scientific proof , " Dr. Rao said .
" If one reads the published scientific literature , it is not difficult to see that this claim is far from being proven .
It will not hurt if the public also realizes that some researchers are declared believers playing dual roles as advocates and researchers . "
In a telephone interview , Dr. Davidson said that the critics ' assertions were overblown , given that the field of study was in its infancy and the studies so far had been exploratory .
When was the last time you actually bent down and picked up that penny you dropped ?
The U.S. penny is on its way to extinction so it 's time to bid farewell to the basic coin and share with you an inflationary " penny for your thoughts " .
What is a penny worth ?
The price of metals
The penny 's composition has changed over the 219 years it has been in circulation : From 1787 to 1837 the composition of the penny was pure copper ; From 1837 to 1857 , the penny was made of bronze ( 95 percent copper and 5 percent tin and zinc ) ;
From 1857 , the penny was 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel ; The Cent became bronze again ( 95 percent copper and 5 percent tin and zinc ) in 1864 and stayed that way until 1962 ;
In 1962 , the cent 's zinc content was removed .
Then , in 1982 , the composition of the penny was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and only 2.5 percent copper .
( This information was taken from the United States Mint website )
You may be wondering why the United States had to switch from a penny that consisted of mostly copper , to one that is almost all zinc .
Well , before 1982 the old copper coin weighed 3.1 grams .
100 coins or $ 1.00 worth weighed 310 grams .
Since a pound is about 453 grams , 100 pennies at 310/453 = .68 pound .
Today , at $ 3.45 a pound for copper , 100 of those 1982 mostly copper pennies are worth about $ 2.35 .
The U.S. government , which is in the business of " making money " , has done a fabulous job of profiting on this coin .
Since 1982 , they 've used an inexpensive copper ( zinc ) as something of greater value ( copper ) in the minting of the penny .
With inflation today , even the zinc in the penny is now worth more than the penny itself .
It actually pays to take your paper money to the bank and exchange it for pennies , then sell them for scrap .
I guess the time has really come to stop making these coins .
What is a penny worth ?
The impact of inflation
But the real story behind the now - worthless penny is , by far , the surge in inflation .
If the core inflation rate is , indeed , only 2.6 percent , and the year - over - year increase in the CPI is 4.3 percent , I wish someone would explain why my household expenses have gone up so much : Household expense % increase Health insurance 23 % Property insurance 40 % Property taxes 19 % Utilities 15 % Gas 25 % Postage 7 %
This does n't even include the following : the cost of groceries or prescription drugs ; take - out food can cost as much as eating out ; parking garages in a city like New York are charging $ 10 more a day to park , reaching $ 40 a day in some garages ; newspapers are shrinking to stay in business because the cost of paper is so high , they need to use less of it .
( Circulation is also down as many former subscribers now read the news directly from their computers ) .
Bush Cheney Cold War on Iran
The Cheney - Bush administration was blocked from attacking Iran during their second term .
A significant faction of the intelligence agencies and generals in the US and Israel were opposed - not out of humanitarian considerations , but that this would increase the havoc in the region , which risks devastating consequences .
Trump and his backers are aiming for a second shot at full scale war , but a decade after Cheney and Netayahu failed to launch full scale war the precariousness of the global economy 's dependence on Middle East oil is even more severe .
While there are too many variables , it seems unlikely that the US can attack Iran in a full scale war .
There is no elasticity in the oil system any more .
There is no more untapped capacity in any country to bridge the gap of Iran 's shutdown .
Iran 's military could retaliate in many ways .
Iran 's Navy would probably try to disrupt oil flows through the Straits of Hormuz .
Perhaps Iran would launch a ( conventionally armed ) missile at the Saudi oil export terminal at Ras Tanura , just across the Gulf from Iran .
If that ever happens , it would blow up the whole global economy , without nuclear weapons .
Europe , Japan , China , India and other industrialized giga - economies are completely dependent on this strategic flow , despite pledges to become carbon neutral some day ( perhaps as the oil fields are depleted ) .
Hopefully the more " realist " faction of the US establishment / deep state / military industrial intelligence complex will prevail over the crazies who want to do to Iran what was done to Iraq .
In some planners ' minds , accelerating chaos throughout the region could permit the oil empire to use ethnic and religious difference to draw a new Middle East map .
Iran war plan : impeachable
" The degree to which this President [ Bush ] continues to take steps to go to war against Iran without consulting with the full Congress is the degree to which he is increasingly putting himself in jeopardy of an impeachment proceeding . "
-- Representative Dennis Kucinich
http://kucinich.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=56365
Kucinich introduced a bill to impeach Bush and Cheney , but no member of Congress co-sponsored it .
Rep. Cynthia McKinney introduced a separate , similar bill which also had zero co-sponsors .
The Democratic Party leadership kicked both members out of Congress .
Kucinich 's district was gerrymandered to ensure his defeat .
McKinney had a more pliable African American primary challenger who was backed by both parties .
( Republicans knew they could not replace McKinney with a Republicans since the district is Democratic and African American . )
Perhaps if there had been impeachments of Bush and Cheney for threatening war on Iran , waging wars on Iraq and Afghanistan , along with their other war crimes , we would not now see the spectacle of the Trump administration escalation .
If there is ever Truth and Reconciliation in America , part of the inquiry could examine acquiescence of the Democrats to Republican war crimes .
Gary
Hart warned about a pretext to trigger a War on Iran
Former Senator and Presidential candidate Gary Hart was part of a study group before the 2000 " election " that was apparently the first place where the term " Homeland Security " was used .
It is interesting to see part of the foreign policy establishment warning against a Cheney / Bush pretext to attack Iran before January 20 , 2009 -- similar to Zbigniew Brzezinski's warning to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February 2007 .
Senator Hillary Clinton voted at the time of Hart 's editorial in support of a resolution accusing part of the Iranian military as a " terrorist " organization .
This was a dangerous escalation that gave the Bush administration more political cover to to attack Iran .
( Nearly all military forces are " terrorist " -- they use violence for political objectives . )

Unsolicited Advice to the Government of Iran
by Gary Hart
Posted September 26 , 2007 | 03:22 PM
( EST )
Presuming that you are not actually ignorant enough to desire war with the United States , you might be well advised to read the history of the sinking of the U.S.S. Maine in Havana harbor in 1898 and the history of the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 .
Having done so , you will surely recognize that Americans are reluctant to go to war unless attacked .
Until Pearl Harbor , we were even reluctant to get involved in World War II .
For historians of American wars the question is whether we provoke provocations .
Given the unilateral U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , you are obviously thinking the rules have changed .
Provocation is no longer required to take America to war .
But even in this instance , we were led to believe that the mass murderer of American civilians , Osama bin Laden , was lurking , literally or figuratively , in the vicinity of Baghdad .
Given all this , you would probably be well advised to keep your forces , including clandestine forces , as far away from the Iraqi border as you can .
You might even consider bringing in some neighbors to verify that you are not shipping arms next door .
Tone down the rhetoric on Zionism .
You 've established your credentials with those in your world who thrive on that .
If it makes you feel powerful to hurl accusations at the American eagle , have at it .
Sticks and stones , etc .
But , for the next sixteen months or so , you should not only not take provocative actions , you should not seem to be doing so .
For the vast majority of Americans who seek no wider war , in the Middle East or elsewhere , do n't tempt fate .
Do n't give a certain vice president we know the justification he is seeking to attack your country .
That is unless you happen to like having bombs fall on your head .

Why Bush wo n't attack Iran
Despite saber - rattling , and the Washington buzz that a strike is coming , the president does n't intend to bomb Iran .
Cheney may have other ideas .
By Steven Clemons
09/20/07 " Salon " -- -
During a recent high - powered Washington dinner party attended by 18 people , Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft squared off across the table over whether President Bush will bomb Iran .
Brzezinski , former national security advisor to President Carter , said he believed Bush 's team had laid a track leading to a single course of action : a military strike against Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Scowcroft , who was NSA to Presidents Ford and the first Bush , held out hope that the current President Bush would hold fire and not make an already disastrous situation for the U.S. in the Middle East even worse .
The 18 people at the party , including former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , then voted with a show of hands for either Brzezinski's or Scowcroft 's position .
Scowcroft got only two votes , including his own .
Everyone else at the table shared Brzezinski's fear that a U.S. strike against Iran is around the corner .

British academics warn US is preparing “ shock and awe ” attack on Iran
By Peter Symonds
11 September 2007
An 80 - page study written by two British security analysts and released on August 28 makes a chilling estimation of the overwhelming force that the US would use in the event of any attack on Iran .
“ The US has made military preparations to destroy Iran ’s WMD , nuclear energy , regime , armed forces , state apparatus and economic infrastructure within days , if not hours , of President George W. Bush giving the order , ” the paper declared .
The authors , Dr Dan Plesch and Martin Butcher , concluded on the basis of publicly available sources that “ US bombers and long range missiles are ready today to destroy 10,000 targets within Iran in a few hours .
US ground , air and marine forces already in the Gulf , Iraq and Afghanistan can devastate Iranian forces , the regime and the state at short notice . ”

Published : Tuesday August 28 , 2007
The United States has the capacity for and may be prepared to launch without warning a massive assault on Iranian uranium enrichment facilities , as well as government buildings and infrastructure , using long - range bombers and missiles , according to a new analysis .
The paper , " Considering a war with Iran : A discussion paper on WMD in the Middle East " – written by well - respected British scholar and arms expert Dr. Dan Plesch , Director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy of the School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) at the University of London , and Martin Butcher , a former Director of the British American Security Information Council ( BASIC ) and former adviser to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament – was exclusively provided to RAW STORY late Friday under embargo .

This is like Hitler 's Suicide Order from the Bunker
By Dave Lindorff
Created Feb 1 2007
This is madness !
I wrote last September that Bush was gearing up for war with Iran , as evidenced by the moving up of the deployment date of the carrier group headed by the recently re-fueled and re-armed USS Eisenhower , some of whose crewmembers had leaked that its mission was to attack Iran .
At the time , there was considerable skepticism expressed about the article , which appeared in the Nation ’s online edition .
Now , four months later , it is widely assumed in Europe that the U.S. is planning to attack Iran , and even in the U.S. , members of Congress are openly talking about their concern that Bush is planning to attack Iran .
....
Iran is the second largest oil producing country in the world , and it borders the entire eastern shore of the Persian Gulf , through which a third of the world ’s oil passes every year .
If it was attacked , all of Iran ’s oil , and most of the oil produced by Kuwait , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , would be taken out of circulation indefinitely .
Oil prices would soar way past $ 100 / barrel , and maybe past $ 200 a barrel , causing a U.S. and a global depression .
So why are we even talking about this ?
We ’re talking about this because the President of the United States , the Vice President , and the neoconservative political gang that has brought the nation six years of war , destruction and Constitution - wrecking , is under attack , and this cabal of madmen and mad women has decided that chaos , death and destruction offers the best hope of salvation .
We are , it appears , about to witness the American equivalent of Hitler ’s suicide orders to the German people as he scurried to his bunker in Berlin .
What to do ?
The answer is simple .
It is time for the Congress , and the American people , to act .
If Senators and Representatives pass a resolution barring the use of any military forces against Iran , or the expenditure of any funds for war against Iran , Bush will not be able to push the country over the precipice .
American military leaders would have reason to ignore any orders that would put them in violation of the law of the land .
This would be a historic moment — a reassertion by Congress of its Constitutional primacy in matters of war and peace .
Members of Congress should follow up that move by initiating impeachment proceedings against this whacko immediately .
Congress must not duck its patriotic duty .
President Clinton was impeached for a little blowjob .
This president wants to blow a hell of a lot more than an intern .
An attack on Iran would be an international crime under the Nuremberg Charter , which calls the invasion of a country that does n’t pose an immediate threat a “ Crime Against Peace . ”
But even aside from such matters , anyone with a lick of sense knows that it would be crazy to go into another even larger war while the American military is completely tied down in two other desperate situations .
The whole Bush administration has clearly gone stark raving mad , and is willing to sacrifice the nation for its own short - term gain .
This can not be allowed to happen .
No War against Iran !
Impeach the President now !

Iran Clock Is Ticking
By Robert Parry
January 31 , 2007
While congressional Democrats test how far they should go in challenging George W. Bush ’s war powers , the time may be running out to stop Bush from ordering a major escalation of the Middle East conflict by attacking Iran .
Military and intelligence sources continue to tell me that preparations are advancing for a war with Iran starting possibly as early as mid-to - late February .
The sources offer some differences of opinion over whether Bush might cite a provocation from Iran or whether Israel will take the lead in launching air strikes against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
But there is growing alarm among military and intelligence experts that Bush already has decided to attack and simply is waiting for a second aircraft carrier strike force to arrive in the region – and for a propaganda blitz to stir up some pro-war sentiment at home .
One well - informed U.S. military source called me in a fury after consulting with Pentagon associates and discovering how far along the war preparations are .
He said the plans call for extensive aerial attacks on Iran , including use of powerful bunker - busting ordnance .
Another source with a pipeline into Israeli thinking said the Iran war plan has expanded over the past several weeks .
Earlier thinking had been that Israeli warplanes would hit Iranian nuclear targets with U.S. forces in reserve in case of Iranian retaliation , but now the strategy anticipates a major U.S. military follow - up to an Israeli attack , the source said .
Both sources used the same word “ crazy ” in describing the plan to expand the war to Iran .
The two sources , like others I have interviewed , said that attacking Iran could touch off a regional – and possibly global – conflagration .
“ It will be like the TV show ‘ 24 ’ , ” the American military source said , citing the likelihood of Islamic retaliation reaching directly into the United States .
Though Bush insists that no decision has been made on attacking Iran , he offered similar assurances of his commitment to peace in the months before invading Iraq in 2003 .
Yet leaked documents from London made clear that he had set a course for war nine months to a year before the Iraq invasion .
In other words , Bush ’s statements that he has no plans to " invade " Iran and that he ’s still committed to settle differences with Iran over its nuclear program diplomatically should be taken with a grain of salt .
There is , of course , the possibility that the war preparations are a game of chicken to pressure Iran to accept outside controls on its nuclear program and to trim back its regional ambitions .
But sometimes such high - stakes gambles lead to miscalculations or set in motion dynamics that can't be controlled .

Name The False Flag Incident
William Rivers Pitt , in his piece A Cornered Animal : " Question :
What is the connection between a possible American attack on Iran and the perjury trial of I. Lewis Libby ?
Answer : Vice President Dick Cheney . "
Indeed .
Most people know that the real president has been Cheney , not the pretend self proclaimed Deciderer .
Some say Cheney has been Bush ' ventriloquist .
Some say they placed the Crawford moron in his position as a convenient lightning rod to deflect criticism for all the disasters we 've seen , as sort of an inside joke .
I would n't disagree .
But now because of the Libby trial Shooter 's garnering a lot of attention as being in the middle of treasonous activity .
It 's very possible that he may be forced to testify .
Cheney has stated publicly he wo n't , even if subpoenaed .
That would bring on a constitutional crisis and all hell would break loose .
One thing that 's written in granite in the fascist playbook is that things should always appear to happen externally to be capitalized politically , not vice versa .
Start wars , get the bump in polls .
Pull off 9/11 and pass fascist legislation .
Do n't get involved in dirty political brawls because it will weaken your ability to manipulate and control .
They 've had a free ride since Black Tuesday but with americans slowly coming out of their coma and the Libby thing threatening to expose lies and corruption , they need to knock their troubles off the front page .

Cheney Reportedly Rebuffed Iran Offer
The AP reports Lawrence Wilkerson , the former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , said Vice President Dick Cheney rejected " an Iranian offer to help the United States stabilize Iraq and end its military support for Hezbollah and Hamas " in 2003 .
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. , Wilkerson said the State Department was " open to the offer , which came in an unsigned letter sent shortly after the American invasion of Iraq . "
Wilkerson said State Department officials " thought it was a very propitious moment " to strike a deal , " but as soon as it got to the White House , and as soon as it got to the vice president 's office , the old mantra of ' We do n't talk to evil ' ... reasserted itself . "

Ominous Signs of a Wider War
Michael T. Klare
On January 5 Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that he was replacing Gen. John Abizaid as commander of the Central Command ( Centcom ) -- the body responsible for oversight of all US forces in Iraq , Afghanistan and the greater Middle East -- with Adm .
William Fallon , currently the commander of the Pacific Command ( Pacom ) .
Fallon is one of several senior officers recently appointed by Gates to oversee the new strategy for Iraq now being shaped by President Bush .
The choice of Fallon to replace Abizaid was highly unusual in several respects .
First , this is a lateral move for the admiral , not a promotion :
As head of Pacom , Fallon commanded a larger force than he will oversee at Centcom , and one over which he will exercise less direct control since all combat operations in Iraq will be under the supervision of Gen .
Dave Petraeus , the recently announced replacement for Gen. George Casey as commander of all US and allied forces .
Second , and more surprising , Fallon is a Navy man , with experience in carrier operations , while most of Centcom 's day - to - day work is on the ground , in the struggle against insurgents and warlords in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Part of the explanation for this move , of course , is a desire by the White House to sweep away bitter ground - force commanders like Abizaid and Casey who had opposed an increase in US troops in Iraq and argued for shifting greater responsibility for the fighting to Iraq forces , thereby permitting a gradual American withdrawal .
" The Baghdad situation requires more Iraqi troops , " not more Americans , Abizaid said in a recent interview with the New York Times .
For this alone , Abizaid had to go .
But there 's more to it .
Abizaid , who is of Lebanese descent and served a tour of duty with UN forces in Lebanon , has come to see the need for a regional solution to the crisis in Iraq - - one that inevitably requires some sort of engagement with Iran and Syria , as recommended by the Iraq Study Group .
" You have to internationalize the problem , you have to attack it diplomatically , geo- strategically , " he told the Times .
" You just can't apply a microscope on a particular problem in downtown Baghdad ... and say that somehow or another , if you throw enough military forces at it , you are going to solve the broader issues in the region of extremism . "
If engagement with Iran and Syria was even remotely on the agenda , Abizaid is exactly the man you 'd want on the job at Centcom overseeing US forces and strategy in the region .
But if that 's not on the agenda , if you 're thinking instead of using force against Iran and / or Syria , then Admiral Fallon is exactly the man you 'd want at Centcom .
Why ?
Because combined air and naval operations are his forte .
Fallon began his combat career as a Navy combat flyer in Vietnam , and he served with carrier - based forces for twenty - four years after that .
He commanded a carrier battle wing during the first Gulf War in 1991 and led the naval group supporting NATO operations during the Bosnia conflict four years later .
More recently , Fallon served as vice chief of naval operations before becoming the head of Pacom in 2005 .
All this means that he is primed to oversee an air , missile and naval attack on Iran , should the President give the green light for such an assault -- and the fact that Fallon has been moved from Pacom to Centcom means that such a move is very much on Bush 's mind .
The recent replacement of General Abizaid by Admiral Fallon , along with other recent moves announced by the Defense Secretary , should give deep pause to anyone concerned about the prospect of escalation in the Iraq War .
Contrary to the advice given by the Iraq Study Group , Bush appears to be planning for a wider war -- with much higher risk of catastrophic failure -- not a gradual and dignified withdrawal from the region .

Iran threatens to block strategic oil strait
TEHRAN : A senior officer in the volunteer Basij militia said on Monday Iran could block oil traffic through the strategic Strait of Hormuz if the West threatens its economy over Tehran ’s nuclear programme .
“ Given Iran ’s authority over the Strait of Hormuz , the passageway to more than 40 percent of the world ’s energy , we have become so strong that the world ’s economic and energy security are in the hands of Iran , ” deputy Basij commander General Majid Mir Ahmadi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency .
“ We can exert pressure on the US and British economies as much as we ourselves are put under pressure , ” he said .
“ US allies , especially those who host US military sites or facilitate American strategies against us , are exposed to our threat , ” Mir Ahmadi added .
“ This is the Islamic republic ’s strategy in the Persian Gulf – security for everyone or for nobody . ”
Meanwhile , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that Tehran would never yield to international pressure to deprive it of its right to nuclear technology , state radio said .
“ The Iranian nation will surely not abandon its right and Iranian officials have no right to deprive the nation of its right , ” Khamenei was quoted as saying on the occasion of the Shia feast of Eidul Ghadir .
Khamenei , who was shown on television , was making his first public appearance since rumours appeared on websites on Thursday that he had died .
Iran last week denied the reports .
Khamenei has final say on all state matters in the Islamic republic , including Iran ’s nuclear standoff with the West .

How to Lose an Army
Plow deep into Iraq and dare Iran to strike .
by William S. Lind
... what do the results of the election mean for a prospective attack on Iran ?
On the surface , the Democrats ’ seizure of both houses of Congress would seem to be good news .
Having won their majorities because the American people want out of a war , they ought to be reluctant to jump into a second one .
Regrettably , that logic may be too simple .
Because an attack on Iran will be launched with no warning , the Bush administration will not have to consult Congress beforehand .
Congress could take the initiative and forbid such an attack preemptively ( “ no funds may be expended … ” ) .
But in an imperial capital where court politics count far more than the nation ’s interests , Democrats may prefer to risk a second war , and a second debacle , rather than open themselves up to a charge of being weak on terrorism .
....
If the U.S. were to lose the army it has in Iraq to Iraqi militias , Iranian regular forces , or a combination of both , cutting our one line of supply and then encircling us , the world would change .
It would be our Adrianople , our Rocroi , our Stalingrad .
American power and prestige would never recover .
Nothing , not even Israel ’s demands , should lead us to run this risk , which is inherent in any attack on Iran .
There is one action , a possibility opened by the Democrats ’ electoral victory , that would stop the Bush administration from launching such an attack or allowing Israel to do so .
If our senior military leaders , especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff , would go public with their opposition to such an adventure , the new Democratic majority in Congress would have to react .
The public that put it in office on an antiwar platform would compel it to answer or lose all credibility .
While the Joint Chiefs would infuriate the White House , they would receive the necessary political cover from the new Democratic Congress .
The potential is there , for the generals and the Democrats alike . ]
For it to be realized , and the disaster of war with Iran to be averted , all the generals must do is show some courage .
If the Joint Chiefs keep silent now and allow the folly of an attack on Iran to go forward , they will share in full the moral responsibility for the results , which may include the loss of an army .

The Proposed Iranian Oil Bourse
by Krassimir Petrov
I. Economics of Empires A nation - state taxes its own citizens , while an empire taxes other nation - states .
The history of empires , from Greek and Roman , to Ottoman and British , teaches that the economic foundation of every single empire is the taxation of other nations .
The imperial ability to tax has always rested on a better and stronger economy , and as a consequence , a better and stronger military .
One part of the subject taxes went to improve the living standards of the empire ; the other part went to strengthen the military dominance necessary to enforce the collection of those taxes .
Historically , taxing the subject state has been in various forms — usually gold and silver , where those were considered money , but also slaves , soldiers , crops , cattle , or other agricultural and natural resources , whatever economic goods the empire demanded and the subject - state could deliver .
Historically , imperial taxation has always been direct : the subject state handed over the economic goods directly to the empire .
For the first time in history , in the twentieth century , America was able to tax the world indirectly , through inflation .
It did not enforce the direct payment of taxes like all of its predecessor empires did , but distributed instead its own fiat currency , the U.S. Dollar , to other nations in exchange for goods with the intended consequence of inflating and devaluing those dollars and paying back later each dollar with less economic goods — the difference capturing the U.S. imperial tax .
Here is how this happened .
Early in the 20th century , the U.S. economy began to dominate the world economy .
The U.S. dollar was tied to gold , so that the value of the dollar neither increased , nor decreased , but remained the same amount of gold .
The Great Depression , with its preceding inflation from 1921 to 1929 and its subsequent ballooning government deficits , had substantially increased the amount of currency in circulation , and thus rendered the backing of U.S. dollars by gold impossible .
This led Roosevelt to decouple the dollar from gold in 1932 .
Up to this point , the U.S. may have well dominated the world economy , but from an economic point of view , it was not an empire .
The fixed value of the dollar did not allow the Americans to extract economic benefits from other countries by supplying them with dollars convertible to gold .
Economically , the American Empire was born with Bretton Woods in 1945 .
The U.S. dollar was not fully convertible to gold , but was made convertible to gold only to foreign governments .
This established the dollar as the reserve currency of the world .
It was possible , because during WWII , the United States had supplied its allies with provisions , demanding gold as payment , thus accumulating significant portion of the world ’s gold .
An Empire would not have been possible if , following the Bretton Woods arrangement , the dollar supply was kept limited and within the availability of gold , so as to fully exchange back dollars for gold .
However , the guns- and - butter policy of the 1960 ’s was an imperial one : the dollar supply was relentlessly increased to finance Vietnam and LBJ ’s Great Society .
Most of those dollars were handed over to foreigners in exchange for economic goods , without the prospect of buying them back at the same value .
The increase in dollar holdings of foreigners via persistent U.S. trade deficits was tantamount to a tax — the classical inflation tax that a country imposes on its own citizens , this time around an inflation tax that U.S. imposed on rest of the world .
When in 1970 - 1971 foreigners demanded payment for their dollars in gold , The U.S. Government defaulted on its payment on August 15 , 1971 .
While the popular spin told the story of “ severing the link between the dollar and gold ” , in reality the denial to pay back in gold was an act of bankruptcy by the U.S. Government .
Essentially , the U.S. declared itself an Empire .
It had extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the rest of the world , with no intention or ability to return those goods , and the world was powerless to respond — the world was taxed and it could not do anything about it .
From that point on , to sustain the American Empire and to continue to tax the rest of the world , the United States had to force the world to continue to accept ever - depreciating dollars in exchange for economic goods and to have the world hold more and more of those depreciating dollars .
It had to give the world an economic reason to hold them , and that reason was oil .
In 1971 , as it became clearer and clearer that the U.S Government would not be able to buy back its dollars in gold , it made in 1972 - 73 an iron - clad arrangement with Saudi Arabia to support the power of the House of Saud in exchange for accepting only U.S. dollars for its oil .
The rest of OPEC was to follow suit and also accept only dollars .
Because the world had to buy oil from the Arab oil countries , it had the reason to hold dollars as payment for oil .
Because the world needed ever increasing quantities of oil at ever increasing oil prices , the world ’s demand for dollars could only increase .
Even though dollars could no longer be exchanged for gold , they were now exchangeable for oil .
The economic essence of this arrangement was that the dollar was now backed by oil .
As long as that was the case , the world had to accumulate increasing amounts of dollars , because they needed those dollars to buy oil .
As long as the dollar was the only acceptable payment for oil , its dominance in the world was assured , and the American Empire could continue to tax the rest of the world .
If , for any reason , the dollar lost its oil backing , the American Empire would cease to exist .
Thus , Imperial survival dictated that oil be sold only for dollars .
It also dictated that oil reserves were spread around various sovereign states that were n’t strong enough , politically or militarily , to demand payment for oil in something else .
If someone demanded a different payment , he had to be convinced , either by political pressure or military means , to change his mind .
The man that actually did demand Euro for his oil was Saddam Hussein in 2000 .
At first , his demand was met with ridicule , later with neglect , but as it became clearer that he meant business , political pressure was exerted to change his mind .
When other countries , like Iran , wanted payment in other currencies , most notably Euro and Yen , the danger to the dollar was clear and present , and a punitive action was in order .
Bush ’s Shock - and - Awe in Iraq was not about Saddam ’s nuclear capabilities , about defending human rights , about spreading democracy , or even about seizing oil fields ; it was about defending the dollar , ergo the American Empire .
It was about setting an example that anyone who demanded payment in currencies other than U.S. Dollars would be likewise punished .
Many have criticized Bush for staging the war in Iraq in order to seize Iraqi oil fields .
However , those critics can’t explain why Bush would want to seize those fields — he could simply print dollars for nothing and use them to get all the oil in the world that he needs .
He must have had some other reason to invade Iraq .
History teaches that an empire should go to war for one of two reasons : ( 1 ) to defend itself or ( 2 ) benefit from war ; if not , as Paul Kennedy illustrates in his magisterial The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers , a military overstretch will drain its economic resources and precipitate its collapse .
Economically speaking , in order for an empire to initiate and conduct a war , its benefits must outweigh its military and social costs .
Benefits from Iraqi oil fields are hardly worth the long - term , multi - year military cost .
Instead , Bush must have went into Iraq to defend his Empire .
Indeed , this is the case : two months after the United States invaded Iraq , the Oil for Food Program was terminated , the Iraqi Euro accounts were switched back to dollars , and oil was sold once again only for U.S. dollars .
No longer could the world buy oil from Iraq with Euro .
Global dollar supremacy was once again restored .
Bush descended victoriously from a fighter jet and declared the mission accomplished — he had successfully defended the U.S. dollar , and thus the American Empire .
II .
Iranian Oil Bourse
The Iranian government has finally developed the ultimate “ nuclear ” weapon that can swiftly destroy the financial system underpinning the American Empire .
That weapon is the Iranian Oil Bourse slated to open in March 2006 .
It will be based on a euro - oil - trading mechanism that naturally implies payment for oil in Euro .
In economic terms , this represents a much greater threat to the hegemony of the dollar than Saddam ’s , because it will allow anyone willing either to buy or to sell oil for Euro to transact on the exchange , thus circumventing the U.S. dollar altogether .
If so , then it is likely that almost everyone will eagerly adopt this euro oil system :
The Europeans will not have to buy and hold dollars in order to secure their payment for oil , but would instead pay with their own currencies .
The adoption of the euro for oil transactions will provide the European currency with a reserve status that will benefit the European at the expense of the Americans .
The Chinese and the Japanese will be especially eager to adopt the new exchange , because it will allow them to drastically lower their enormous dollar reserves and diversify with Euros , thus protecting themselves against the depreciation of the dollar .
One portion of their dollars they will still want to hold onto ; a second portion of their dollar holdings they may decide to dump outright ; a third portion of their dollars they will decide to use up for future payments without replenishing those dollar holdings , but building up instead their euro reserves .
The Russians have inherent economic interest in adopting the Euro – the bulk of their trade is with European countries , with oil - exporting countries , with China , and with Japan .
Adoption of the Euro will immediately take care of the first two blocs , and will over time facilitate trade with China and Japan .
Also , the Russians seemingly detest holding depreciating dollars , for they have recently found a new religion with gold .
Russians have also revived their nationalism , and if embracing the Euro will stab the Americans , they will gladly do it and smugly watch the Americans bleed .
The Arab oil - exporting countries will eagerly adopt the Euro as a means of diversifying against rising mountains of depreciating dollars .
Just like the Russians , their trade is mostly with European countries , and therefore will prefer the European currency both for its stability and for avoiding currency risk , not to mention their jihad against the Infidel Enemy .
Only the British will find themselves between a rock and a hard place .
They have had a strategic partnership with the U.S. forever , but have also had their natural pull from Europe .
So far , they have had many reasons to stick with the winner .
However , when they see their century - old partner falling , will they firmly stand behind him or will they deliver the coup de grace ?
Still , we should not forget that currently the two leading oil exchanges are the New York ’s NYMEX and the London ’s International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) , even though both of them are effectively owned by the Americans .
It seems more likely that the British will have to go down with the sinking ship , for otherwise they will be shooting themselves in the foot by hurting their own London IPE interests .
It is here noteworthy that for all the rhetoric about the reasons for the surviving British Pound , the British most likely did not adopt the Euro namely because the Americans must have pressured them not to : otherwise the London IPE would have had to switch to Euros , thus mortally wounding the dollar and their strategic partner .
At any rate , no matter what the British decide , should the Iranian Oil Bourse accelerate , the interests that matter — those of Europeans , Chinese , Japanese , Russians , and Arabs — will eagerly adopt the Euro , thus sealing the fate of the dollar .
Americans cannot allow this to happen , and if necessary , will use a vast array of strategies to halt or hobble the operation ’s exchange : Sabotaging the Exchange — this could be a computer virus , network , communications , or server attack , various server security breaches , or a 9 - 11 - type attack on main and backup facilities .
Coup d’état — this is by far the best long - term strategy available to the Americans .
Negotiating Acceptable Terms & Limitations — this is another excellent solution to the Americans .
Of course , a government coup is clearly the preferred strategy , for it will ensure that the exchange does not operate at all and does not threaten American interests .
However , if an attempted sabotage or coup d’etat fails , then negotiation is clearly the second - best available option .
Joint U.N. War Resolution — this will be , no doubt , hard to secure given the interests of all other member - states of the Security Council .
Feverish rhetoric about Iranians developing nuclear weapons undoubtedly serves to prepare this course of action .
Unilateral Nuclear Strike — this is a terrible strategic choice for all the reasons associated with the next strategy , the Unilateral Total War .
The Americans will likely use Israel to do their dirty nuclear job .
Unilateral Total War — this is obviously the worst strategic choice .
First , the U.S. military resources have been already depleted with two wars .
Secondly , the Americans will further alienate other powerful nations .
Third , major dollar - holding countries may decide to quietly retaliate by dumping their own mountains of dollars , thus preventing the U.S. from further financing its militant ambitions .
Finally , Iran has strategic alliances with other powerful nations that may trigger their involvement in war ; Iran reputedly has such alliance with China , India , and Russia , known as the Shanghai Cooperative Group , a.k.a.
Shanghai Coop and a separate pact with Syria .
Whatever the strategic choice , from a purely economic point of view , should the Iranian Oil Bourse gain momentum , it will be eagerly embraced by major economic powers and will precipitate the demise of the dollar .
The collapsing dollar will dramatically accelerate U.S. inflation and will pressure upward U.S. long - term interest rates .
At this point , the Fed will find itself between Scylla and Charybdis — between deflation and hyperinflation — it will be forced fast either to take its “ classical medicine ” by deflating , whereby it raises interest rates , thus inducing a major economic depression , a collapse in real estate , and an implosion in bond , stock , and derivative markets , with a total financial collapse , or alternatively , to take the Weimar way out by inflating , whereby it pegs the long - bond yield , raises the Helicopters and drowns the financial system in liquidity , bailing out numerous LTCMs and hyperinflating the economy .
The Austrian theory of money , credit , and business cycles teaches us that there is no in - between Scylla and Charybdis .
Sooner or later , the monetary system must swing one way or the other , forcing the Fed to make its choice .
No doubt , Commander - in - Chief Ben Bernanke , a renowned scholar of the Great Depression and an adept Black Hawk pilot , will choose inflation .
Helicopter Ben , oblivious to Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression , has nonetheless mastered the lessons of the Great Depression and the annihilating power of deflations .
The Maestro has taught him the panacea of every single financial problem — to inflate , come hell or high water .
He has even taught the Japanese his own ingenious unconventional ways to battle the deflationary liquidity trap .
Like his mentor , he has dreamed of battling a Kondratieff Winter .
To avoid deflation , he will resort to the printing presses ; he will recall all helicopters from the 800 overseas U.S. military bases ; and , if necessary , he will monetize everything in sight .
His ultimate accomplishment will be the hyperinflationary destruction of the American currency and from its ashes will rise the next reserve currency of the world — that barbarous relic called gold .

Do n’t scale : 99.999 % uptime is for Wal - Mart David 99 comments Latest by e.senguttuvan
Jeremy Wright purports a common misconception about new companies doing business online :
That you need 99.999 % uptime or you ’re toast .
Not so .
Basecamp does n’t have that .
I think our uptime is more like 98 % or 99 % .
Guess what , we ’re still here !
Wright correctly states that those final last percent are incredibly expensive .
To go from 98 % to 99 % can cost thousands of dollars .
To go from 99 % to 99.9 % tens of thousands more .
Now contrast that with the value .
What kind of service are you providing ?
Does the world end if you ’re down for 30 minutes ?
If you ’re Wal - Mart and your credit card processing pipeline stops for 30 minutes during prime time , yes , the world does end .
Someone might very well be fired .
The business loses millions of dollars .
Wal - Mart gets in the news and loses millions more on the goodwill account .
Now what if Delicious , Feedster , or Technorati goes down for 30 minutes ?
How big is the inconvenience of not being able to get to your tagged bookmarks or do yet another ego - search with Feedster or Technorati for 30 minutes ?
Not that high .
The world does not come to an end .
Nobody gets fired .
Alistair Cockburn taught me a great name for this in Agile Software Development : Criticality .
The criticality of your average “ Web 2.0 ” application is one with loss of comfort as the result of something going wrong .
Unlike the criticality of the credit card processing for Wal - Mart , which is probably at the level of essential money .
So the short summary is that it ’s not a profitable decision to shoot for 99.999 % availability for tagging bookmarks .
But that ’s not nearly as important as the real lesson :
Before you have users , it ’s a waste of time ensuring that they can always get to the service
A project that spends a lot of time upfront on scalability is the one that ca n’t afford to fail .
And a project that ca n’t afford to fail is an inherently uninteresting idea for a new growth business .
You ca n’t carry around the label of Zero Risk ( TM ) and expect to be the next big thing .
It will focus your energy on all the wrong things .
What you need is to embrace the goal of getting someone to care enough about your product that they ’ll actually complain when its down .
Once the first complains starts to trickle in , you know you ’re riding something right , and then you start caring about adding another percentage point or two .
Om Malik thinks that the running - with - scissors approach of most start - ups is a sign of a bubble .
Awahh ?
The bubble was when people thought they needed to spend $ 3 million dollars buying Sun servers and Oracle databases to build a site for wedding invitations .
The business smarts is when you do n’t blow the farm before the crap shot has turned sure bet .
Fail cheap .
Because odds are you ’re going to .
And you need to have your shirt for the second round .
So .
Do n’t scale .
Do n’t worry about five 9’s or even two .
Worry about getting something to a point where there ’s reason to worry about it .
UPDATE : Dare Obasanjo from Microsoft talks about how even the big guys have these issues from the position of a company that launched MSN Spaces and grew it to 3x LiveJournal in 1 year :
The fact is that everyone has scalability issues , no one can deal with their service going from zero to a few million users without revisiting almost every aspect of their design and architecture .
Spot on .

When C is the Best ( Tool for the Job )
Introduction
“ Java and / or .NET are better than C in every way . ” .
“ Perl / Python / PHP / Ruby / Tcl are better than C. ”
“ LISP is better than C ” .
“ If you need speed , use O’Caml or Haskell - do n’t bother with C. ”
“ C is for kernels . ”
We hear these things all the time and still people insist on using C for some tasks .
OK , these sentences are not entirely false .
Most of the time ( I do n’t know if it ’s 90 % , 80 % or slightly above 60 % , I did n’t count ) , it is preferable to use something else .
But what about the minority of these cases ?
The purpose of this article is to point to the cases where C really shines and is the best tool for the job .
At first I ’ll enumerate some of the strengths of C , and then I ’ll give a case study which illustrates some of these points .
Before that - a note .
By “ C ” I mean either ANSI C ( with most common and portable extensions ) or C99 or C++ with many C primitives used .
The so - called Standard C++ is entirely different .
Reasons for Wanting to Prefer C
Portability
C is portable for every architecture there ’s a gcc backend or any other compiler for .
With Java you rely on Sun ’s whims .
Open - source high level languages are better ( especially if they can be compiled using gcc or supply a gcc back - end ) , but nonetheless , C is still more portable than anything written using it .
Open-Source Considerations
gcc is a full - featured and robust compiler for C , and it ’s open - source .
Sun ’s Java distribution has a very problematic license .
It ’s not distributed as part of most Linux distributions due to this .
Low - levelness
You cannot effectively duplicate a struct containing other structs in Java or in Perl as you can in C .
This is due to the fact that in these languages every struct is a reference .
You cannot work with interrupts , DMAs , and other hardware elements .
It ’s much harder to write your own custom fine - grained memory - management routines .
Many problem domains call for C .
Writing self - contained code
You can compile a C library and distribute it as is .
With Java or Perl one often needs a substantial run-time .
Making use of UNIXisms
There ’s no fork ( ) in Java , and not many other UNIX system calls .
You need to create bindings for them ( which require JNI ) or work around them .
Perl and other languages , usually do n’t have this limitation .
To some extent , this is also true when working on Microsoft Windows , where some of the system calls and APIs are not available in the Java distribution by Sun .
Integrability
A C library can be used by Perl code , Python code , Tcl code , Ruby code , to a lesser extent Java code , etc .
Code written in a high - level language is mostly usable only in that language .
Speed and Memory Consumption
And naturally there ’s speed and memory consumption .
Often when speed or low memory consumption is the issue , one cannot use a high - level language , because it may have a lot of overhead in one area or both .
Many real - time applications ( i.e : applications that should respond to events within a given time ) must be written in a low - level language for that reason .
Other applications like that are applications that simply can never be fast enough : various APIs , virtual machines , simulations , graphics , audio , video and 3 - D programs , etc .
Case Study : Freecell Solver
Freecell Solver is a C library that can be used to solve games of the Solitaire Card Game Freecell , and similar Solitaire variants .
Started as a way for me to see if a theory I had about how a computer can solve Freecell would work in practice , it ended up as a highly - customizable , very feature - rich and pretty fast program .
It is the only one with a high quality web - site dedicated to it , has been integrated into at least three GUI games so far , and is the only program of its kind with binaries and source packages distributed for common distributions .
I am pretty confident in saying it has become the “ category killer ” of its kind .
Freecell Solver ( also FCS from now on ) is written in C - mostly C89 but with some necessary extensions that are common in most modern C compilers .
It ’s been successfully compiled with gcc , Visual C++ , and the Intel C Compiler .
The code of Freecell Solver is very “ funky ” : hard to understand , uses preprocessor macros all over the place ( inline and gcc ’s statement expressions are not portable enough unfortunately ) with many tricks to the untrained eye .
There are some comments , but many of them may be out of date .
I happen to agree with the Extreme Programming camp that it is really better to refactor and make the code easier to understand than to comment redundantly .
But since it was essential that it would run as fast as possible , I could not structure it appropriately .
However , I can assure you that the code is modular , and of good quality and maintainable .
So do n’t believe those who claim it ’s bad .
Luckily , I have written an architecture document that covers the main data structures and algorithms used .
Why Freecell Solver should be written in C ?
The best way to realize why C is the ideal language for Freecell Solver is to think how to port it to Java , which a high - level language that is similar to C. Freecell Solver represents the states of the board as an array of pointers to columns , where each column is an array of bytes , where each byte represents a single card .
The states themselves are allocated from blocks of contiguous memory .
The blocks themselves are not realloc ed , and thus remain in the same memory address .
If more states need to be allocated , then more blocks are created .
This is all done to reduce the amount of allocated memory , as individually allocating the states may incur a lot of overhead .
A similar technique is used for the columns themselves .
This time they are allocated , out of also contiguous blocks of memory , but this time they are not of fixed size .
Each column follows the other one .
The columns themselves are placed in a hash , to make sure duplicate columns are eliminated .
Now , how do we do it in Java ?
In Java every reference to a structure or an array is allocated and manipulated individually .
We cannot have them chained one by one in memory .
This ( together with the fact that the garbage collection also incurs some memory overhead ) , will cause them to occupy more memory .
And more memory means more cache misses , potentially more swapping and less speed .
One way I can think of overriding it is allocating a very large array , and then giving an index .
But that would be slower than a simple C pointer .
That ’s not all there is to it .
The Freecell Solver hash implementation itself is very optimized .
The chains of the hashes themselves are compactly allocated and from then on re-used in the manner described above .
This too is very hard to achieve in Java .
In order to efficiently process and manipulate the states and the individual cards , Freecell Solver contains a great deal of preprocessor macros .
Java does not have a preprocessor , and therefore one will need to either :
Replace them with methods .
This would mean lower speed .
Use a preprocessor ( such as filepp ) to process the code .
This would mean that problems would be harder to track , line numbers may be skewed , and the development environment may not necessarily support it .
Use the expressions encapsulated by the macros verbatim in the code .
This would make it less modular .
Another fact that may incur a lot of overhead in Java is the fact that in some functions Freecell Solver uses a great deal of nested loops and conditionals to search for suitable moves .
A loop in Java has more speed overhead than its C equivalent , and together it will probably add up .
Potentially , also all the arrays that are extensively used by Freecell Solver may incur speed overheads due to the fact Java also does bounds checking .
Finally , Freecell Solver uses a lot of C-isms .
It compares structs using memcmp ( ) , copies adjacent regions of memory using memcpy ( ) , etc .
These have a more limited support in Java , and may not necessarily make sense all of the time .
To sum up , while one can write a program that will be compatible in its output to Freecell Solver in Java , it will feel less native there , and will probably be much slower and more memory hungry .
All of these things add up to a lot .
C is the best language for writing a Freecell solver in .
Conclusion
Despite the fact that computers have become much faster , and that there are now high level languages whose run-time speed is very adequate , C still has its uses .
Whether you want your code to be self - contained ( and not contain a huge run-time ) , or you want to have a fine - grained memory allocation , or you want to interoperate with your system ’s native built - ins , C may be the best choice .
It is insightful to know , and often proves very useful .
And it still has its place .

A nearly four - month - old Internet drama in which the cryptic video musings of a fresh - faced teenager became the obsession of millions of devotees — themselves divided over the very authenticity of the videos , or who was behind them or why — appears to be in its final act .
The woman who plays Lonelygirl15 on the video - sharing site YouTube.com has been identified as Jessica Rose , a 20 - ish resident of New Zealand and Los Angeles and a graduate of the New York Film Academy .
And the whole project appears to be the early serialized version of what eventually will become a movie .
Matt Foremski , the 18 - year - old son of Tom Foremski , a reporter for the blog Silicon Valley Watcher , was the first to disinter a trove of photographs of the familiar - looking actress , who portrayed the character named Bree in the videos .
The episodes suggested Bree was the home - schooled daughter of strictly religious parents who was able to find the time to upload video blogs of her innermost thoughts .

The fans ’ disbelief in Lonelygirl15 was not willingly suspended , but rather teased and toyed with .

About 30 cattle left on the farm are starving to death
Owners of Emmadale Farm in Rowley Green Lane , Lionel , David and Stephen Tonge , were jailed in May for non-payment of fines for animal welfare breaches .
Of the 200 animals at the farm , 90 have been put down and a further 30 are slowly starving to death .
Local farmers said they could not help as they would become liable .
The three owners of the farm were found guilty of breaching the Protection of Animals Act at a trial in 2003
In total they were fined in excess of £ 100,000 .
Take responsibility
They were jailed for 12 months each on May 25 for failing to pay the fine .
John Puckering , who works on a farm nearby , said : " The cattle are slowly starving to death .
" This is why I 'm trying to get somebody to take some responsibility for the animals , trading standards or Defra , and instruct somebody to look after them . "
But Andy Williams , animal health manager at Worcestershire County Council , said : " There is very little we can do .
" To take the animals off the farm we need a court order which would take so long it's a non starter and if we start caring for them the authority would become liable which we want to avoid .
" We are monitoring the situation daily and where necessary the state veterinary service is used to humanely destroy the animals . "
Call for action
Councillor Roger Hollingsworth , leader of Bromsgrove District Council in whose ward the farm is located , called for action by the agriculture minister Ben Bradshaw .
" These animals are in a sickening state , covered with worms .
I hate to seen animals suffering in this way .
" I understand the animals could be cared for under a process if their identity is uncertain , but it needs Ben Bradshaw to do that .
" I would like the minister to get off the fence and take some action in this case . "
Urgent inquiry
Speaking on BBC Radio WM Mr Bradshaw said : " I will happily look at this urgently . "
A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said : " We are concerned about reports of animals suffering .
" We are getting back in touch with trading standards to clarify the legal position to see if we can help . "
Bush blocked surveillance probe President blocked surveillance probe
Gonzales tells Senate panel that Justice Department investigators were denied clearance
WASHINGTON - President Bush effectively blocked a Justice Department investigation of the National Security Agency 's warrantless surveillance program , refusing to give security clearances to attorneys who were attempting to conduct the probe , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Tuesday .
Bush 's decision represents an unusually direct and unprecedented White House intervention into an investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility , the internal affairs office at Justice , according to administration officials and legal experts .
It forced OPR to abandon its investigation of the role played by Justice Department officials in authorizing and monitoring the controversial NSA eavesdropping effort .
" Since its creation some 31 years ago , OPR has conducted many highly sensitive investigations involving Executive Branch programs and has obtained access to information classified at the highest levels , " chief lawyer H. Marshall Jarrett wrote in a memorandum released Tuesday .
" In all those years , OPR has never been prevented from initiating or pursuing an investigation . "
In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee , Gonzales said that in matters involving access to classified programs , " the president of the United States makes the decision . "
" The president decided that protecting the secrecy and security of the program requires that a strict limit be placed on the number of persons granted access to information about the program for non-operational reasons , " Gonzales wrote in a related letter sent to the committee 's chairman , Sen. Arlen Specter , R - Pa .
" Every additional security clearance that is granted for the ( program ) increases the risk that national security might be compromised . "
The eavesdropping program , begun in secret after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and revealed in news reports last December , allows the NSA to intercept telephone calls and e-mail between the U.S. and overseas without court approval if one of the parties is suspected of links to terrorists .
It is the focus of lawsuits and months of wrangling between the administration and Congress over its legality .
Last week , Specter and the administration agreed on a proposal that would allow Bush to submit the program to the government 's secret terrorism and intelligence court for review of its legality .
Allegations centre on DaimlerChrysler 's luxury Mercedes range
DaimlerChrysler said it was co-operating fully , and has made all its accounts available .
The criminal probe escalates a civil one by the US market watchdog , the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday .
At issue is whether Mercedes staff paid bribes , and whether senior DaimlerChrysler executives knew .
DaimlerChrysler revealed last year it was being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission .
' Co-operating '
There are now two investigations .
" We are working with the SEC and the Justice Department on the investigation .
We have made all our accounts available , " said a DaimlerChrysler spokesman following the Wall Street Journal on Friday .
In July , DaimlerChrysler said in its interim financial results statement that it had identified " accounts , transactions and related payments that are subject to special scrutiny " .
It said it was " voluntarily sharing .... information from its own investigation " after subpoenas from US federal agencies .
DaimlerChrysler said in July that it had not yet reached " any definitive conclusions " about whether the payments it had identified breached the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act .
Troubled times
The latest embarrassment to hit the carmaker comes one day after the German financial market watchdog launched a probe into possible insider trading in the firm 's shares .
DaimlerChrysler 's share price surged up 10 % last week ahead of chief executive Juergen Schrempp 's announcement that he was planning to step down two years early .
Mr Schrempp will step down at the end of 2005 .
He had become a target of investor criticism , drawing fire over the firm 's global expansion plans and problems at its flagship Mercedes division .
DaimlerChrysler has seen its earnings come under pressure as steel prices have increased and competitors have offered cut - price deals to lure customers .

十分に設計を行わないでコーディングを始めてしまうと、プログラムは行き詰まり、メンテナンスができなくなってしまうと恐れてしまいがちである。その結果、手戻りに多大なコストがかかり、最悪、プロジェクトは中止に追いやられてしまう。設計をシンプルに留めてリファクタリングを行う、というのは手戻りとは異なるものなのだ。これでびくびくせずにプロジェクトを進めることができるようになるであろう。

最近 、Yahooグループで、コーディングを始める前にどれぐらい設計をすれば十分かという議論があった。その議論の中で、私はリファクタリングは決して手戻りではない、ことを明言し、Alistair Cockburnによる下記の発言に反駁した。「えっと、リファクタリングは厳密に言えば手戻りである。もし、手戻りにあたるものがまだあるとするならば、リファクタリングがそれだ。」Alistairは正式には訂正をしている。
「手戻り」とは、辞書に従えば、改訂という意味であり、おそらくリファクタリングとは確かに改訂も含めたある種のインクリメンタル開発のことだ。しかし多くの人々−−ソフトウェア関係者やマネージャも含めて−−にとって、手戻りはいけないことだと考えられており、避けるべきだとされている。私はこの言葉をAlstairによるもっと丁寧な定義とは異なり、そういう意味で使っている。
手戻りとは、もちろん、同じ作業を何度も行うことだ。プログラミングは、リファクタリングというテクニックを用いれば何度も繰り返し実施することができるが、簡単な設計からリファクタリングを繰り返すソフトウェア開発は厳密には手戻りとは異なるものである。
一言で言うと、プログラミングはタイピングとは異なる、ということだ。これは、マーチンファウラーから借りてきた言葉である。長い説明となると本論文がそれにあたる。
単純な問 題
テストファースト、簡単な設計とリファクタリングを用いて小さなプログラムを実装する。ここでは、PushとPopができるスタックの実装を行う。我々のミッションは、明確になっている開発を観察し、プログラムを開発する中でどのぐらいの手戻りが発生するのかを見ることである。この点にフォーカスするために、これまでにやったことのない方法でスタックを実装しよう。
さて、もちろん本稿の件について考えたことがあるし、スタックについてもかなりの量の知識をもっている。というのは、スタックが考案された時のことをよく知っているからである。私がまだやっていないことは、どのようにこのバージョンを実施しているか、を詳細に見せることである。この中で私は以前に用いた設計のことは考えないように努めるつもりだ。本稿を読んでいる間はピンクの象さんについては考えないで読んでもらいたい。
まずはテス ト
本稿でRubyを用いるのは、簡単で無駄な時間を使わないからだ。私はこの原稿を、このホテルをチェックアウトするまでにあげたいと思っている。今日の最初のテストは、確かにRubyプロジェクトを正しくセットアップできていることを確かめることだ。これを見て欲しい:
class TestStack < TestCase def testHookup assert 1==1 end end
最初 のPop
最初の本当のテストは、スタックを作ってPopすることだ。私は空のスタックを定義し、Popを実行してnilが返る。テストはこうなる:
def testPopEmpty s = Stack.new assert_equal ( nil , s.pop ) end
スタックはまだ定義されていないので、これはまだ完璧ではない。よってここでクラスを書く:
class Stack end
これでもテストはまだ動かない。Popが定義されていないからだ。そこでnilが返るようにPop操作を定義する:
def pop return nil end
これでテストがちゃんと動くと思う、うん、動いたね。
Push し てPop
Popとしてはこれではまだ十分ではない。そこでスタックに何かを格納してそれを取り出すような新しいテストを書くことにする。
def testPushPop s = Stack.new s.push ( " a " ) assert_equal ( " a " , s.pop ) end
これは期待どおりには動かない。Pushが定義されてないからだ。‥やっぱり通らない。そこで入力を格納するPushを定義し、格納したものを返すようにPopを修正しよう。ここでは本当にバカみたいな方法をとる。誓って言うが、教育的な目的のためにこうするのだ。
def pop return @saved end def push ( x ) @saved = x end
このテストは全てちゃんと動く。しかしながら、Rubyは、@savedが初期化されていないとワーニングを出す。これは、最初のポップのテストに起因するものである。でも、テストはちゃんと動いているのでこのワーニングについては気にしないことにする。
テストが動くように、全く新しいメソッド" push " を書いたが、popメソッドの中のreturn行もいじった。return nilとなっていたところがreturn @savedになっている。
これは手戻りだろうか ?
私はそうではない、と声を大にして言いたい。というのは、プログラミングというのは決してタイピングとは違うのだから。私が最初にこのメソッドを書いたとき、ほとんど何も設計を行わず、「テストではnilが欲しいのでnilを与えよう」と考えた。2番目のあまり賢くないバージョンでは、少しだけ設計を行った。私は、「pushした入力を格納し、後でそれを返すこと」と考えた。この作業は新しい作業であり、手戻りではない。タイピングそのものは手戻りである。古い3文字を新しい6文字に置き換えたのだ。(プログラム中には全部では299文字あるので、手戻りがあったのは約1％である。)
Push 、Pushそし てPop、Pop
じゃぁ、ここでちょっとかき回してみよう。厳しいテストをやってみるのだ。値を2つPushして、2回Popを行って正しい値が正しい(逆の)順序で取り出せることを確認する。
def testPushTwice s = Stack.new s.push ( 1 ) s.push ( 2 ) assert_equal ( 2,s.pop ) assert_equal ( 1, s.pop ) assert_equal ( nil , s.pop )
end
ここで、私は極端に走って、スタックが空になったらnulを返すことを確かめることにした。もし私がこのテストをtestPushメソッドで行おうと考えていたら、テストはそこで失敗し、このプログラムは違った方向へ発展していたことだろう。でも私はそうとは考えなかった。そして今がある。我々はこのテストが失敗することを期待しよう(詳しく書けば、1をPopするときに失敗することを期待する。 )...さあ。
さて、ここでやらないといけないことがいくつかある。私は、このスタックをリンクリストを用いて実装しようと決めた。だからここで、コード中に私の意図を表明しておこう。ここで私は以下のように、コードを数行を追加しないといけない：
def push ( x ) @saved = ListElement.new ( x , @saved ) end
私の考えは、Xと@savedに既に存在するもの全てを含むListElement(このクラスはまだ存在していない)を新たに生成し、そのリスト要素を@savedに格納しようということである。今、スタックをポップするために、@savedの最初の要素に格納されているアイテムを返し、@savedに次の要素を格納しなければならない。これはこのように見える...いや、ちょっと待って欲しい。私は今テストを走らせ、ListElementに関するエラーを見つけて、最初にそのエラーを訂正しようと思う。この作業は次の段階として程よい大きさだし、私はこれ以上たくさんのことを一度にやるつもりはないので、今やってしまおう。
class ListElement def initialize ( object , link ) @object = object @link = link end end
よし、できた。でも、2つほどテストが通らない(我々の期待どおりに)。2つのエラーは両方とも、Popの結果として予期された答えの代わりにListElementを得たと苦情を述べている。これは驚くに値しない。Popメソッドは@savedを答えている。我々はPopメソッドが@saved内にあるListElement中のオブジェクトを返し、そしてListElementのリンクを@savedに格納するように変更しないといけない。じゃコードを書こう。これは少しトリッキーになるけど、許容範囲だ。
def pop result = @saved.object ; @saved = @saved .
link return result end
読者諸君もお気づきのように、これらのLinkElementのオブジェクトメソッドやリンクメソッドはまだ実装していないことは分かっている。これを確認するためにテストを走らせてみよう。(私は、@savedがnilだった場合に発生する別のエラーも期待している ) 。
果たして 、 ” オブジェクト ” メソッドが定義されていないというエラーがでた。じゃぁ、実装しよう：
class ListElement def initialize ( object , link ) @object = object @link = link end attr_reader : object attr_reader : link end
attr_reader文ではこのクラスのためのreadアクセサを定義する。このくらいにして次のエラーに進もう。期待通りに、次のエラーでは、nilが" object"へ返らない。でも驚かないよ。@savedがnilだったときにpopに入ることに関して何か対処する必要があるのだ。また、@savedが初期化されていないというワーニングがまだ出ている。1個めの問題をまずは解決してしまおう。popに1行追加だけだ:
def pop return nil if @saved == nil result = @saved.object ; @saved = @saved .
link return result end
@savedがnilの場合をチェックする。もしnilだったらスタックが空だという意味なのでnilを返す。テストを実行しよう。全部走らせるのだ。今度はうるさいワーニングの番だ。@savedをnilにする初期化メソッドを追加してフィックスしよう:
def initialize @saved = nil end
そしてテストは全て合格した。
ファイナルアンサー ?
我々はわずかな時間で、ゼロからスタックを実装した。(私が望んでいたほどわずかという訳ではない。私はアトランタから帰宅する途中、30,000フィート上空でこれをやり終えた)。このスタックは単純な設計とリファクタリングを使ってテストファーストで作った。これが、そのプログラムとテストの全てだ：
class TestStack < TestCase def testHookup assert 1==1 end def testPopEmpty s = Stack.new assert_equal ( nil , s.pop ) end def testPushPop s = Stack.new s.push ( " a " ) assert_equal ( " a " , s.pop ) end def testPushTwice s = Stack.new s.push ( 1 ) s.push ( 2 ) assert_equal ( 2, s.pop ) assert_equal ( 1, s.pop ) assert_equal ( nil , s.pop ) end end class
Stack def initialize @saved = nil end def pop return nil if @saved == nil result = @saved.object ; @saved = @saved .
link return result end def push ( x ) @saved = ListElement.new ( x , @saved ) end end class ListElement def initialize ( object , link ) @object = object @link = link end attr_reader : object attr_reader : link end
手戻り?それとも新しい手順?
手戻りはあった ? だろ? 修正したコードはほとんど全部が、あちこち文字を書き換えているけど追記の類だ。それに考え直すようなこともほとんどなかった。最初の「簡単な」テストの際に、私はシステムの全体的な構成を組み入れた。クラスやメソッド定義、ほとんどが空でテストを走らせるためだけのコードだった。そして、ListElementを実装し、使い、拡張するというテストで支援された小さなフェーズをこなすことでラストスパートをかけた。
ここで、私は、手戻りだとは思わず、追加、追加、さらに追加のようだったと言える。確かに、書き換えた部分も少しはあったけど、タイピングの大部分や思考過程は新しいものであり、手戻りではなかったのだ。
リビングルームをペンキで塗る場合における手戻りというのは、壁全体を塗り直さなければならない場合のことであって、2，3箇所を直す場合のことではない。学期末のレポートにおける手戻りというのは、ほとんど全てを書き直さないといけない場合であって、スペルチェッカを走らせたり、タイポや文法を修正することではない。そして、ソフトウェアにおける手戻りというのは、コード全体をいじり直す場合のことであって、新しいことを追加したり、コードを若干移動させたりすることではない。
リファクタリングは手戻りではない。修正だ。でも、何度も繰り返しやってはいけないよ。
It ’s no surprise that most businesses like this rotary drilling company or this personal trainer manchester business for example have different social media accounts such as Facebook , Twitter , Instagram etc. in which we like and follow a bunch of celebrities and entertainment pages .
Yet almost none of us are aware of the amount of money that can be made from these pages and how people get paid thousands of dollars for a single photo or publicity on their story .
So how does it all work ?
Well , it all comes down to traffic , many companies can make really great and high - quality products , but if they ’re not able to promote it or get it out to the public , they wo n’t be able to sell much , this is where social media marketing takes place , these companies pay different pages from different platforms to push their products out there for the consumer .
However , it ’s really important for the consumer to be interested in that product in the first place , that ’s why the seller targets a specific niche ( a specialized subset of a larger set ) that increases the chance for sells .
For example , if the product is a cute dog costume , the seller will most likely look for famous dog pages to promote his product .
Jim Manney runs the social media for this radiators store and says “ This is a simple way to define Influencer Marketing , and it ’s been around for a long time .
Different people get out there and create content of a specific niche for their audience , they then grow a large following and use that as a way to make a living in different ways , they can make their own products ( write a book , create a digital product , clothing lines … ) or promote other people ’s products .
The amount of money obviously depends on the number of active followers they have . ”
Jillian Horner runs a roller compaction for dry granulation business and also this rope lights store and is a big advocate for social media and notes “ All in all , social media marketing , if used the right way , can be a goldmine for entrepreneurs or people looking to start a business on the internet . ”
You come home after a long , honest day 's work , stroll by your message machine , and see the light blinking .
Did a loved one call with good news ?
Is there a friend calling to find out what you 're doing tomorrow ?
Some people are finding that they have instead received a " misdialed " call from a stranger , leaving a " hot " investment tip for a friend .
The message is designed to sound as if the speaker did n't realize that he or she was leaving the hot tip on the wrong machine .
Maybe the message sounds like this :
" Hey Tracy , it 's Debbie .
I could n't find your old number and Tammy says this is the new one .
I hope it 's the right one .
Anyway , remember that hot stock exchange guy that I 'm dating ?
He gave my father that stock tip on the company that went from under a buck to like three bucks in two weeks and you were mad I did n't call you ?
Well I 'm calling you now !
This new company is supposed to be like the next really hot clothing thing .
And they 're making some big news announcement this week .
The stock symbol is ...
He says buy now .
It 's at like 50 cents and it's going up to like 5 or 6 bucks this week so get as much as you can .
Call me on my cell , I 'm still in Orlando .
My Dad and I are buying a bunch tomorrow and I already called Kelly and Ron too .
Anyway I miss you , give me a call .
Bye . "
If you get a message like this , it 's not a wrong number at all .
Instead , it is from someone who is being paid to leave these messages on a whole lot of answering machines .
The people paying for this message to go out on hundreds or thousands of answering machines own some of this stock .
They are hoping you can be tricked into buying some too , as they stand to gain by selling their shares if the stock price rises because gullible investors buy .
Once these fraudsters sell their shares and stop hyping the stock , the price typically falls and investors lose their money .
Fraudsters frequently use this ploy with small , thinly - traded companies because it 's easier to manipulate a stock when there 's little or no information available about the company .
These scams have also migrated to email and faxes .
Be extremely wary of an email message that starts out like this :
Hey you !
PLEASE do n't tell anyone about this email , because if the SEC finds out , I could get in big trouble for passing on this information , maybe even go to jail .
This is super important !
I hope I have the right email for you .
Your messages keep bouncing back because your mailbox is full , and I seem to remember this is your other account .
I tried calling but you 're not home .. arghh !
OK here 's the news ..
And look out for a fax transmission that says , " Will you please put your cell phone on .
I have been trying to get you for 2 hours .
I have a stock for you that will triple in price just like the last stock I gave you did .
I can't get you on either phone .
Either call me , or call Linda to place the new trade .
We need to buy now .
P.S. You better be good to me this Christmas .
No other Stock Broker has given you back to back wins .
Thanks , your shining star Financial Planner . "
It is never a good idea to put your hard - earned money into a stock on the basis of a hot tip from somebody you do n't know .
There are unscrupulous individuals out there who have a financial stake in trying to drive up the price of companies that you 've likely never heard of .
Many fraudsters rely on Internet chat room sites or spammed investment newsletters to promote companies , but at the SEC we 're beginning to hear more and more reports of the phony misdialed number and misdirected email scams .
So what should you do if you get one of these messages ?
Before you delete the phone message , trash the email , or rip up the fax , we would appreciate hearing details about the stock being hyped .
Be sure to tell us the phone number from which the call came ( if you 're able to tell us ) , forward the email ( including the header information ) , or send us a copy of the fax .
This kind of information is invaluable as we seek to enforce the federal securities laws .
You can use our on - line complaint form , at http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml, e-mail us at enforcement@sec.gov , send us a fax at 202-772-9295 , or you can call us at 1 - 800 - SEC - 0330 .
We welcome your help in ferreting out fraud in securities sales .
After you send us the information , we suggest you delete the phone message or email .
Then congratulate yourself for not falling victim to this kind of scam !
Here 's a list of red flags that we often find in many of the frauds that we see :
If it sounds too good to be true , it is .
Any investment opportunity that claims that there are huge guaranteed rewards , especially for acting quickly , are incredibly risky , and more likely to lead to losing some , most , or all of your money .
Any investment opportunity that claims that there are huge guaranteed rewards , especially for acting quickly , are incredibly risky , and more likely to lead to losing some , most , or all of your money .
" Guaranteed returns " are n't .
Every investment carries some degree of risk , and the level of risk typically correlates with the return you can expect to receive .
Low risk generally means low yields , and high yields typically involve high risk .
If your money is perfectly safe , you 'll most likely get a low return .
High returns represent potential rewards for folks who are willing to take big risks .
Most fraudsters spend a lot of time trying to convince investors that extremely high returns are " guaranteed " or " ca n't miss . "
Do n't believe it .

By the end of this year , more than 70 percent of all server , desktop , and mobile processors that Intel ships will be multicore .
This represents a challenge for software developers .
Applications must be threaded if they are to make efficient use of these multicore processors .
In this way , work can be given to individual cores to make as much use as possible of all the available execution resources .
In this article , we describe how to make existing single - threaded applications multithreaded by analyzing their runtime performance characteristics and relating that back to the app 's source code .
Multicore CPUs
Intel multicore architecture consists of a single processor package that contains two or more execution cores and can deliver , with appropriate software , parallel execution of software threads .
The operating system sees each core as a separate processor with all resources that are typically associated with individual processors .
Each core in a package runs at the same frequency and shares the same interface with the chipset and external memory .
Dual - core processors are an extension of hyperthreading technology .
A hyperthreaded processor executes two software threads using a single execution unit .
Complicating this is that multicore processors can also be hyperthreaded .
A dual - core processor that is not hyperthreaded can execute two threads by running each thread on a different core .
In a hyperthreaded dual - core processor , each core can execute two software threads .
So , for example , two software threads could be executed either on separate cores or on the same core using hyperthreading technology .
A critical aspect of multicore technology is that it is much more important to realize performance gains through threading than by relying on new hardware to increase processor speed .
This is because semiconductor manufacturers are decreasing the rate at which processor speed is increased with each generation of multicore processor to make them run cooler .
This means that in the future , application performance may not increase as much as it did in the past based only on running unmodified apps on newer processors .
However , if applications are coded to use the extra threading capability of multicore technology , applications will continue to run faster and faster as new generations of multicore processors are introduced .
One of the side effects of multicore technology is that CPU - bound applications can potentially run twice as fast on dual - core processors , whereas memory - bound applications may only run 50 percent faster .
I / O - bound applications may not run any faster .
When threading applications for both multicore and hyperthreaded processors , it is important to make sure thread workload types are spread across processor packages as much as possible .
For instance , if an application has four threads , two computationally intensive threads and two UI intensive threads , and the application is run on a dual - core hyperthreaded machine , it would probably be more effective to have the computationally intensive threads run on separate cores , and the UI threads run on separate cores .
In this way , one UI thread and one compute thread are handled via hyperthreading technology on each core .
This would provide a more balanced workload for the two cores , rather than having both compute threads on one core and both UI threads on another core .
A Threading Example
To illustrate the process of threading an application , we take a serial , single - threaded application and determine how to make it multithreaded .
The application we use is a Microsoft Windows application that simply draws a fractal by manipulating individual pixels in organized separate horizontal scan lines .
The platform we ran the application on was a four - socket , dual - core , hyperthreaded ( HT ) machine .
This means there were a total of eight hyperthreaded cores , which the operating system saw as 16 processors ( 4 sockets × 2 cores per socket × 2 HT CPUs per core ) .
We analyze the fractal application using Intel 's VTune performance analysis tool .
We use it to take a close look at the execution characteristics of the application to guide our decisions in terms of how and at what points to thread the application .
Here 's the process we follow : First , we find the main performance bottlenecks in the application .
We then see if it makes sense to thread the application there .
If there 's not enough work at that point for individual threads , we can look farther up the program 's calling sequences to find a more appropriate place .
We then check to see if our newly created threads are well balanced .
If not , we try to come up with a solution in which the threads all use roughly the same amount of CPU time .
Find the Hotspot
One of the first issues to consider is whether threading the application improves performance .
If the work that the application does can be distributed either through functional or data decomposition , then some performance improvement can be achieved through threading .
To find out where our application is doing most of its work , we start by running the application and collecting hotspot information to find out where the application is consuming a lot of CPU time .
We can find the modules , functions , and even the line of source code that consumes most of the CPU cycles using the VTune Analyzer , and we do n't need a special build of the application .
Figure 1 is the Process View in the VTune Analyzer 7.2 for Windows after collecting sampling data on the platform .
It shows the majority of CPU time being spent in the System Idle Process and our example program .
The fact that the amount of CPU time spent in the System Idle Process is a large fraction of the total CPU time during the data collection run indicates that significant CPU resources are not being used .
This is expected given that we ran only the example application , the application is single threaded ( and therefore only ran on 1 CPU ) , and the application is running on a machine with 16 logical processors .

Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 show the executables that consumed time in the Mandelbrot process , all the threads in the Mandelbrot app ( only one thread that does any significant computation ) , and the Source View of the application 's main bottleneck .
The Source View shows that about 99 percent of the CPU time used by the application was spent in the function GenerateScanLine .
To improve performance , you could try to change the code in this function so it would run faster .
However , since we are running the application on a multicore machine , let 's see if it makes sense to create threads to distribute the workload .
Fortunately , there is a single location of intense computational activity that lends itself to threading .
If there had n't been any dominant hotspots , it would be more difficult to figure out what work to distribute across the processors .

If you can distribute the work currently done on one processor onto two processors , you can theoretically double the performance of an application .
Amdhal 's familiar equation gives a formula for the improvement in performance by threading an application :
Speedup of the application=1 / ( ( 1 - P ) + ( P/ A ) ) , where P is the fraction of the application that is parallelized , and A is the speedup of the parallelized portion .
For example , if you parallelize 25 percent of the application and make that part twice as fast as the result , the application speeds up by about 14 percent :
Speedup=1/((.75 ) +(.25/2 ) ) =
1/(.75+.125)=1/.875=1.14
This equation is also often written a different way in terms of the number of processors on the system :
Speedup=1 / ( S ( 1 - S ) /N )
where S is the fraction of the application that is serial and N is the number of processors .
From the sampling results we know that over 99 percent of the CPU time was consumed in the CalculatePixels , so if we can do the work in CalculatePixels on 16 threads , we could see a theoretical maximum speedup in our application of 1388 percent .
Again , using the equation :
Speedup=1 / ( S + ( 1 - S ) /N ) .
where S , the serial portion of the application , is the part we did n't thread , so S= 1-.99=.01 .
Speedup=1/((1-.99 ) +( 1-(1-.99 ) /16 ) )
=1/(.01+.99/16 )
=1/(.01+.062 )
=1/.072
=13.88
Our application ran in 2156 milliseconds as a serial application , and 1388 percent faster would be :
2156/13.88=155 milliseconds
Thus , the minimum runtime for our application would be about 155 ms .
However , hyperthreading changes the calculation of speed .
Hyperthreading runs multiple threads through one core .
The threads run more slowly than if they were executing alone , but the combined execution is faster than running one thread after the other , although not as fast as if they each were run on a separate processor .
Taking hyperthreading into account the equation for speedup then becomes :
Speedup=1 /( S+0.67 *( ( 1 - S ) /N) +hN )
where h is a constant that varies depending on the application and represents the overhead from hyperthreading , which is comprised of operating system overhead and time spent synchronizing threads ( see Programming with Hyperthreading Technology , by Richard Gerber and Andrew Binstock , ISBN 0971786143 ) .
We can get a significant increase in application speed by threading it , but where should we create the threads ?
It would n't be a good idea to create a thread for each call to CalculatePixel , because we would then be creating , synchronizing , and destroying a thread for each pixel on the screen .
The thread management would dominate the execution time spent actually calculating each pixel and might actually decrease performance .
The same can be said for creating a thread for each scanline .
Instead , we should look farther up in the calling sequence to find a better place to create threads to distribute the work .
Creating a Call Graph to Find a Threading Point
You can use the VTune Analyzer 's Call Graph feature to create a call graph of our application .
By looking at the call graph , we can find a place farther up in the call tree from the hot function where it could make sense to create a thread .
By recoding the call chain to the hot function to partition the work among several threads , we can take advantage of the parallel processing capability of the machine to improve the performance of the application .
In the case where there is n't a single hotspot , we could have used VTune to create a call graph , and looked for a subgraph that took a proportionally large amount of time .
The total time of the root function of a candidate subgraph would have a large total time relative to other subgraphs .
As with Sampling , the analysis technology we used , VTune 's Call Graph feature does not require a special build of the application , just debug symbols ( with fully optimized compilations ) so we can see function names .
The function GenerateScanLine works on the pixels in a scanline , by calling the function CalculatePixel for each pixel ; see Figure 5 .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
By looking at the generated call tree , you can see that a good place to create separate threads is in the function Generate_Display , which calls GenerateScanLine .
The strategy is to create as many threads as there are logical processors ( 16 ) and break the scanline drawing into pieces , giving each thread a set of scanlines to work on .
After we make the source code changes to do this , the application retrieves the number of logical processors from the OS and creates that many threads to draw the fractal .
The Call Graph display tells us that Generate_Display and GenerateScanLine are on the time - critical path because the functions are on the most time - consuming calling sequence as indicated by the thick red arrows .
This is a good indication that we are focusing on the right subgraph .
Also , the Self Time for Generate_Display is low compared to the Self Time for GenerateScanLine .
This means that most of the time is consumed in GenerateScanLine .
By putting the calls to GenerateScanLine into separate threads , the application work can be partitioned among the available processors .
To have an application that can scale with different numbers of processors , it 's a good idea to dynamically determine how many threads to create .
In this case , we use the operating system to find out how many logical processors there are and create the same number of threads .
This ensures we limit thread - synchronization issues .
Figure 6 shows the modified code to determine how many scanlines each thread should calculate .

After running the multithreaded application , there is a significant speedup , from 2156 milliseconds to 375 milliseconds .
The application runtime is faster , but not as fast as Amdahl 's equation predicts is theoretically possible .
Have we done all we can to improve performance ?
Now that the application is multithreaded , we need to make sure that the threads are doing about the same amount of work and that they are running in parallel .
If not , we wo n't be getting the maximum amount of benefit from threading the application .
Check Load Balancing
To get an idea of how well distributed and parallelized the workload is , we use VTune Analyzer 's Samples Over Time feature .
The Samples Over Time display shows how the activity for a particular application , module , or thread varies over the time the data was collected .
By looking at the thread sampling data over time , we see if the CPU time consumed by each thread was about the same , providing evidence of whether the workload was evenly distributed .
In addition , we can tell if the threads are parallelized by noticing whether there were a significant number of samples taken on each thread during the same block of time .
Figure 7 is the Sample Over Time View .
Each square in the right panel represents a slice of time and the red squares indicate a larger number of amount of CPU usage in that slice of time .
Many of the squares for each thread are colored red at the same instant in time , indicating that the threads are indeed running in parallel .
However , all of the threads are finishing at different times , indicating that some threads have much more work than others , and that there will be idle CPUs when the first threads finish .

Fix the Load Balancing Problem and Rebuild
The Sample Over Time View reveals that the threads are doing different amounts of work .
It turns out that some threads are drawing on parts of the screen that are n't covered by much of the fractal so they do n't consume much CPU time , while other threads are drawing on parts of the screen that are covered by a large part of the fractal and consequently are consuming a lot of CPU cycles .
Instead of organizing the threads so that the first thread does the first several scanlines ( which are the simplest in terms of the fractal ) , we interleave the threads and scanlines so ( on a 16 - CPU system ) the first thread does the first line , the 17th line , the 33rd line , and so forth , while the second thread does the second line , the 18th line , and so on .
This should distribute the computation more evenly over all the threads .
The Sample Over Time View ( Figure 8 ) shows the results after interleaving the threads .
The amount of thread activity is balanced between the 16 threads that are drawing the fractal , and the time to draw the fractal is reduced from 375 to 297 milliseconds .

Final Results
By proper threading of the single - threaded fractal application , we got a speedup from 2156 milliseconds to 297 milliseconds .
This was done by analyzing the performance characteristics of the application .
We began by finding the performance bottleneck , then created multiple threads farther up the bottleneck 's calling sequence .
We then realized that the threads were not properly balanced , so we came up with a way to partition the work between the threads more evenly .
Threading applications as a way to improve application performance is vital with the introduction of multicore processors .
You need to first determine whether threading will actually improve performance , and if it 's justified , you need to keep principles of proper threading in mind when introducing threading into applications .
Such factors as load balancing and synchronization have to be examined to gain optimal performance from threaded applications , and performance analysis tools can be used to help with these decisions .

The alloy used suggests sophisticated metal - working skills
It is the latest find from one of many tombs believed to have formed the cradle of Thracian civilisation .
The dagger , made of an alloy of gold and platinum , was found near the village of Dubovo .
Bozhidar Dimitrov , head of Bulgaria 's National Museum , told Reuters news agency the discovery was " sensational " .
It is the latest in a string of finds in the area in recent years which has excited archaeologists and has provided more details of the skills of the still mysterious Thracian civilisation .
According to officials at the museum , the dagger is 16 cm ( 6in ) long and is sharp enough to shave with .
More than 500 other miniature gold items were found in the same tomb .
The detail on the dagger suggests that it was used for sacrificial purposes .
Bloodthirsty
The Thracian civilisation thrived on the edge of the ancient Greek and Roman empires in what is now Bulgaria , Romania , northern Greece and Turkey , and is believed to have lasted up to 4,000 years .
The historian Herodotus described the Thracian as savage , bloodthirsty warriors and provided a description of the elaborate funeral procedures for their rulers .
Other finds in recent years include a gold mask , an ancient Thracian temple , a crown and thousands of items of jewellery .
The alloy used in the latest find suggests a far greater degree of sophistication in metal - working that was previously known for that period .
" This significant find confirmed that people in this region were familiar with what was then high technology in metal processing , " Mr Dimitrov told Reuters .
Microsoft ’s Robert Scoble , who cowrote a book on corporate blogging called Naked Conversations , now seems intent on turning himself into a case study for why companies should n’t blog .
The posts on his company - sponsored blog , Scobleizer , have become increasingly shrill and antagonistic of late .
He recently implied that bloggers who run AdSense ads are incapable of writing objectively about Google , and last week he launched an ad hominem attack on journalists he disapproves of – using terms like “ 100 % incompetent ” and “ jerk ” – and pedantically lectured the blogosphere on how to tell “ credible journalism ” from “ non-credible journalism . ”
Microsoft has spent the last couple of years trying hard to rid itself of its image as a corporate bully .
Now , it has a bully in the blogosphere .
That ’s not good .
With the Scoble case in mind , let me offer seven simple and unfashionable rules for corporate blogging .
I do n’t know how credible they are , since they reflect my own personal opinions , but I ’ll let you make that judgment .
Do n’t do it .
If you have no compelling business reason to get involved in the blogosphere , then do n’t .
While there ’s no evidence , beyond a few anecdotes , that corporate blogging leads to better business results , there are clearly risks .
If you give bloggers too much freedom , they may “ go native ” and tarnish your reputation by writing something stupid .
If you try to rein them in , you ’ll be attacked for being a dinosaur .
That ’s a lose - lose situation – the kind companies should avoid if at all possible .
And do n’t buy that nonsense about needing to have “ conversations ” with the marketplace .
That ’s an ideology , not a strategy .
Use blogs to advance your business interests .
OK , you ’ve decided to ignore my first rule .
Fine .
But do n’t get carried away .
For companies , blogging should be treated as another channel for corporate communications , with its own strengths and weaknesses .
You should use that channel to get your message out , not to give employees a sand pile for self - expression .
Yes , corporate bloggers should write with honesty and personality , but they should never forget – nor let their readers forget – that they ’re speaking on behalf of their employer .
If a corporate blogger is embarrassed to be promoting his company ’s interests in public , he should n’t be a corporate blogger .
Stick to your goals .
Maybe the goal of your blogging program is to help customers use your products more effectively .
Maybe it ’s to make your company more attractive to potential recruits .
Maybe it ’s to influence the public or lawmakers .
The important thing is to be clear about your objectives , to stick to them and , as with any corporate program , to routinely evaluate how well you ’re meeting them .
If blogging is n’t working , then change what you ’re doing ( or who ’s doing it ) .
If it still is n’t working , then stop it .
Choose your bloggers wisely .
Blogging is a hot medium .
The people who blog for your company should be ones who can keep their cool – and who are n’t likely to fall in love with their own words .
Often , the people who most want to be allowed to blog are precisely the ones who should n’t be allowed to blog .
Assign blogging buddies .
You need to trust your bloggers , not censor them .
On the other hand , blogging makes publishing so simple that having some kind of circuit breaker can make a lot of sense .
Think about requiring each of your corporate bloggers to have a blogging buddy – a colleague who reads each post before it ’s published .
All boggers have had the experience of hitting the “ publish ” button too soon – and then regretting it .
A second set of eyes will solve most problems before they even happen .
And your bloggers will thank you for that ( after , perhaps , some initial whining ) .
Be wary of allowing comments .
Most people who comment on other people ’s blogs are smart and insightful .
But “ most ” is n’t “ all . ”
In addition to being a spam - magnet , blog comments can be nasty , obscene , and offensive .
This can lead to another lose - lose situation :
If you do n’t censor comments , you ’ll end up with stuff that can embarrass your company .
If you do censor them , you ’ll be accused of , well , censorship .
In most cases , it ’s best just to turn off the comment feature from the get - go .
That may annoy the true believers , but they ’re a tiny minority anyway .
Call in the lawyers .
I hate to say it , but if you ’re allowing your employees to blog on your dime , you ’re liable for what they write .
Better safe than sued .
To sum up : People blogging on behalf of their employers do n’t need to wear suits , but they should wear clothes .
Independent bloggers can afford to blog “ naked . ” Corporate bloggers can’t .
As explained by Ms. George and documented by posters from the day , the Nazis believed thoroughly in a vicious corruption of Malthusian economics .
That is , they believed there would inevitably be shortages of food , and it should not be wasted on so - called undesirables , including mentally retarded people ( who supposedly tended to reproduce much faster than careful , prudent Aryans of good mental health ) and unemployed vagabonds , who were portrayed as weighing heavily on the shoulders of the German working man .
However , by what were described then as good , sensible Nazi economic policies , the “ unfit ” could be “ controlled ” and the available food could feed the blond gods and goddesses of the Thousand Year Reich .
( Malthus had never recommended such actions , believing natural disasters and famines would control population . )

Hadamar was closed in 1941 as a euthanasia center because of protests from a nearby Catholic bishop .
Three of his priests were beheaded for passing out copies of his sermon .
But then shortly thereafter , it was reopened for other nauseating killing purposes , one of which was to murder half - Jewish children who had one parent at a concentration camp and one at labor or at war .
The half - Jewish child would often be in a ward of some kind and would be , as Ms. George put it in Nazi terms , “ a useless eater . ”
Just like mentally ill , divorced or unemployed people , this child would be consuming resources needed for good Aryans , and thus it was scientifically sensible to give them an overdose of barbiturates and bury them at the small graveyard near the mental hospital .
The logic was simple : Fewer “ useless eaters , ” more food for the Reich .
Exhausted forced laborers from Russia and the Balkan states were killed there for the same reasons .
( There are two Star of David gravestones in the cemetery and the doors are kept locked to prevent vandalism by neo -Nazis . )
As I thought about this horror show and walked among the markers , I wondered if we in America were unintentionally following any similarly sickeningly mistaken ideas .
Is there some Thomas Malthus in our economics policy - making world who is proposing seemingly scientific theories that will eventually be misused to take innocent life ?

Do n't give in to feature demands !
The more successful the product or service is , the stronger the pressure to give in to user requests .
The more users you have , the more diverse the requests .
One user 's must - have - or - else feature is another user 's deal - killer .
And the more popular your product or service is , the more those requests start turning into demands and ultimatums , and finally very harsh criticisms .
The worst thing we can do is give in .
But as the requests / demands and criticisms become louder and angrier , the harder it is to resist the siren call -- " But if we just added this one thing ... these guys would ease up . "
But when we 've blended all the colors into one muddy blob , then nobody hates us , and nobody is delighted , excited , or turned on by what we do .
We become mediocre .
Usually the worst place to be .
But we can't just ignore the suggestions , requests , and criticism .
So how do we filter the useful feedback from the crap ?
How do we know who we should listen to ?
Let 's say that most of the people who might make feature requests or demands fall into one of these categories :
1 ) The Active Haters
Those who hate you no matter what you do .
The more popular you become , the louder they become .
2) The Extreme Critic
Those for whom " hate " is too strong a word , but they have a mile - long list of things you 're doing wrong .
3 ) The Against - My - Will User
Those who are forced to use your product or service , but are n't happy about it .
Maybe you 're the only one in your category , or their employer or client made the decision -- whatever the reason , they do n't like it .
4 ) The Previously Satisfied , Now Overwhelmed User
Those who were satisfied once , but have now become unhappy because of updates and changes in the product .
They just want to go back to the way things were !
They could not care less how much more productive / creative / stimulated they could be if they embraced the changes .
They worked hard to cross the " suck threshold " , and they do n't want to go back .
5 ) The Previously Satisfied , Now Impatient User
These folks are unhappy for the opposite reason as the Now Overwhelmed User .
They 're pissed off that your updates and changes have n't kept up with their requests which have recently turned into demands .
They 're the most likely to go elsewhere without much warning , because they feel they 've outgrown you or that you just do n't care .
[ Or just do n't care about them . ]
6 ) The Previously Passionate , Now Pissed Off User
Ahhhh ... the most interesting users of all .
They were your biggest fans , but You Just Would n't Listen to them and now they 're threatening to go elsewhere , passionately , but they 're giving you plenty of notice .
They want to regain that spark they once felt , but the original bond only goes so far .
7 ) The Still Satisfied User
Whether they 're too new to know what else they might want , or you 've simply met all their expectations and requirements , these users are humming along without problems .
8 ) The Still Passionate User
Our favorites .
They 're thrilled with what your product or service lets them do .
But ... this does n't mean they do n't have requests .
They can be passionate without necessarily being satisfied , but they 'll do everything they can to help you improve .
The trouble is , we 're back to the same problem ... one passionate user 's idea of Useful Improvement is another 's Worst Mistake You Could Make Ever .
9 ) The Uncaring User
They just do n't think about your product or service .
They use it , but if something else came along that did the same thing , they might not even notice the difference .
10 ) Marketing ( and sales )
They ask for things based on research ( often dubious ) , or their own feeling / judgement about what people want , or perhaps based on feedback from sales people , etc .
11 ) Engineers / Developers / Producers with little or no user contact
They may want to put in " this really cool thing we could do " , regardless of whether anyone has asked for it .
This could be the classic " solution in search of a problem . "
12 ) Engineers / Developers / Producers in close contact with users
These are the folks that interact with the customer / clients / users on a regular basis , usually prior to and during development , with less contact after the thing is done .
13 ) Customer Service / Tech Support
Those on the front line !
The ones who are in the closest contact with users .
[ I 've probably left out some crucial category , so help me out here . ]
Now the big question is , who do we listen to ?
I 'd love for you to add your advice , but here 's a rough cut of one way to think about it :
COMPLETELY IGNORE :
* The Haters
The Haters are too irrational about you to offer any criticism you can trust .
They might have valid feedback , but if it 's valid you 'll hear the same feedback from other less - hateful users .
* The Uncaring
* Marketing ( could n't resist )
KEEP ONE EAR OPEN :
But only for new ideas , not for specific requests and criticisms ( again , if a criticism or request is really valid -- you 'll hear about it from many others )
* The Extreme Critic
* The Against - My - Will user
* Engineers / developers with little or no user contact
Just because you can do something " really cool " , does n't mean you should .
LISTEN ...
... but resist the pressure to give in until you 've considered all the long - term implications to all the OTHER user groups :
* Previously Satisfied , Now Overwhelmed
I think we 're often better off trying to train them -- to help them get up to speed on the new stuff without having to suck again .
* Still Satisfied
Their suggestions are n't coming from real motivation , but they might have a good idea ...
* Marketing
( Unless you really REALLY know and trust that your marketing people deeply understand both the product and the users .
Too often , they just want to make something more " sellable " , regardless of the big picture . )
* Still Passionate
These are often the most difficult to resist !
But they may ask for things that nobody needs , just because -- like engineering -- it would be cool .
PAY ATTENTION :
That still does n't mean you 'll give in , but feedback from these users should be given a lot of weight .
* Previously Satisfied , Now Impatient
These are the people who are on the verge of becoming passionate users , if you can keep up with them !
One problem is that they may want to push you into territory that is out of your niche , and if you please them by adding advanced features , you have to make sure you do n't create new " Now Overwhelmed " users as a result .
But anytime we can add advanced features without hurting the low - lever users ( who may stay that way forever once they have the basics down ) , we should consider it .
If we want users to be passionate , we have to give them new challenges -- new ways to learn and grow and apply their new skills and knowledge .
Another option is to create a separate more advanced product -- like Apple 's three different music apps ( when you outgrow Garage Band you go to Logic Express .
When you outgrow Logic Express , you go to Logic , etc . )
* The Previously Passionate , Now Pissed Off User
It took a LOT to piss them off , because they 've been extra forgiving and willing to overlook your faults , but only to a point .
They know your product better than anyone else .
One problem with these guys is that they tend to be so advanced that they do n't necessarily reflect your average user .
If you can find a way to work with them ( and they desperately WANT you to succeed and win them back ) , and perhaps compromise , they 'll be your biggest champions again .
At the very least , we should tell them that we 've listened carefully , and here 's why we 're having trouble adding or changing this thing ... they might even have an answer we had n't thought of .
And at least we 've given them the respect they deserve .
* Engineering / Developers in close contact with users
They 're close to the product , they understand how it 's being used .
Best of all , they might know the best 80/20 way ( most bang for the development buck ? ) to do the smallest thing that 'll have a positive impact .
They are the best source of ideas for compromise without hurting existing capabilities .
( But I 've spent enough time as a member of this group to know that we can't help ourselves from " adding this one cool thing " that we know " will take no time at all . "
So challenge our assumptions . )
PAY THEM FOR THEIR FEEDBACK :
* Customer service / tech support
Nobody knows where the pain is the way the front line does , and they can probably get very specific about the exact source of that pain , which lets you do a more surgical fix rather than a sweeping change .
But one question ... why -- in so many companies -- are these the people who often get the least amount of respect and voice about this ?
* You
The one user category I did n't mention .
In the end , we have to trust ourselves .
This is a controversial position -- we 're not supposed to be building things for us ... it 's not about us .
But that does n't mean we are n't the ones who can make the best overall decisions .
We 're the ONLY ones who get all the feedback and can think through the long - term implications , and can see how pleasing one user group might piss off another group , so which group do we choose ?
If you have a product or service or cause where you " eat your own dog food " , then you 're in at least as good a position as any user to know what 's broken and what will break if you listen to this request .
So , we have to listen but resist .
The overwhelming pull of that right ( hate ) side slides you closer and closer to the middle .
Those who hate it will hate it until you 've neutered it into submission and taken away the magic some once loved .
Be brave ; )

Nintendo has grasped two important notions that have eluded its competitors .
The first is , Do n't listen to your customers .
The hard - core gaming community is extremely vocal -- they blog a lot -- but if Nintendo kept listening to them , hard - core gamers would be the only audience it ever had .
" [ Wii ] was unimaginable for them , " Iwata says .
" And because it was unimaginable , they could not say that they wanted it .
If you are simply listening to requests from the customer , you can satisfy their needs , but you can never surprise them .
Sony and Microsoft make daily - necessity kinds of things .
They have to listen to the needs of the customers and try to comply with their requests .
That kind of approach has been deeply ingrained in their minds . "

You forgot the previously passionate , now purely habitual ( " meh " ) user .
This guy is another one you have to listen to .
What made him lose his passion ?
Anyone whose attitude has changed for the worse will be worth getting input from .
And they might value being given the opportunity to voice their criticisms .
Everybody wants to be heard , after all !

I really like this article , though I wonder about that first statement .
" The more successful the product or service is , the stronger the pressure to give in to user requests . "
It seems in my own experience that the less successful a product or service is , the more pressure I feel to try to meet the demands of the user .
Just a thought .
Posted by : Paul | May 11 , 2006 6:43:56 AM
Kathy ,
I think its also important to have a philosophy , or a set a guiding principles behind ones product .
To give an example of what I mean , I ’m working on a web product that has built in very hierarchical constraints on how information can be accessed .
If I was building the same product my guiding principles would be oriented towards facilitating information sharing .
Feature creep is the opposite of the guiding principle of simplicity .
One has to keep an open mind – we do n’t know in advance how our users are going to use our products – but a sense of what the core values are behind the product gives the product continuity .
It helps filter out the requests that are not in the right spirit of the product and helps suggestions that are shine through .

Just last week I was having a conversation with a co-worker about technology , and how we wished we had more choices of things that just work , with their default settings , right out of the box .
No fuss , no silliness .
All too often , we get forced into upgrading to versions with too many bells and whistles , which just get in our way .
But , that need for default simplicity does n't preclude the product from having an " advanced mode " , which would allow expert users to configure things to their heart 's desire .
You do n't like green ?
Fine , make it orange .
Do n't like Windows XP 's default cartoonish look ?
Switch it back to the " Classic Start Menu " , for the Windows 2000 look .
The " emacs " editor in UNIX allows you to select between five different levels of expertise right up front .
My first experience with this kind of flexibility was way back in the 1980's , when I first encountered DBase III and its all - powerful " dot prompt " .
In fact , being able to switch painlessly between different modes or " skins " characterizes all of the products I feel most passionate about .

The Event Horizon of feature creep .. after a certain point , you and everyone else just KNOWS that something needs to be implemented .
So good design skills would be recognizing critical features before you cross the event horizon and you look like you 've gotten egg all over your face . :)
Also , I just can't deal with it unless it 's in fuschia .

When I read your post I see 37 Signals and BaseCamp written all over it , and it turns me completely off to your message .
The problem is 37 Signals markets BaseCamp as the ultimate project management system for everyone , but then actively denies adding features that are essential in use cases other than those needed by a web development firm .
So , if a company is going to piss off the " blue , " " pink , " and " orange " users they should at least make sure they market the product specifically targeting to " green " users and not try to sell it to everyone .
Posted by : Mike Schinkel | May 11 , 2006 11:48:14 AM
" but then actively denies adding features that are essential in use cases other than those needed by a web development firm . "
Essential * to you * which is exactly Kathy 's point .
Everyone has their own set of " essential " features .
If everyone 's essentials were plugged in to make everyone individually happy then no one would be happy .
Basecamp does n't have any features specific to any one industry .
There 's no web design features , there 's no publisher features , there 's no professor / teacher features , there 's no architect features .
There are just general , simple tools that apply to everyone : messages , to - do lists , simple scheduling , and file sharing .

" Ignore the uncaring ?

I see your point really well , but you then have to go a step further , and ask where the critical mass of apathy lies , do n't you ?
There 's always going to be a section of your userbase that drifts with the winds .
How much is too much ?
Moreso , should you be concerned if there - is n't - anyone who does n't care one way or the other ?
Some sort of success barometer based entirely upon user apathy ?

I been an avid reader for a while .
But , how much of the above post is from the writer 's experience and how much of it is his / her 's hunch ?
The post makes broad , sweeping and attention - grabing conclusions , which without experience is far far less useful than it could be .
thanks

You guys have a lot of great comments -- thanks .
Karyn : " You forgot the previously passionate , now purely habitual ( " meh " ) user .
This guy is another one you have to listen to .
What made him lose his passion ? "
Agreed !
Paul : " It seems in my own experience that the less successful a product or service is , the more pressure I feel to try to meet the demands of the user . "
That 's true , but what I meant by that was that the more successful it is , the more * external * pressure you get .
I should have specified that , because you 're right -- in the beginning there 's more internal pressure to make the ( fewer ) users happy ( and attract new ones ) .
Mad William : " If a user is near - totally ambivalent about your solution as compared with someone else 's , does n't that tell you a great deal about your product ? "
That makes sense ...
I had n't thought about it like that .
Daniel : Yep --
I tend to revisit my favorite topics a lot , although I try to add a slightly new perspective to it .
But I 'm impressed if you remember my old posts better than I do .
Ram :
I 've personally seen it from just about any perspective , and dealt with each of the groups I named .
As a software developer ( everything from in - house business apps to public games ) , I 've fielded requests and demands from existing users , managers , external clients , marketing , and engineers on other parts of the system .
But , I 've also seen the same problems with our books ( although that 's just as often about what to remove / tone - down as it is about what to add ) , and the internal and public training I used to do ( client wants 20 topics in a time that 's appropriate to cover 10 , everyone has different ideas about what those 10 should be , etc. ) .
I 'm not sure what you meant by attention - grabbing conclusions ...
I think just about all of us who are in this situation struggle with the same things ( demands to change our products ) , and the point of this post for me is to start playing with ways to organize those requests / demands .
We 've got more than a quarter - million readers of our books right now , and that represents a staggering amount of feedback -- there has to be a better way to filter it and apply different " weights " to different users , while still listening for ideas that make sense .
And all too often , those who make the most noise often ARE the ones we should pay the least attention to .
But I reckon it 's always dangerous when you try to figure out who and what to ignore , since getting that wrong carries a big penalty .
Anyway , I 'd consider this post an " alpha " -- my first cut at identifying / classifying / filtering requests .
I never suggested that I 've gotten this right , which is why I 'm so grateful for the readers who offer ways to make it better .
If you 've got specific ideas , Ram , I 'd love to hear them .

I must say I really enjoyed this post .
As the product director of MyPhotoAlbum I really love all our members .
We have the philosophy that it ’s our members that have made us successful so it's hard not to try to solve every problem , change everything that people ask .
Our team is very personally invested in what we do , and because of that , sometimes , criticisms hurt .
After all it is our baby .
Many of your comments were right on point .
If only you could please all of the people all of the time .
I think that sometimes users forget that we want you to like it , use it , tell other 's how great it is .
But everyone 's definition of that GREAT is ... unfortunately .... different .
But I guess that 's what makes working in the Internet business so fun .
Keep the great post 's coming .

Since you added " Engineers / Developers / Producers with little or no user contact " , " Marketing / Sales " and " Customer Service / Tech Support " as categories , you are missing one other :
" Quality Assurance / Documentation "
These folks usually come in after a feature has been implimented to meet the customers demand and sometimes have no contact with the client yet believe that a feature either goes too far or not far enough .
They definately belong in the " LISTEN ... " group .
Since QA 's job is usually to break the program rather than actually use it , feature requests sometimes arise from lack of understanding of the use of the product in a real world senerio .
Though sometimes feedback from another view close to the code is helpful .

I think it 's a fundamental mistake to filter feature requests based on who they 're coming from .
Even people who will completely hate your product no matter what you do can still offer useful insights into improvements .

Kathy , what an awesome post .
I have blogged about it as consider it to be ESSENTIAL reading for any Web 2.0 marketeer looking to engage the community more and realising it is not as easy as it sounds !
One thing that cannot be underestimated is the value in those customers that complain .
People rarely call to say " thanks for your wonderful service or extremely practical vacuum cleaner bags " .
People more often call with complaints which , given the effort and passion ( read : anger ! ) required to be bothered to call / write / email means that the complaint is significant .
The customer in this instance is aleady helping us by letting us know what the worst parts of our product or service is and shoudl be treated better than most .
I often say that the sign of a good company is how it resloves its mistakes and we can only learn from the complainants .

Apple is n't just breaking Norwegian consumer law - it 's breaking promises Steve Jobs once made about digital music , the country 's consumer watchdog says .
Torgeir Waterhouse , senior advisor to the Norwegian Consumer Council , chivvied the private sector for its myopic approach to digital music .
" The digitalisation of culture and other consumer products is simply too important to be dictated by the industry , " he told The Register .
In June , the country 's consumer ombudsman , whose decisions are legally binding , ruled that the digital rights management scheme used in Apple 's iTunes Music Store was breaking section 9a of the Norwegian Marketing Control Act .
The ombudsman also ruled that aspects of Apple 's terms and conditions were also illegal , and pointed out that it attempted to put Norwegians under an English legal contract .
The ombudsman asked Apple to respond by 31 July , but now it has , it falls short in crucial areas .
Waterhouse told us that while some progress had been made , Apple 's response fell short on the crucial area of DRM .
" They do not even try to come close to lift the lock - in between iTunes Music Store and the iPod .
" It seems clear to us that iTunes intend to continue their unfair practice of using the DRM as lock - in technology under the cover being [ a ] copy - protection only scheme . "
And he 's been through the press clippings .
" The position they 're signaling now is the direct opposite of the consumer - friendly attitude Steve Jobs put forward in 2002 , when he told MacWorld that " if you legally acquire music , you need to have the right to manage it on all other devices that you own " .
That was only a few months after the iPod was launched - when it still looked like an expensive flop - and a year before Apple launched the iTunes Music Store in the US .
Waterhouse also noted the rise of eMusic , which sells songs without DRM , to number two spot in the market .
eMusic , which is owned by the same company that owns digital music wholesaler The Orchard , must source its inventory from independents , as the major labels refuse to deliver digital music without DRM .
There has been progress on altering the terms of service , he notes .
Apple has promised not to implement changes to the terms of service retrospectively to music a consumer had already purchased , will make changes more visible , and has acknowledged the jurisdiction of Norwegian law .
Waterhouse expressed his desire that all digital download ventures focus on " a joint responsibility for creating a well functioning digital society " .
The Norwegian Consumer Council wants further progress on the terms of service and says it does n't expect the DRM issue to be resolved soon .
" Obviously there 'll be a lot of work on the DRM issue which clearly is the area where iTunes Music Store is most reluctant to offer the consumers a fair deal . " ®
After Anna Wintour showed her support of Roger Federer in his bid to win the US Open , Roger returned the favour by attending New York Fashion Week with the Vogue Editor in Chief .
Federer and his girlfriend Mirka Vavrineck sat between Wintour at the Oscar de la Renta Spring 2007 show .
“ He watched open - mouthed in the front row , clearly digging the show , and produced a huge grin when a model stopped in her tracks to present him with a bouquet of roses , ” according to the FWD .
Federer seemed to be on such good terms with Wintour that she supposedly greeted him with a hug and a pat on the back .
The pair looked quite sharp with Wintour wearing a black and white Oscar de la Renta dress , while the Swiss tennis World Number 1 traded his tennis whites for a navy suit and shirt .
As for what happened on the catwalk , well de la Renta did what he does best , make women look beautiful .
The dresses were ladylike and classic , with floral patterns and embroidery and accessorized with Lucite necklaces .
At 72 years old the master of style and class seems like he will be doing this forever and has dressed some of the worldâ€™s most glamourous women , including Jackie Kennedy Onassis .
With large beehive hair and Sixties shades it the show had a few Jackie O moments .
Artwork : Chip Taylor IBM 's first PC , announced on August 12 , 1981 , was far from the first personal computer -- but when it arrived , there was near - universal agreement that it was likely to be a landmark machine .
It was .
And 25 years later , it still ranks among the most significant computers ever .
Like the IBM Personal Computer , Model 5150 , the greatest systems have always had ambitions to boldly go where no computer has gone before .
Without these innovative machines , the PC revolution would have been a lot less ... well , revolutionary .
So we decided to celebrate the IBM PC's 25th birthday by identifying the 25 PCs that have mattered most -- from any manufacturer , and from any era .
No single characteristic makes a computer great .
But we managed to boil down an array of winning qualities into four factors , all of which happen to begin with the letter I .
Innovation : Did the PC do anything that was genuinely new ?
Did it incorporate the latest technology ?
Did the PC do anything that was genuinely new ?
Did it incorporate the latest technology ?
Impact : Was it widely imitated ?
Did it become part of the cultural zeitgeist ?
Was it widely imitated ?
Did it become part of the cultural zeitgeist ?
Industrial design : Was it a looker ?
Did it have clever features that made using it a pleasure ?
Was it a looker ?
Did it have clever features that made using it a pleasure ?
Intangibles :
Was there anything else about it that set it apart from the same ol ' same ol ' ?
Armed with this scale , we considered dozens of PCs -- which meant that we also had to consider the question " What is a PC , exactly ? "
Ultimately we decided that a PC is anything that 's recognizably a desktop or portable computer in design -- or , alternatively , anything that runs an operating system originally created for desktops and laptops .
After a lot of nostalgic debate , we selected our winners .
Which systems we picked -- and did n't pick -- for our Top 25 may be controversial .
If one of your favorites did n't make our roster , check out our list of 25 near - great PCs .
Just to drum up a little suspense , we 'll reveal the Top 25 starting with number 25 , and then work our way backward to the single greatest PC of all time .
( Spoilsports can skip ahead to number 1 ; we wo n't be any the wiser .
You can also jump to the complete list of our Top 25 picks . )
Ready ?
Ah , so this is what you get when you take a hardware platform " open- source " -- the Neuros OSD .
This infinitely hackable Linux - based media recorder / player beta unit is on sale now .
Yeah , beta , ' cause this ain't no ordinary hardware offering .
See Neuros is willing to pay you cash - money " bounties " to code new features into the open source firmware : YouTube or Google video ( $ 1000 ) , Flickr photo browsing ( $ 600 ) , wireless remote capabilities from a WiFi handheld device such as a PDA ( $ 500 ) , TiVo - style radio recording when connected to an FM / AM or satellite receiver ( $ 700 ) , and VoIP capabilities when a USB phone is connected ( $ 500 ) .
Not bad for something you 'll likely do for the fun of it anyway right ?
Out of the box , you get a standalone media player which can record from any external analog audio / video source and then automatically encode it for playback on PSPs , mobile phones , and iPods in popular formats such as MPEG - 4 , AVI , ASF , MP3 , OGG , WMA , and AC3 .
And with a dual - core ARM9 / TI DSP , multi-card memory slot , USB host capability , Ethernet , recording up to 720x480 resolution at 30 fps , IR Blaster , and S - Video in and Composite audio / video in / out , well , you still might be tempted to plunk down the meager $ 230 to take this baby home .
Hurry though , only 200 beta units left !

Better water supplies are linked to rise in hungry children in Ethiopia .
On tap : a shorter trip to get water boosted the birth rate in Ethiopian villages .
© WHO
Improving access to clean water can cause unexpected health problems , suggests a study in Ethiopia .
Cutting down a woman 's long trek to get water can boost her fertility .
But bumping up birth rates worsens childhood malnutrition overall .
It is widely accepted that a cleaner water supply will enhance the health of those in developing countries .
But few studies have tested how such installations affect a village as a whole .
Two UK researchers examined what happened after water taps were plumbed into several rural villages in southern Ethiopia between 1996 and 2000 .
They gathered information on children 's births and deaths before and after the water supply arrived , and compared the data to that collected from settlements without a new tap .
Weighed down
As they expected , the taps slashed the death rate among children by half , at least partly because they cut infectious diseases spread in dirty water .
More surprisingly , the pair found that women were , each month , three times more likely to give birth in the years after the tap was introduced .
Mhairi Gibson of the University of Bristol and Ruth Mace of University College London , both in the UK , report their findings in Public Library of Science Medicine1 .
The increase in birth rate did not seem to be explained by factors such as changes in the women's age , overall health or prosperity .
The researchers suggest that the women 's fertility may have soared because they had stopped burning up energy trekking to and from distant water supplies .
The women had previously spent up to six hours per day fetching water in extremely heavy clay pots .
" I could barely lift an empty one , " Gibson says .
The women 's fertility may have been partly dampened by this strenuous exercise , says Gibson , much as athletes often experience a drop in fertility from excessive training .
When the women had to walk only 15 minutes to a village tap , their fertility shot up .
More mouths to feed
This boost in birth rate takes a toll on children 's health .
The investigators found that kids were more likely to be malnourished , based on their height and weight , in villages with taps than in those without .
This could be simply because families are sharing their scarce food between more children .
Or perhaps low birth - weight babies , who previously would not have survived the trauma of birth , are now surviving but not thriving .
ADVERTISEMENT
The higher birth rate might help explain why rural Africa 's population continues to spiral upwards despite slowly improving living and health conditions , Gibson says .
It contrasts with the rapid drop in birth rates seen in developed countries as economic conditions improve and family planning becomes more widely used .
Gibson says that aid agencies and other organizations that promote access to clean water may overlook the effects on birth rate .
She argues that new taps , or other development schemes , should ideally occur in parallel with increased access to contraception and child healthcare .
" It 's something these organizations have n't really looked at , " Gibson says .

Who Runs Wikipedia ?
During Wikimania , I gave a short talk proposing some new features for Wikipedia .
The audience , which consisted mostly of programmers and other high - level Wikipedians , immediately begun suggesting problems with the idea .
“ Wo n’t bad thing X happen ? ” “ How will you prevent Y ? ” “ Do you really think people are going to do Z ? ”
For a while I tried to answer them , explaining technical ways to fix the problem , but after a couple rounds I finally said :
Stop .
If I had come here five years ago and told you I was going to make an entire encyclopedia by putting up a bunch of web pages that anyone could edit , you would have been able to raise a thousand objections :
It will get filled with vandalism !
The content will be unreliable !
No one will do that work for free !
And you would have been right to .
These were completely reasonable expectations at the time .
But here ’s the funny thing : it worked anyway .
At the time , I was just happy this quieted them down .
But later I started thinking more about it .
Why did Wikipedia work anyway ?
It was n’t because its programmers were so far - sighted that the software solved all the problems .
And it was n’t because the people running it put clear rules in place to prevent misbehavior .
We know this because when Wikipedia started it did n’t have any programmers ( it used off - the - shelf wiki software ) and it did n’t have clear rules ( one of the first major rules was apparently Ignore all rules ) .
No , the reason Wikipedia works is because of the community , a group of people that took the project as their own and threw themselves into making it succeed .
People are constantly trying to vandalize Wikipedia , replacing articles with random text .
It does n’t work ; their edits are undone within minutes , even seconds .
But why ?
It ’s not magic — it ’s a bunch of incredibly dedicated people who sit at their computers watching every change that gets made .
These days they call themselves the “ recent changes patrol ” and have special software that makes it easy to undo bad changes and block malicious users with a couple clicks .
Why does anyone do such a thing ?
It ’s not particularly fascinating work , they ’re not being paid to do it , and nobody in charge asked them to volunteer .
They do it because they care about the site enough to feel responsible .
They get upset when someone tries to mess it up .
It ’s hard to imagine anyone feeling this way about Britannica .
There are people who love that encyclopedia , but have any of them shown up at their offices offering to help out ?
It ’s hard even to imagine .
Average people just do n’t feel responsible for Britannica ; there are professionals to do that .
Everybody knows Wikipedia as the site anyone can edit .
The article about tree frogs was n’t written because someone in charge decided they needed one and assigned it to someone ; it was written because someone , somewhere just went ahead and started writing it .
And a chorus of others decided to help out .
But what ’s less well - known is that it ’s also the site that anyone can run .
The vandals are n’t stopped because someone is in charge of stopping them ; it was simply something people started doing .
And it ’s not just vandalism : a “ welcoming committee ” says hi to every new user , a “ cleanup taskforce ” goes around doing factchecking .
The site ’s rules are made by rough consensus .
Even the servers are largely run this way — a group of volunteer sysadmins hang out on IRC , keeping an eye on things .
Until quite recently , the Foundation that supposedly runs Wikipedia had no actual employees .
This is so unusual , we do n’t even have a word for it .
It ’s tempting to say “ democracy ” , but that ’s woefully inadequate .
Wikipedia does n’t hold a vote and elect someone to be in charge of vandal - fighting .
Indeed , “ Wikipedia ” does n’t do anything at all .
Someone simply sees that there are vandals to be fought and steps up to do the job .
This is so radically different that it ’s tempting to see it as a mistake :
Sure , perhaps things have worked so far on this model , but when the real problems hit , things are going to have to change : certain people must have clear authority , important tasks must be carefully assigned , everyone else must understand that they are simply volunteers .
But Wikipedia ’s openness is n’t a mistake ; it ’s the source of its success .
A dedicated community solves problems that official leaders would n’t even know were there .
Meanwhile , their volunteerism largely eliminates infighting about who gets to be what .
Instead , tasks get done by the people who genuinely want to do them , who just happen to be the people who care enough to do them right .
Wikipedia ’s biggest problems have come when it ’s strayed from this path , when it ’s given some people official titles and specified tasks .
Whenever that happens , real work slows down and squabbling speeds up .
But it ’s an easy mistake to make , so it gets made again and again .
Of course , that ’s not the only reason this mistake is made , it ’s just the most polite .
The more frightening problem is that people love to get power and hate to give it up .
Especially with a project as big and important as Wikipedia , with the constant swarm of praise and attention , it takes tremendous strength to turn down the opportunity to be its official X , to say instead “ it ’s a community project , I ’m just another community member ” .
Indeed , the opposite is far more common .
People who have poured vast amounts of time into the project begin to feel they should be getting something in return .
They insist that , with all their work , they deserve an official job or a special title .
After all , wo n’t clearly assigning tasks be better for everyone ?
And so , the trend is clear : more power , more people , more problems .
It ’s not just a series of mistakes , it ’s the tendency of the system .
It would be absurd for me to say that I ’m immune to such pressures .
After all , I ’m currently running for a seat on the Wikimedia Board .
But I also lie awake at night worrying that I might abuse my power .
A systemic tendency like this is not going to be solved by electing the right person to the right place and then going to back to sleep while they solve the problem .
If the community wants to remain in charge , it ’s going to have to fight for it .
I ’m writing these essays to help people understand that this is something worth fighting for .
And if I ’m elected to the Board , I plan to keep on writing .
Just as Wikipedia ’s success as an encyclopedia requires a world of volunteers to write it , Wikipedia ’s success as an organization requires the community of volunteers to run it .
On the one hand , this means opening up the Board ’s inner workings for the community to see and get involved in .
But it also means opening up the actions of the community so the wider world can get involved .
Whoever wins this next election , I hope we all take on this task .

In Humanizing Peer Reviews , Karl Wiegers starts with a powerful pronouncement :
Peer review – an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverable examine it for defects and improvement opportunities – is one of the most powerful software quality tools available .
Peer review methods include inspections , walkthroughs , peer deskchecks , and other similar activities .
After experiencing the benefits of peer reviews for nearly fifteen years , I would never work in a team that did not perform them .
After participating in code reviews for a while here at Vertigo , I believe that peer code reviews are the single biggest thing you can do to improve your code .
If you 're not doing code reviews right now with another developer , you 're missing a lot of bugs in your code and cheating yourself out of some key professional development opportunities .
As far as I 'm concerned , my code is n't done until I 've gone over it with a fellow developer .
But do n't take my word for it .
McConnell provides plenty of evidence for the efficacy of code reviews in Code Complete :
… software testing alone has limited effectiveness – the average defect detection rate is only 25 percent for unit testing , 35 percent for function testing , and 45 percent for integration testing .
In contrast , the average effectiveness of design and code inspections are 55 and 60 percent .
Case studies of review results have been impressive :
In a software - maintenance organization , 55 percent of one - line maintenance changes were in error before code reviews were introduced .
After reviews were introduced , only 2 percent of the changes were in error .
When all changes were considered , 95 percent were correct the first time after reviews were introduced .
Before reviews were introduced , under 20 percent were correct the first time .
In a group of 11 programs developed by the same group of people , the first 5 were developed without reviews .
The remaining 6 were developed with reviews .
After all the programs were released to production , the first 5 had an average of 4.5 errors per 100 lines of code .
The 6 that had been inspected had an average of only 0.82 errors per 100 .
Reviews cut the errors by over 80 percent .
The Aetna Insurance Company found 82 percent of the errors in a program by using inspections and was able to decrease its development resources by 20 percent .
IBM 's 500,000 line Orbit project used 11 levels of inspections .
It was delivered early and had only about 1 percent of the errors that would normally be expected .
A study of an organization at AT&T with more than 200 people reported a 14 percent increase in productivity and a 90 percent decrease in defects after the organization introduced reviews .
Jet Propulsion Laboratories estimates that it saves about $ 25,000 per inspection by finding and fixing defects at an early stage .
The only hurdle to a code review is finding a developer you respect to do it , and making the time to perform the review .
Once you get started , I think you 'll quickly find that every minute you spend in a code review is paid back tenfold .
If your organization is new to code reviews , I highly recommend Karl 's book , Peer Reviews in Software : A Practical Guide .
The sample chapters Karl provides on his website are a great primer , too .
The House yesterday passed legislation that would require voters to show a valid photo identification in federal elections over the overwhelming objections of Democrats who compared the bill to segregation - era measures aimed at disenfranchising Southern blacks .
The Federal Election Integrity Act was approved on a nearly party - line 228-196 vote .
Republicans backed the bill 224 - 3 , with three nonvoters ; Democrats opposed it 192 - 4 , with five nonvoters .
They were joined in opposition by the House ’s one independent member .
The bill , which faces an uncertain future in the Senate , is part of a Republican effort to complete before the November elections a package of proposals aimed at curbing illegal immigration and its effects on ordinary Americans .
The so - called “ Voter ID ” bill , aimed at stamping out voter fraud , would require voters in federal elections to provide picture identification by 2008 and provide proof of U.S. citizenship by 2010 .
It was among the recommendations made last year by the bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform , headed by former President Jimmy Carter , a Democrat , and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III , a Republican .
“ Effective voter registration and voter identification are bedrocks of a modern election system , ” they wrote in their final report .
But Democrats , siding with groups that work on behalf of minorities and illegal aliens , called the bill a “ modern - day poll tax ” and said it would place an insurmountable burden on voters and infringe upon their voting rights .
Rep. Brian Bilbray , California Republican , countered that the real infringement upon voting rights would be allowing fraudulent votes by the dead or illegal “ to cancel out legitimate votes . ”
“ That is the violation of the Voters Rights Act that we have not addressed , ” he told colleagues before the vote .
Democrats , who have long demanded reforms to the federal voting process , yesterday dismissed Republican concerns about voter fraud .
“ Show me the examples of the problem you ’re trying to solve , ” demanded Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer , Maryland Democrat who accused Republicans of trying to appeal to the “ fear and — yes , perhaps — the prejudices of people . ”
A Republican cited a study by Johns Hopkins University that found 1,500 dead people who had voted in recent elections .
Mr. Hoyer belittled the study , saying no criminal convictions for voter fraud had been won in any of those cases .
Mr. Bilbray pointed out that such convictions might be obtained if proper identification were required .
“ Voter fraud is not something you can come back to after the fraud is committed , ” he said .
“ The person who voted for those dead people is long gone by the time it comes up on the record . ”
Rep. Ginny Brown - Waite , Florida Republican , urged support of the bill because , she said , it would prevent illegal aliens from voting in U.S. elections .
“ It ’s outrageous and inexcusable that voters do not have to show proof of citizenship in order to vote in an election , ” she said .
“ Illegal immigrants are populating this country at an unprecedented number , and it is unjust and unfair to citizens of this country that noncitizens should have a hand in electing federal officials . ”
Rep. Alcee L. Hastings , Florida Democrat , said he ’s more concerned about discouraging voters than he is about illegals voting .
“ Nonparticipation in the election process is more of a problem in this country than noncitizens trying to vote , ” Mr. Hastings said .
Rep. John Lewis , Georgia Democrat , called the bill a “ modern - day poll tax ” and charged that the bill “ is nothing less than voter suppression . ”
He also reminded the Republican chamber of its overwhelming support in July for renewing the Voting Rights Act , although many conservatives off Capitol Hill warned that portions of it are no longer necessary .
“ Just three months ago , this body passed the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , admitting the sad fact that voter discrimination is still the reality , ” said Mr. Lewis , who said requiring identification at the polls is “ an attack on the voting rights of millions of Americans . ”
Across the Capitol in the Senate , Democrats continued to slow - walk legislation approved by the House last week to construct 700 miles of fencing along the U.S. - Mexico border .
The chamber voted yesterday 94 - 0 on a procedural motion to take up the bill .

Level Term Life Insurance
What is level term life insurance ?
As the name implies , the amount of death benefit protection you buy stays the same ( level ) for the entire term of the policy - usually 10 , 20 , or 30 years .
For example , if in July 2020 you purchase a 10 year level term life insurance policy with a death benefit of $ 500,000 , and if you die any time before July 2030 , your beneficiary or beneficiaries will be paid the entire amount of the policy - in this case , half a million dollars .
This type of policy is unlike decreasing term insurance , in which the death benefit decreases over the policy term period .
This type of policy is often used as mortgage life insurance , and we do not recommend it .
It is best to get a regular level term life insurance if you want mortgage life insurance protection .
Why obtain level term insurance ?
This type of life insurance is the most affordable type you can buy , and most often is the best for most situations .
Here are some examples of the costs of term life insurance :
A 40 year old male in good health , non-smoker , can get a $ 300,000 , 30 year term policy for as little as $ 35 per month .
If he happens to be a smoker , he will pay an extra $ 90 per month .
A 30 year old woman , smoker , can get a 20 year term , $ 200,000 policy for about $ 25 to $ 30 per month .
A 30 year term for $ 35 to $ 45 per month .

While chatting online today , Tay mentioned something about inspiration .
A lot of people love to be inspired .
After all , nothing pumps more energy into your youthful ambitious bloodstream than the words of a " successful " achiever in your field .
You can see what the pro has accomplished and as a rising star you want to get there faster and shine brighter .
Or maybe you 're not the alpha - male type .
You just want to encapsulate yourself in the glowing warmth of inspiration and ascend towards the apex with a Buddhist sense of omniscient calm .
After all , if they did it , so can you !
And they said that repeatedly in their hour long self - realization speeches .
If you have n't figured it out yet , I do n't like to be inspired .
I 'm not saying inspiration is good or bad , just saying if given the choice , I prefer not to be inspired .
Just like wealth , hardwork , and genius , inspiration appears to be a very good measure of the potentiality of success .
Clearly a person inspired to change the world has more chance of achieving that than someone who cares not one bit and has no inspiration to leave a mark on the planet .
Just like how everyone who is rich is successful , how every person who works hard always wins , and how every genius is recognized for his or her intellect by the masses .
Right ?
No , you say ?
I guess then inspiration is n't that good of a barometer either , is it ?
Other than a momentary appreciation of self - worth and an inflated sense of personal capabilities , inspiration does n't really do much , especially in the long term .
Great , so you just watched an amazing play or read a touching autobiography .
Or you went to see a famous CEO talk about how he grew his company from his garage to over 100 countries in under five years .
Wow !
Nobody can deny that such growth is anything short of impressive .
But is it inspirational ?
Will you go home and realize " if he can do it , so can I ? ! "
Like this sarcastic Despair poster says , " If a pretty poster and a cute saying are all it takes to motivate you , you probably have a very easy job .
The kind robots will be doing soon . "
Inspiration is just motivation to dream big .
Shame on you if you did not automatically think you could turn your 5 - person company to a 500 - people multi-national and instead needed some guy to come in for an hour and teach you how to dream .
If going to a 30 - minute seminar on financial planning inspires me to change my lifestyle entirely , I 'd say I 'm ashamed of how I was spending and planning money before .
I should 've realized it on my own that I was bad with finances instead of having someone tell me I 've been wrong all my life in just half - an - hour .
What I AM in favor of , is of course , education .
If going to this financial planning seminar taught me how to better plan my retirement , more power to me .
But if I need to go to a " Retirement - Planning Info - Meet " to realize that hey , someday I 'm going to be 65 and I just might need money for food , then well , I 'm a pretty stupid person to begin with .
Most people get inspired from momentary experiences .
A speech , a book , a movie , a play .
While I love change and always welcome something small changing my entire outlook on everything , I think if an intro-book about bio -genetics is all I need to inspire me to give up computers forever and take up bio - genetics as my new career path , then wow , where was I last ten years while the Human Genome Project sequenced the DNA ?
Maybe , people will not feel the need to be inspired if they just keep their eyes open and see what 's happening every single day .
In today 's world , you only get inspired if [ a ] some amazingly major breakthrough occurs ( very very rarely ) or [ b ] you have been living in a cave for years ( most probably ) and just realized that you can draw pictures on back of business cards and actually make money selling them !
I guess I feel the need to not be inspired for two reasons .
Firstly , as I hinted above , the state of being inspired is n't very productive .
There is a state of feeling excited and ambitious that IS indeed productive .
If I realize I can connect my old and new database systems using a simple tool , I am not inspired , I 'm simply excited and well , feeling quite ambitious about accurate data migration , because now I know I can .
When I was inspired , I wanted to make the world a better place by writing an email client that worked in different Indian languages ; currently nobody I know uses this software that took me months to code .
When I was not - inspired , but rather just indifferent and in need of a small simple music player , I wrote one within days that well , just played music ; over 2 million downloads in last six years and counting .
Inspiration , big dreams , and castles in the sky have n't made me famous yet .
Creating tools that make others ' lives easy , help me though .
Secondly , and primarily , I like to dream my own dreams and I like to dream big .
You cannot quite possibly insert your dreams into my head and somehow show me that I did n't dream big enough .
That is just not possible .
I 've already thought of every single thing that I can quite possibly do as a human , rather as a super human .
I 've calculated what I need physically , mentally , and financially to climb Mt. Everest and definitely looked into forming my own Antarctic sub-station .
I 've thought about giving up everything I have so I can save the baby seals and I 've considered spending my life travelling throug the villages of India teaching young and old about computers , math , and science .
However , I 'm not rushing to start work on my online digital - life - management suite or take up International Relationships to get a seat on a UN sub - committee for Economic Development of South - East Asia .
I guess you can call me uninspired and unmotivated .
After all , I could potentially be doing any of the above yet I 'm spending my spare time filling a big hole in my backyard every day so it stops looking like the surface of Mars .
Lack of inspiration alright .
I believe short of a few physical / mental limitations , pretty much anyone can do anything .
Inspiration is basically you realizing that " HEY !
I can do it too ! "
Well guess what ?
I 've already realized that I can do anything I have my mind set on .
And so can you !
The sooner you realize that , the better it is .
Inspiration is just a stage you have to go through to come to the best part of your life - actually doing things that you really want to do !
Creating , molding , finishing .
Above all , choosing .
I choose to fix my backyard myself instead of helping cute little kitties at the pet shelter get their vaccines and medicines .
Right now , you too could be doing any particular thing from a selection of thousands of things that you have been inspired to do - writing songs , sketching meadows and hills , planning marketing campaigns to overthrow your competition , or joining a sports club .
But instead , you chose to be here and read my blog .
Why ?
Not because you 've never had the inspiration to do something bigger , better , and nobler .
But rather because given your particular situation in life , reading this ' blog entry is something you want to do .
Inspiration can only tell you what you can potentially do .
Freewill and choice is what actually determines what you do in life .
None of these inspiration - arousing speakers were talking about being inspired when they were struggling like you and I .
They did not do whatever they did solely because someone inspired them or because they wanted to change the world .
They did it and then realized , " Hey , maybe I can help inspire others to change the world like I did . "
I 'm not the one to doubt anyone 's intentions but it 's like saying , " Hey !
Now that I have completed this one particular crossword , let me give you all the words that I used so you can try to jam them into your own unique crossword puzzle and see if you can solve it . "
Then you go home all inspired because now you have words like seamlessness , fluidity , and ideation that you try to jam into every open row and column .
Not gonna work .
Get a dictionary and you 'll have every word .
The only way to win is to figure out which words you need , not which word you can force in .
In short , do n't do something because you 're blindly inspired to do it .
Do it because that is the thing you want to do the most out of a list of million other things you can potentially do .
And if that leads to success , more power to you .
If it does n't lead to success , at least you did something you wanted to do of your own volition .

2. Security Analysis : The Classic 1940 Edition :
The most detailed book that I ’ve ever read that explains how to invest in stocks .
It goes over the financials , how to read SEC filings , how to analyze a company .
Everything is in detail , therefore this is not a light reading , but what you get out of it is worth it ’s weight ( it ’s a heavy book ) .
3 . The Essays of Warren Buffett : Lessons for Corporate America :
There ’s nothing like reading directly from the richest person ever who made his fortune by investing in stocks !
This is a collection of many of his best pieces , grouped together into topics .
4. The Warren Buffett Way , Second Edition : A very good introduction on what to look for in stocks .
Almost like a follow - up to The Intelligent Investor mentioned above as the # 1 stock investing book .
5. How to Lie With Statistics :
If you ’re going to invest in stocks , you need to be able to read graphs , there ’s no doubt about it .
The key however is that you need to understand how to properly read graphs because it ’s very easy to manipulate their meaning by simple modifications ( with the exact same data ) !
6. A Random Walk Down Wall Street :
Anyone who ’s educated themselves in stocks knows there are many investing philosphies and styles .
This book goes through many of the more common ones and tries to determine which is better .
In case you ’re curious , the author believes that throwing a dart to pick your stocks gives you just as good of odds over the long term as any investment strategy .
I do n’t believe this , but he makes a very compelling case .
7. Take On the Street : What Wall Street and Corporate America Do n’t Want You to Know : I recommend this book not for its overall content , but for the great take aways on how the mutual fund market works .
I was never fond of the mutual fund market , and now I know for sure that I ’ll never invest in mutual funds .
8. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator :
This is the disguised story of the stock speculator Jesse Livermore from long ago who used shady practices to make and lose a lot of money .
What ’s good about this book is that it ’s got an interesting perspective on when to buy , sell , or hold a position in any investment vehicle .
9. Buffett : The Making of an American Capitalist :
The best way to be successful at anything it to learn from the best , and Warren Buffett has consistently shown himself to be the most profitable stock investor in the world .
Therefore no list would be complete without his biography , and this is the best one I ’ve read about him .
Dov Charney is talking .
He 's been going for something like an hour and there 's little sign of him stopping .
He speaks without punctuation , rattling off figures , asides , anecdotes and taking phone calls , all at the same breakneck speed .
Occasionally the patter is accompanied by the flapping of arms or a jig around his cluttered office .
For emphasis - or perhaps because he simply likes the sound of it - he frequently punches a fist into his open palm .
At one point he pulls down the waistband of his trousers to show me his electric - pink Y - fronts .
" I have a men 's underwear here , a brief , that you would probably like to wear , " he says .
" A lot of people say " - smacks fist into palm - " that 's a perfect underwear .
I made 165 versions of it .
I was in my underwear for , like , six months .
I gave up even putting my pants on . "
Charney is in the clothing business .
Just over two years ago Charney , who turns 37 this month , took his successful line of wholesale T - shirts and opened his first American Apparel store in downtown Los Angeles .
Today there are more than 100 of the bright , simple shops selling the company 's bright , simple clothing , which it proudly boasts is made in a sweatshop - free environment .
This year he plans to add 50 more .
By the time he has finished , he says , there will be 500 American Apparel outlets across the world .
The list of store locations reads like a hipsters ' dream vacation : Seoul , Tokyo , Berlin , Mexico City , New York .
London currently has two , with two more in the works and one set for Manchester .
The UK , he says , is a 20 - store country .
" We have the fastest growing apparel company in the US , " says Charney , who goes by the title Senior Partner .
" People say , ' Everywhere I go I see your store .
I go to Paris , I go to London , I go to Mexico City . '
But I tell them , ' We 're following you , bitch ' . "
Charney deals in basics .
His company 's biggest seller is its 2001 fine - jersey T - shirt , available in colours ranging from cranberry to asphalt .
But it does n't just cater to the cotton - clad youth masses .
Babygros , infant karate pants , even dog T - shirts are part of the mix .
The Jewish Canadian son of an architect and a painter , Charney began hustling at an early age , selling T - shirts while still at school before eventually dropping out of university to go into the clothing industry .
Charney , it is safe to say , is not a regular CEO .
Nor is American Apparel a regular American company .
Located in a seven - storey pink warehouse covering 800,000 square ft in the post - industrial wasteland of downtown Los Angeles , American Apparel is bullish about its presence .
The former train depot is decorated with intense and unfathomable slogans : " Legalize LA " declares one enormous banner strung across the outside of the building .
" American Apparel es una compañía rebelde , " says another .
Rebel company or not , in its brief life the company has achieved a certain notoriety - for its risque advertising , for the antics of its boss and for its labour practices .
Eschewing the fashion glossies and the mainstream media , American Apparel takes out ads in the alternative press featuring unpolished models , often friends of Charney , company employees or AA customers , and unpolished photography , sometimes taken by Charney himself .
" Viva Mexico City ! " reads the text of a recent offering above a cropped picture of a dark - haired girl wearing gaudy makeup , a green bikini top and a come - hither look .
Sofía , the text tells us , likes to sell bikinis .
" Next stop for her may be London , where we hear they could use a dose of Latin warmth .
Word is that Mexicans are scarce over there and we could n't think of a lovelier messenger to spread the news about one of our favourite places . "
The aesthetic is Polaroid softcore in homage to Larry Clark and Nan Goldin .
Boys with bulging Y - fronts stare breathlessly at the camera ; girls in thongs and vests look coy .
But there is also a hint of iffy personals , of the unvarnished allure of teenage sex .
In one set , Lauren W poses for a series of close - ups with her fingertips in her dully parted lips .
As photograph after photograph of Lauren W lying with her mouth agape spools past , one jumps out : a male hand has replaced the model 's hand .
The photographer , reads the credit , is Dov Charney .
" I think people have fake sex , " says Alexandra Spunt , sitting at a computer working on the Mexico City ad in AA 's in - house advertising department .
" We 're accustomed to this sanitised version of sex in public , so yes , there 's a lot of interest in the photos , a lot of them are sexual and raw .
It 's the difference between something you can smell and something you can't . "
The current catalogue features on its cover not an amateur model or a member of staff but all - American porn star Lauren Phoenix , the star of Assploitation 2 .
Charney has little time for the critics who allege that his advertisements are akin to teen porn : " It 's noise , it 's chatter , it 's bullshit , it 's perceptions , it 's stereotypes , it 's manipulation , it 's garbage , " he says .
" I never started making any proper money until I decided to make clothing that was geared towards young adults only and not even consider whether it would fit on a boomer , " he says .
" To meet their sensibility , sexy was job one .
Fashion is all about sex and function .
You want to look attractive , and attractive is just another way of saying sexy .
Even if you do n't want the person , you want them to be attracted to you .
Even among other men we want to look attractive and dapper .
That 's still driven by our sex drives . "
Unfortunately , Charney 's own sex drive has become as much a part of the American Apparel story as the desirability or otherwise of its Cotton Spandex Jersey Boy Brief .
Charney preaches the doctrine of the modern , relaxed workplace : there are phones dotted around the pink building for workers to use free of charge ; there is a massage area where workers can take advantage of a free massage every two weeks ( although if you 're on a piece rate , you lose earnings while having your back kneaded ) ; no one bats an eyelid if you have a drink when working late ; and the company 's sexually charged imagery graces the upper office floors , away from the areas where the mainly Latino workers stitch garments together .
The company is also tolerant of workplace relationships , including the CEO 's dating of his employees .
What more natural place to meet someone who shares your interests than at work , ask Charney 's defenders .
But Charney 's relationships , and the hyping of the company as a sexually charged place to work , have brought problems .
As American Apparel has expanded - it now employs 5,000 people - so the mores and manners of big business have come into conflict with its founder 's happy - go - lucky nature .
Three lawsuits alleging sexual harassment have been filed by former employees .
Two have subsequently been withdrawn and a third is languishing .
But the damage has been done ; the image of the sexually liberated , progressive company has been tainted by the suggestion of exploitation .
That suggestion was not helped by an interview Charney gave to the magazine Jane in July 2004 .
Over the course of two months reporter Claudine Ko spent , it seems , a little too much time with Charney , watching as he and a female employee " put on a show " for her ( the implication is that the woman performed oral sex while Ko watched ) , and then interviewing him as he masturbated in front of her .
Several times .
" I 've got myself in trouble telling people what I like to do for 20 minutes off - site , " Charney says .
" Believe me - a ) it 's fun , and b ) it only takes 20 minutes .
That 's it .
The rest of it , I like being productive and animated .
To me , I can affect people 's lives in a happy way by producing garments and being a happy person and making intriguing photoshoots and opening stores in cool neighbourhoods .
That turns me on . "
Websites have taken great delight in deconstructing Charney : creep or visionary ?
It 's a close run thing .
But the fuss has been enough to persuade him to take a more considered approach to his role as the senior partner of a major company .
And so he declines to discuss the lawsuits , other than to declare that there is a " false victim culture ...
Most of these kinds of cases , it 's always bullshit . "
The fallout from the sexual harassment allegations has also taken a toll on the company 's two other unique selling points - that it is sweatshop free and that it is pioneering " vertically integrated manufacturing " .
Exactly what this means is open to debate , but its root is in the notion that everything in the company - from design to manufacture to distribution to marketing - takes place under one roof .
This , argues Charney , gives American Apparel a unique flexibility , allowing it to outstrip and out - innovate its competitors , both large and small .
( We 'll leave aside the fact that the weaving and much of the dyeing takes place off - site , some of it contracted out . )
With the pink HQ capable of churning out 1.325 million garments each week , American Apparel is encroaching on the territory of big players such as T - shirt manufacturers Haines and Fruit of the Loom and bulk retailers from Gap to Wal - Mart .
And with everything done in - house , Charney claims that he can dream up a product on Monday and have it in the shops with accompanying promotion by the end of the week .
That , claims Charney , is the hidden cost of outsourcing .
" I might be able to get someone across the street to make me a coffee but it 's nice to make coffee in my house . "
His unconventional approach made financing the company difficult at first .
" The thing that scares the banks the most is manufacturing in the US " - He adopts a big guy banker voice - " ' You want to finance sewing and knitting equipment in the USA ?
You 're fucking crazy , we just bankrupted nine companies that were doing that , what the fuck 's your problem , kid ? ' "
But there were bankers , he says , who were willing to give him a shot .
In fact , one of them is waiting outside his office as we speak .
" You want to meet my bank manager , " says Charney , jumping out of his chair , " put him on the fucking spot ?
Certain bankers say , ' Hey , it 's fucking crazy . '
But some bankers say , ' You know what , I 'm going to put my money in this fucking new thing .
I think this is more authentic , this company is more in tune with what the marketplace wants right now , and this is less risky for me than being with a traditional company that is out of touch . ' "
He dashes into the corridor where his bank manager is indeed waiting , conspicuous by his age ( over 45 ) .
We both stand aside as Charney is intercepted by a young girl - possibly 16 or 17 - accompanied by her mother .
The girl , apparently , has visited to try out for some modelling work .
" I think you 're lovely , I have your pictures and we 're probably going to work together , " Charney tells her .
Without skipping a beat he turns to the mother .
" Your hair is gorgeous . "
She looks like a flustered teen at the senior prom .
Charney turns his attention back to her daughter .
" You 're very lovely , just do n't trim your eyebrows . "
We return to his office .
" I have a $ 55 m line of credit with that guy , " Charney says .
Just what is it that you 're good at , I ask , and away he canters .
" It 's not very English for me to tell you what my secret is , but I can be a cavalier arrogant American and tell you the bottom line if you want .
OK ... I think I have an ability to spot something that 's right .
That house is the right house .
Or that store is going to work .
Or that underwear is so fucking hot , cut 30,000 of them , it 's right on .
Or that look , the look of that particular girl 's face is so strong .
Eyebrows , trimmed eyebrows are out .
Any asshole that trims her eyebrows , do n't even bring them in , you know what I 'm saying ?
It 's superficial , but that 's fashion and that 's style and that 's real estate . "
It is all some way from American Apparel 's initial appeal , that it made its clothes in LA without using sweatshops .
American Apparel is now the largest clothing manufacturer in the US , an oasis among the outsourced hulks of industry in Los Angeles .
On the shopfloor it looks pretty much like any other mid-size manufacturing operation .
Workers organised into small teams huddle furiously over sewing machines , working against the clock to produce as much as they can .
They are paid a piece rate for each item the team produces , with a guaranteed minimum slightly above the minimum wage .
Handwritten in marker pen on a board above each team is a tally for the day and the earnings per hour for that day .
The teams are the brainchild of chief operating officer Marty Bailey , an industry veteran brought into the company by Charney as he realised that the expansion was running away with him .
" We have the highest - paid apparel workers in the world , " says Bailey .
" Our company will only be successful if these folks are . "
Bailey questions the usefulness of the sweatshop - free label .
" This is a business , " he stresses .
" It goes back to making a quality product .
Sweatshop - free or ethical manufacturing , that 's going to help sell it once , but quality is what brings people back . "
The reality , though , is somewhat disappointing : a recent trip to one of their shops revealed crooked seams and missed stitches .
While the shopfloor work looks crippling , the conditions buck the stereotype of the sweatshop .
There is plenty of light , each floor is freshly painted white , there is a subsidised canteen , the company offers interest - free loans , there are free bicycles , even cash - machine cards to avoid the charges incurred in cashing a wage cheque .
Notably , the sexual iconography that dominates its public face is absent from the walls where the product is actually made .
There is a year - long waiting list to get a job .
It all seems remarkably progressive , despite the fact that there are almost no white faces to be seen .
And there are no unions - a sensitive subject with Charney and Bailey .
A recruiting drive three years ago by a garment workers ' union failed , thanks either to a lack of interest on the part of the American Apparel workforce or intimidation from the company , depending whose version of recent history you choose to believe .
" Every employee has the right to organise if he chooses to do so , " says Bailey .
" That 's the worker 's choice .
There was a rally , and it was more to say leave us alone , we do n't need you here .
If somebody decides they need someone to speak for them , then I 've not been available enough . "
An employee is produced to pay tribute to their enlightened bosses .
" I 'm not against a union but I think if you have the right level of respect , you do n't need one , " says Jeremias Pablo , a 26 - year - old supervisor who has been with the company for seven years .
" Also the boss , the great man Dov Charney , he goes on the floor and asks us if we are OK .
If you want an appointment with him , you can do it .
The doors are open . "
Yet despite his assurances , there is no system of collective bargaining at American Apparel .
And in a large multinational enterprise such as American Apparel , it is surely unrealistic to imagine that labour issues can be resolved on a one - to - one basis .
But Charney 's heart seems to be in the right place , his vision of himself as a benevolent capitalist intact despite the growth of the company .
" It 's on point not to be exploitative right now , " he begins .
" While the whole industry is ignoring the workplace and outsourcing it , we 're actually reintegrating workers in the company .
We do n't have to exploit them .
Maybe I bought some of that socialist crap from socialist Canada , but I Americanised it because it 's the company that 's doing it , it 's private enterprise . "
With the company making so much profit , he says , " Guess what ?
We did n't have to gip off the damn garment workers .
It appears to be somewhat extravagant from the outside , but really - who cares ?
We 're making so much money , so who really , who 's counting ? "
He takes great delight in showing me the spreadsheets for his retail operation from the day he opened his first shop in LA in October 2003 ( it took $ 83 on its fourth day ) .
" Look , " he says , " the fact of the matter is I 'm not leading the pack in terms of neo - CEOs , OK ?
But the old guys are going to retire and there will be a pack of new guys like me .
This is just waiting for a new wave .
It 's not going to be that big a deal if the CEO does n't get married or does n't wear a tie .
Who fucking cares ?
Things are going to deformalise .
It will be easier to carry on a less formal lifestyle . "
Which begs the question : where does this burgeoning enterprise go next ?
How does it retain the informality of both its working practice and its outside image while it aims to become the Starbucks of the T - shirt ?
Charney seems to relish too much the control and the flexibility guaranteed by the absence of shareholders to go public .
And as for retaining the personal touch over the behemoth of American Apparel , he returns to one of his favourite themes : technology .
" There 's new technology today , " he exclaims , jumping out of his chair .
" Video - conferencing , emails , I could talk to 100 people in a minute .
I could poll the stores .
I have visuality to what 's going on in my stores every night , every day of the week .
Right here and now .
There 's ways I can maintain a connection whereas I could n't before .
And because all my products are made in the single country , I can get stuff into other countries quickly . "
Whatever happens , the hustler who started off bringing T - shirts across the Canadian border in black bin liners has arrived .
Whatever the fate of his company , he has few concerns about his own future .
" Well , you could say so , by virtue of the fact that I own this company , " he says when I ask if he is rich .
" I 'm not personally wealthy but I 'm working on it .
You do n't have to worry about me " .
One Story of Nikola Tesla
Our lives today are dependent upon a bewildering amount of technology , much of which we take for granted .
Indeed , some of that technology is so pervasive that we forget it even is technology .
Perhaps that 's one reason why so many have forgotten the name of Serbian - born inventor Nikola Tesla .
Tesla endured a frightening number of injustices during his lifetime .
Let me tell you a story about Tesla , one of his inventions , and his extraordinary generosity , in hopes that he will not face the additional injustice of being forgotten by history .
In the distribution of electricity , alternating current has distinct advantages over direct current .
Levels of voltage and current can be readily transformed with AC , allowing distribution of power over distances of hundreds of miles .
DC power , on the other hand , is difficult to distribute in usable levels more than two miles between generator and user .
This was already well - known in the 1880s .
Direct current , however , was still the predominant type of power being installed at the time .
The reason , simply put , was that nobody had yet figured out how to build reliable AC motors and equipment .
AC devices in use at the time used " commutators " - mechanical current - switchers - to operate , and frequently failed due to heat , vibration , and an excess of moving parts .
Some scientists and inventors had been trying for years to find solutions to these problems .
Other inventors and financiers , who had invested in DC power systems , were n't interested in solutions .
DC power was firmly under their financial control , and they saw anything that challenged DC not as an improvement , but as a threat .
Nikola Tesla , then twenty - eight , had recently been forced to give up his studies at the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz due to lack of funds .
In his studies there he had taken special interest in AC devices , and the flaws inherant in their design had returned to his thoughts often during the years .
One day in 1882 , while talking to a friend in a Belgrade park , Tesla abruptly froze in mid-step and mid-sentence .
A new concept of AC equipment , long forming in the background of his thoughts , had suddenly crystallized in his mind .
His friend wanted to help him to a bench to sit down , but Tesla refused to relax until he had traced a drawing of a new AC motor design in the sand .
Six years later Tesla would present the drawing again , this time in an address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers .
Far more than just a new motor , it was an entirely new principle for handling AC power , a " new scientific principle of stunning simplicity and utility " , which was to sweep the world .
Those six years , however , proved to be difficult ones .
" Tesla came over from Graz and went to work for Thomas Edison .
Edison could n't stand Tesla for several reasons .
One was that Tesla showed up for work every day in formal dress - morning coat , spats , top hat and gloves - and this just was n't the American Way at the time .
Edison also hated Tesla because Tesla invented so many things while wearing these clothes . "
- Laurie Anderson , " Dance of Electricity " , United States part 1
Thomas Alva Edison did not fully understand the light bulbs that he himself had invented .
Though the carbon filaments would work from AC or DC current equally well , Edison himself believed his electric lights would only work with DC .
It was to be years before he learned of his error .
In any event , when Tesla first arrived in America in 1884 , Edison had a large vested interest - both financial and emotional - in the DC power plants which he had been building , and which the " robber baron " J. Pierpont Morgan had been financing .
When Tesla arrived in the United States and sought Edison 's backing for his new AC devices , therefore , Edison refused to listen .
" Hold up !
Spare me that nonsense .
It 's dangerous .
We 're set up for direct current in America .
People like it , and it's all I 'll ever fool with . "
Nonetheless Edison offered him a job , promising Tesla fifty thousand dollars if Tesla could redesign Edison 's breakdown - prone DC generator designs .
Tesla agreed and worked for the better part of a year redesigning the dynamos , also adding new automatic controls of Tesla 's own design .
The new generator designs were a vast improvement over Edison 's originals .
Upon completing the job Tesla went to Edison to collect the $ 50,000 promised for the task .
" Tesla , " Edison replied , " you do n't understand our American humor . "
And Tesla was never paid .
Tesla soon found himself unemployed , and for a time he worked as a laborer on a New York street gang to keep from starving .
In time , however , he was fortunate enough to find a financial backer for his AC work .
Soon he was able to apply for patents for his polyphase AC motors , distribution systems , and transformers .
Word of the extraordinary patents reached the academic world , and so it came to pass that the inventor was invited to lecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers .
Tesla 's presentation and ideas were lauded at the time as remarkably new , lucid , thorough , and far - reaching in ramifications , and were discussed widely by engineers .
So it was that Tesla came to the attention of business magnate George Westinghouse .
Westinghouse already understood the advantages of AC electricity , and had been one of its ' early advocates .
He had dreamed of someday being able to provide electricity throughout the country , but the technology to do so reliably had not yet existed .
Learning of Tesla 's successes , Westinghouse had found what he needed to make that dream a reality .
Westinghouse soon purchased the patents to Tesla 's polyphase AC systems , and hired Tesla as a consultant as well .
Westinghouse then began to develop AC systems across the country , systems which are now in use throughout the entire world .
The agreements between Westinghouse and Tesla called for the businessman to pay the inventor a royalty of two dollars and fifty cents - for every horsepower of AC equipment sold .
Even a century ago , the royalties would be enough to make Tesla one of the wealthiest men in the world .
( Were such royalties to be paid on equipment in use today , the royalties on AC generators alone would be worth more than seven and a half billion dollars . )
Dogs and cats began disappearing from the neighborhood around Edison 's laboratory in West Orange , New Jersey .
Unable to challenge AC electricity on technical merits , Edison turned to using scare tactics instead .
" Just as certain as death [ AC power ] will kill a customer within six months , " he declared .
Leaflets about the dangers of AC current were printed and distributed .
Lobbying efforts were made in New York State to limit legal levels of electricity to 800 volts , making AC distribution impractical " as a matter of public safety " .
Perhaps most horrifying , though , were Edison 's weekend demonstrations of the dangers of Tesla 's work .
Taking one of the frightened pets stolen from the streets of West Orange , Edison would place it on a sheet of metal , bring forth two wires attached to an AC generator , and announce to spectators , " Ladies and gentlemen , I shall now demonstrate the effects of AC current on this dog . "
Edison 's efforts to discredit AC electricity were , in the long run , unsuccessful .
This did not , however , make Edison 's lies or killings any less repugnant .
The race was on between Morgan and Westinghouse to detemine who would control the future of electricity in America .
Morgan did n't care what kind of electricity was used , as long as he was in control of it - and he controlled Edison 's DC patents .
Westinghouse retained his faith that AC was the superior and more cost - effective system , and should be used for that reason , if no other .
One of Morgan 's managers , Charles Coffin , proudly boasted of his tactics to gain ground for Morgan and Consolidated Edison ( later to become General Electric ) .
He described raising the price of Edison - built streetlights from $ 6.00 to $ 8.00 , specifically to raise an extra $ 2 per streetlight to pay off local politicians .
He also advocated getting generators and distribution systems installed quickly , the advantage being that " the users willingly pay our price [ for power in the future ] as they cannot afford to change the system . "
Westinghouse made it clear that he and Coffin did not share their style of doing business .
The House of Morgan therefore went after Westinghouse in a different manner , spreading rumors to Wall Street investors that Westinghouse 's finances were unstable .
Investors began to shy away from providing Westinghouse with new capital , capital being the lifeblood of his efforts to implement AC .
Eventually it became clear that , if AC and the Westinghouse business were to survive , the remarkable royalty contract between Westinghouse and Tesla would have to be drastically altered .
Westinghouse came to Tesla and described the situation .
Tesla replied with these words :
" Mr. Westinghouse , you have been my friend , you believed in me when others had no faith ; you were brave enough to go ahead ... when others lacked courage ; you supported me when even your own engineers lacked vision ... you have stood by me as a friend ...
" Here is your contract , and here is my contract .
I will tear both of them to pieces , and you will no longer have any troubles from my royalties .
Is that sufficient ? "
The advantages of AC power , and the strength of Tesla 's ingenious designs , soon made the difference .
AC installations rapidly overtook DC , and Tesla 's designs are now the standard used throughout the world .
The name of Nikola Tesla , however , is now largely unknown .
He is rarely given credit for the vast variety of his inventions .
Certainly he was not given sufficient reward for the benefits he gave us all freely ; Tesla died in a New York hotel room , nearly penniless , in 1943 .
Nikola Tesla was a pioneer in a staggering number of fields ; AC power was only one of them .
He has also done significant research and development in a wide variety of other disciplines , and his body of patents ranges through such diverse fields as robotics , wireless communications , turbines , fluid dynamics , radar , therapeutic equipment , VTOL aircraft , artificial lighting , X - rays , and computer systems .
Though history books continue to give Guglielmo Marconi credit for the invention of radio , Tesla 's lectures on wireless broadcasting precede Marconi 's radio patents by some three years .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the matter in Tesla 's favor , and struck down Marconi 's patent claim , in 1943 .
The developers of integrated circuits for modern computers have been surprised to discover that some of the basic logic gates they desired to implement and patent on silicon had already been implemented and patented , by Tesla , in 1903 , using AC - based components .
Many of Tesla 's experiments , such as his artificial creation of ball lightning , still baffle scientists today .
It still remains to be seen what other scientific advances were anticipated by Tesla over a century ago .
Much more about Tesla has been written than this .
A look at Bogdan Kosanovic 's Nikola Tesla site would be a good place to start .
As well , the following books are worth reading :

Today we ’re going to focus on three different strategies .
Each is different in terms of sophistication and potential consequences , but all have been proven to be successful .
And each has the important benefit of being extremely unlikely to land you in jail .
We will also consider a case study for each strategy to help you apply them in the real world .
The Legitimate Loan Shark
Risk of jail - time : low
Profit potential : high
Sophistication : low
There are about 1200 payday loan operations across Canada .
These businesses provide small , short - term loans at high interest rates .
Canada ’s criminal code prohibits charging more than a 60 % annual interest rate , but these companies get around this by charging the maximum legal rate ( Money Mart charges 59 % ) and then tacking on “ fees ” .
With the fees viewed as interest , the rates for these loans skyrocket past the legal limit .
Goal :
Make a lot of money illegally .
Strategy :
1 . Do n’t try to hide it .
Secretive criminals look sneaky .
If you want to break the law , register a business and advertise .
2. Service a niche market that depends on you .
Payday lenders say their service is necessary , because banks do n’t lend small amounts of money , and sometimes , people just need to survive until their next cheque .
3 . Rename the parts of your business that are illegal .
It ’s not interest , it ’s fees .
4 . Claim you ’re only breaking the law a little bit .
“ If I was to loan an individual $ 100 for five days and charge that individual $ 1 , that is 107 per cent on an annual rate , ” says Canadian Payday Loan Association spokesman Bob Whitelaw .
Case Study : Building and Growing a Human Trafficking Ring
Yuri Ropov wants to import poor Romanians so they can clean and provide companionship for single , lonely middle - aged men ( see 2 ) .
Yuri has studied the payday loan industry carefully and he knows what steps to take – and what mistakes to avoid .
First , Yuri registers a business called Exotic Migrant Cleaning Charity and establishes a downtown storefront ( see 1 ) .
He immediately starts advertising that he provides cleaning services performed by Romanian volunteers for minimal amounts of money .
By advertising , Yuri gains an immediate advantage over the police , who assume his business must be legitimate .
And by calling his imported Romanians volunteers , he no longer needs to abide by employment laws such as the minimum wage ( see 3 ) .
When Yuri is confronted by an irate citizen who uncovers his business practices , Yuri points out that he only has a few illegal immigrants working for him , and most are quite diminutive ( 4 ) .
The Unflappable Patriot
Risk of jail - time : zero
Profit potential : moderate
Sophistication : moderate to high , depending on locale
President George Bush is embroiled in a controversy over his administration ’s illegal domestic wire - tapping activities .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) makes it clear that spying on an American citizen requires a warrant from a court set up for that purpose , but thousands of Americans were spied on without these legally - required warrants .
Goal :
Do whatever you want regardless of legality .
Strategy :
1. Assume a position of authority .
2 . Hide your illegal activities .
No one has to know what probably is n’t hurting them if they ’re not Arabs or liberals .
3 . When your illegal activities become public knowledge :
a) Immediately acknowledge you are responsible for the activities
b ) Deny that you ’ve done anything wrong
c ) Hire a lawyer ( preferably the Attorney General )
4 . Repeat the following words and phrases at every opportunity : “ terrorism ” , “ war on terror ” , “ terrorist activities ” , “ protect democracy ” , “ Osama bin Laden ” , “ September 11 ” .
5 . Deny the law says what it says , and even if it did say that , it does n’t apply to you .
See 3 c ) .
6. Rename your illegal activities ( see Legitimate Loan Shark , step 3 ) .
The Bush administration and its supporters have renamed the domestic spying program the “ terrorist surveillance program “ .
7 . Go on a public - relations offensive .
Case Study : Selling Cocaine to High School Students
Willy Wilson has a reliable supply of high - grade Columbian cocaine .
He knows that teenagers love to party , and if he can get them hooked while they ’re young they ’ll probably be life - long customers .
Luckily for Willy , he has closely followed Bush ’s career , so he knows what steps to take – and what mistakes to avoid .
First ,
Willy applies for the position of guidance counsellor at his target high school .
He knows that in this role he will be trusted and he ’ll also have access to the school ’s most troubled students , a key market niche for coke dealers .
After two - and - a - half years of profit , word gets out during a PTA meeting that something is n’t quite right .
Allegations of improper behaviour are levelled at Willy .
Willy keeps his cool and immediately acknowledges that he is a coke - dealing guidance counsellor .
However , since the primary reason students fail in school is a lack of concentration and attention in class , his supply of a powerful stimulant to students helps improve their grades .
“ In the war against terror , ” he tells a local television crew , “ it ’s vital that all of our citizens , including our teenagers , guard vigilantly against Osama bin Laden .
The cause of democracy is not advanced when our citizens ca n’t stay awake . ”
Finally , Willy registers a company called Slightly Stronger than Coffee and advertises his All - Natural Coca Crystals in the local paper .
The Questionable Memoir
Risk of jail - time : zero
Risk of negative public perception : high
Profit potential : very high
Sophistication : low
The untruthfulness of James Frey ’s book A Million Little Pieces is now undisputed , but he ’s still sold millions of books and made millions of dollars .
However , because of the damage to his reputation , this strategy is not recommended .
Goal : lie to people for personal gain .
Strategy :
1. Lie .
2. Promptly cash all cheques received as a result of 1 .
3 . When confronted by accusations of dishonesty , mull on the nuances of human perception and the uncertainty of memory .
Suggest a truth - to - lies ratio in percentage terms that indicates you are mostly truthful .
4. Relax in the renewed glow of the approval of your peers .
5 . When confronted by accusations of dishonesty for a second time , recast your lies as “ ideas ” and “ alterations ” , but admit you have made mistakes .
Mutter helplessly .
6. Retire with your millions in shame .
Analysis
This strategy is potentially profitable , but due to its costs to personal reputation and dignity , it is not recommended .
Other strategies are almost as profitable with fewer negative consequences .
Thus , a case study will not be presented .
Instead , it is worth examining the reasons this strategy is a failure .
First , this strategy is obviously completely legal .
This might seem like an advantage , but is actually to its detriment : criminal strategies snarl people up in endless discussions over their legality , which neatly removes the need to consider their morality .
Adopting a legal strategy means people will immediately judge you on ethical and moral grounds , which is rarely in your benefit .
Second , the consequences for the people you ’ve taken advantage of are minimal , which means people are less likely to assume you were acting to protect their interests .
Payday loan companies make poor people poorer by giving them money to help them out of their poverty .
Bush violates the freedom of Americans in order to safeguard their freedom .
Frey , on the other hand , fabricated parts of his book so people would pay $ 25 a piece for it .
And that is truly unforgivable .

This post was partly inspired by Jon Stewart ’s commentary .
Last week , I had lunch with one of my best friends from college , who is going into his tenth year of teaching English literature at a Georgia high school .
He 's black , as are many of his students .
He made a couple of points that I found interesting : 1. No Child Left Behind :
He agreed with the ideals behind this law , but he was very stressed out over the fact that his school has to show a certain level of " Average Yearly Progress , " or else the federal government can take over the school and demand that the teachers reapply for their jobs .
The problem :
Too many students who are arriving in 10th grade English not even knowing how to read , and having been “ socially promoted ” for their entire lives .
My friend said ( and I paraphrase from memory ) : “ I ’m doing the best that I know how to do , but you know how reading tests are written :
They ’re full of little logical tricks to make sure that you read and understood the question .
How am I going to get someone whoto pass that kind of test ?
It ’s just impossible for me to spend one or two semesters and get someone caught up on 9 or 10 years of schooling .
And then there are always some kids that just do n’t care , and no matter what I try , they just wo n’t do the work .
So the government is going to tell me that because of a handful of students that are unreachable , therefore I ’m a bad teacher ?
No way .
” 2 . The conversation turned to the problems caused by fatherlessness in the black community .
My friend told a story that I found very touching .
Again , I paraphrase from memory : “ One of my kids just cried like a baby the other day .
This was one of the bad kids , always disruptive , bad attitude .
He and I were arguing about something the other day , and I said , ‘ Let ’s take this out in the hall .
’“ So we get out there , and he says , ‘ You ca n’t tell me what to do .
You ’re not my dad .
’“ Then I said , “ That ’s when the kid just started sobbing .
“ Anyway , after that , he was much better behaved in class .
But the sad part is , that I ’m still probably going to have to fail him .
He has n’t turned in about half of the assignments , and I do n’t see how he is going to be able to pass my test . ”
How to make executable files with CMUCL on Linux
Start by creating the file start .
lisp in your CMUCLLIB directory ( e.g. , /usr/lib/cmucl / ) :
( in - package " COMMON - LISP-USER " ) ( setq ext::* complain-about-illegal - switches * nil ) ;;
Delete the command - line arguments that loaded this file ( pop lisp: : lisp - command - line - list ) ( do ( ( opt ( pop lisp::lisp- command - line-list ) ( pop lisp::lisp- command - line-list ) ) ) ( ( char / = ( schar opt 0 ) #\-) ) ) ( ext:: process - command - strings ) ( setq ext::*complain-about-illegal - switches * t ) ;;
Allow a #!
line on source files ( set-dispatch - macro - character #\# #\! ( lambda ( stream bang arg ) ( declare ( ignore bang arg ) ) ( read - line stream ) ( values ) ) ) ( let ( ( file ( first lisp: :lisp- command - line - list ) ) ) ( unwind - protect ( when file ( load file ) ) ( ext:quit ) ) )
Compile it : lisp - eval ' ( compile - file " start " ) ( quit ) ' and make sure any user can load it : chmod 644 start .x86 f .
Put the following in /usr / local / bin/ runlisp ( adjusting the path to your lisp executable , if necessary ) :
#!/bin/sh # exec /usr / bin / lisp - quiet - batch - noinit - load library : start " $ @ "
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/runlisp
Finally , load the binfmt_misc kernel module and tell it about Lisp .
You may want to do this in your boot scripts ( e.g. , /etc/rc.d/rc.local ) .
/sbin/modprobe binfmt_misc echo : lisp:M:: FASL FILE::/usr/local/bin/runlisp : >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
The EFF's Deeplinks section has a pretty alarming post about the RIAA and MPAA 's attempts to freeze the progress of consumer electronics technology and then start turning back the clock on all of us .
Fair use , meet your successor : " customary historic use . "
The post points to broadcast flag draft legislation sponsored by Senator Gordon Smith ( R - Ore. ) that contains provisions which appear to limit digital broadcast media reception devices to " customary historic use of broadcast content by consumers to the extent such use is consistent with applicable law and that prevents redistribution of copyrighted content over digital networks . "
In other words , if it does anything heretofore unheard of with the digital content that it receives , then it 's illegal .
And if it does anything " customary " that could also possibly lead to unauthorized redistribution , then it 's also illegal .
So all the bases are covered !
Can it really be that bad ?
We already knew that the proposed HD radio provisions are just awful and absurdly draconian , but can Big Content really be trying to put a blanket freeze on innovation and outlaw any possible novel use at all of copyrighted digital broadcast content ?
I downloaded the PDF and read through it , and it does indeed look that way .
There are a few relevant sections , so let 's take a look at them .
Here 's the first major section in which the phrase " customary historic use " is used :
(2) CRITERIA FOR CONTENT OF REGULATIONS ?
In achieving the goal of preventing the indiscriminate unauthorized copying and redistribution of certain digital audio content over digital networks , any proposed regulations to govern digital audio broadcast transmissions and digital audio receiving devices shall ?
( a ) require Commission licensees that transmit digital audio broadcast signals or that manufacture digital audio receiving devices to implement a Broadcast Flag technology to protect digital audio content ; ( b ) permit customary historic use of broadcast content by consumers to the extent such use is consistent with applicable law ; ( c ) not interfere with the deployment and spread of digital audio broadcasting to the maximum extent possible ; and , ( d ) to the extent that such regulations cover devices , cover only devices that are capable , without any hardware alterations or additions , of receiving digital audio signals when such devices are sold by a manufacturer .
( e ) not interfere with the monitoring of or gaining access to musical works contained in broadcasts by performing rights organizations for the purpose of collecting or distributing royalties .
This sounds vaguely ominous , but not truly earth - shattering , mostly because it 's phrased positively .
Unfortunately , by the time you 're done with the document you understand that it 's worse than it looks at first .
At issue in the legislation are two types of implementation - agnostic " technologies " : 1 ) a " broadcast flag " technology that 's embedded in the digital signal by the sender and that tells the receiver what it can and cannot do with the digital content ; and 2 ) a " secure moving technology " that the draft legislation defines as follows :
( b) " Secure Moving Technology " is a technology that permits content covered by the Broadcast Flag to be transferred from a broadcast receiver to another device for rendering in accordance with customary historic use of broadcast content by consumers to the extent such use is consistent with applicable law and that prevents redistribution of copyrighted content over digital networks . "
There 's the nub of it .
The broadcast flag alone is n't enough , because what happens when you want to actually listen to the audio that the device has received ?
Unless you 've got headphones attached directly to your digital radio , you 're going to want to move the signal from the digital radio to a stereo receiver ( for " rendering " as the draft puts it ) , even if you 're not necessarily planning on ripping the music and uploading it to eDonkey .
This where the " secure moving technology " kicks in .
The " secure moving technology " ensures that whatever you do with the signal that leaves the digital broadcast receiver , it definitely wo n't be anything you can't already do right now .
Furthermore , even some things that you can currently do will be outlawed if those things could facilitate piracy .
This probably means that such devices wo n't have much in the way of hi- fi analog outs .
After you read the above definition of " secure moving technology " and then go further back and look at the first section that I quoted above , that first " customary historic use " passage starts to make more sense and to look more insidious .
From reading the whole draft , it appears that the " customary historic use " stipulation governs playback on any device , whether it's an attached device or the receiver itself .
The broadcast flag is embedded in the signal like a special tag that defines the content 's terms of use , while the secure moving technology acts as a sort of DRM wrapper / sandbox for the content that ensures that any ( compliant ) playback device not only respects the restrictions dictated by the broadcast flag but also does absolutely nothing novel or unexpected with the content that the broadcast flag 's terms did not or could not anticipate .
So , if you were planning to launch a startup and make millions off the coming digital broadcast media revolution by inventing the next iPod or by combining digital radio with Web 2.0 and VoIP and Skype and RSS and WiFi mesh networks , then forget about it .
When digital broadcast nirvana finally arrives , the only people who'll be legally authorized to make money off of music and movies are the middlemen at the RIAA and the MPAA .
But I hate to end a post on a sour note , so here 's a thought to cheer you up .
This " customary historic use " thing reminds me of something I once read in a history of Japan that I picked up on sale at Borders .
( I 'd give the title , but I 'm not at home so I do n't have the book handy .
It was n't very good anyway . )
At the height of their cultural power , the samurai were authorized to kill peasants for an insane number of reasons , including " acting in an other than expected manner . "
So look on the bright side : at least we do n't live in feudal Japan ... yet .
The free set of Web - based programs for small businesses , universities and nonprofit businesses goes by the mouthful " Google Apps for Your Domain " ( http://www.google.com/a).
Later this year , Google said it will offer a " paid , premium " version with the option of being ad - free and more administrative control and compliance features to meet the demands of bigger corporations and government agencies .
Pricing for this more advanced version is not yet available , it said .
Google will host the applications relieving companies of the need to maintain or install software on individual PCs - support tasks often more costly than software itself .
" If we do it right , we get the best of both worlds - very consumer - friendly software , but also low - cost business applications , " said Dave Girouard , general manager of Google 's enterprise division , which sells search software to companies .
Individual office workers can sign on to Google Apps - short for applications - through their Web browsers .
Initial apps are Gmail Web email , the Google Talk instant message and Web phone - calling service , group scheduling on Google Calendar , and Google Page Creator for Web page design .
" It really is intended to be a platform , " Girouard said .
" One of the fundamental benefits of the software as service approach is that you can just turn on new features over time . "
The Writely word processor and Google Spreadsheet are candidates for future inclusion in Google Apps , Girouard said .
Google 's main appeal is to consumers of its popular Web search and advertising systems .
By packaging a set of software for businesses , Google is responding to demands by corporate network administrators who prefer to manage a standard set of software inside organisations .
Many are cracking down on the spread of individual consumer programs within their networks .
Sue Feldman , an analyst with market research firm IDC , said Google Apps moves the company into open competition with Microsoft in the business software market .
Anticipating Google 's moves , the world 's biggest software maker has responded with Windows " Live " - Web - based software for small business and consumers .
But Microsoft 's unwillingness to deliver its software until it is " fully baked " gives Google an opening to win adherents to its approach , the analyst said .
" There is simplicity and there is s - i - m - p - l - i - c - i - t -y , " Feldman said .
" If you are used to using Microsoft Outlook , you may need many more features and you will want to use them whether you are connected to the internet or offline . "
Martin Pyykkonen , an analyst with Global Crown Capital of San Francisco , says Google 's bid to host business software may give pause to companies mulling when to upgrade to new versions of Microsoft Windows , Office and Outlook due in the next year .
" For all the complexity of Microsoft software and how long Vista has taken , a lot of corporate executives are going to be wary :
Do you update to the complexity of Vista or would you be better off just using something simple like Google Apps ? " he said .
Vista , the first major upgrade of Windows in five years , is due out later this year or early next .
IBM , Oracle Corp and SAP AG also are racing to offer their software as Web - based services in order to make it easier to use and to cut costs , following the lead of pioneer Salesforce.com Google 's latest move makes them both competitors and potential partners .
Girouard underscored that the Google Apps platform is not designed to replace Microsoft 's core software .
Many businesses are likely to run Windows and Office programs alongside Google Apps on office workers ' computers , he said .
" This platform is n't by any means an alternative to Windows , " Girouard said .
" We are not really out there to eliminate any applications .
We are looking to introduce new ways to solve problems people have been having for years . "
ANSWERING the question of why people smoke tobacco is reasonably easy .
Tobacco plants have evolved a chemical called nicotine that locks into particular molecular receptors in the outer membranes of certain animal nerve cells .
Once there , it stimulates those cells in ways that they were never intended to be stimulated .
If the animal in question is an insect , the result is lethal — which , from the plant 's point of view , is a good outcome .
But in a big , bulky animal such as a human , a small amount of nicotine produces a pleasant sensation ( though enough of the stuff can kill a human , too ) .
Nicotine has a second effect , though .
It induces semi-permanent changes in the ways the nerves it stimulates talk to each other .
The result is that those nerves are uncomfortable without it , and the owners of those nerves become addicted to smoking dried tobacco leaves .
Just how many of those leaves an addict needs seems to vary from person to person , and here the reason is not well known .
Or , rather , it was n't .
For Hidetoshi Nakamura of the Tokyo Electric Power Company Hospital , in Japan , and his colleagues have just thrown some light on the issue .
In a paper published in the European Respiratory Journal they suggest that the number of packs a smoker smokes is a consequence of which versions of a particular enzyme he has in his body — in other words , of his genetics .
The enzyme in question is called , rather inelegantly , CYP2A6 .
It is part of a family of toxin - destroying enzymes known as the cytochrome P450s , and one of its jobs is to convert nicotine into a less harmful chemical called cotinine that can then be excreted .
The gene that encodes CYP2A6 , however , comes in three varieties , each resulting in a different form of the enzyme .
On top of that , some people lack the gene altogether .
Dr Nakamura and his team looked at 200 regular smokers over the age of 50 , to see if the particular varieties of CYP2A6 that those people had could be correlated with their smoking habits .
They could .
Those with two copies of the commonest form of the gene ( one copy inherited from each parent ) smoked most .
Those individuals with rarer forms smoked less , and those completely without the enzyme smoked least .
That , paradoxically , is because the commonest form of the enzyme is also the most effective at detoxifying nicotine while , of course , an absence of CYP2A6 means that the drug must be detoxified by other , slower , routes .
In people with effective enzymes , nicotine vanishes rapidly , so they need another cigarette soon .
The less effective the enzyme , the fewer cigarettes you need to smoke to keep your drug levels up .
So what natural selection has favoured as healthy may end up killing you faster .
But then , there were not many tobacconists in the African savannah where humanity evolved .
Anyone sprayed with SmartWater glows under an ultra-violet light
SmartWater , which shows up under ultra-violet light , contains a unique DNA - style code .
When a break - in happens the thief is sprayed with the liquid , which cannot be washed off and lasts for months .
Custody offices are now fitted with ultra-violet arches which every prisoner will pass through to show if they have been sprayed .
Those who have been will glow under the lights and the liquid's " code " can be used to place them at the scene of a particular burglary .
Police have invested in a number of sprinkler systems which can easily be installed in homes or commercial premises .
Peter Fay , a community inspector with Northumbria Police , said : " Every person arrested in Newcastle is now passing underneath the arches which will show up immediately if they have been in contact with SmartWater .
" We are also starting to work with second - hand shops in Newcastle to educate them on SmartWater and will be providing them with portable scanners so they can test items themselves . "

What can character animators learn from those who render microscopic worlds in 3D ?
Plenty .

But it will share a place along side them in SIGGRAPH's Electronic
Theatre show , which will run for three days during the 33rd annual exhibition and conference in Boston next month .
Created by XVIVO , a scientific animation company near Hartford , CT , the animation illustrates unseen molecular mechanisms and the ones they trigger , specifically how white blood cells sense and respond to their surroundings and external stimuli .
Nuclei , proteins and lipids move with bug - like authority , slithering , gliding and twisting through 3D space .
" All of those things that you see in the animation are going on in every one of your cells in your body all the time , " says XVIVO lead animator John Liebler , who worked with company partners David Bolinsky , XVIVO 's medical director , and Mike Astrachan , the project 's production director , to blend the academic data and narrative from Harvard 's faculty into a fluid visual interpretation .
" First , we could n't have known where to begin with all of this material without significant work done by Alain Viel , Ph.D. [ associate director of undergraduate research at Harvard University ] , who wrote and guided the focus to include the essential processes that needed to be described to complement the curriculum and sustain an interesting narrative .
I 've been in the medical animation field for seven years now , so I 'm a little jaded , but I still get surprised by things .
For instance , in the animation there 's a motor protein that 's sort of walking along a line , carrying this round sphere of lipids .
When I started working on that section I admit I was kind of surprised to see that it really does look like it's out for a stroll , like a character in a science fiction film or animation .
But based on all the data , it 's a completely accurate rendering . "
" I was impressed by the ability of the XVIVO team to transform all the structural information and the very detailed sequence of molecular events that I assembled in a storyboard into a visually pleasing work of art , " adds Dr. Viel .
" This is because the XVIVO team combines artistic talent with a good understanding of biology . "
Liebler says the team worked hard to give the final animation the kind of dramatic heft you might find in a longer project with more stirring plot lines .
" It 's one of the reasons we were brought into this project in the first place , " he says .
" There are plenty of others in the academic community creating these kinds of animations to illustrate concepts for students and their peers , but they tend to look and feel , well , very academic .
The idea with this was to make something different , and there was definitely an effort to make it as cinematic as we could . "
In some instances , that meant sacrificing literal accuracy for visual effect .
" What we did in some cases , with the full support of the Harvard team , was subtly change the way things work , " Liebler says .
" The reality is that all that stuff that 's going on in each cell is so tightly packed together that if we were to put every detail into every shot , you would n't be able to see the forest for the trees or know what you were even looking at .
One of the most common things we did , then , was to strip it apart and add space where there is n't really that much space . "
Because of the sheer volume of structures that needed to be visible and functional in each scene , XVIVO was given a longer development cycle than a typical commercial project , to transform the molecular data and storyboards supplied by Dr. Viel , and Dr. Robert Lue , the director of life sciences education and creator of Harvard 's BioVisions computer - based learning program for undergraduates .
" In a lot of cases , the animation had to be worked out more thoroughly than we would have done on an ordinary project so that we could understand what was going on , " says Liebler .
" Even though David has a medical background , Mike and I come from art and graphic design backgrounds .
We needed to get a grasp of the actual objects and things that were involved by making them ; only then could we understand what was happening .
But we also continued working on this project while other projects were coming in and out .
The Harvard job was a constant that we were building and refining until we had satisfied its unique academic and aesthetic requirements . "
Luckily , Harvard 's Dr. Lue and Dr. Viel were receptive to the animators ' questions along the way and always came back with good advice and relevant resource materials .
" The revision process was more organic than a typical job , where we'd have a simple review and revision schedule after we received the storyboards , " says Liebler .
" In this case , they needed to describe these unseen processes for us and then we went back and forth with what we thought we could show and what we thought we could n't show .
As we did this , we 'd discover things that , surprisingly , we realized we could show .
It was much more flexible than an ordinary project . "
Dr. Lue says the animation has received a " tremendously enthusiastic response from students in both freshman biology and sophomore cell biology courses .
Furthermore , preliminary evaluation shows that using animations as a part of their study resource enhances performance on questions requiring data interpretation followed by hypothesis building in the cellular context by almost 30 percent . "
Through a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant awarded to Dr. Lue , Harvard has contracted XVIVO to create several more animations for the same classroom series .
" Both the quality of the final product and my experience working with XVIVO has reinforced my interest in a long - term collaboration with this team , " says Dr. Viel .
Liebler is already at work on the next one .
" In the past couple of days I 've been digging into the material to once again get my head around the scientific concepts and figure out how much we can carry over from the previous project to make the next one go even more smoothly , " he says .

The Corax , built by BAE Systems , is the UK's first pilotless stealth aircraft
Enlarge Image
The unmanned vehicle , which has been built by BAE Systems , is known as the Corax , or as the Raven .
The Corax bears some resemblance to a cancelled US military spy plane called DarkStar , analysts have said .
Jane 's International Defence Review said the unmanned aircraft " indicated a new direction in combat vehicles for the UK's armed forces " .
Bill Sweetman , the magazine 's aerospace and technology editor , said Corax could represent one member of a family of stealthy aircraft based around a similar central body but using different outer wings optimised for different missions .
" If you look at that Corax shape , it 's very reminiscent of something that 's designed to fly fairly high , fairly slow and have quite a long endurance .
It looks rather typical for a surveillance aircraft , " he told the BBC News website .
" But if you take those long outer wings off and put on shorter swept wings , you have a somewhat faster aircraft that would be more of a penetrating strike platform . "
Future plans
The US and British armed forces believe these pilotless planes will play an increasingly vital role on 21st Century battlefields .
The UK has reportedly scrapped plans for a future manned combat aircraft and is working closely with the US on " Project Churchill " .
The aircraft is probably a small demonstrator with a 5 - 6 m wingspan
Enlarge Image
The Corax prototype has been built to investigate the stability , control and performance of the design , which is said to maximise all - round stealth .
Mr Sweetman said the aircraft appears to be a small - scale demonstrator powered by a commercially available model aircraft jet engine and with a 5 - 6 m ( 16 - 19 ft ) wingspan .
Stealth technology refers to a variety of techniques used to render aircraft , ships and missiles less visible - and ideally invisible - to radar .
The prototype Corax was first flown in 2004 after a 10 - month development programme .

Fed 's Williams sees about three years for full U.S. recovery
The U.S. recovery from the coronavirus - linked recession has been more robust than expected , a top Federal Reserve policymaker said on Tuesday , though he added it could be about three years before the economy regains its strength .
WHEN it comes to the difficult problem of deciding who gets to keep the holiday home , the dog and the Barry Manilow albums , divorcing couples now have somewhere new to turn .
Researchers in Australia have developed a computer program that relies on a branch of mathematics known as game theory to produce a fairer outcome when dividing property .
Instead of the traditional approach of dividing a couple 's property in half , the system , called Family Winner , guides the couple through a series of trade - offs and compensation strategies .
According to John Zeleznikow , a computer scientist at Victoria University in Melbourne , who developed the software with his colleague Emilia Bellucci , the results are fairer because both parties end up with what they value most .
The software was tested last year on 50 divorcing couples , with the outcomes evaluated by Victoria Legal Aid .
Each party is given a limited number of points , which they are asked to allocate to the items of property they wish to keep .
Through a multi-step process of modification , the parties are encouraged to give priority to the items they most value .
The researchers found that , using the software , each party ended up with 70 - 80 % of what they originally wanted , rather than the usual 50 - 50 split .
Applying game theory in this way is a welcome development in an area of law where parties are normally encouraged to be combative when going through the courts , says Richard Susskind , a law professor who is technology adviser to England 's Lord Chief Justice .
In the eyes of the law , this approach to conflict resolution would appear to be superior , he says , because it produces a more equitable outcome than the courts .
But , he notes , it can be employed only if both parties consent to its use , which is unlikely in the most acrimonious cases .
“ The ones that perhaps need it the most may be the ones most resistant to using it , ” he warns .
Dr Zeleznikow admits that despite the system 's merits , divorcing couples do not necessarily always want what is fair .
But , he says , the system is intended for use by couples seeking out - of - court mediation as they separate , rather than those already involved in legal battles .
The software will be aimed at mediation services when it goes on sale later this year .
This is not Dr Zeleznikow 's first venture into the field of robolawyer software .
Indeed , for those determined to take their former spouses for everything they 've got , he has already developed a different program , called SplitUp , which can encourage them to reconsider mediation .
It uses techniques from the field of artificial intelligence to draw inferences based on past rulings in the Family Court of Australia .
This allows parties to play out risky or aggressive courtroom strategies to see just how successful they might actually be , but without any of the risks .
“ By going for the jugular , disputants generally diminish their prospects of getting what they want , ” says Dr Zeleznikow .
SplitUp can help people realise this , and thus encourage them to give mediation another look .
Game theory can be applied to many other fields besides family law , notes Dr Zeleznikow .
The availability of a purely rational approach to dividing property means that the same approach could be particularly suitable for resolving industrial disputes , he suggests .
By forcing the parties to focus on what matters most to them , it could bypass the emotional and political elements of a dispute that so often inhibit progress .
Resolving disputes more efficiently through software is a laudable aim .
But is there not a risk that it might trigger a legal arms race ?
After all , says Dr Susskind , if a system can be developed to inject fairness and rationality into divorce , then someone else could just as easily design a system that suggests more aggressive or Machiavellian strategies — to help clients take their exes to the cleaners .

Covid - 19 : avec les médecins de la dernière chance , à la Pitié - Salpêtrière
Le service de réanimation de l’hôpital parisien est spécialisé dans un système de circulation extracorporelle pour oxygéner le sang , l’ECMO , destiné à certains patients en état critique .
In yesterday 's press conference , President Bush insisted that there would be no withdrawal of American troops from Iraq as long as he was president .
He gave a long , scattered list of reasons .
Among them was a claim put forward in a number of different ways that boiled down to this : " it 's what the Iraqi people want . "
Really ?
Mark Tessler and Mansoor Moaddel recently released some of the data from their latest survey of Iraqi public opinion .
As reported in US News , this survey revealed that
The growing sense of insecurity affected all three of Iraq 's major ethnic and religious groups .
The number of Iraqis who " strongly agreed " that life is " unpredictable and dangerous " jumped from 41 % to 48 % of Shiites , from 67 % to 79 % of Sunnis , and from 16 % to 50 % of Kurds .
The most recent survey , done in April this year , also asked for " the three main reasons for the U.S. invasion of Iraq . "
Less than 2 % chose " to bring democracy to Iraq " as their first choice .
The list was topped by " to control Iraqi oil " ( 76 % ) , followed by " to build military bases " ( 41 % ) and " to help Israel " ( 32 % ) .
The survey also asked a direct question about the presence of American troops in Iraq ( which for some reason was not included either in Kaplan 's story or in the University of Michigan press release ) .
Tessler kindly provided me with a short write - up of the data , forthcoming in the TAARI Newsletter .
Here is Table 3 , responses to the question " Do you support or oppose the presence of coalition forces in Iraq ? "
The bottom line : 91.7 % of Iraqis oppose the presence of coalition troops in the country , up from 74.4 % in 2004 .
84.5 % are " strongly opposed " .
Among Sunnis , opposition to the US presence went from 94.5 % to 97.9 % ( 97.2 % " strongly opposed " ) .
Among Shia , opposition to the US presence went from 81.2 % to 94.6 % , with " strongly opposed " going from 63.5 % to 89.7 % .
Even among the Kurds , opposition went from 19.6 % to 63.3 % .
In other words , it is n't just that Iraqis oppose the American presence - it's that their feelings are intense : only 7.2 % " somewhat oppose " and 4.7 % " somewhat support . "
Maybe there are reasons for keeping American troops in Iraq , but " it 's what the Iraqi people want " really does n't seem to be one of them .
The water flea Daphnia pulex is a commonly used model organism among ecologists and other environmental scientists .
Copyright Holder : P.D.N. Hebert , University of Guelph
When sexual species reproduce asexually , they accumulate bad mutations at an increased rate , report two Indiana University Bloomington evolutionary biologists in this week 's Science .
The researchers used the model species Daphnia pulex , or water flea , for their studies .
The finding supports a hypothesis that sex is an evolutionary housekeeper that adeptly reorders genes and efficiently removes deleterious gene mutations .
The study also suggests sexual reproduction maintains its own existence by punishing , in a sense , individuals of a species that meander into asexuality .
" It is known that sex is common in plants and animals , and that asexual species are typically short - lived , but why this should hold throughout evolutionary time is a great mystery , " said Susanne Paland , who led the study .
" Our results show that asexual deviants are burdened by an ever - increasing number of genetic changes that negatively affect the function of their proteins .
It appears sex is important because it rids genomes of harmful mutations . "
Coauthor Michael Lynch added , " Although there has been solid theory on the matter for quite some time , these results provide the first definitive proof at the molecular level that sexual reproduction magnifies the efficiency of natural selection in eliminating deleterious mutations from populations . "
Sexual reproduction is biologically costly and at times complicated .
In mammals , sex is usually preceded by intricate mating behaviors .
It requires the compatibility of sexual structures , an insertion event , fertile eggs and sperm , and the successful unification of egg and sperm into a viable zygote .
All of this adds up to a big energy investment -- energy an organism might have used for other purposes .
Scientists have long been left to ponder , what is it about sex that justifies its big energy investment ?
Biologists have come up with a wide variety of competing ( and , in some cases , complementary ) hypotheses to explain why sex continues to exist in the midst of recurrently evolving asexual competitors .
The most widely accepted explanation has been that sexual reproduction confers the benefit of " unlinking " genes , meaning bad versions of genes wo n't always get to ride the coattails of good versions , and vice versa .
In essence , the theory holds that natural selection operates best when parts of the genome are free to shuffle .
The present report provides evidence this is so .
In the case of Daphnia pulex , sex appears to have enabled the separation of beneficial and deleterious versions of genes , so natural selection could act more efficiently in favoring the good and weeding out the bad .
The scientists used mitochondrial genome data to compose a phylogenetic tree depicting relationships among sexual and asexual strains of Daphnia pulex sampled from 75 ponds as far west as Illinois and as far east as Nova Scotia , Canada .
This family tree reveals that sexual populations have recently and repeatedly spun off asexual strains .
The scientists sequenced the entire mitochondrial genomes for a subset of these sexual and asexual lines of Daphnia pulex , and by comparing rates of protein evolution , they found the asexual lines have accumulated bad mutations four times faster than sexual lines .
Paland and Lynch reason that if a switch to asexuality causes a big increase in the number of protein defects , a mechanism for removing those defects must somehow be missing when sex , too , is missing .
The present report supports the notion that it is sex -- or genetic recombination that is a component of sexual reproduction -- which is the purifying force that helps get rid of genetic mishaps that harm the overall evolutionary health of a population .
The ability to reproduce asexually may be useful to organisms that can't get mates , but its long - term benefits are questionable .
" Ultimately , we would like to know how long a species can abstain from sex without going extinct , " Lynch said .

If you want to lead a team , a company , an army , or a country , the primary problem you face is getting everyone moving in the same direction , which is really just a polite way of saying “ getting people to do what you want . ”
Think of it this way .
As soon as your team consists of more than one person , you ’re going to have different people with different agendas .
They want different things than you want .
If you ’re a startup founder , you might want to make a lot of money quickly so you can retire early and spend the next couple of decades going to conferences for women bloggers .
So you might spend most of your time driving around Sand Hill Road talking to VCs who might buy the company and flip it to Yahoo !.
But Janice the Programmer , one of your employees , does n’t care about selling out to Yahoo ! , because she ’s not going to make any money that way .
What she cares about is writing code in the latest coolest new programming language , because it ’s fun to learn a new thing .
Meanwhile your CFO is entirely driven by the need to get out of the same cubicle he has been sharing with the system administrator , Trekkie Monster , and so he ’s working up a new budget proposal that shows just how much money you would save by moving to larger office space that ’s two minutes from his house , what a coincidence !
The problem of getting people to move in your direction ( or , at least , the same direction ) is not unique to startups , of course .
It ’s the same fundamental problem that a political leader faces when they get elected after promising to eliminate waste , corruption , and fraud in government .
The mayor wants to make sure that it ’s easy to get city approval of a new building project .
The city building inspectors want to keep getting the bribes they have grown accustomed to .
And it ’s the same problem that a military leader faces .
They might want a team of soldiers to charge at the enemy , even when every individual soldier would really just rather cower behind a rock and let the others do the charging .
Here are three common approaches you might take :
The Command and Control Method
Method The Econ 101 Method
Method The Identity Method
You will certainly find other methods of management in the wild ( there ’s the exotic “ Devil Wears Prada ” Method , the Jihad Method , the Charismatic Cult Method , and the Lurch From One Method To Another Method ) but over the next three days , I ’m going to examine these three popular methods and explore their pros and cons .
The Fed 's Open Market Committee has raised its key interest rate for the 17th time in a row to its highest level in more than five years .
Federal Reserve head Ben Bernanke said the risk of inflation could well require " some further policy firming " .
But he also indicated that the string of rate rises could be nearing an end .
" Ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labour costs , and inflation expectations remain contained , " the Fed said in a statement .
" However , the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures . "
On Thursday New York crude oil rose by more than $ 1 to hit $ 73 .
' Relief rally '
Analysts remain split over how long the Fed is likely to extend its run of rate hikes .
We have Mr Bernanke rebuilding his credibility in the eyes of the market by committing to combat inflation while also indicating that the economy is cooling
Elisabeth Denison
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein
" There is a sense that another rate hike by the Fed will not be automatic , " said David Jones , head of consultancy at DMJ Advisors .
" This is a relief rally . "
US stocks soared on the news , seeing it as a sign that the Fed 's two year credit - tightening policy could be slowing down .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 217.24 points higher , or nearly 2 % , to reach 11,190.8 , marking its highest gain since April 2005 .
The Nasdaq index of technology stocks saw a dramatic rise of 62.5 points , or close to 3 % , at 2.174.38 , its highest rise in over two years .
Meanwhile the Standard & Poor 500 was 26.87 points , or 2 % higher , at 1,272.87 , its biggest climb since October 2003 .
However some are not changing their positions .
" Lehman Brothers still expects the Fed to raise rates another 25 basis points in August and follow up with a final 25 basis point rate in October , " said David Mozina of Lehman Brothers .
' Turning point '
The problem for the Fed is that while prices have been rising faster than officials would like , other recent data has indicated that US economic growth is slowing .
Concerns that higher interest rates may slow US growth just as consumer spending dips and the housing market cools have prompted a sell - off in global stock markets during recent weeks .
" We are at a turning point right now and not even the Fed can be sure how much more needs to be done , " said David Jones .
Analysts also have complained that Mr Bernanke is giving out conflicting statements on the direction of the Fed 's rate policy , increasing and amplifying the recent market volatility .
" He 's talking way too much and he says one thing one day and then says something entirely different the next day , " said Martin Regalia , chief economist at the US Chamber of Commerce and a former Fed economist , earlier in the day .
" This is not increasing transparency .
It is increasing confusion , " she added .
Elsewhere , the Commerce Department released figures on Thursday showing that the US net debt to the rest of the world hit a record of $ 2.69 trillion at the end of 2005 .
It said that Americans held overseas assets - such as shares , bonds and factories - worth $ 10.01 trillion , while foreign owners held $ 12.70 trillion in US assets .

Sweden appears to have a full - fledged pirate movement .
In addition to The Pirate Bay it also has a Pirate Office and a Pirate Party .
The latter are considering entering Swedish politics by taking part in this year ’s elections for the Swedish Riksdag and may very well obtain a seat .
The pirate movement started in the summer of 2003 with the establishment of the Pirate Office ( Piratbyrån ) .
Its name refers to the Svenska Antipiratbyrån , the lobbying group which was set up by media companies to investigate breaches of copyright and take these to court .
The Pirate Office believes that there should be no obstructions to the copying of information and culture , and wants to start a public debate on the issue .
In November 2003 the group Bittorent - tracker established The Pirate Bay , which has continued independently since October 2004 .
On 1 January 2006 Rickard Falkvinge opened a website announcing the intention to start a Pirate Party ( Piratpartiet , pp ) and a prototype of the party programme .
On 15 February the party already had the 1,500 signatures needed for official registration as a political party .
Today it has 7,136 members .
Not bad compared with the 7,862 members of the green party Milieupartit ( mp ) , one of the two leftwing parties , with 17 seats in the Riksdag supporting the social - democratic minority government of Göran Persson .
The razzia on 31 May by the Swedish police against The Pirate Bay led to a 50 % increase in its membership .
The Pirate Party ’s programme can be summed up in three main points : personal integrity should be protected , culture should be free , patents and private monopolies are harmful to society .
The party ’s position is that in modern society individuals are monitored in all kinds of ways , especially in the digital world .
It claims that current legislation is totally outdated and hampers creativity , hence all restrictions on copying information for private purposes should be lifted .
This means that copying an MPG - or MP3 - file for personal use or for a friend should be made legal , but does not comprise the total abolition of today ’s copyright and patent laws .
The party acknowledges that such legislation is reasonable and necessary for companies and commercial interests .
The party has no opinions on any other issue and has announced that its vote in the Riksdag will be available in exchange for the realisation of its programme .
The party adopts a neutral position between the two large blocs in Swedish politics : the Alliance for Sweden which groups four parties of the right , and the bloc on the left comprising the governing social - democrats with the Greens ( mp ) and the Left ( v ) .
These blocs are on a par in the opinion polls , and the Pirate Party hopes that in the elections it may be in a position where it can shift the balance .
Some polls indicate that there is a chance of it gaining a seat .
The minimum number of votes required to gain a seat ( 4 % ) is 225.000 , and the party is hoping to glean these from the 800,000 to 1.1 million Swedes who use file sharing .
Already , however , the Pirate Party ’s influence is being felt in Swedish politics .
The Greens , the Left and the Moderaten ( m ) have made adjustments to their programmes to prevent voters from switching to the Pirate Party .
Thomas Bodström , the Swedish Justice Minister , clearly concerned by the advent of the Pirate Party , suggested altering the law to make filesharing legal in exchange for an extra tax on the use of broadband .
The Pirate Party ’s response to this was negative .
They said this was not an acceptable solution but one which indicates that the traditional politicians have still not grasped the problem .
Location is crucial in determining how many solar cells are necessary to power a house .

If you have read the HSW article entitled How Solar Yard Lights Work , then you can get a feeling for how much power a solar cell can produce .
The solar panel shown in that article contains 4 cells , and each of them can produce 0.45 volts and 100 milliamps , or 45 milliwatts .
Each cell measures 2 inches by 0.5 inches .
In other words , with these solar cells you can generate 45 milliwatts in one square inch ( 6.45 square cm ) .
For the sake of discussion , let 's assume that a panel can generate 70 milliwatts per square inch .
To calculate how many square inches of solar panel you need for a house , you need to know :

How much power the house consumes on average .
Where the house is located ( so you can calculate mean solar days , average rainfall , etc. ) .
This question is impossible to answer unless you have a specific location in mind .
We 'll assume that on an average day the solar panels generate their maximum power for 5 hours .
The first question is actually pretty interesting , so let 's work on it .
A " typical home " in America can use either electricity or gas to provide heat -- heat for the house , the hot water , the clothes dryer and the stove / oven .
If you were to power a house with solar electricity , you would certainly use gas appliances because solar electricity is so expensive .
This means that what you would be powering with solar electricity are things like the refrigerator , the lights , the compute­r , the TV , stereo equipment , motors in things like furnace fans and the washer , etc .
Let 's say that all of those things average out to 600 watts on average .
Over the course of 24 hours , you need 600 watts * 24 hours = 14,400 watt - hours per day .
­ From our calculations and assumptions abo­ve , we know that a solar panel can generate 70 milliwatts per square inch * 5 hours = 350 milliwatt hours per day .
Therefore you need about 41,000 square inches of solar panel for the house .
That 's a solar panel that measures about 285 square feet ( about 26 square meters ) .
That would cost around $ 16,000 right now .
Then , because the sun only shines part of the time , you would need to purchase a battery bank , an inverter , etc. , and that often doubles the cost of the installation .
If you want to have a small room air conditioner in your bedroom , double everything .
Because solar electricity is so expensive , you would normally go to great lengths to reduce your electricity consumption .
Instead of a desktop computer and a monitor you would use a laptop computer .
You would use fluorescent lights instead of incandescent .
You would use a small B&W TV instead of a large color set .
You would get a small , extremely efficient refrigerator­ .
By doing these things you might be able to reduce your average power consumption to 100 watts .
This would cut the size of your solar panel and its cost by a factor of 6 , and this might bring it into the realm of possibility .
The thing to remember , however , is that 100 watts per hour purchased from the power grid would only cost about 24 cents a day right now , or $ 91 a year .
That 's why you do n't see many solar houses unless they are in very remote locations .
When it only costs about $ 100 a year to purchase power from the grid , it is hard to justify spending thousands of dollars on a solar system .

Who are you ?
Volume 9 , Issue 99 ; ; last modified 08 Oct 2010
Actually , not so much who are you in any absolute sense , but sometimes I 'd like to be able to distinguish you from everyone else .
Using OpenID , for example , instead of yet another user name and password .
The whole campaign was a tragic case of mistaken identity .
— George McGovern
I have no particular expertise in security or identity issues , for that you want someone like Eve .
I thought I 'd say that right up front .
Nevertheless , I build web applications and sometimes I want those applications to be able to distinguish one user from another .
When I built WITW , I employed what I expect is the most common mechanism for this purpose : user names and passwords .
There are two problems ( three actually ) with user names and passwords : convenience and security .
If every web application that wants to distinguish your identity from the identity of others asks you to provide a user name and password , you have two choices : create a whole raft of user name / password pairs , inconvenient for most people , or use the same user name / password pair for more than one application .
Reuse exposes you to greater risk : it means that if any one of the applications you use is compromised , other applications are potentially compromised as well .
When I built the photodata.org application , I decided to try something else : OpenID .
The promise of OpenID is the ability to broker your identity through a common server .
That common server can authenticate your identity to any number of web applications without requiring you to reveal any user name or password information to the individual applications .
From the other side of the fence , to the application , user identity becomes a verified URI instead of a verified user name .
I already expect to use URIs to identify things , so that 's a win too .
I 'm currently using Verisign 's personal identity server , but there are plenty of other OpenID servers out there .
You can even run your own server , if you want .
I 'm giving Verisign a little free advertising here to reward them for outstanding service .
The OpenID login stuff involves several redirects and some session caching and is a little complicated to setup .
I wanted a Ruby implementation that was n't designed to be part of a Rails framework , so I wound up having to hack my own from one of the example scripts .
I got it wrong a bunch of times before I got it right which was n't too surprising .
What was surprising was that the technical director of the PiP program noticed my failed attempts in their server logs and contacted me to help .
I thought that was pretty impressive .
In case you too are looking for a non-Rails implementation , feel free to start with my efforts .
You can also take it for a test drive , if you 'd like .
So far , my experience with OpenID has been all positive .
I had no trouble explaining it to several early testers of photodata.org and they had no trouble going out and getting their own identities .
I can tell users apart and I do n't have to manage user names and passwords ( I do n't have to assign them , I do n't have to store them , I do n't have to help people who forget them , I do n't have to worry about someone stealing them , etc. ) .
Next time you build a web application that needs a login , consider OpenID .
The Nintendo Revolution has finally received its " real " name , the " Wii . " Pronounced " we , " as in " we really do n't know about this name , " the name is supposed to connote the universal appeal of the console .
It 's for all of us , you see .
You , me , uh , we !
So sayeth Nintendo :
While the code - name Revolution expressed our direction , Wii represents the answer .
Wii will break down that wall that separates videogame players from everybody else .
Wii will put people more in touch with their games ... and each other .
But you 're probably asking :
What does the name mean ?
Wii sounds like " we , " which emphasizes the console is for everyone .
Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world , no matter what language they speak .
No confusion .
No need to abbreviate .
Just Wii .
Wii has a distinctive " ii " spelling that symbolizes both the unique controllers and the image of people playing it .
And Wii , as a name and a console , brings something revolutionary to the world of videogames that sets it apart from the crowd .
So that 's Wii .
But now Nintendo needs you .
Because it 's really not about you or me .
It 's about Wii .
And together , Wii will change everything .
The name also brings to mind the cacophonous hollering of " wee " on playgrounds , roller coasters , and Fry 's electronics sales floors .
Or maybe that 's what you 'll be shouting when you 're using the Wii's " revolutionary " controller .
And for those of you keeping score , two " i"s are better than one .
Hence
Wii is twice as awesome as iPod , iPlayer , iTunes , or iWhatever .
And let 's hope that our children do n't get too confused over all of these double " i " words , either .
Wii is wee , but Viiv is vive , as in vibe .
At least the Germans can be consistent about this " i " stuff .
Do you think about socks much if at all these days ?
I usually think of them when I wear boots , and if I owned and wore sneakers .
They ’re an accessory that has practically forgotten about since ballet flats became so popular .
French designer , Delphine Murat has come up with an ingenious idea to make socks fashionable again with her line of MiniSocks .
Like sockets , they add a bit of extra jazz to any outfit .
Slip them on with a pair of sexy stiletto heeled pumps or a pair of plain ballet flats then lace then around your ankle like a ballerina ; they will add a bit of French sophistication to your footwear any day .
Give your outfit an eighties sporty look like Gemma Ward modeled in the April 2006 issue of UK Vogue ( pictured ) , or pair a lacy mini sock with black heels for some sexy sophistication .
Available in Australia in black , pink , blue , gold , silver and lace for AUD $ 69 a pop , they ’re exclusive to Tuchuzy ’s Bondi Beach Store .
So is n’t it about time you pop by 90 Gould St , Bondi Beach , in Sydney ?
I am very tempted to buy a lace pair – with cropped pants / pencil skirt and heels it could definitely turn heads .
[ Update ]
They ’re now also available online at eDressMe.com .
Why " I 'd Prefer If You Called Us X " Is n't Enough of an Argument in My Book :
On the " handicapped " thread , Trevor Morrison asks :
My mother spent years as an advocate for the disabled .
On the basis of her work there , I 'm reasonably certain that people actually involved in the lives of the disabled tend to favor " disabled " over " handicapped . "
Your defense of " handicapped " relies on your account of the word 's etymology .
So is your position that the formal definition and origin of a word always defines its appropriate usage , or do contemporary changes in usage affect things ?
A good question , which I think deserves a detailed answer .
First , let me make clear that I do n't think etymology dictates meaning ; my post about " handicapped " was a rebuttal to the argument that " handicapped has a pejorative etymology , therefore it's a rude term to use " ; that argument , I pointed out , was premised on an inaccurate factual claim .
But one can still argue that the term is pejorative even if its original meaning is fairly innocent .
Let me also make clear that I do n't want to fault anyone for trying extra hard to accommodate what he sees as the preferences of a group or some members of that group ; if that 's your choice , fine by me .
Rather , it seems to me that the interesting question here is whether people have some sort of good manners obligation to abandon " disabled " for " handicapped , " " American Indian " for " Native American , " " black " for " African American , " and so on .
I think the answer is generally no , unless the old term is so commonly used as a pejorative that listeners can reasonably infer that your use of it is pejorative , or possibly if the old term is so rarely used and thus archaic that listeners can reasonably wonder " what does he mean by that ? " when they hear it ( e.g. , " Negro " or " Hebrew " as a noun to refer to Jews ) .
The mere fact that some members of a group , or even a majority of the members of a group , prefer the new term does n't impose on us an obligation to use the new term .
Here are a few reasons why .
1 . To begin with , note that Prof. Morrison cites the views not of the disabled generally ( a hard group to poll ) , but of " people actually involved in the lives of the disabled . "
More precisely , I suspect that he is relying on the views of those people who are " advocates of the disabled " and who are outspoken enough to express their views as to the preference .
This may well be a highly unrepresentative sample of the disabled .
Just by way of example , a 1995 Labor Department survey reported that 50 % of American Indians preferred " American Indian " and only 37 % preferred " Native American " ; 44 % of blacks preferred " Black " and only 40 % preferred " African - American " or " Afro - American " ; 58 % preferred " Hispanic " and only 12 % preferred " Latino " ( no separate data was given for " Latino / a " ) .
Matters may have shifted some since 1995 , but not vastly ; and I 'm pretty sure that in 1995 , the preferred terms among activists were " Native American , " " African - American , " and ( here I 'm less sure ) " Latino , " yet the actual majority ( or , for blacks , plurality ) preferences were different .
( Source : U.S. News & World Report , Nov. 20 , 1995 . )
Even if I thought that I had some moral or good manners responsibility to use the label preferred by a strong majority of the group , I see no basis for accepting such a responsibility to use the label preferred by a vocal minority , or even half of the group .
2. Moreover , shifting from an old label to a new label is not cost - free .
It 's not cost - free for the speaker .
Sometimes the new term has shades of meaning that are n't quite apt for certain uses , and thus requires extra work to think through .
( " African - American , " for instance , is n't a racial group , but a racial subset of Americans ; it thus is n't always an apt substitute . )
Sometimes the new term carries an ideological literal meaning that the spaker may disliks evoking , even when it 's fairly clear that he 's using the term just as a label and not for its literal meaning .
This is clearest for " differently abled " or " Latter - Day Saint " ( I have nothing against Mormons , but I prefer not to call them Saints , even with the implied quotes ) .
But it may also apply in other situations , such as with " disabled " ; some people may genuinely prefer to stress the handicap ( i.e. , burden ) under which a person labors rather than his disability .
Sometimes the word acquires a connotation of adherence to the ideology that spawned it ; the word " womyn " may be the most famous example , though I suspect that these days it 's so often used facetiously that people may want to avoid it for that reason as well .
Speakers may then resist using the term because they do n't want to be seen as proclaiming allegiance to an ideology that they do not adhere to .
Sometimes the new term is just clunkier and sounds more stilted to many people ; some , I suspect , take this view as to African - American , and I suspect that headline writers are especially unhappy with it .
3 . But the more important cost to the speaker is that telling people that they should stop saying certain words , not because those words are likely to be reasonably interpreted as expressing hostility , but simply because some other people dislike those words , is itself something of an affront to dignity and a possible source of offense .
Even the good - mannered among us cherish our freedom to speak as we please , and while we try not to be rude ( in the sense of slighting others or saying bad things about them ) , we understandably bristle at being told to stop using this word and start using that one on pain of Being a Bad Person .
A sound explanation that shows why people are reasonably offended by a term ( for instance , an explanation to someone coming from Russia , where " black " is insulting much like " yellow " would be , and " negro " is considered the proper scientific term , that in America " negro " is so rarely used that it sounds like a deliberate insult at worst or one of those what - did - he - mean - by - that ? archaicisms at best ) might soften the sting .
But simply saying " most of us like this term , so stop using this other one that you 've used all your life " is a legitimate source of offense for those whose speech people are trying to control .
It 's even more such a source if those people were once taught by then - representatives of the same group that " handicapped " was the better term , and some years later are now told that it 's become bad .
And it 's especially so when the number of forbidden words grows and grows ( " rule of thumb , " " Chinese wall , " " seminal , " etc. ) .
4 . On top of that , there 's also another substantial cost to the " If you are n't a bigot , stop saying ' handicapped ' and say ' disabled ' instead " approach :
It may actually increase how often the group that one is trying to protect from offense ends up feeling offended .
If handicapped people learn that some people say " disabled " and others say " handicapped , " and that neither is evidence of hostility , a few might still bristle at one ( or the other ) ; but many will be satisfied by the explanation that decent people use both .
But say that everyone is told that " disabled " is the one right term , and some decent people do n't go along , whether because of force of habit , strong preference for " handicapped , " or just bristling at being told what to say .
Then handicapped people who hear the term may well become more offended , because they 've been taught that the word is offensive .
People who might even prefer to shrug the term off might feel almost obligated to take it as an insult .
If someone calls me " Gene " rather than " Eugene , " I 'm a little annoyed ( that 's just not the name I prefer in English ) , but I assume that it 's just because they 've fallen into that habit with other Eugenes they know , who do go by Gene in a way that I do n't .
I assume the speaker 's intentions were good , and I think I 'm happier for it .
But if someone started a campaign of insisting that calling me Gene is actually rude , perhaps even insulting ( because the diminutive implies a diminution of my status ) , I 'd both hear " Gene " a bit less often , and be much more annoyed when I do hear it , precisely because I 'll worry that it's a deliberate violation of the New Good Manners Rule and thus a deliberate slight .
Those who make the handicapped / disabled issue into a matter of identity politics rather than just a matter of apricot / apricot ( or even Gene / Eugene ) may thus increase the amount of hurt feelings on both sides .
5 . So I think the approach that 's more tolerant of speakers , ultimately more likely to avoid offense to the subjects of the speech , and less likely to be subject to the whims of a small minority of activists is generally to tolerate both the old terms and the new terms , and not consider either to be a breach of good manners .
There are exceptions .
One , as I noted above , is when one term is so often used pejoratively that reasonable listeners might assume that the current user is using it pejoratively .
Another is when the term is so archaic that it will make people wonder whether the speakers must have some ulterior motive in using it ( the obvious motive , which is that it 's a commonly used term that springs to people 's minds naturally , being absent ) .
There may well be others ; rules of manners are often not competely simple and crisp .
But as to handicapped / disabled , or American Indian / Native American , or black / African American , the let - at - least - a- couple - flowers - bloom approach strikes me as the clearly preferable one .
Police say they arrested him for driving without a license and disobeying a police officer .
He spent six hours in jail before being released on bail .
He 's the third " Lost cast " member to be arrested for traffic violations .
Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros were the others .
Six other cast members have been cited , but not arrested .
They are Josh Holloway , Dominic Monaghan , Naveen Andrews , Ian Somerhalder , Christian Bowman and Harold Perrineau .

Cluster headache sufferers say LSD can abort attacks .
Cluster headaches cause excruciating pain around the eyes .
We need to study the effect of powerful hallucinogens such as LSD ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) and psilocybin , the active ingredient in ' magic ' mushrooms , on debilitating cluster headaches , researchers say .
Their study , which points towards the effectiveness of these drugs , is published in the journal Neurology1 .
It is the first formal look at reports of LSD 's therapeutic benefits in nearly 40 years , says Andrew Sewell of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Massachusetts .
LSD was used extensively in psychiatric research in the 1960s , but as mainstream attitudes swung against ' acid ' , prohibitive measures made researching the beneficial effects of hallucinogens extremely difficult .
Cluster headaches are characterized by excruciating pain that lasts from fifteen minutes to up to three hours if left untreated .
In the chronic form , attacks can happen up to eight times a day , with no period of remission lasting longer than a month .
The condition is not fatal , but for some sufferers it is so horrific they commit suicide .
There is no cure , but sufferers are often given supplemental oxygen to ease an attack .
Some are prescribed migraine drugs , but these may not work and the side effects are often extreme .
About five years ago , users of Internet message boards began swapping stories about chronic sufferers who gained two - to six - month periods of complete remission after one or two sub-hallucinogenic doses of LSD or psilocybin .
Sewell and John Halpern , both of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center , decided to investigate .
They interviewed 53 cluster - headache sufferers around the world who had self - administered psychedelics in an attempt to alleviate their symptoms .
Medical records were checked to verify that they did indeed suffer from cluster headaches .
Acid test
Their results are startling : the majority ( 85 % ) of psilocybin users report that it aborted attacks — better than oxygen , which stopped attacks for 52 % of the patients surveyed .
LSD and psilocybin were both better at preventing future attacks than conventional medicines .
The authors note there are many potential sources of bias in this type of retrospective analysis : sufferers may be more likely to recall and report good experiences than bad , for example .
" Many retrospective studies have shown strong effects that evaporated when studied properly , so we are inclined to take a sceptical stance , " says Sewell .
Nonetheless , they say further research with controlled , randomized clinical trials is warranted .
In the meantime , many sufferers are convinced of the psychedelic drugs ' utility .
One patient , Bob Wold , started the Clusterbusters website to alert the community to the potential benefits — and dangers — of psychedelic drugs .
For him , he says , a single dose every six months helps to stave off attacks .
" I use psilocybin , and use just enough that I can feel the effects but do n't really hallucinate as people would expect . "
The feeling , he says , is similar to what others might call a " two - beer buzz " .
Head case
" I think there are better things to test , " says Peter Goadsby , an expert in cluster headaches from the Institute of Neurology , University College London .
But , he adds , " there seems to be a large number of people who think it 's been useful to them , so it 's a reasonable thing to consider . "
Sufferers of the condition certainly need help , he adds .
" It 's the most appalling thing that can happen to you short of losing your family .
That people are taking LSD and psilocybin is a reflection of the desperate straits they are in . "
It is unclear how the drugs might work , though it is clear they affect the brain .
LSD and psilocybin are types of amines called tryptamines , and their chemical structures are very similar to natural neurotransmitters such as serotonin .
One conventional medicine for cluster headaches , Methysergide , is known to be chemically similar to LSD .
The study was partly funded by MAPS ( Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ) , a non-profit alliance of scientists and campaigners that funds research into the therapeutic benefits of psychoactive drugs and lobbies for changes in US law .
The California - based MAPS is also helping to fund a study into the effects of MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , also known as ecstasy ) on post - traumatic stress disorder .
And a MAPS - funded study into psilocybin as a treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder has been completed at the University of Arizona , Tucson .
Halpern is separately leading another study on the effects of MDMA on end - stage cancer anxiety .
Halpern and Sewell are now pushing for clinical trials of LSD and psilocybin .
" We owe it to patients to determine whether this treatment works , " says Sewell .
" And we owe it to neurologists to provide them with accurate information so that they can effectively counsel patients . "

The Azerbaijani media is rife with speculation that Harnish is being recalled because of a burgeoning human smuggling scandal which came to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The Moscow newspaper Trud newspaper reported on Thursday that FBI agents began interviews with embassy officials about the smuggling of Azerbaijani prostitutes into the United States and the issuing of visas .
As the investigation proceeded , Zarifa Dzhabieva , a former translator for the American embassy was found knifed to death in her own home .
Whoever killed Dzhabieva ransacked her dwelling looking for something , even though none of the victim 's valuables had been touched .
Dzhabieva was under investigation for aiding and abetting the issuing of visas and forged documents to girls destined for the U.S. sex trade .

There are n't many small countries with greater geostrategic heft than Azerbaijan .
Wedged between Russia and Iran , it 's a major port of entry to the West for the region 's oil and heroin , much of the latter being routed through the distribution hub of Kosovo , secured in the Balkans wars of the last decade .
Another commodity in Azerbaijan 's pipeline subject to fantastic mark - up is the flesh of young women .
Anar Orujov , in his report " Azerbaijani slaves of the 21st century " for the Caucasus Media Investigations Center , writes that " in our country a prostitute can make a profit from $ 7,000 up to $ 100,000 depending on the ' exploitation conditions . '
No doubt that , and establishment of a large mafia network which sometimes .
" The composition of the US - Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce certainly suggests another large mafia network has n't neglected Baku .
The " Honorary Council of Advisors " includes James Baker , Lloyd Bentson , Zbigniew Brzezinski , Dick Cheney ( resigned after the Nov 2000 election ) , Henry Kissinger , Brent Scowcroft and John Sununu .
Richard Perle is a Trustee , and Richard Armitage was on the Board until his State Department appointment .
Turkish and Azerbaijani were Sibel Edmonds ' two languages in the FBI 's translation department , where she discovered the intersections of drugs , arms and oil .
So it 's with some interest I read that the US State Department has today announced the recall of Ambassador Reno Harnish , former Chief of Mission , Pristina ( capital of the aforementioned hub of Kosovo ) and late of the American Enterprise Institute .
Why , is of particular interest .
From UPI
Tales of prostitution , visa fraud , human trafficking and the murder of an embassy translator prompted the bizarre comment from public relations official Jonathan Henick that " The uncovering of the crime linked to the sale of Azerbaijani girls to the USA , and the punishment of the guilty parties merely shows the high level of American - Azerbaijani relations .
"
A translation of thestory , reproduced in , can be read here adds that " It is known for certain that the enlistment and transfer of young people from sunny Azerbaijan to no less sunny Florida were organized on a truly American scale and brought large profits .
" Reno seems destined to land on his feet , reputation unsmudged .
His next assignment appears already lined up .
According to " diplomatic sources " , he will find an environmental posting engaged in the " fight against bird flu . "
Having lauded the arrival of legal music download services likes Apple 's iTunes for saving it from online piracy , the music industry is now complaining that the digital domain is not sufficiently recompensing artists .
According to a report in today 's Times newspaper , the Music Managers Forum ( MMF ) , a trade body of artists ' representatives , are bemoaning the 4.5 p performers make out of every 79 p iTunes download .
That figure , which translates into a rate of six per cent is half the rate they get from physical singles .
“ Sale prices and royalties have gradually been eroded to the point where an artist needs to sell in excess of 1.5 m units before they can show a profit , after paying for recording time and tour support , " Jazz Summers , MMF chairman and manager of Snow Patrol , told the paper .
Separately , the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society ( MCPS ) and the Performing Rights Society ( PRS ) both want to up the writer 's royalty to 12 per cent from today 's 8.5 per cent rate , though they have said they are willing to knock it down to eight per cent cent for the next two years for new services .
Summers ' comment echoes a point made recently by Tim Clark , co-founder of ie : music , the company that represents Robbie Williams and others .
Clark told a meeting convened by industry networking organisation MusicTank that iTunes was giving most artists just 3 - 4 p per download .
For all his complaints about iTunes and Steve Jobs , Clark 's problem really lies with the labels .
iTunes , Napster , Virgin Digital , Wippit and co. are all retailers - performance royalties are negotiated by the labels and artists ' managers , not by the retailers .
That 's something Summers appears to appreciate : he said recording companies had been " caught with their pants down " by the legal download services .
Fearing the illegal download arena , they quickly accepted the pricing dictated to them by Apple and co .
Now they 're beginning to feel short - changed - witness last month 's comment from Warner Music CEO Edgar Bronfman that Apple 's uniform pricing policy is unfair , and should be replaced with a differential pricing plan , typically with new material costing more than older , back - catalogue songs .
Of course , that 's still not going to benefit the artists , many of whom are awaiting the end of their current recording contracts with labels so they can negotiate better download royalties .
In some cases , it can be argued that if managers were more astute , many artists would already have better royalty arrangements than they do today .
Market size
It 's also worth mentioning at this point that while Apple is singled out for most of the blame - after all , it owns more than 80 per cent of the UK , if not global , digital music download market - the segment in which it 's a player only accounts for a few percentage points of the overall music market .
Factor in all the products sold that have a music connection - including hi- fi kit , media and , yes , iPods - its an even smaller percentage .
Again , that puts the emphasis on getting ready for the time when it's a much more important part of the business .
Clark said he believes that stage is going to come much sooner than most people believe .
Indeed , he let slip that Robbie Williams ' £ 80 m four - album recording contract with EMI , signed in 2002 , is timed to come to end just as the download market really starts to take off .
How good Clark 's timing is will determine how successfully Williams can leverage the digital music market .
It 's up to other artists ' managers to similarly plan ahead .
Given how easy it is for indies to partner directly with iTunes and so on , that could lead to significant trouble for the labels , certainly if the established acts , who largely bankroll everything else the labels do , choose to cut their own download deals .
Worse , newer acts may choose the direct route too .
Paying for recording is the same whether the result is a download or a physical single , said Alun Taylor , MD of indie label Roots Music Group , but a download is a lot cheaper to offer and far less risky than putting out a potentially unsuccessful physical single . ®

« Why marketing should make the user manuals ! | Main | Friday bytes »
How to get users to RTFM
The " F " in RTFM is the biggest clue that most of us blame the user for not reading the manual .
But if " reducing guilt is the killer app " , companies should take more responsibility for whether readers use their manuals .
And since we can't force our users to do anything , if we want them to RTFM , we need to make a better FM .
[ This post is a follow - on to two earlier posts , Are your Users Stuck in P Mode ( worth reading for the very useful comments from others ) and my previous Why Marketing Should Make the Manuals ]
Qualifiers : this post is about products for which someone might have -- or develop - - a passion for whatever the product lets them DO .
So , we are n't talking about , say , watches or portable radios -- although these simple products still need good manuals .
Also , these tips are for those who are NOT professional tech writers .
Too many times , being asked to create the manual is almost a form of punishment because the company does n't appreciate the importance of the manual , let alone the skill ( and time ! ) required to craft a good one .
Note :
This is one long - ass post , with most of the words living in the vast cognitive wasteland known as the middle .
If you look at the graphic and skim only the headings , you 'll get most of what 's in here .
The rest is just support details .
In no particular order , a few tips on making a better FM :
Make Reading the Manual Unnecessary
In theory , " If your product is good enough , they should n't need a manual . "
In practice , that 's a meaningless sentence without context .
If your car radio does need a manual ( oh , how I hate that mine does ) , blame the designers .
But if your pro video editing software does n't , then it 's probably not a " pro " app .
A complex product that needs a manual does not necessarily mean there 's a design flaw .
If you are lucky enough to be in a position to influence a product 's design , then of course you 'll try to reduce the need for a manual .
All the standard usability , information architecture , and user experience advice applies here ( e.g. make the product intuitive , make the right things easy and the wrong things hard ( to do ) , rely on what Don Norman refers to as " knowledge in the world " rather than " knowledge in the head " , whenever possible ( more on that in a minute ) , follow sound user interface guidelines ( burn Steve Krug 's ideas into your DNA ) , etc . )
And if are a product developer , please , PLEASE kick the crap out of anyone on the team who utters the phrase all tech writers fear and hate , " We 'll fix that in documentation " -- a phrase that actually means , " We f'd up , but the tech writers will make up for our mistakes by putting a bunch of extra stuff in the manual to deal with it . "
But ...
I wrote this post because most of us do n't have the luxury of modifying ( let alone designing from scratch ) the products we want to help people use , so the rest of this assumes that you 're pretty much stuck with what you 've got .
Separate Reference from Learning
A good manual for a complex product should usually include at least FIVE distinct sections : Reference Guide , Tutorial , Learning / Understanding , Cookbook / Recipe , and Start Here .
The single biggest problem with most bad less than stellar manuals is that they 're usually only reference .
But even with the best index on the planet , a reference guide suffers from one huge mother - of - an - assumption : that the user knows exactly what to look up !
A reference guide , no matter how technically correct and concise and clear and all those other referencey goodness attributes , does virtually NOTHING to get me out of " P " mode if I do n't even know what ( or even that ) I should be looking up .
If I have a specific thing I know I need to do , AND I know what it 's called in the product , then I 'm fine with the reference guide .
But reference guides fail :
* If I have only a vague idea of what the " thing " is called that I want to look up .
OR
* If I do n't even know the thing exists
OR
* If I want to get better not at the tool , but at the thing the tool lets me do .
( This is my problem with the Nikon D200 manual ( which is actually a really good reference guide ) -- it helps me use the camera controls , but it 's teaching me only about the camera -- the thing I care least about .
What I really want is to take better photos , and if the manual helped me figure out which features of the camera mapped to which cool photography things I might want to do , I 'd come up the curve more quickly -- which means a better chance of becoming passionate , yada , yada , yada ) .
1 ) The Reference Guide
Despite the problems with having only a reference guide , it 's still one of the most important parts of the manual and deserves the best you can give it including a great index , a user - friendly , relevant organization scheme ( make it easy for me to look things up regardless of whether I know what they 're called , etc. ) , and clear , concise information with visuals whenever possible .
Since reference is where most manuals concentrate , and far more people are skilled at doing it , I 'm not going to say anything else about it here .
2 ) The Tutorial
By " tutorial " , we mean walking the user through a concrete example of using the product to do a specific task .
A lot of manuals skip this in favor of giving abstract instructions for how to do something , but not all brains can learn that way .
For many people , a step - by - step tutorial is the only thing that helps them " get it . "
So , even though some users will never need or read the tutorial sections , they can mean the difference between a new user who actually uses the product and one who never gets past opening the box .
A few tips on good tutorials :
* Choose examples that best reflect what most new users will want to do .
* Keep the cognitive overhead as low as possible by NOT using an example that requires domain - specific knowledge .
For example , a tutorial on a desktop publishing program would be better using a pizza shop as the scenario rather than , say , a tax attorney .
The learner should be able to focus 100 % of their brain cells on doing the tutorial and not a single neuron wasted in figuring out why that particular business would need to do that particular thing ...
* Include a LOT of them .
Some of us learn by " triangulation " .
* Watch for cliffs !
The deal - killer in a tutorial is when a crucial piece -- however small -- is left out either inadvertently or because the author assumed this part of the step was so frickin ' obvious .
Of course , the level of granularity you choose for a " part " depends on who your audience is .
Most software apps today should not have to explain how a mouse works , for example ; a lot of pre-existing user knowledge is rightly encapsulated in the " Select FOO from the BAR menu ... "
But , rarely do people complain that the manual contained too many step - by - step details .
For most of us , the pain starts when we suddenly turn the page and say , " Uh ... what did I just miss ?
How the hell did they get THERE ?
My dialog box looks nothing like that ... "
( If you want to know more about making good tutorials , a great place to look is at the Visual QuickStart Guides like the ones Tom and Dori write . )
3 ) Learning / Understanding
The more they understand , the less they have to memorize .
The only way to reduce the time and pain of the learning curve is to increase learning .
Too many manuals mistake reference information and memorization for learning , but we 've all experienced the frustration of looking something up , doing it , and then forgetting everything the next time we need to do it again .
The only way to really make it " stick " is by helping them ' get it ' on a deeper level , where the mental model ( thought bubble ) in their head matches the one you were trying to communicate ... the mental model that lets them extrapolate and infer and be creative about things that were n't in the tutorial .
While a tutorial is a concrete step - by - step use - case , without a deeper understanding of how and why things work the way they do , the user / learner can have trouble adapting what they did in the tutorial to their own unique use - cases .
We 've all seen users who end up bending and shoehorning their own work into something that more closely matches what the tutorial did , simply because that 's the only way they know how to do it !
By including a learning and understanding section in the manual , you have the best chance to help users get out of " P mode and -- most importantly - - want to .
This is where you take them from surface users who must call tech support at the first instant anything goes wrong to users who become engaged with the product and enjoy co-discovering all the ways in which the product will help them kick ass .
It is this part of the manual where the advertising , marketing , and entertainment folks have something to teach us .
It is up to us to get the user / learner motivated to not just Open The Manual , but to want to actually ... learn new things .
Learning new things usually sucks at first , because it means we have to pass through the phase of frustration , confusion , stupidity , anger , etc .
Most humans avoid learning anything that comes with a manual , and will try to do as little as possible to get the bare minimum level of competency .
This wo n't do if we 're actively trying to create and inspire passionate users .
We have to make this part of the manual especially enticing , compelling , seductive , entertaining , informative , useful ... all without ( as many of you warned ) making it appear like a shallow sales pitch .
This is also where it really needs to be memorable .
It 's amazing how much written documentation is meant to be remembered , but anything BUT memorable .
Memory is tied to chemistry , and the brain pays attention and records to long - term memory that which the brain finds important .
What your conscious mind wants has nothing to do with it -- this is about your legacy brain recognizing that this new thing is useful for long - term survival .
And let 's face it -- most of the content in user manuals are far , far , far , from something the brain thinks is important enough to store .
So , we have to trick the brain into thinking that [ insert widget A into widget B and configure server C... ] is just as important ( or life - threatening ) as the tiger licking his lips outside your cave .
And who better to help us make things stand out than advertisers and marketers ?
Entertainers and graphic designers ?
Really Good Storytellers ?
There are a ton of things that can get past the brain 's crap filter , but we have to care enough to create a manual that 's brain - friendly , not just user - friendly .
And the brain is sooooo much pickier about what it attends to and records .
Knowledge in the Head vs. Knowledge in the World
When we 're talking about memory , we have to define what should be remembered , and what should exist Out There .
Clearly , the more we can rely on external clues the better , and there 's no reason we should have to memorize the reference steps for doing something we 'll never do again , but we have to memorize some things .
The trick is to figure out what .
What will make their experience much better if they just know it ?
Don Norman talks about defining the difference between Knowledge in the World ( external clues ) vs. Knowledge in the Head ( things you memorize and " know " ) .
Although he 's talking about product design , it applies to manuals and to the relationship between the product and the manual .
4 ) Cookbook / Recipe
A tutorial is a specific , concrete example .
Reference is , well , reference .
Learning and understanding is the place where you start to really " get it " on a deeper level .
A Cookbook / Recipe section is where a series of steps that might otherwise live in different places in the manual are all brought together under something like a " How do I ... " heading .
It 's kind of like a playlist ; it rarely contains fundamentally new information , and simply groups a collection of otherwise separate pieces into one action / goal - based context .
For example , the Nikon D200 can do continuous high - speed shooting , but to do it right , you need to change several different settings on the camera including shooting mode , auto - focus , and metering .
The problem is , all the different pieces you need are scattered in different places in the manual , and you have to figure out which you need only if you happen to stumble on each section and put the pieces together in your head .
A simple , " How do I take high - speed shots ? " or even something like , " How do I take action shots ? " that described all the things you need to do ... in one place ... would be a HUGE help .
If page count is a concern , the cookbook section could simply list the different places in the manual you need to look ( e.g. reference page 27 , learning page 82 , reference page 120 , and the last half of the FOO tutorial ) .
And although having to flip pages is n't as user - friendly , it 's still way better than leaving it up to chance that the reader will put those pieces together on his own .
5 ) Start Here
There you are , with the freshly opened box , staring at this huge manual and wondering how long it 'll take to just do the One Simple Thing you bought this thing for .
A " Start Here " section , which many product manuals include , is a low - intimidation way to help the new user jump in and get something happening .
Some early success .
The problem with many Start Here guides is that they are about configuration and set - up and very little else .
There 's a Grand Canyon between the Start Here and ... the rest of the manual .
Ideally , the Start Here would go beyond the initial set - up and function as a kind of mini version of the whole manual .
And the Start Here makes a great sales piece for the manual itself .
" Hmmmm ... the Start Here guide was great , so if the rest of the manual is like that , this should n't be too painful .
Maybe even fun ... "
Of course we 've all seen Start Here guides that were total bait - and - switch -- they do indeed look as if they were produced by an inspired and caring design department , but then the REAL manual looks like it was done by someone who really , really does n't like you .
One of the best product manual goals we 've ever heard is the Electric Rain " User must do something cool in 30 minues " mission .
What would it mean to have a goal like that ?
Would it change anything about the manual ?
Change the " F " in RTFM to " Fun "
Not , just fun .
Fun as in chess .
Fun as in writing elegant code .
Fun as in doing something you 're good at ... something that lets you have a high - resolution experience .
What would it mean if you asked , " How can we make the manual a fun experience ? "
Do n't jump to the " nobody wants humour in a manual " argument -- you do n't need " humour " to have fun .
Change the " F " in RTFM to " Flow "
If you can keep the reader / learner / user in a flow state -- where the rest of the world drops away -- they 'll love you .
Seriously .
And they 'll want their friends and family to love you as much as they do .
The flow experience is one of the most enjoyable and enriching times in most people 's lives , and we all have the chance to help give our users just a little more of this .
There 's only so much we can do if the product itself is a flow killer , but the manual can go a long way toward helping the user stay in the moment doing whatever the tool is supposed to help them do .
The less they have to stop and refer to the manual ( because you helped them remember how the thing works so that the next right step feels natural and intuitive ) , the more they get to keep doing the do .
Care
About the right thing .
Instead of caring what the user / learner thinks about the manual or even the product , care about what the user thinks about .
Care about how the user feels during -- and as a result of - - his reading the manual and learning this thing .
Care about helping the user kick ass .
Care about giving the user an " I Rule ! " experience , rather than the default " I Suck " experience we usually get from trying to parse a product manual .
Yes , this is a big " duh " , but orientation is everything .
When you ask someone to create a manual , be sure they know who and what it 's for .
Be sure they know that the goal is not simply To Accurately Document The Thing , but to Help The User Kick Ass .
This one shift in perspective could change a user 's world .

I wonder how many manuals are tested rather than proof - read ?
You 're seeking to replicate the way a long term friend would explain it to you if they had used the product for many years and you were asking them specific " how do I do this ? " type questions .
That 's easy to expound but hard to do and I think there should be almost as much testing of the manual as of the product .

It was n't the quote I was looking for , but the sentiment is the same :
‘ In a sense , knowledge shrinks as wisdom grows : for details are swallowed up in principles .
’Alfred North Whitehead
-------
For the section " Make reading the manual unnecessary " , I would point people at the classic text : " The design of everyday things " ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385267746?v=glance)
-------
Section ' Change the " F " in RTFM to " Flow " '
At the risk of getting all recursive , it would seem that the thing to do when creating a tutorial or start guide would be to use the same criteria for design as we use for our main products - ie .
work out what it is that the user is actually trying to achieve .
In the case of a tutorial , we 're not aiming at the same end - game that we are with our product , but we should be using a criterion like " at the end of this tutorial , what should the user be able to achieve ? " ( note : that is ' achieve ' , not ' do ' - but then we probably all know that anyway )
------
Learning / Understanding
Is it my imagination , or are some people more comfortable with one or the other ?
And if so , is it possible to design teaching material that will satisfy both groups ?
If so ... how ?

This is an awesome post ( as always ) .
But you only talk about written manuals .
How about screencasts ?
Well , for ( online ) software at least .
A screencast is the coolest way to do a ' Start Here ' section - I 'm starting to wonder if the whole manual should be made up of a bunch of short screencasts .
Why write about things when you can show them - show the user , customer and especially potential users how they can use it .
But even with screencasts - making the reading of the manual ( or watching screencasts ! ) unnecessary should have the highest priority .
Posted by : Chris Ritke | Sep 1 , 2006 7:36:44 PM
Kathy , this is another great post .
( I 'm struggling to learn my new camera . )
Just imagine when you not only flow with the manual , or not , but can also ask questions or learn from other people 's experience .
FTM if I can interact with an enthusiastic fellow user .

Unfortunately , as you 've said , user manuals are often terrible .
I will say that I found a great user manual from the Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Network people because it was organized by task : 1 ) Setup 2 ) Teacher Work Area , 3 ) Orientation for Students , etc .
( They are owned by Riverdeep . )
The table of contents was great .
I have n't seen a user manual that good in a long time .
As for the other software packages I 've installed this year including Adobe Web Bundle ( all macromedia and adobe software programs ) , Pinnacle Movie Studio MX , and others , the manual remained unprinted on the CD because after one glance , I could see that it was going to be too much .
Adobe did have 2 - 3 hours of video on a CD which I guess I 'll get to eventually .
For now , its in the box .
When I have a task , I do n't have 2 hours to figure out how to do one thing .
As for me , the Riverdeep people are creating a passionate user of their product because my learning curve was accelerated so rapidly by their great user manual .
I have one software program I returned because their usermanual was written for a rocket scientist and I did n't want to expend the energy interpreting .
Great post !
Thank you for mentioning
My teacher blog .
I aspire to create passionate students and you inspire me to do that .
Much of what I teach is practical , real world , and based on what I 've learned from you .

Good post but you stumble on your own cleverness here about learning .
You write as if the brain is recording something like an empty container .
Controversially you write somewhere else about learning as construction rather than recording and storing .
I would say it 's much more important what 's in your head already regarding the subject rather than what 's being stored , as learning is a process of network creation .
What you write about learning section could be embedded into tutorials / cookbooks to make them more compelling .

Great post .
In many ways , a manual is just a replacement for self - paced training .
Or at least it shoould be .
I always think it helps to look at training in terms of ( K ) Knowledge , ( S ) Skills and ( E ) Experience .
Obviously , a manual should be stuffed full of knowledge about the product , ( let 's say a digital camera to continue the theme ) and what it can do .
And as you point out , the knowledge needs to be organised in a context - logical way so that you can find exactly what you are looking for about the camera when you need it .
Most manuals do OK here , although their context - logical organisation often leaves a lot to be desired .
It should also foster skills building by supporting experimentation with the camera .
Building skills through experimentation is critical for turning knowledge into working practices .
When was the last time that your camera manual had a set of " projects " for you to do to learn something new ?
Most importantly , it should be useful over the life of the camera as the user gathers experience using it .
We all tend to use only a small percentage of the features of the cameras we own , but when we want to do something new , e.g. to start using infra-red techniques to take photos of virus - diseased plants ( a project when I was an undergrad student ) , the manual should be able to help us too .
I suspect most manuals are rapidly forgotten after the initial excitement of learning about your new camera .
Thinking about it again , the importance of these KSA factors show clearly that marketing are simply the wrong people to develop the sort of manuals that we want to and can use over the lifetime of a camera .
But my enthusiasm for using users to guide the manual 's development is as strong as it was in my previous post .

Reference Guide , Tutorial , Learning / Understanding , Cookbook / Recipe , and Start Here .
I find that I often can find a commercial product that does those things when the manual does n't -- which I find frustrating .
Another thing , make * real * manuals available , not just pdf files -- nothing is worse than trying to do something on screen while paging back and forth with a pdf .
I read real print at over a thousand words a minute ( at least complex legal briefs at that speed ) , pdfs and the like are much , much slower .
But a good manual can make the difference between a product I buy an upgrade to and a product I start looking for an alternative to .
e.g . I 'm using iomega hardware and software for back - ups for several computers at the house .
Is it the best rated ?
No , I own that , but could n't figure it out .
The iomega stuff was clear , easy and worked .
So I 've bought more , and the rest is sitting in a bin , ready to be used next time I need it for an upgrade discount or something similar .
I really hope your ideas spread .

The concept of understanding v memorising is one that has exercised me for years , although in the slightly tangential field of learning and assessment .
The current system of closed book exams loads the dice in favour of the person with the good memory as opposed to the person with the good understanding .
I have long advocated open book / media exams , because being able to remember a thing in an exam situation is no guarantee that you actually know how to make use of the information in the real world .
On the other hand , being able to find and apply information - now there 's a skill worth having !
I can't remember who it was who said " I keep my knowledge in my friends " but I 'm with him / her .
I have a very clever colleague who says his first brain is in his head , his second in Google , his third in his blog , and his fourth in the www ( or something like that ) .
By contrast , my second brain is in his head !
And in the real world , I can access that brain whenever I need to , so why should I try to memorise the things I know he already knows ?

Kathy , your terrific post leaves out one element : troubleshooting .
I 'm speaking as a hasty , impatient user who is reluctant to read ANYTHING if I can instead start to make the thing work .
A good troubleshooting section is an essential part of the manual for when the gizmo does n't magically act the way I think it should .
And no , I do n't think there is any possible improvement to the rest of the manual that is going to make me read it first .

This is a fantastic post with lots of excellent ideas .
One potential problem is that any user manual that actually included all five of the suggested sections would be very long .
At my company , we have been adding Understanding and Recipe type information to our manuals ( which were previously just reference ) .
Feedback from users is positive about the more helpful content , but negative about the increased length .
It seems many users are turned off by the length of the manual : they assume that a longer manual means a more difficult learning experience ( even though your post seems to suggest that the opposite may be true ) .
Perhaps the better solution is to approach the five areas as types of content that can be distributed through different channels .
The Understanding stuff that helps you grasp the mental model might best be achieved through short videos like those at http://www.2minuteexplainer.com/.
My other concern is with the Tutorial section .
You write that , " The deal - killer in a tutorial is when a crucial piece - - however small - - is left out . "
Including highly detailed step - by - step instructions seems to go against Minimalist principles for documentation , where users should be given some direction but encouraged to explore the product itself ( and provided with the information needed to recover from errors -- which is principally covered in the Understanding section , IMO ) .

Great article !
I think , you are in line with the work of John Carroll and colleagues .
They did much research on manuals in the eighties .
The first invented " guided exploration cards " and afterwards the " minimal manual " .
Minimal manuals have the following attributes :
- Superfluos text is avoided ( no " Welcome to the text processing software " section ) .
- It is task - oriented .
All functions are described in the context of a real task .
- It is modular .
Each module describes how to solve a task ( much like a tutorial ) .
- It contains hints about error - recovery .
I think that work is old - but up - to - date !

Slightly OT , but if you 're wondering about your D200 ( excellent camera , by the way ) , I wholeheartedly recommend that you take a half an hour or so and read Ken 's user guide : http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d200/users-guide/index.htm
.
It may just be the manual you were hoping for , or at least a simulation of part of it .

The majority of regular blog readers are completely unaware of Really Simple Syndication ( RSS ) and the amount of passion the technology excites , it seems .
A Nielsen / Netratings ' survey of 1,000 regular blog readers found 66 per cent do not understand RSS and have never even heard of the technology .
Twenty three per cent claimed they understood RSS but did not use it .
That 's a reality check for Silicon Valley technologists and venture capitalists debating and investing in RSS .
Last week , it emerged Microsoft will re-name RSS in the next version of its Internet Explorer ( IE ) browser and Windows Vista operating system to make it more , er , consumer friendly .
Microsoft is using " web feeds " as a substitute name for RSS in the current IE beta .
Venture capitalists ( VCs ) and enthusiasts from the communications industry , meanwhile , announced ambitious plans for a $ 100 m fund to invest in RSS in June .
The fund will focus on news aggregation , blogs , search engines and applications capable of aggregating data for use in the financial and medical sectors .
Despite strong evidence of a huge knowledge gap and need for greater education surrounding RSS , there are some encouraging signs for VCs and start - ups .
Eleven per cent of blog readers use RSS to sort through a growing tangle of blog and information feeds , according to Nielsen / Netratings .
Nearly five percent use feed aggregation software and more than six per cent use a feed from an aggregating web site to monitor blog feeds .
" While RSS is an established technology , the growing popularity of blogs has catapulted RSS into the spotlight as a content personalization tool , " Nielsen / Netratings senior research manager Jon Gibs said in a statement .
Blog traffic is up , too .
The top fifty blogging and blog - related sites have grown 31 per cent to 29.3 m unique visitors since the start of the year , accounting for one fifth of the internet 's traffic .
Microsoft 's MSN Spaces was top with 947 per cent growth , while Fark.com and Blogger were second and third with 63 per cent and 45 per cent increases respectively .
Nielson believes these sites will ultimately lack the kinds of traffic that large advertising networks manage to draw , but that advertisers can still leverage bloggers to influence their peers in niche markets .
" By associating their message with the blog 's image , advertisers can legitimize new trends , " Gibs said . ®
MICHAEL MILKEN will celebrate his 60th birthday on July 4th .
The former “ junk - bond king ” is still going strong , having seen off prostate cancer , and remains as controversial as ever .
The debate over whether Mr Milken deserved his jail term for manipulating the high - yield bond market he largely created rumbles on nearly 20 years later , most recently during the Enron trial , where Mr Milken 's genius was championed by none other than Kenneth Lay ( as the saying goes , with friends like that ... ) .
Jeremy Siegel turned 60 last November .
The Wharton business school economist , whose book “ Stocks for the Long Run ” was the bulls ' bible during the last bubble , is going strong too , trim and fit , with his mind as lively as ever — despite being called “ demented ” at last weekend 's Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting by one of the firm 's bosses , Charlie Munger .
( “ He 's a very nice guy , ” retorted the other boss , Warren Buffett . )
Mr Siegel and Mr Milken are among the first members of the post - war “ baby boom ” generation to enter the decade of life in which most people retire .
( Mr Siegel puts the dates of America 's baby - boomers at 1946 - 64 , which he says technically makes him a pre-boomer . )
Lately , both men have been giving considerable thought to what impact the impending retirement of the baby - boomers will have on the prices of financial assets .
They have reached sharply different conclusions , which they aired in a conference last month at the Milken Institute .
Having built his career on arguing that buying shares and holding them is the best long - term investment strategy in almost any circumstances , Mr Siegel is now surprisingly worried about the impact on asset prices of the demographic time - bomb in the rich world represented by the baby - boomers ' mass retirement .
Many boomers have bought assets such as bonds and shares to fund their old age .
Arguably , these purchases have helped to drive up prices over the past couple of decades .
Now , he says , all else being equal , the sale of these assets will lead to a sharp fall in prices , because there are too few people in the smaller generations that followed the boomers to buy all of those assets at today 's prices .
For instance , in the developed world share prices could fall by as much as 40 - 50 % over the coming decades because of boomer selling , calculates Mr Siegel .
Unless they retire later , baby - boomers could see their standard of living in retirement halved , relative to their final year of work .
Mr Siegel 's one great hope is that the shortfall of buyers of assets in the rich world will be made up for by a surge in demand from the developing world , as it gets richer fast thanks to the information revolution and globalisation .
The demographic time - bomb of a lot of rich - country boomers having to be supported in their retirement by a smaller group of younger workers disappears when the huge , far younger population of the developing world is added to the mix .
Indeed , Mr Siegel calculates that shares will continue to perform as well as they have in the past — generating real returns of above six percentage points a year since 1802 , according to the research that made his name — provided that the developing world continues to grow strongly , and that buyers there are able to snap up all the shares they want .
That would need to be a lot of shares , says Mr Siegel , who is writing a new book on the subject , “ The Global Solution ” .
By the middle of this century , he reckons , most multinational companies would need to be owned by investors outside today 's developed countries , he says , especially investors in Asia .
The challenge is to integrate global capital markets so that selling assets from the old in the rich world to the young in developing countries is no harder , nor more unusual , than today 's sales of assets by elderly folk in Florida to younger people in other American states .
From this perspective , America 's external deficits , particularly with some developing countries , may be both long - lasting and nothing to worry about .
The biggest danger is that growing protectionism in the rich world will both slow the rate of growth in the developing world and prevent its demand for shares being met .
Mr Siegel views the recent opposition to purchases of American firms by companies from China and Dubai as decidedly ominous .
Milken honey
Mr Milken , by contrast , is hugely optimistic , mainly because he thinks that many boomers will live far longer than is expected today , thanks to existing medical practice and spectacular advances , such as a cure for cancer , that he expects in the near future .
He thinks that average life expectancy could eventually reach 120 years .
With good health at a far greater age , people will want to keep working , not retire , he says — just as he and Mr Siegel do .
( This prediction , Mr Siegel notes , goes against the trend for rising average life expectancy to coincide with falling retirement ages in the rich world . )
Undaunted , Mr Milken insists that working for longer will become easier thanks to technological innovation , such as using the internet from home .
That will increase wealth , fuelling demand for assets .
Hence the real issue for the world over the coming decades , predicts Mr Milken , will be not whether there are enough people to buy the assets of the baby - boomers , but whether there are enough assets to buy , given all the extra demand in the world .
Most economists will tend to agree with Mr Siegel that Mr Milken 's forecast is “ more hope than reality ” .
But Mr Milken 's greatest achievements , from creating the high - yield debt market to beating cancer , have been the result of his refusal to accept conventional wisdom .
Perhaps he will be proved right again .
And if not , there may be an ounce of good news among the bad .
If politicians realise that foreign buyers are needed to prop up the value of America 's retirement savings , they may be less inclined to flirt with protectionism .
During the recent right - wing howling over the British terror plot once again the fringe right has proved itself incapable of having a intelligent discussion about national security and the Constitution .
This is from a wing - nut site called Newsbusters , dated 9-11-2006 , Thank NSA Wiretapping for Foiled Terror Plot ?
Will the New York Times write stories on how eavesdropping is what alerted U.S. authorities to the terrorist airplane attack ?
Time magazine reported in an exclusive that the “ U.S. picked up the suspects ’ chatter and shared it with British authorities . ”
The operation involved cooperation between British and American authorities .
Britain ’s MI - 5 intelligence service and Scotland Yard had been tracking the plot for several months , but only in the past two weeks had the plotters ’ planning begun to crystallize , senior U.S. officials tell TIME .
In the two or three days before the arrests , the cell was going operational , and authorities were pressed into action .
MI5 and Scotland Yard agents tracked the plotters from the ground , while a knowledgeable American official says U.S. intelligence provided London authorities with intercepts of the group ’s communications .
The Wall Street Journal says media and Democratic opposition to the programs now looks foolish after the foiled terror plot .
The plot was foiled because a large number of people were under surveillance concerning their spending , travel and communications .
Which leads us to wonder if Scotland Yard would have succeeded if the ACLU or the New York Times had first learned the details of such surveillance programs .
It looks like Newsbusters is run by someone only capable of winning arguments with small frail straw - man .
No Democrat , let me repeat that , NO Democrat of any prominence has said that we should n’t spy on suspected terrorists .
Our laws allow for spying on the British and any communications going into and out of Britain .
That is not even an issue .
None of the plotters as far as we know were in the US or US citizens .
Newsbusters and the editorialists at the WSJ are simply lying sacks and not speaking to the real issue .
President Bush and conservatives want to spy on any American citizen in America anytime they want without a warrant .
Newsbusters and the WSJ are liars when they state the issue in any others terms .
The NSA can by law spy on the British and the Pakistanis all day without restriction and no Democratic member of Congress or the Senate has voiced any objection to that .
No one has any objection to spying on suspects in the US if they are non-US citizens .
We have no objection to the spy first arrangement in FISA whereby the NSA may spy on someone for 72 hours before getting a warrant .
Either Newsbusters and WSJ are simply the most immoral of liars or they cannot grasp the constitutional issues involved .
If the first case is true this will not be the first or the last time that our nation will pay the price for conservative ’s slim grasp of morality and the truth .
If the second is true , one could say that whatever they have to offer by way of opinion on constitutional issues are just the irrelevant rantings of mentally deficient nationalists that could care less about the rule of law and the common good .

Summary :
The oldies continue to be goodies -- or rather , baddies -- in the list of design stupidities that irked users the most in 2005 .
For this year 's list of worst design mistakes , I decided to try something new : I asked readers of my newsletter to nominate the usability problems they found the most irritating .
I assumed that asking for reader input would highlight many issues that I had n't noticed in my own user testing .
This was not the case .
Instead , all of the top thirty problems were covered in existing usability guidelines .
Thus , when you read this year 's top ten list , you 'll probably say , " Yes , I 've heard about this before . "
That 's okay .
There 's value in reminding ourselves of past findings and raising their priority on the agenda of things to be fixed .
Because these mistakes continue to be so common , it makes sense that people continue to complain about them the most .
1. Legibility Problems
Bad fonts won the vote by a landslide , getting almost twice as many votes as the # 2 mistake .
About two - thirds of the voters complained about small font sizes or frozen font sizes ; about one - third complained about low contrast between text and background .
For more info on resizable text and readability , see my 2002 column , " Let Users Control Font Size . "
2. Non-Standard Links
Following are the five main guidelines for links :
Make obvious what 's clickable : for text links , use colored , underlined text ( and do n't underline non-link text ) .
Differentiate visited and unvisited links .
Explain what users will find at the other end of the link , and include some of the key information - carrying terms in the anchor text itself to enhance scannability and search engine optimization ( SEO ) .
Do n't use " click here " or other non-descriptive link text .
Avoid JavaScript or other fancy techniques that break standard interaction techniques for dealing with links .
In particular , do n't open pages in new windows ( except for PDF files and such ) .
Links are the Web 's number one interaction element .
Violating common expectations for how links work is a sure way to confuse and delay users , and might prevent them from being able to use your site .
3. Flash
I view it as a personal failure that Flash collected the bronze medal for annoyance .
It 's been three years since I launched a major effort to remedy Flash problems and published the guidelines for using Flash appropriately .
When I spoke at the main Flash developer conference , almost everybody agreed that past excesses should be abandoned and that Flash 's future was in providing useful user interfaces .
Despite such good intentions , most of the Flash that Web users encounter each day is bad Flash with no purpose beyond annoying people .
The one bright point is that splash screens and Flash intros are almost extinct .
They are so bad that even the most clueless
Web designers wo n't recommend them , even though a few ( even more clueless ) clients continue to request them .
Flash is a programming environment and should be used to offer users additional power and features that are unavailable from a static page .
Flash should not be used to jazz up a page .
If your content is boring , rewrite text to make it more compelling and hire a professional photographer to shoot better photos .
Do n't make your pages move .
It does n't increase users ' attention , it drives them away ; most people equate animated content with useless content .
Using Flash for navigation is almost as bad .
People prefer predictable navigation and static menus .
4. Content That 's Not Written for the Web
Writing for the Web means making content
short ,
scannable , and
to the point ( rather than full of fluffy marketese ) .
Web content should also
answer users ' questions and
use common language rather than made - up terms ( this also improves search engine visibility , since users search using their own words , not yours ) .
5. Bad Search
Everything else on this list is pretty easy to get right , but unfortunately fixing search requires considerable work and an investment in better software .
It 's worth doing , though , because search is a fundamental component of the Web user experience and is getting more important every year .
6. Browser Incompatibility
I admit it : during my spring 2004 seminars , I downgraded cross-platform compatibility to a one - star guideline ( that is , " worth thinking about if you have extra project time , but not a priority " ) .
At that time , almost everybody used Internet Explorer and the business case for supporting other browsers was getting pretty tough to defend on an ROI basis .
Today , however , enough people use Firefox ( and various other minority browsers , like Opera and Safari ) that the business case is back : do n't turn away customers just because they prefer a different platform .
7. Cumbersome Forms
People complained about numerous form - related problems .
The basic issue ?
Forms are used too often on the Web and tend to be too big , featuring too many unnecessary questions and options .
In the long run , we need more of an applications metaphor for Internet interaction design .
For now , users are confronted by numerous forms and we must make each encounter as smooth as possible .
There are five basic guidelines to this end :
Cut any questions that are not needed .
For example , do you really need a salutation ( Mr/ Ms / Mrs/Miss / etc . ) ?
that are not needed .
For example , do you really need a salutation ( Mr/ Ms / Mrs/Miss / etc . ) ?
Do n't make fields mandatory unless they truly are .
unless they truly are .
Support autofill to the max by avoiding unusual field labels ( just use Name , Address , etc. ) .
to the max by avoiding unusual field labels ( just use Name , Address , etc. ) .
Set the keyboard focus to the first field when the form is displayed .
This saves a click .
to the first field when the form is displayed .
This saves a click .
Allow flexible input of phone numbers , credit card numbers , and the like .
It 's easy to have the computer eliminate characters like parentheses and extra spaces .
This is particularly important for elderly users , who tend to suffer when sites require data entry in unfamiliar formats .
Why lose orders because a user prefers to enter a credit card number in nicely chunked , four - digit groups rather than an undifferentiated , error - prone blob of sixteen digits ?
Forms that violate guidelines for internationalization got dinged by many overseas users .
If entering a Canadian postal code generates an error message , you should n't be surprised if you get very little business from Canada .
8. No Contact Information or Other Company Info
Even though phone numbers and email addresses are the most requested forms of contact info , having a physical mailing address on the site might be more important because it's one of the key credibility markers .
A company with no address is not one you want to give money to .
For advice on how to best present contact info , see our usability studies of " About Us " pages and store finders and locators .
9. Frozen Layouts with Fixed Page Widths
Complaints here fell into two categories :
On big monitors , websites are difficult to use if they do n't resize with the window .
Conversely , if users have a small window and a page does n't use a liquid layout , it triggers insufferable horizontal scrolling .
The rightmost part of a page is cut off when printing a frozen page .
This is especially true for Europeans , who use narrower paper ( A4 ) than Americans .
Font sizes are a related issue .
Assuming a site does n't commit mistake # 1 and freeze the fonts , users with high - resolution monitors often bump up the font size .
However , if they also want to bump up the window size to make the bigger text more readable , a frozen layout thwarts their efforts .
The very worst offenders are sites that freeze both the width and height of the viewport when displaying information in a pop- up window .
Pop-ups are a mistake in their own right .
If you must use them , do n't force users to read in a tiny peephole .
At an absolute minimum , let users resize any new windows .
10 . Inadequate Photo Enlargement
According to the vote count , # 10 should really be about pop-ups , but I 've written a lot about them already ( most recently when they were rated the # 1 most hated advertising technique ) .
Instead , I want to feature here a problem that got a bit fewer votes , but illustrates a deeper point .
One of the long - standing guidelines for e-commerce usability is to offer users the ability to enlarge product photos for a close - up view .
Seeing a tiny detail or assessing a texture can give shoppers the confidence they need to place an order online .
It 's gratifying that most sites obey this guideline and offer zoom features , often denoted by a magnifying glass icon .
But many sites implement the feature wrong .
The worst mistake is when a user clicks the " enlarge photo " button and the site simply displays the same photo .
It 's always a mistake to offer no -ops that do nothing when clicked .
Such do - nothing links and buttons add clutter , waste time , and increase user confusion :
What happened ?
Did I do something wrong ?
( An even more common no - op mistake is to have a link on the homepage that links to the homepage itself .
This was # 10 on the list of most violated homepage guidelines . )
Another mistake here that 's almost as bad is when sites let users enlarge photos , but only by a fraction .
When users ask for a big photo , show them a big photo .
It 's often best to offer an enlargement that fills up the most common screen size used by your customers ( 1024x768 for B2C sites , at the time of this writing ) .
Other times , this is insufficient , and it's better to offer a range of close - ups to give users the details they need without requiring them to scroll a too - large photo .
Yes , initial pages should use small photos to avoid looking fluffy .
Yes , you want to be aware of download times and watch your pageweight budget .
Even in this broadband age , slow response times were # 15 on the full list of design mistakes .
But , when users explicitly ask for larger pictures , they 're willing to wait for them to download — unless that wait produces a mid-sized photo that lacks the details they need to make a purchasing decision .
Back to Basics in Web Design
This year 's list of top problems clearly proves the need to get back to Web design basics .
There 's much talk about new fancy " Web 2.0 " features on the Internet industry 's mailing lists and websites , as well as at conferences .
But users do n't care about technology and do n't especially want new features .
They just want quality improvements in the basics :
text they can read ;
content that answers their questions ;
navigation and search that help them find what they want ;
short and simple forms ( streamlined registration , checkout , and other workflow ) ; and
no bugs , typos , or corrupted data ; no linkrot ; no outdated content .
Anytime you feel tempted to add a new feature or advanced technology to your site , first consider whether you would get a higher ROI by spending the resources on polishing the quality of what you already have .
Most companies , e-commerce sites , government agencies , and nonprofit organizations would contribute more to their website 's business goals with better headlines than with any new technology ( aside from a better search engine , of course ) .

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman seized on the terror arrests in Britain today to attack his Democratic rival , Ned Lamont , saying that Mr. Lamont ’s goals for ending the war in Iraq would constitute a “ victory ” for extremists , including those accused of plotting to blow up airliners traveling between Britain and the United States .
“ If we just pick up like Ned Lamont wants us to do , get out by a date certain , it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in England , ” Mr. Lieberman said at a campaign event at lunchtime in Waterbury , Conn .
“ It will strengthen them and they will strike again . ”
Mr. Lamont , who rode an antiwar message to beat Mr. Lieberman in the Connecticut Democratic primary on Tuesday , has called for a firm deadline to remove front - line American troops from Iraq , and he endorsed a Democratic - sponsored amendment in the Senate to set that deadline for next July .
Mr. Lieberman opposed setting a deadline .
In a telephone interview from his vacation home in Maine , Mr. Lamont said he was disappointed with the personal tone Mr. Lieberman ’s remarks , and questioned the connection between the Iraq war and the new terrorist plot .
He also continued his strategy of trying to link Mr. Lieberman ’s views with those of the Bush administration , whose approach the senator has tended to support in the fight against terrorism .

Hussein says he is afraid to go outdoors
That is the fear that haunts Hussein , and other gay men in Iraq .
They say that since the US - led invasion , gay people are being killed because of their sexual orientation .
They blame the increase in violence on the growing influence of religious figures and militia groups in Iraq since Saddam Hussein was ousted .
Islam considers homosexuality sinful .
A website published in the Iranian city of Qom in the name of Ayatollah Sistani , Iraq 's most revered Shia cleric , says : " Those who commit sodomy must be killed in the harshest way " .
Sistani 's official website calls for gay men to be executed
The BBC asked Mr Sistani 's representative , Seyed Kashmiri , to explain the ruling .
" Homosexuals and lesbians are not killed for practising their inclinations for the first time , " Mr Kashmiri said in a response sent via email .
" There are certain conditions drawn out by jurists before this punishment can be implemented , which is perhaps similar to the punishment meted out by other heavenly religions . "
Mr Kashmiri added : " Some rulings that are drawn out by jurists are done so on a theoretical basis .
Not everything that is said is implemented . "
Violent attacks
Killings and kidnappings are widespread in Iraq , with much of the bloodshed being linked to sectarian tensions and the anti-US insurgency .
Dina , a transsexual , was killed in Baghdad last year
But homosexual Iraqis who have spoken to the BBC say they are also being targeted because of their sexual orientation .
Hussein is 32 and lives in Baghdad with his brother , sister - in - law and nieces .
He says his effeminate appearance and demeanour make him stand out and attract hostility .
" My brother 's friends told him : ' In the current chaos you could get away with killing your brother without retribution and get rid of this shame , ' " Hussein said , after agreeing to speak to the BBC only if his real name was not used .
A transsexual friend of his , who had changed names from Haydar to Dina , was killed on her way to a party in Baghdad about six months ago , Hussein said .
Gym terror
Ahmed is a 31 - year - old interior decorator who used to live in Baghdad with his boyfriend , Mazin .
Ahmed fled to Jordan nine months ago after Mazin was murdered outside a gym .
I fled from Iraq because of the threat to my life
Ahmed
After his partner was shot dead , Ahmed hid in the gym toilets then slipped away and later flew to Amman , the Jordanian capital .
He says it was well known that they were a couple and Mazin was targeted because of his sexuality .
" I fled from Iraq because of the threat to my life , because I was a gay man , " he told the BBC .
Ahmed also said that , before the gym shooting , he and a gay friend had survived a grenade attack and he still had fragments of shrapnel in his face .
The friend was killed a week later by gunmen who raided his house , he added .
Powerful militia
Iraq 's deputy interior minister Maj Gen Hussein Kamal told the BBC that he was unaware of any minority groups being specifically targeted for kidnappings and killings .
He also said he was unaware of the statement on Ayatollah Sistani 's website calling for gay people to be killed .
But he added : " We do not condone vigilante action .
We encourage the victims to inform the authorities if they are subjected to any attacks . "
However , Hussein says gay people are afraid of the police .
The Interior Ministry is run by members of Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( Sciri ) , which is one of Iraq 's country 's leading Shia parties .
Sciri has its own militia , the Badr Brigades , and there are widespread concerns that large parts of Iraq 's police force are under the control of such groups .
Hussein blames the Badr Brigades and other Shia militia for many of the attacks on gay Iraqis .
Saddam was a tyrant , but at least we had more freedom then
Hussein
Human rights group Amnesty International has focused most of its work in Iraq on the high levels of violence linked to the insurgency .
The organisation said it had no information on reports of anti-gay activities in the country .
" It is not an area that we have been actively looking at , but that is not to say that we will not look into the issue at some point , " said a spokesman at the group 's London headquarters .
But Hussein , Ahmed and gay activists outside Iraq say there is clear evidence that the situation has deteriorated dramatically for Iraqi homosexuals .
" Saddam was a tyrant , but at least we had more freedom then , " said Hussein .
" Nowadays , gay men are just killed for no reason . "

The Big Lie About ‘ Islamic Fascism ’
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
The latest big lie unveiled by Washington ’s neoconservatives are the poisonous terms , " Islamo - Fascists " and " Islamic Fascists . "
They are the new , hot buzzwords among America ’s far right and Christian fundamentalists .
President George W. Bush made a point last week of using " Islamofacists " when recently speaking of Hezbullah and Hamas — both , by the way , democratically elected parties .
A Canadian government minister from the Conservative Party compared Lebanon ’s Hezbullah to Nazi Germany .
The term " Islamofascist " is utterly without meaning , but packed with emotional explosives .
It is a propaganda creation worthy Dr. Goebbels , and the latest expression of the big lie technique being used by neocons in Washington ’s propaganda war against its enemies in the Muslim World .
This ugly term was probably first coined in Israel — as was the other hugely successful propaganda term , " terrorism " — to dehumanize and demonize opponents and deny them any rational political motivation , hence removing any need to deal with their grievances and demands .
As the brilliant humanist Sir Peter Ustinov so succinctly put it , " Terrorism is the war of the poor , and war is the terrorism of the rich . "
Both the terms " terrorism " and " fascist " have been so abused and overused that they have lost any original meaning .
The best modern definition I ’ve read of fascism comes in former Columbia University Professor Robert Paxton ’s superb 2004 book , The Anatomy of Fascism .
Paxton defines fascism ’s essence , which he aptly terms its " emotional lava " as : 1 . a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond reach of traditional solutions ; 2 . belief one ’s group is the victim , justifying any action without legal or moral limits ; 3 . need for authority by a natural leader above the law , relying on the superiority of his instincts ; 4 . right of the chosen people to dominate others without legal or moral restraint ; 5 . fear of foreign " contamination . "
Fascism demands a succession of wars , foreign conquests , and national threats to keep the nation in a state of fear , anxiety and patriotic hypertension .
Those who disagree are branded ideological traitors .
All successful fascists regimes , Paxton points out , allied themselves to traditional conservative parties , and to the military - industrial complex .
Highly conservative and militaristic regimes are not necessarily fascist , says Paxton .
True fascism requires relentless aggression abroad and a semi-religious adoration of the regime at home .
None of the many Muslim groups opposing US - British control of the Mideast fit Paxton ’s definitive analysis .
The only truly fascist group ever to emerge in the Mideast was Lebanon ’s Maronite Christian Phalange Party in the 1930 ’s which , ironically , became an ally of Israel ’s rightwing in the 1980’s .
It is grotesque watching the Bush Administration and Tony Blair maintain the ludicrous pretense they are re-fighting World War II .
The only similarity between that era and today is the cultivation of fear , war fever and racist - religious hate by US neoconservatives and America ’s religious far right , which is now boiling with hatred for anything Muslim .
Under the guise of fighting a " third world war " against " Islamic fascism , " America ’s far right is infecting its own nation with the harbingers of WWII totalitarianism .
In the western world , hatred of Muslims has become a key ideological hallmark of rightwing parties .
We see this overtly in the United States , France , Italy , Holland , Denmark , Poland , and , most lately , Canada , and more subtly expressed in Britain and Belgium .
The huge uproar over blatantly anti-Muslim cartoons published in Denmark laid bare the seething Islamophobia spreading through western society .
There is nothing in any part of the Muslim World that resembles the corporate fascist states of western history .
In fact , clan and tribal - based traditional Islamic society , with its fragmented power structures , local loyalties , and consensus decision - making , is about as far as possible from western industrial state fascism .
The Muslim World is replete with brutal dictatorships , feudal monarchies , and corrupt military - run states , but none of these regimes , however deplorable , fits the standard definition of fascism .
Most , in fact , are America ’s allies .
Nor do underground Islamic militant groups ( " terrorists " in western terminology ) .
They are either focused on liberating land from foreign occupation , overthrowing " un-Islamic " regimes , driving western influence from their region , or imposing theocracy based on early Islamic democracy .
Claims by fevered neoconservatives that Muslim radicals plan to somehow impose a worldwide Islamic caliphate are lurid fantasies worthy of Dr. Fu Manchu and yet another example of the big lie technique that worked so well over Iraq .
As Prof. Andrew Bosworth notes in an incisive essay on so - called Islamic fascism , " Islamic fundamentalism is a transnational movement inherently opposed to the pseudo - nationalism necessary for fascism . "
However , there are plenty of modern fascists .
But to find them , you have to go to North America and Europe .
These neo -fascists advocate " preemptive attacks against all potential enemies , " grabbing other nation ’s resources , overthrowing uncooperative governments , military dominance of the world , hatred of Semites ( Muslims in this case ) , adherence to biblical prophecies , hatred of all who fail to agree , intensified police controls , and curtailment of " liberal " political rights .
They revel in flag - waving , patriotic melodrama , demonstrations of military power , and use the mantle of patriotism to feather the nests of the military - industrial complex , colluding legislators and lobbyists .
They urge war to the death , fought , of course , by other people ’s children .
They have turned important sectors of the media into propaganda organs and brought the Pentagon largely under their control .
Now , the neoconservatives are busy whipping up war against Syria and Iran to keep themselves in power and maintain the political dynamics of this 21st century revival of fascism .
The real modern fascists are not in the Muslim World , but Washington .
The neocons screaming fascist the loudest , are the true fascists themselves .
It ’s a pity that communist and leftist propaganda so debased the term " neo- fascist " that it has become almost meaningless .
Because that is what we should be calling the so - called neocons , for that is what they really are .

The search for a coal - fired power station that does not give off any carbon dioxide has taken a step forward with the announcement of plans to build such a plant in Germany .
Vattenfall already operates a coal - fired power station in Germany
Vattenfall , a Swedish company , which owns mines and power stations in Germany , plans to start construction next year .
" We believe coal has a future , " says Markus Sauthoff , who is leading the project .
" But this is linked to the carbon - dioxide trading system . "
" It 's likely that there will be quite ambitious emission reduction targets in the future , and that the price of CO2 trading certificates will be quite high , as a kind of penalty for the use of fossil fuels in power plants , " he says .
" So we need to try to reduce our CO2 emissions . "
Pilot project
Mr Sauthoff admits that " carbon - dioxide free " is something of a misnomer .
Burning coal inevitably produces carbon dioxide .
The idea is to capture the carbon dioxide before it is released into the atmosphere and then store it in a safe place .
The technology now being developed by Vattenfall is designed primarily for use with lignite , or brown coal , which is one of eastern Germany 's primary mineral resources .
Its use in power stations has long been controversial , because of the high level of carbon dioxide it emits in comparison with other fossil fuels .
Vattenfall is to build its new plant at Schwarze Pumpe , south - east of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg , where it already operates a conventional coal - fired power station .
The new plant will use what Vattenfall is calling the Oxyfuel process .
" In a conventional power plant we burn lignite in air , which is about 75 % nitrogen , " explains Markus Sauthoff .
" But in the Oxyfuel process we extract the nitrogen and burn the coal in almost pure oxygen combined with some of the flue gases , which are re-circulated into the furnace . "
" Today we 're testing single components of this at the university level but to stick all the different parts together and to try to operate them in the most effective way will be the task of the pilot plant . "
Climate issues
Oxyfuel is not the only method of capturing CO2 that 's currently being investigated .
There is another so - called " pre-combustion " method , which involves turning the coal into gas before it is burned , and then producing hydrogen that can be used in fuel cells .
Environmental groups say relying on coal fuel is a bad idea
A " post - combustion " method involves the chemical " scrubbing " of the gases produced by burning coal , to extract the carbon dioxide .
Markus Sauthoff admits that it is not yet clear which method will prove to be the most efficient and economically viable .
" But Vattenfall does believe that Oxyfuel will be the most favourable and this is why we 've decided to build the pilot plant , " he says .
The company has come in for criticism from environmental groups for its continued investment in fossil fuels .
Gabriela von Goerne , a climate campaigner for Greenpeace Germany says : " I do n't think Vattenfall is taking climate issues seriously . "
" They want to move on with coal technology , which ultimately is a dead end .
The best choice would be to concentrate on renewable energies and put renewable energies in the energy mix of Vattenfall . "
Vattenfall says it plans to have the 40 m - euro plant in operation by 2008 .
Yes , another cell phone with VOIP capability hits the market .
Paragon claims the hipi-2200 to be the first SIP based Dual - Mode phone on the market .
It was unveiled earlier this month at the VON convention center n Boston .
It does pack plenty of features including SIP VOIP support , quad band coverage and WiFi to name a few .
Cool phone , however they may want to think about changing the name before marketing it here in the U.S .

The Book of Sand hypertext has been moved to a new location :

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil travelled to his country 's biggest city yesterday to urge an immediate deployment of the army on its streets after weeks of sporadic violence involving a shadowy organised crime group .
Sao Paulo has been the scene of waves of attacks by criminals that have so far claimed more than 200 lives .
The violence , supposedly masterminded by the First Command of the Capital ( PCC ) group , began on May 12 .
This week police killed six suspects following three days of attacks across Sao Paulo state , which saw Molotov cocktails and a nailbomb used against public buildings .
So far Sao Paulo 's governor , Claudio Lembo , has ignored calls to use federal troops against the group .
" Carrying out attacks has become a tragic and stupid fashion , " Mr Lembo told reporters this week .
" These are teenagers carrying out small attacks [ that are ] ridiculous and stupid . "
But other prominent figures , including Brazil 's former president , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , have begun to predict the beginning of an urban guerrilla war in Sao Paulo .
" It is an unrecognised civil war - only they are not political groups involved .
It is the poor person versus anybody who has something , and that something need not even be very much , " said Carlos Amorim , author of The Brotherhood of Crime and an expert on the PCC .
" This fear is not artificial .
People are being terrorised by the violence . "
So far the principal victims have been those engaged in fighting crime .
Experts , however , fear that government officials and public figures could soon become targets .
" There is no way of controlling it , " one prison guard , who refused to be identified , told the Guardian during a recent visit to the Chacara Belem prison complex in Sao Paulo , a notorious PCC stronghold .
" One day someone will just have to come in [ to the prison ] with explosives and blow the whole thing up . "
The guard , who had attended the funeral of one of his colleagues the previous day - shot by PPC members in Sao Paulo - added : " We are all completely vulnerable . "
Internal memos about further violence have been circulated by prison authorities , adding to the sense of insecurity .
The Guardian had access to one such note , apparently sent by the state 's prison secretariat .
It detailed the recording of a phone conversation between divisions of the PCC in which members were urged " to break everything without remorse " .
It recommended " caution - without panic " .
Panic , however , is starting to overcome many of the city 's police and prison guards .
With thousands of prisoners being allowed out of jail this weekend to celebrate Father 's Day , the city is readying itself for a new wave of violence .
The Sao Paulo fire department , in the city centre , has parked a fire engine across its entrance to hamper possible attacks , while cordons encircle most police positions .
For an organisation that has brought Sao Paulo to its knees on three occasions since May , relatively little is known about the PCC .
The group was founded in the Taubate prison in Sao Paulo in the aftermath of the 1993 Carandiru prison massacre , when 111 inmates were killed by police .
It claims to fight " repression in the prison system " and also to be part of a wider " revolution of the poor " .
According to Mr Amorim , one of the PCC 's key strengths is its capacity to recruit " freelance " members to carry out specific actions .
Many see involvement as a means of self - protection .
" It is a kind of seguro - cadeia [ jail insurance ] , " Mr Amorim said .
" You know you will be arrested one day , so it is better to arrive in prison as a friend or at least someone who is known [ to the PCC ] . "
Propaganda , and the dissemination of fear , appear to be increasingly important parts of the group 's armoury .
On Thursday , the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported receiving a video - supposedly produced by the PCC - featuring a masked man flanked by machine guns and sticks of dynamite .
In the video , he reportedly made demands in the name of the " party " , saying at one point : " Do n't mess with our families and we wo n't mess with yours . "
Threats of violence tomorrow have also been circulated via the internet .
Less than half of Americans satisfied with 9/11 investigations RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday May 23 , 2006 Print This | Email
This According to a new Zogby poll , less than half of Americans are convinced that that the events of September 11 have been thoroughly investigated , RAW STORY has learned .
In the telephone survey of 1200 individuals , just 47 % agreed that " the 9/11 attacks were thoroughly investigated and that any speculation about US government involvement is nonsense . "
Almost as many , 45 % , indicated they were more likely to agree " that so many unanswered questions about 9/11 remain that Congress or an International Tribunal should re-investigate the attacks , including whether any US government officials consciously allowed or helped facilitate their success . "
The poll is the first survey that has attempted to gauge the level of Americans ' doubts about 9/11 and was carried out for the " 9/11 : Revealing the Truth , Reclaiming Our Future " conference to be held in Chicago in June .
Not surprisingly , Republicans as a group were the most supportive of existing investigations , with 70 % expressing their satisfaction -- about the same percentage that has expressed approval of Bush 's performance in recent polls .
Sixty - four percent of those earning over $ 75,000 were also skeptical of doubts about 9/11 .
The groups most likely to want the attacks re-investigated were Hispanics at 67 % and African - Americans at 64 % .
Other groups also skewed one way or another , but with the majority position generally not above 58 % .
Overall , the breakdown on the question closely followed the usual political divisions in the country : Republicans vs. Democrats and independents , whites vs. minorities , the wealthier and better - educated vs. the poorer and less educated , people over fifty vs. those under fifty , men vs. women .
This rough balance in opinions is itself a striking finding .
It suggests that doubts about the officials accounts of 9/11 , far from representing an extreme fringe position , have become a standard component of anti-establishment attitudes .
When asked specificially if they thought there had been a government coverup of evidence that contradicts the official story , the results were again not far from an even split , with 48 % rejecting the idea of a deliberate coverup and 42 % supporting it .
Belief in a coverup was the majority position among Democrats , 18 - 29 year olds , and a few other groups .
In an attempt to focus more specifically on the attitudes of those who were best informed about the events of 9/11 , the poll asked its responders if they were aware of WTC Building 7 , whose collapse on September 11 for no obvious reason was not investigated by the 9/11 Commission .
Only 52 % answered that they were aware of the collapse of Building 7 , but out of that subgroup , 73 % believed it should have been investigated .
On a related topic , those polled were asked if they felt the Bush Administration had exploited the September 11th attacks to justify the invasion of Iraq or if Bush had been right to go into Iraq because Saddam Hussein supported terrorism .
Here the country was divided exactly , 44 % to 44 % , with the answers following party lines more closely than those to the 9/11 questions .
Among Republicans , 72 % felt the invasion was appropriate , while among Democrats 69 % felt it was not .
A final question asked about the media 's performance regarding 9/11 , including coverage of victims ' families , unanswered questions , theories that challenged the official account , and how the attacks were investigated .
A majority of 55 % rated the media as only fair or poor , while only 33 % rated it as good .
Surprisingly , the groups most likely to rate the media positively tended to be those that were also most skeptical about official accounts of 9/11 , including African - Americans , progressives , and those with lower incomes .
The media were rated poorly by roughly 60 % of Republicans , conservatives , and the more affluent and better educated .
Libertarians and extreme conservatives , at 74 % and 67 % respectively , were the most negative of all .

Because We Don't See Our Malfeasance
Editor 's note :
This is Part 1 of ESPN.
com 's series on high school football in Barrow , Alaska .
To read Part 2 : On Top Of The World .
 Standing on the sidelines , looking across the high school football field , it all seems normal .
The zebra-striped officials , the screaming parents , the face - painted cheerleaders .
But normal ?
This is anything but .
Four of the six officials are working their first game .
The calendar says it 's the middle of August , but snow flurries fill the air .
While the cheerleaders drape themselves in blankets , the parents and children wear sealskin and caribou parkas .
Chat Wrap
What he said
ESPN.com senior writer Wayne Drehs stopped by to chat about his experiences while writing The Real Frozen Tundra .
The goalposts are made of spray - painted sprinkler pipe .
The benches are tipped - over telephone poles .
School buses double as locker rooms .
The massive body of water that 's a touchdown pass away ?
The Arctic Ocean .
And the uninvited guests every fan is watching for ?
Polar bears .
Welcome to the top of the world , home of the Barrow Whalers , the one and only Arctic high school football team in America .
Here , 330 miles north of the Arctic Circle , at the very top of our country 's 49th state , a place with no grass , no trees , but plenty of permafrost ( snow and ice covers the landscape eight months a year ) , school superintendent Trent Blankenship controversially brought America 's most popular sport to town this year .
And no one is quite sure what to think .
Of the 44 Eskimo , Tongan , Samoan , Asian - American , African - American and Caucasian teenagers who signed up for this experiment , only four had ever played organized football before .
Now , nearly a quarter of the school plays .
They play , the kids tell you , because it 's something to do , something besides roaming the snow - and mud-covered streets looking for a snowmobile to send off a cliff .
They play , the adults insist , to save the future of a town plagued by substance abuse and escalating high school dropout rates .
And they play , the critics argue , because it's what Trent Blankenship wants .
" Whether or not it 's a good idea , that 's not up to me , " says running back Quinton Carroll , who is part Eskimo .
" If they 're going to have a football team and give us the opportunity to play , I 'm going to play .
And then people can see , even though we 're up at the top of the world , we have football like everybody else . "
But at 71 degrees 18 minutes north latitude , this place is unlike anywhere else .
Barrow , the seat for the 88,000 - square - mile North Slope Borough , is the northernmost settlement in the United States and one of the northernmost towns in the world .
It 's a place that snowy owls , arctic foxes and 4,600 people  more than half of whom are native Inupiat Eskimo  call home .
The discovery of oil in nearby Prudhoe Bay in the late 1960s brought millions of dollars to this once - poor region and with the money came all the modern amenities  and plagues  of the 21st century .
Drive by almost any home on Barrow 's muddied streets and the town 's overnight evolution smacks you in the face .
Four caribou heads sitting on a banquet table beside a shiny red ATV .
A rug of polar bear skin draped across a snowmobile in a backyard .
Three middle school kids climbing over a scattering of caribou antlers to run inside and play Xbox .
But more money has also meant more problems .
Parents uninvolved in the lives of their kids .
Unmotivated kids who could n't care less about school .
As North Slope Borough mayor Edward Itta sees it , this secluded Arctic town that was once built on Eskimo values like sharing and cooperation has devolved into a greed - driven world where money is king .
" The growth has been dramatic  and traumatic , " Itta says .
" In many ways , it 's a place that 's grown up too fast . "
Football , some believe , is the answer .
Football , they say , can keep kids out of trouble , teach principles like discipline and teamwork and bring the community together , helping a modern - day Barrow reconnect with its values - rich past .
To others , the concept is laughable .
Critics look at a cost of nearly $ 200,000 , logistical headaches like flying every opposing team into town or squeezing three road games into one 3,682 - mile , six - day road trip , and they wonder if high school football really belongs in the land of the polar bear .
" I do n't think it fits here , " says middle school teacher Lynn Lacey .
" I do n't think this is a long - lasting thing .
There 's simply not enough history and background with football  the kids do n't watch it , they do n't know it .
It 's nothing more than a flashy way to get headlines and waste money . "
Challenges of the Arctic
In the middle of August , the Arctic looks nothing like you 'd imagine .
There 's no snow , no ice and typically no polar bears .
The ice pack that shoves itself against Barrow 's shoreline nine months a year has retreated a mile or so out to sea , where it is barely visible on the horizon .
Soon , when the winds shift and the fall freeze takes hold , the ice will return , stretching Barrow 's end - of - the - world shore some seven miles farther over the Arctic Ocean .
But for now , the temperature is in the 20s , the sun is shining brightly and 44 high school teenagers  the majority of whom are wearing shorts  gather on a gravel field for the final practice before their first game .
No. 67 , the linebacker with the square jaw and crooked demeanor , can't stand still .
He kicks rocks at his teammates between plays .
He rolls his eyes when coaches order him to stop .
When he 's told not to tackle his teammates , he flattens them .
When he 's told to run full speed , he jogs .
And this is the only player with varsity experience .
His name is Kilifi Fotukava and he's the poster boy for the type of kid so many believe football can help .
Since his mother sent him from Anchorage to Barrow three years ago to live with his aunt , Fotukava has been in trouble for everything from inappropriate behavior toward female students to bringing a weapon to school .
" I do n't know why I act the way I do , " Fotukava says .
" I guess it 's just the way I am . "
But he loves football .
Lives for hitting people .
So his family , his teachers , his classmates and even Fotukava himself hope the sport can change the way he is .
" My thing is that I do n't want to see him on the front page of the paper going to prison and getting lost in the system , " says Fotukava 's aunt , Anna Manu .
" Or worse yet , I do n't want to open the paper and see that he is dead .
Football is something that he looks forward to .
It helps motivate him to do his homework and stay in class . "
On this day in practice , offensive line coach Brian Houston tears into Fotukava for kicking rocks at his teammates and disrupting the huddle .
" Kilifi , you gotta quit messing around , " Houston says .
" Take pride in your huddle .
C'mon , now .
This is where you come together as a unit .
Cut all this other stuff out . "
Head coach Mark Voss , the man with the raspy , deep voice that sends shudders down the spines of his middle school computer class students , misses the discussion altogether .
He already has plenty to worry about .
In April , when he got the e-mail from Superintendent Blankenship asking if any of the teachers on staff had football coaching experience , the man who last coached 23 years and 5,000 miles ago in Arkansas laughed .
" I thought it was a joke , " Voss says .
" Football ?
Up here ? "
Little did he know what he was getting into .
Forty kids showed up for the first meeting , asking questions like , " Where are we going to play ? "
" Who are we going to play ? " and " Is this tackle football ? "
" You could sense their desire , " Voss says .
" For all the questions these guys had  and they were all good questions  you could tell they wanted to play . "
If only it were that simple .
If only Barrow were like any other high school in the country and Voss could prey on that teenage exuberance and roll out a few footballs , toss out some gear , instill some discipline and then cross his fingers and hope that no one gets hurt .
But this is the Arctic .
The footballs , the shoulder pads , the tackling dummies , they have to be ordered from an athletic supplier in the Lower 48 and shipped in on one of the two daily Alaska Airlines flights from Anchorage .
Outfitting each player from head to toe  including jerseys , pads , Under Armour and hand warmers  costs the district about $ 400 per player .
And delivery is n't exactly guaranteed .
Don Dunbar , the director of purchasing for the school district , waited three weeks for a case of athletic field marking paint to show up for the first game .
It did arrive  two days too late .
" Welcome to the Arctic , " Dunbar says , " where express overnight delivery means five days . "
Because of its remote , island - on - the - mainland location , finding opponents is n't easy .
Every home opponent  be it Delta 450 miles away or Sitka 1,400 miles away  has to be flown to Barrow .
That means providing flights to the visiting team , plus ground transportation , meals and a place to sleep .
It all adds up to roughly $ 20,000 in expenses for each home game .
When the Whalers hit the road , they 're the ones hopping in a plane , sleeping in a gym and eating fast - food pizza .
" The logistics boggle your mind , " Voss says .
" They keep me from sleeping at night .
When you think of a high school football program that has to deal with the things we do , it blows you away .
But our cross-country ( team ) deals with it , our basketball deals with it , our wrestlers deal with it .
Football is just one more layer . "
The field where the team plays is a glorified gravel pit , a plot of land the corporation uses to operate heavy machinery in the winter and dry gravel in the summer .
The lines on the field are a combination of field paint and flour , which seagulls swarm around and eat after each game .
Since the permafrost can't hold a 1,000 - pound structure without truckloads of cement , which the school district can't pour into a temporary field , the goalposts sit above ground .
They were built by an Inupiat man named " Moosie , " who had never watched a football game before in his life .
Using drawings given to him by his boss , he built the structures out of spare sprinkler pipe he found in the district maintenance shed .
" I just had to read the blueprints , look at all the material we had and just start cutting and welding it together , " he says .
" It was n't too difficult . "
The referee for the opening game is a state trooper .
Bill Broderson was escorting a prisoner to Fairbanks , Alaska , when he overheard talk about high school football coming to Barrow .
A few phone calls later and the longtime high school official had his first - ever job in the Arctic .
To fill out the rest of his six - man crew , he advertised on KBRW , the only radio station in town .
Of the assorted group of teachers , baggage handlers and secretaries who responded , only one had any experience .
Two were related to players on the team .
An Inupiat woman , who had never watched a football game in her life , simply wanted to be part of the first game in the Arctic .
They all were hired .
" I pretty much threw them the rulebooks and said , ' Here you go  ask me some questions , ' " Broderson says .
" When we walked on the field , they looked scared .
Absolutely petrified .
But what else would you expect ?
There are n't exactly a ton of officials running around up here .
There 's no blueprint for starting a football team in the Arctic . "
The evolution of a town
When the temperatures begin to fall into the teens and the ice pack returns to shore , so , too , will Barrow 's most feared winter visitors  polar bears .
But on this mid-August afternoon , even though the ice pack is out at sea , three of the creatures have swum the seven miles to shore to stroll through town in search of food .
Word spreads like a bitter wind blowing off the Arctic .
Voss is sitting at his desk when he gets an e-mail from a concerned parent , wondering what the team is going to do if a bear shows up at practice .
One bear has been spotted less than a mile from the field .
" I do n't know what they want me to say , " Voss says .
" We 'll gather the team up , get on the school bus and wait for the bear to leave .
Then once it does , get back out there and continue practice .
The bear is n't going to come messing with the bus . "
In Barrow , dealing with bears is just part of everyday life , a life that on the surface , seems incredibly basic  one gas station , one radio station , two grocery stores , no paved roads .
But surviving in one of the harshest environments in the world is physically , mentally and financially taxing .
Here , the sun wo n't set for 84 straight nights .
In the winter , it wo n't rise for 67 straight mornings .
There are no roads in or out of town , meaning that every single piece of everything  from people to pizzas to shoulder pads  needs to be flown in or shipped on the barge that arrives from Seattle once a summer .
According to the North Slope Borough Planning Department , the cost of living in Barrow is approximately 278 percent higher than the cost of living in the lower - 48 states and 214 percent higher than in Anchorage , Alaska 's largest city .
A sampling shows a gallon of milk costs $ 8 , a case of Powerade $ 35 , a bottle of saline solution $ 16 .
Part of that is the town 's remote location .
Part of it is astronomical winter heating costs .
Even on a sun-splashed late - summer afternoon , signs of the cold to come are everywhere .
The windshield of every car is cracked , its glass unable to withstand the frigid temperatures of winters past .
Every grille has an electrical plug hanging from it to keep engine blocks warm .
And every building is constructed on stilts so that when summer temperatures climb into the 40s and 50s and the top layer of permafrost melts , the foundation does n't sink into the ground .
" When you 're the tallest thing walking around on the streets and the wind is blowing off the Arctic Ocean at about 60 , 70 miles an hour , it hits you pretty hard , " says PJ Ford Slack , a former school administrator in Barrow .
" It feels like little ice knives going through you . "
There is n't much for kids to do .
The local recreation department does its part , with a roller rink , rock - climbing wall , basketball gym and a pair of teen centers , but there 's no movie theater , no mall , no place to hang out .
So why live here ?
The natives say it's what they know .
Archeological digs suggest that Inupiat Eskimos lived here as far back as 500 A.D. , hunting caribou , polar bears and the whale , just as the native population  60 percent of the total population  still does today .
For the others , it 's opportunity  a job , a promotion , some extra money .
While the average starting salary for a teacher in Alabama is $ 25,000 a year , a first - year teacher in Barrow is paid close to $ 50,000 in an effort to bring quality educators to the area .
In recent years , the financial picture has darkened .
Oil production in Prudhoe Bay has begun to slow , meaning smaller dividend checks , fewer jobs and more government cutbacks .
The uncertain future  for adolescents and adults alike  has culminated in an escalating drug and alcohol problem .
Broderson , the state trooper , estimates that 98 percent of the criminals he transports can trace their troubles to substance abuse .
Fotukava appears to be one of the kids headed down that track .
" If having a football team can keep one kid from ever having to meet me , it 's worth it , " Broderson says .
" I can't think of a better , legal , encouraged avenue for these kids to take out all that pent up aggression than playing football . "
Stepping on the field
The 44 high school football players in their brand - new helmets , brand - new shoulder pads , brand - new football pants and brand - new jerseys , squeeze into the vinyl seats of the antiquated school bus and listen for the final instructions before their first game of the season .
When their coaches finish the clichés about playing hard , having fun and leaving it all on the field , assistant coach Jeremy Arnhart steps forward .
" Guys , " he says , " this is simple .
Just play like you know how . "
Only these 44 do n't know how .
When they step off the bus and onto the gravel - covered field , it will be the first time most of them have ever stood on a field with lines .
It was just three weeks ago that this group started practice .
Three weeks ago that Coach Voss first issued equipment , piece by piece , hoping to ease the transition from the touch football these kids had played on the tundra to the hard - hitting , full - contact , the - whole - town - is - watching real thing .
" I thought I knew football , " says Jake Voss , a senior tight end and Mark 's son .
" But when I started watching the game , looking at coverages and responsibilities , I realized real quickly : I did n't know a damn thing . "
The 15 practices have been a brain - numbing cram session , with Voss and his coaching staff teaching everything from how to tackle to how to put on pads .
" We had one kid who put his pads on upside down , " Voss says .
" But we got it corrected . "
In this final walk - through before the first game , Voss runs through all the details any sensible coach would , reminding his kids to get a good night sleep , stay out of trouble and eat a healthy breakfast in the morning .
Voss has a quiet confidence about him .
And for good reason .
He has done all this before .
At his last coaching job , 23 years ago in Arkansas , he helped start a program from scratch .
And after three weeks of practice , he says , this team could beat that team .
But that confidence quickly evaporates in the season opener .
Though nearly half the town shows up for the game , surrounding the field with pick - up trucks , ATVs and even recliners , the Whalers are plagued by nine procedural penalties , including four false starts by Fotukava alone .
They lose their opener to Delta , a school that has played football for just three years , 34-0 .
The next week against Valdez , there 's improvement .
The Whalers graduate to the next level of football blunders .
A ball hits a Barrow punt returner in the leg and is returned for a touchdown .
Fotukava throws an interception on a botched punt , and it , too , is returned for a touchdown .
Valdez defeats Barrow , 33-0 .
Two games into the season , the Whalers have been outscored , 67 - 0 .
They have yet to find the end zone .
And just one home game remains against Sitka before the team 's three - games - in - six - days road trip .
But there 's a glimmer of hope .
Standing at midfield talking to Voss after the game , one of the Valdez coaches says , " If your kids play as hard as they did today against us , you 'll have a shot against Sitka . "
That 's all Voss needs to hear .
Thinking back to that first season in Arkansas , he knows how difficult this can be .
Now he 's got something to help push his players .
" It can be heartbreaking , " he tells them .
" Absolutely heartbreaking .
But all that pain , all those difficult days in practice , it 's all erased by winning that one game .
You win that one game , you have that one day where everyone comes together and everything clicks , and they will never take that away from you . "
The following week , they 'll get their next chance .

The cashiering of " Brownie , " whom Mr. Bush now purports to know as little as he did " Kenny Boy , " changes nothing .
The Knight Ridder newspapers found last week that it was the homeland security secretary , Michael Chertoff , not Mr. Brown , who had the greater authority to order federal agencies into service without any request from state or local officials .
Mr. Chertoff waited a crucial , unexplained 36 hours before declaring Katrina an " incident of national significance , " the trigger needed for federal action .
Like Mr. Brown , he was oblivious to the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the convention center , confessing his ignorance of conditions there to NPR on the same day that the FEMA chief famously did so to Ted Koppel .
Yet Mr. Bush 's " culture of responsibility " does not hold Mr. Chertoff accountable .
Quite the contrary : on Thursday the president charged Homeland Security with reviewing " emergency plans in every major city in America . "
Mr. Chertoff will surely do a heck of a job .
WHEN there 's money on the line , cronies always come first in this White House , no matter how great the human suffering .
After Katrina , the FEMA Web site directing charitable contributions prominently listed Operation Blessing , a Pat Robertson kitty that , according to I.R.S. documents obtained by ABC News , has given more than half of its yearly cash donations to Mr. Robertson 's Christian Broadcasting Network .
If FEMA is that cavalier about charitable donations , imagine what it 's doing with the $ 62 billion ( so far ) of taxpayers ' money sent its way for Katrina relief .
Actually , you do n't have to imagine : we already know some of it was immediately siphoned into no -bid contracts with a major Republican donor , the Fluor Corporation , as well as with a client of the consultant Joe Allbaugh , the Bush 2000 campaign manager who ran FEMA for this White House until Brownie , Mr. Allbaugh 's college roommate , was installed in his place .
It was back in 2000 that Mr. Bush , in a debate with Al Gore , bragged about his gubernatorial prowess " on the front line of catastrophic situations , " specifically citing a Texas flood , and paid the Clinton administration a rare compliment for putting a professional as effective as James Lee Witt in charge of FEMA .
Exactly why Mr. Bush would staff that same agency months later with political hacks is one of many questions that must be answered by the independent investigation he and the Congressional majority are trying every which way to avoid .
With or without a 9/11 - style commission , the answers will come out .
There are too many Americans who are angry and too many reporters who are on the case .
( NBC and CNN are both opening full - time bureaus in New Orleans . )
You know the world has changed when the widely despised news media have a far higher approval rating ( 77 percent ) than the president ( 46 percent ) , as measured last week in a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll .
Like his father before him , Mr. Bush has squandered the huge store of political capital he won in a war .
His Thursday - night invocation of " armies of compassion " will prove as worthless as the " thousand points of light " that the first President Bush bestowed upon the poor from on high in New Orleans ( at the Superdome , during the 1988 G.O.P. convention ) .
It will be up to other Republicans in Washington to cut through the empty words and image - mongering to demand effective action from Mr. Bush on the Gulf Coast and in Iraq , if only because their own political lives are at stake .
It 's up to Democrats , though they show scant signs of realizing it , to step into the vacuum and propose an alternative to a fiscally disastrous conservatism that prizes pork over compassion .
If the era of Great Society big government is over , the era of big government for special interests is proving a fiasco .
Especially when it 's presided over by a self - styled C.E.O. with a consistent three - decade record of running private and public enterprises alike into a ditch .
What comes next ?
Having turned the page on Mr. Bush , the country hungers for a vision that is something other than either liberal boilerplate or Rovian stagecraft .
At this point , merely plain old competence , integrity and heart might do .
Op - Ed Columnist Correction : October 2 , 2005 , Sunday Op - Ed columns by Paul Krugman ( Sept. 5 and 9 ) , Maureen Dowd ( Sept. 10 ) and Frank Rich ( Sept. 18 ) said Michael Brown , the former FEMA director , was a college friend or college roommate of Joe Allbaugh , his predecessor .
They went to different colleges and later became friends .
Quick note on timeliness I wrote this article in 2006 , and I was quite fond of it then .
Most of the theory explained here still stands , but since then , I ’ve learned much better techniques for implementing those ideas .
Check out more recent planning articles on this web site for more on current techniques .
Up until a few years ago , most projects I got involved in had a recurring pattern of getting stuck before they even started .
They clearly needed more direction in the opening scenes .
I am not really a fan of big , formal methods , so I was looking for something light - weight which would help , but not get in the way .
Focusing on goals turned out to be a very effective approach to setting the stage for software development .
The way we used to work was quite common – clients would come with a list of wishes , we would meet with them , write down ideas , go back and try to turn produce a list of requirements and tasks ; this process would then repeat until the clients were happy with the list .
After a few rounds , we would start prototyping and writing specifications , then developing , but features would just get thrown in and out all the time .
It was hard to decide when to start turning customers ’ ideas and wishes into specifications and it was difficult to know when we have covered everything .
If we started to prototype and draw specifications too early , then a lot of work would be wasted when the requirements change ; if we waited for too long , the projects would just be a pile of loosely coupled ideas , too broad to take any form or have any sort of unified vision .
##Goal - driven requirements gathering
Goals are excellent as a utility to drive requirements gathering .
Goals are much less likely to change than requirements , so focusing on goals provides a stable platform for project work .
I cannot pinpoint exactly where I picked up the idea of focusing on goals , so it has probably crystallised influenced by various books and project experience over the last four years .
This is by no means my original idea , just a set of established techniques that work well .
Scott Berkun ’s excellent book The Art of Project Management < /a> helped me express my ideas much better and make the technique more effective .
Goal - driven requirements gathering process looks like this :
Identify project goals , prioritise and number them For each goal , identify features that help or fulfill that goal .
Number the features , and write down related goal next to each feature .
For each feature , identify system requirements .
Number them , and write down related feature next to each requirement .
When writing specifications or any other supporting documentation , include labels of relevant requirements .
I typically prefix goal numbers with G , features with F and requirements with R . So when I see F16 or R22 I know exactly where to look for more information .
Goals should ideally be prioritised , but more importantly divided into at least two groups : ‘ must have ’ and ‘ would be nice ’ .
If the clients can split them into three groups , even better .
If they can be divided into four groups , the project is too broad - and should probably be divided into several sub-projects or phases .
One feature may map into several goals , but it has to help at least one goal .
If I can not write a goal label next to the feature , then the feature does not really belong to the project .
At this point , there are two choices - either expand the project by adding a new goal , or scrap the feature and leave it for some later project or phase .
Same goes for the requirements - if there is no related feature , then the requirement does not belong in this project .
It ’s not always a straight - forward process as it sounds , and it ’s normal to run up and down the hierarchy of goals , features and requirements .
At least there is some sort of traversal algorithm for that tree , which makes sure that everything is covered .
And , there is a clear signal when the process is complete .
##Focused projects = everybody happy <
Projects become more focused , as divergent ideas get flushed out into the open - they have no parent goal .
Though it might not sound hard to identify unrelated features , that task is very difficult without actually knowing the project goals .
During a recent meeting on web portal restructuring , clients asked us to include support for marketing mailing lists .
How do we decide if this is actually relevant to the web portal restructuring or not ?
Where should the line be drawn ?
Imagine a goal like a spot - light , shining on a few features , then on a bit more requirements and finally on parts of the system intended to answer those requirements .
Magic of written goals is incredible , since it instantly becomes obvious if the project is too broad or has not been thought over properly .
Too many goals clearly signal that the project should be split into several phases or sub-projects .
In my experience , having two or three top - priority goals is ideal , but I can live with five or six .
This is consistent with Berkun ’s rule of thumb that ‘ project vision document should have somewhere between three and five high - level goals ’ .
With ten or more top - priority goals , project should really be split into phases , and each phase should be considered a project .
If , on the other hand , the project does not have clear and coherent objectives , then I see a big red flashing DANGER sign .
A sudden pain in my stomach comes shortly after , reminding me of a community portal in which I was involved about six years ago .
The original estimate was that it would take three months , but the project was cancelled after two years of heavy development , and everybody was angry .
Clients were just throwing requirements in and out , never happy with the way the portal works .
Developers were angry because they were running around in circles .
Management was angry because there was no money .
Contractual obligations and financial issues set aside , I strongly believe that clients should get a solution for their problem on the end of the project , even if that solution is not what they originally requested .
It ’s up to us to provide focus and guidance for the project , and make sure that their goals are met .
That also means helping them to identify and express objectives if they cannot do it themselves .
However , if it ’s impossible to define clear and consistent objectives for the project , I suggest not starting at all .
Somehow , I do n’t like to embark on a ship when it ’s only destination is the bottom of the ocean .
Having goals prioritised makes it easy to prioritise development , since it ’s obvious which features and requirements are essential for top - priority goals .
On bigger projects , preparing for actual software development may take months , and it ’s not uncommon for features to get thrown in and out after the first draft of specifications or prototyping .
Sometimes , goals are redefined .
Having a labelled tree that spans from goals down to specifications makes it easy to cut an entire branch , and this came in very handy as a way to make sure which parts of the system are no longer required .
Without a written trail , it would be hard to throw out all unnecessary ( and unwanted ) requirements and parts of the specifications .
Also , if something turned out to be much harder to implement than we originally thought , it was easy to check if the feature was really important and could it be re-negotiated .
Preparing a list goals at the beginning of a project , and maintaining them throughout the implementation , also helps communicating objectives with team members .
That is a good technique for improving understanding and coordination .
On the end , written list of goals clearly defines an exit criteria and measure of success for the project .
A better perspective for looking at the requirements
It turned out that focusing on goals helps a lot to identify true requirements and design better solutions .
Clients and users think about software in different terms and on different levels of abstraction then developers .
Their comprehension is , in technical terms , superficial - so their ideas can be a tip of an ice berg .
Though the requests might seem simple ( ‘ add a button to this screen that recalculates the liability ’ ) , they describe genuine problems - which we should really be interested in .
Why do they need to update that kind of information manually ?
Is the liability not being calculated properly ?
Asking the clients to describe the actual problem or objective , not a sequence of steps to implement the solution , makes a big impact - we can then see the problem from a large - scale perspective , usually leading to a systematic solution .
Sending movies over Bluetooth My team designed and built a J2EE - based system for Bluetooth content distribution .
It was initially used for pushing small files and text messages to mobile phones .
After a few months , the client wanted to add on - demand content pull , and distribute large animation / film files .
Enabling on - demand content pull required significant system changes , and the Bluetooth network is not suitable for sending five - megabyte movie files to hundreds of mobile phones all the time .
As always , the client wanted it done as soon as possible , ideally in less than two months .
There was no way that such functionality could be implemented and work properly in that time , and even if it was possible , such a hack would make future support a nightmare .
We asked the clients to identify the problems they wanted to solve by pulling films to the phones .
They had an opportunity to sell the system to an art fair , where the visitors would use it as a video tour .
From that perspective , ‘ video tour ’ had absolutely nothing in common with the original solution , except the idea of client software running on mobile phones .
We decided to build a small stand - alone player for the mobile devices , that would read all files from a MMC card , and would not communicate with any servers at all .
That was done in time for the art fair , and did not break the architecture of the server .
Moral of the story :
If a client comes with a list of tasks , ask them for problems and goals .
Problems with goals and how to solve them
The first bump in the road is probably getting clients to participate in the process - most of them come with ideas or a list of tasks , typically already implying a solution .
It ’s a bit hard at first to make them work with you up the pyramid , from requirements to features and goals , since this approach requires a few steps back and a different perspective .
However , benefits of focusing on goals quickly become obvious , as they bring more structure into the conversation and make communication easier .
From my experience , clients tend to view discussing goals as genuinely trying to understand their problems , and appreciate it , which is an additional benefit .
Another big challenge is identifying and expressing goals , which I ’ve touched upon in How to develop software like commanding a tank .
Scott Berkun offers a mnemonic to identify good goals : SMART , which stands for Specific , , Measurable , Action - oriented , Realistic and Timely .
Once you reach the top of the pyramid , and have a list of goals , the hard part is getting the clients to prioritise objectives and split them into groups .
Clients will try to define too many goals and insist that all are critical - but writing down goals gives us some advantage in negotiations .
Having a list of 20 goals in front of you makes it easy to argue that the project is getting too big , and that it should be split into several phases .
Focus only on the first phase , and you are back on track .
Refusing to include ad - hoc features is not easy , and it has to be done politely .
The trick is to make sure that the project is focused and does not get out of hand , but at the same time make clients feel that they are in control .
Rejecting a divergent requirement should not be seen as refusing to do work , but as a suggestion to implement ( and charge ) it separately , as part of some other project .
I usually create a ‘ waiting list ’ for features and requirements and just throw ideas into it .
Then , after the meeting , I process all the ideas , trying to fit them into the structure .
If a requirement does not map to a higher - level concept , I ’ll call the client or bring that up during the next meeting - asking to either add a new feature or goal into the list , or set the requirement aside for now and include it in another project .
Re-defining goals should be intentionally made a bit burdensome .
After a goal gets added , I try to get re-prioritisation , and if the list is getting too big , then start asking for splitting the project into phases .
Scoring goals
For me , focusing on goals helps a lot in providing structure for the opening stages of projects , stable framework for mid-game and a light on the end of the tunnel .
It is not a silver bullet , but does provide a level of safety by establishing focus for projects and helping to mitigate some development risks , without bureaucracy required by formal software engineering methods .
It is a simple , but very powerful guideline that fits into any development methodology .
Goal - driven requirements gathering is most useful for ground - up development or big system modules - there is not much point in doing it for small change requests .
However , even in trivial cases it ’s good to understand what the clients are trying to achieve , since there might be a simpler or better solution from the technical perspective .

Tree sculptures
Arborsculpture is a branch of arboriculture specifically involved with the shaping of tree trunks and branches into structures with ornamental or functional utility .
Basic techniques involve pruning , grafting and bending single or multiple trees into shapes that grow thicker and stronger as they add annual rings .
The closest related practice is espalier .
The term Arborsculpture was coined in the 1990s to unify the field , but the practice can be dated back to 1911 when John Krubsack grew a chair in Wisconsin .
Axel Erlandson is considered the most prolific Arborsculptor to ever practice this art .
Starting work in the late 1920s and continuing until about 1963 , a year before his death .
Most of his works are currently housed at Bonfante Gardens .
Serious arborsculptors can be found on each continent .
Australia
Peter and Becky of Queensland are growing and shaping extremely detailed and balanced arborsculpture .
They call their trees Pooktres .
Japan On Okinawa island , in Bio Park , this ficus structure sheds the rain and is a favorite spot for children .
Thailand
Nirandr Boonnetr Started shaping trees about 1983 .
This is one of his chairs .
He describes his techniques in the book Arborsculpture - Solutions for a Small Planet
Israel
Aharon Navieh is the head gardener at Kibbutz Revivim .
He started shaping trees in 1984 and has n't slowed down .
Ezekiel Golan , owner of Plantware , grows and shapes Ficus roots .
By growing long roots and then shaping them almost anything could be formed .

Nearly five years after 9/11 , the United States remains far too vulnerable to natural disaster and major attack .
That 's the consensus of security experts and a new federal report released Friday .
Most states and local authorities lag in emergency planning , the report found .
At the same time , the federal government is still struggling to close big security gaps in airline passenger screening and port security and at chemical plants , these experts say .
The reasons are many , they add , but a crucial one is American industry 's limited security efforts .
An estimated 85 percent of critical infrastructure is in private hands .
But the Bush administration has largely resisted mandating the minimum security standards for business .
" What we 've done at this point is look to the private sector to set their own security standards – and if they 're doing it , they 're doing it very , very slowly , " says Lee Hamilton , president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission .
" It 's not working very well , so maybe we have to think more seriously about government imposing standards . "
The result ?
The nation 's guard is down , critics say , or at least not what it should be .
" We have n't come very far at all in terms of credible security that would deter a determined terrorist from going after the things most valuable and vulnerable , " says Stephen Flynn , a senior fellow for national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington .
The chemical industry , for example , has adopted voluntary standards yet remains highly vulnerable .
The risk is so high that if a worst - case scenario occurred at any of 123 US chemical plants , the resulting release of toxic gases could put 1 million people at risk of exposure , the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) reported in April .
While the GAO noted some progress in chemical security , it reported that only one - sixth of 15,000 facilities with large quantities of dangerous chemicals are covered by federal security requirements .
And the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has no authority to require minimum standards .
In March , DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff told Congress he needed legislative authority to mandate minimum standards .
Federal standards would create a " level playing field , " says Mr. Hamilton , who calls the move long overdue .
At the moment , companies that adopt tough security measures put themselves at a cost disadvantage to those who do not .
" Everyone in the business community knows that we 're just a single event away from the federal government jumping in with both feet to tell us how to do it , " Dr. Flynn says .
So taking unilateral steps , which might not square with future federal mandates , looks risky , he adds .
" No sector is going to make a substantial investment under these conditions .
If they do n't see the government on board with it , they 're not in a position to do anything . "
There are also legal liability reasons businesses may hold back .
How much security is enough to avoid a jury verdict after an attack ?
It 's hard to know without a standard .
" The government needs to be able to say ' This is what is required – A , B , C , but not D – and if you fail to do D , we recognize your good faith effort , ' " Flynn says .
Railroad industry takes initiative
One industry that has broadly taken the initiative is railroads .
Companies have drawn up their own emergency response plans and have even conducted war games using their own prioritized list of crucial infrastructure .
Yet , without federal leadership , states have been reluctant to supply national guard troops for practice sessions and some key infrastructure goes lightly guarded , crimping preparedness , a senior railroad official says .
Those shortfalls and others were again hammered home in a major review of national preparedness unveiled Friday .
Conducted in 56 states and territories and 75 urban areas over the past six months , that review envisioned hurricane , influenza , and terror attack scenarios and analyzed some 2,800 emergency operations plans along with interviews with first responders .
While the US is generally prepared for tornadoes and other localized , and even statewide emergencies , the nation is not prepared for catastrophes that strike multiple states at once .
Just 13 percent of states and 7 percent of urban areas had plans for mass evacuations rated as " sufficient . "
Among state plans in the hurricane belt , less than 65 percent were rated sufficient .
A key problem , experts say , is that government and first responders at all levels need to practice their complex response plans .
But less than one - fifth of the $ 18 billion spent just on disaster preparedness has gone toward training , the bulk going toward communication and detection equipment , said George Foresman , DHS undersecretary for preparedness , at a press conference Friday .
That lack of practice has led to foul - ups .
During hurricane Katrina , for instance , the Federal Emergency Management Agency " had an empty passenger train parked at Baton Rouge for three to four days after it hit , " says the railroad official , who asked not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press .
" It was used maybe once to evacuate people , but could have been used a lot more if there was more decisiveness .
The role of the government , as we see it , is to set priorities .
That 's what we need . "
Federal failure to prioritize critical infrastructure has also contributed to some key assets remaining unguarded , the railroad official says .
" There is infrastructure we 've pinpointed that , if it were destroyed , would be a major problem for the country , " the official says .
" These assets are n't as well protected as they should be . "
Bird flu preparedness
Preparedness is also lagging in certain other key areas .
A flu pandemic could knock out a third of the nation 's rail capacity .
Yet without priorities set by government for what must be carried on remaining rail capacity , the results could be a mess .
" Do we need more Nintendos hauled to stores – or more coal and grain ? " the railroad official asks .
" We can't make that decision .
Someone in government has to make those decisions as to what 's a priority . "
Slowly , that is happening .
A just completed federal plan for dealing with a bird - flu pandemic includes a range of tools for setting such priorities , points out Mr. Foresman in a phone interview last week .
Authority of governors and the president to mandate essential services ensures coal will travel ahead of Nintendos , he notes .
Foresman favors risk - based , minimum performance standards rather than spelling out to industry specific technologies that must be adopted .
Prioritizing the nation 's critical infrastructure remains a challenge .
The list of crucial sites ballooned from 143 shortly after 9/11 to more than 270,000 today .
" Do we have a fully prioritized list yet ?
No .
But we have a robust list , " Foresman says .
" We are getting better . "
Standards alone are no panacea .
Security gaps remain even in areas where government has imposed them .
For example : the US still does n't screen all airline passengers against a comprehensive terrorism " watch list , " says Clark Kent Ervin , former inspector general of DHS and author of " Open Target , " a book strongly critical of the nation 's preparedness .
Nearly two years after 9/11 , soon after he started at DHS , Ervin sent undercover teams to airports to try to sneak weapons aboard aircraft – knives , mock explosives , and real guns .
Despite billions of dollars spent over the past three years on various initiatives including luggage - scanning systems , airport screeners at many airports were no better at detecting weapons in 2003 or again in 2004 than they were in 2001 , Mr. Ervin says .
Even now , not all cargo luggage is scanned for explosives , he adds .
The GAO report in April echoed the sentiment .
Despite progress measuring the effectiveness of its screening systems , covert testing shows , it found that " weaknesses and vulnerabilities continue to exist " in airline passenger weapons screening .
Overall , " we 're much more secure than we used to be , " says Foresman , citing hardened cockpit doors , air marshalls and federalized passenger screening .
" For every one [ weapon ] that does get through , hundreds or thousands do n't . "
Critics disagree .
" Unless the federal government is willing to take responsibility as well as accountability for setting minimum security requirements within these [ port , rail , hazardous material trucking and chemical ] sectors , we 're not going to see much progress , " says Flynn .
Even among those willing to grant the administration points for progress , there is a sense the job is only a bit better than halfway done .
" It took the US a decade to get things in place to fight the cold war , " says James Carafano , an analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
" We have a layered , risk - based approach to security this time , and it will take time to implement .
It 's a good approach .
I would argue it is kind of working . "

Special Report : Parking The High Cost of Free Parking Humble " free " parking is largely responsible for the catastrophic failures of postwar North American cities .
By Ryan McGreal
Published April 14 , 2005
Off - street parking requirements are a fertility drug for cars .
— Donald Shoup , The High Cost of Free Parking
There is no righteous ire like the ire of people who believe they deserve something for nothing .
In that light , do n't expect many motorists to appreciate Donald Shoup 's new book , The High Cost of Free Parking .
An UCLA professor in the Department of Urban Planning , Shoup dissects the economic , social , and environmental impacts of current parking regulations and proposes a new approach that can help free cities from the pernicious effects of auto dependency .
Originally limited to the curbside , parking was destined to become a scarce resource .
Cars take up a lot of space , the total area of curbside parking is limited , and certain areas , like workplaces and commercial districts , experience peaks in demand when large numbers of people arrive at once .
Planners concluded that the solution was physical : create enough additional parking to offset the projected increase in demand .
What seemed like good public policy at the time has been a slow - motion time bomb for cities .
Too much parking is much worse , in the long run , than not enough parking .
When planners calculate how many parking spaces to provide1 , they assume parking is free .
Obviously , demand for a " free " service will be much higher than demand for a service that must be purchased .
If people do n't have to pay for parking , they are much more likely to drive .
Parking Is n't Free
There 's just one problem : parking is n't free .
In fact , according to Shoup , " the cost of all parking spaces in the U.S. exceeds the value of all cars and may even exceed the value of all roads . "
Parking costs billions of dollars a year .
Shoup is an economist , and it shows in the perspective he brings to bear .
" [ E] conomists do not define the demand for food as the peak quantity of food consumed at free buffets . "
Nevertheless , planners define the demand for parking as the peak quantity of spaces used when parking is free .
Developers simply pass the cost of " free " parking to property owners , who pass it to tenants , who pass it to all customers in the form of higher prices .
" Off - street parking requirements encourage everyone to drive wherever they go because they know they can usually park free when they get there . "
Huge expanses of asphalt push buildings far back from the street and away from each other .
" Free " parking increases demand for driving lanes , which further separates destinations , making it difficult to get anywhere without a car .
This further increases demand for more lanes and more parking in an insidious positive feedback loop .
Price Signals
Professor Donald Shoup kindly helps to subsidize your driving expenses
Markets normally use price signals as negative feedback to contain demand .
When demand goes up , the price goes up , and the higher price lowers demand .
However , for price signals to work , the people using a good or service must be the ones paying for it .
By breaking the relationship between use and payment , " free " parking eliminates the negative feedback that keeps the system in balance .
As a result , everyone decides to drive everywhere , and the car crowds out other forms of transportation .
Even paid parking is often underpriced .
In Hamilton , for example , motorists can park for 50 cents an hour at most curbside meters .
Assuming about 60 square feet for a parking spot , that 's six dollars per square foot per month - an order of magnitude lower than the equivalent monthly cost for a square foot of building space .
The tantalizing promise of underpriced parking leads motorists to cruise around the block until a spot opens up .
In studies Shoup cites that analyzed traffic congestion , 30 percent of cars on the road were trying to find a parking spot .
Terminal Costs
Of all the transport systems available , including public transit , shipping , and rail , cars are unique in that terminal costs ( doing something with your vehicle when the trip is finished ) are offset to the rest of the economy .
This " provide[s ] a huge subsidy to motorists , and thus increase [s ] the demand for cars , parking spaces , and vehicle travel . "
Only walking , which has effectively no terminal costs , is comparable .
All things being equal , most people would rather drive than walk .
The problem is that all things are n't really equal ; parking requirements just make it seem that way .
Worse still , " free " parking provides the biggest per-mile subsidy to the shortest trips , meaning drivers have a major incentive to drive to destinations they would otherwise be able to reach with ease by foot or bicycle .
A huge proportion of traffic congestion is made up these short trips .
Aim For 15 % Vacancy
Shoup concludes cities should eliminate zoning requirements for off - street parking , end free municipal parking , and charge whatever price will maintain about 15 percent vacancy - the optimal rate to ensure easy entry and exit .
To balance variable demand against a fixed supply , he recommends setting different prices according to time of day and day of week .
Anticipating the righteous ire of those drivers accustomed to free parking , Shoup notes that the biggest barrier to eliminating this subsidy is political , not technical , and proper implementation is critical .
The best way to implement market priced parking is for cities to remit all of the revenues from parking to what he calls " parking benefit districts " , akin to business improvement areas .
This way , decisions on how to collect and how to spend are made by the citizens most affected .
Bicycle parked against a parking meter
The benefits are potentially tremendous : with less parking , there is more room for both people and businesses , and the right balance between supply and demand means less congestion from cruising , less noise , and less air pollution .
Reduced parking requirements also ease entry for investors who might otherwise build elsewhere .
As the area becomes more appealing to pedestrians , it attracts both visitors and investors .
For Hamilton in particular , this kind of arrangement can provide the momentum and investment to restore and revitalize our beautiful downtown neighbourhoods that preceded cars and are already designed with pedestrians in mind .

Adding to criticism of the Bush administration ’s prosecution of the war in Iraq , a retired senior general who commanded an infantry division in the conflict said Monday that requests by commanders for more soldiers were repeatedly turned down .
“ Many of us routinely asked for more troops , ” retired Maj. Gen. John R.S. Batiste said , contradicting statements by President Bush and his senior aides that the administration had given the military all the resources it had asked for .
“ There simply are n’t enough troops there to accomplish the task , ” said Batiste , who has previously called for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to resign .
“ It ’s a shell game we ’re playing in Iraq , and we ’ve been doing it since day one .
And we ’re still doing it today . ”
The general ’s remarks , echoed by two other retired soldiers Monday , came at a special hearing called by Democratic senators in what they said was a new initiative to increase oversight of the war effort .

Senior Republican lawmakers dismissed the hearing as a stunt orchestrated with November elections in mind .
A Pentagon spokesman declined to address Batiste ’s comments directly , instead pointing to past public statements by Marine Gen .
Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , that Rumsfeld had regularly consulted the senior military leadership on troop levels .
In April , when retired generals including Batiste called for Rumsfeld to resign , Pace said : “ We had then [ in Iraq invasion planning ] and have now every opportunity to speak our minds , and if we do not , shame on us , because the opportunity is there . ”
Batiste ’s comments added fuel to questions about how the administration pursued its goals in Iraq and about the war ’s consequences .

Several newspapers , including The Times , reported Sunday that the nation ’s intelligence agencies had concluded that the Iraq war intensified the threat of global terrorism .
Administration officials responded that the articles on the war assessment contained in the classified National Intelligence Estimate did not represent the full report .
On Monday , White House Press Secretary Tony Snow continued to discount the news reports .
“ One thing that the reports do not say is that war in Iraq has made terrorism worse , ” Snow said .
The senior Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee called Monday for the document to be declassified , a request the administration is resisting .

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said in a statement that the disclosure of the assessment and the testimony at Democrats ’ hearing dealt “ a fatal blow to any claim that staying the current course is an acceptable strategy for success in Iraq . ”
Batiste , in his testimony , renewed his April call for Rumsfeld to resign .
Joining him were retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton and retired Marine Col. Thomas X. Hammes .
All three of them Iraq veterans , they lambasted what they called the Defense secretary ’s reluctance to commit more troops and other resources to the war .
“ The whole thing is absolutely disingenuous , ” Batiste said of the administration ’s position that the number of soldiers deployed was sufficient to secure Iraq .
“ We started with a strategy and a plan that was under - resourced in soldiers and Marines and airmen and sailors by a factor of three . ”

A career Army officer -- and military aide to then - Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz , an architect of the Iraq war -- Batiste commanded the 1st Infantry Division from 2002 until his retirement in 2005 .
Batiste commanded about 22,000 soldiers sent to north - central Iraq from February 2004 to February 2005 .
Eaton , who oversaw efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces in 2003 and 2004 , also said he was not given enough U.S. troops to do the job .
About 145,000 American troops are serving in Iraq .
In the run-up to the March 2003 invasion , then - Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric K. Shinseki drew harsh criticism from administration officials for predicting that “ hundreds of thousands ” of U.S. troops might be needed to keep the peace in a postwar Iraq .

Batiste and Eaton said Monday that a lack of troops was helping fuel the anti-U.S. insurgency .
And Batiste went a step further , suggesting that insufficient troop levels contributed to the abuse of Iraqis by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison and other detention facilities .
As the violence in Iraq has continued , the administration has faced increasing criticism that it went to war with an inadequate force and failed to anticipate the problems of rebuilding .
The Pentagon has steadfastly defended its war planning and deployments .
Army Gen. John P. Abizaid , commander of all U.S. troops in the Middle East , has argued that higher troop levels would be counterproductive because they would anger local communities and undercut Iraqi forces ’ incentive for taking over security responsibilities .

For Democrats -- often divided over the war and on the defensive because of White House and Republican congressional leaders ’ charges that the Democrats want to “ cut and run ” -- Monday ’s hearing was an attempt to take the offensive .
“ I hope this here will be a wake - up call to our Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to start having hearings , to start doing their congressional responsibility , ” said Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
Still , the party faces a challenge in formulating an alternative approach .
Responding to questions by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , Batiste , Eaton and Hammes strongly warned against an early withdrawal of American forces from Iraq -- a position that several leading Democrats in Congress have advocated .

Clinton has not supported early withdrawal but has said that the American troop commitment should not be open - ended .

Summary : Clear content , simple navigation , and answers to customer questions have the biggest impact on business value .
Advanced technology matters much less .
Here are the biggest issues that led to lost business value in some of our recent consulting projects :
An e-commerce site lost millions of dollars because overly aggressive homepage promotions made users distrust the price of any product that was not on sale .
This is a classic example of the importance of trust - enhancing design in e-commerce .
Rather than offering a unified intranet portal , one big company 's intranet had inconsistent design and used different systems to manage different areas .
As employees moved around the intranet , the navigation options and structural appearance changed .
Parts of the intranet looked outdated compared to newer sections , which made users doubt the accuracy of the older pages ' information .
Again , this is a credibility problem — trust is not just an e-commerce issue .
Potential customers could n't find a service company 's outlets because the store finder required users to know the company 's name for each location .
People who used other names left the site , wrongly assuming the company did n't serve their areas .
A content site chased users away with intrusive advertising that included few relevant ads .
A completely novel Internet offering was lost on most users , who did n't understand the service , how it worked , or what it could offer them .
Given their vague inklings about the payoff , users were unwilling to register with the site .
Among other problems , users did n't understand the site 's terminology .
Top Three Design Priorities
What 's the common theme in all these business - killing usability problems ?
They all involve simple usability principles that have been the same for ten years .
None of them involve advanced " Web 2.0 " technology ; none would be fixed by implementing any of the fancy stuff that everybody 's talking about .
Indeed , the biggest design flaws destroying business value typically involve :
Communicating clearly so that users understand you .
Users allocate minimal time to initial website visits , so you must quickly convince them that the site 's worthwhile .

Providing information users want .
Users must be able to easily determine whether your services meet their needs and why they should do business with you .
Users must be able to easily determine whether your services meet their needs and why they should do business with you .
Offering simple , consistent page design , clear navigation , and an information architecture that puts things where users expect to find them .
Get these three right , and you 'll enhance your site 's credibility , ease a user 's way through the site , and thus do far more for the site 's business value than any JavaScript trick .
( For more Web design priorities , see my list of 10 high - ROI design steps . )
Better Content
Content rules .
It did ten years ago , and it does today .
People do n't use things they do n't understand .
Writing for the web is still undervalued , and most sites spend too few resources refining the information they offer to users .
The same goes for photos :
On countless sites , product images are too small , fuzzy , or murky , or they 're simply shot from a bad angle , making the product hard to see .
These same sites lavish pixels on big glamour illustrations that our eyetracking studies show attract no fixations .
Go figure .
Generally , all you need are plainspoken words and clean photos .
Nonetheless , these two design elements get almost no coverage in the trade press .
Every month , there seems to be a new article in a leading publication about 3D spinning views , even though 3D is nearly useless in most cases .
But you never see an article about how to write better headlines or take a clearer product photo .
Why Useless , Fancy Stuff Gets Promoted
I have my theory for why the discussion is biased in favor of the things that do the least good : it 's exactly because they are technologies that they get talked about .
Two reasons :
New technology equals news .
Whether in a newspaper or a blog , nobody wants to run stories about the same old , same old .
As the saying goes , " man bites dog " gets press coverage , but " dog bites man " does n't .
Yet , if you 're in charge of prioritizing health system resources , you should invest in helping humans who 've been bitten by dogs .
A clinic to cure dogs that have been bitten by humans would stand empty most of the time .
That the main usability guidelines have remained constant for ten years is no reason to ignore them : it 's a reason to believe that they have durable value and relate to deep human needs .

That the main usability guidelines have remained constant for ten years is no reason to ignore them : it 's a reason to believe that they have durable value and relate to deep human needs .
Companies champion technologies because they can be sold as products and consulting services .
Go to any tradeshow and you 'll see plenty of booths pushing various fancy technologies -- most of which will make very little difference to your bottom line .
But each of these technologies has smooth - talking salespeople who will invite your executives out for a round of golf .
In contrast , no trade show booth features Photographers ' Society representatives saying " clear photos move more products , " even though it 's the truth .
Nor does the Writers ' Guild cold - call Internet managers to sell them on the value of bulleted lists .
This is not to say that there 's no role for new technology .
We 're currently working with a company that 's placing an extremely complicated application online .
They can't do this with good usability unless they use several " rich UI " tricks .
But that 's an application , and a big one to boot .
For 90 % of websites , it 's more important to focus on communicating clearly , whether they 're e-commerce sites , corporate sites , government sites , or non-profit sites .
Elite Experience vs. User Experience
A final reason why attention flows to things that matter little to mainstream business websites : the Web 's chattering classes tend to be overly engaged in the " Internet elite experience . "
They actually care about the ' Net for its own sake , and go gaga over new ways of showing maps .
In contrast , average users just want to complete tasks online .
They do n't particularly like the Web , and they 'd like to get back to their jobs or families as quickly as possible .
Wall Street experiencing Web Bubble 2.0 is one thing .
But I 'm concerned that Internet professionals are getting a dangerous sniff of bubble vapors as well , deluding themselves into thinking that their preferences and interests represent those of normal customers .
One of usability 's most hard - earned lessons is that " you are not the user . "
If you work on a development project , you 're atypical by definition .
Design to optimize the user experience for outsiders , not insiders .
The antidote to bubble vapor is user testing : find out what representative users need .
It 's tempting to work on what 's hot , but to make money , focus on the basics that customers value .

Image Hosting Vs. Video Hosting
Image Hosting is the process that facilitates user for uploading an image on an internet website .
The image will be stored by an image host on its server and code will be available to other users so that they can easily approach that image .
The websites of image hosting deliver a peculiar platform for uploading .
The upload platform is like a form at which image file position can be easily specified on user ’s local computer file system .
By clicking on submit button , the file can be easily synced on host ’s server .
An uploader will be easily allowed by image host to upload multiple files at a time by making it a ZIP file .
Nowadays , many image hosting and video hosting websites are available for users .
Main Factors of Image Hosting
1. Reliable service
2. Multiple files can be uploaded
3. Image URL is peculiar
4. Encrypted photo albums
5. Customized subdomains
6. Flexibility in bandwidth
Image Hosting Services
Image Hosting services allow users for FTP access in which many files can be easily uploaded using FTP software or browser of FTP .
Hosted images are enclosed to other websites using specified inline links .
Flicker Tool :
Using this tool the user can upload photos by his own camera phone which should have the capability of email service .
Instagram :
This website delivers photo sharing services and user has to register himself first then only he can use it .
It is owned by Facebook .
Imgur :
In this free image hosting is provided , and registration is not required anymore .
Ipernity :
This provides the facility of photo and video sharing , blog , and groups .
The unlimited images are displayed this year .
How to choose Image Hosting
For the best image hosting , user has to take care of many important points that should follow an outstanding hosting .
These points are as follows :
Identification : Image hosting has a great potential that can identify the images easily that where and when they are being utilized .
Whenever there will be a request for an image accessing then image host will log date and numeric Internet address related to the request .
In spam case , all messages involve their peculiar image URLs which are particular to that provided messages .
This eccentric URL is required in tracking ID so that image host will be authorized to encrypt the message and will know the recipient also in addition to above authorization .
Cost : Number of image hosting is free , and some of them do not require any registration .
Free image hosting is supported by many features like thumbnail pages , advertisements on top pages or not found pages .
Advertisements for users enhance image size and bandwidth limits also .
Tools :
Image hosting provides tools to design galleries and photoblogs with user ’s images and make a slide show by those images .
Some tools are outstanding that provides an ability to append the notes to the user so that these can be used on side loaders and browser sidebars .

Tired of fluorescent tubes ?
Imagine your ceiling -- or any surface -- as a giant light panel , thanks to OLED research from the University of Southern California and Princeton University .
Scientists studying organic light - emitting devices ( OLEDs ) have made a critical leap from single - color displays to a highly efficient and long - lived natural light source .
The invention , described in the April 13 issue of Nature , is the latest fruit of a 13 - year OLED research program led by Mark Thompson , professor of chemistry in the USC College of Letters , Arts and Sciences , and Stephen Forrest , formerly of Princeton University and now vice president for research at the University of Michigan .
" This process will enable us to get 100 percent efficiency out of a single , broad spectrum light source , " Thompson said .
If the device can be mass - manufactured cheaply - a realistic expectation , according to Thompson - interior lighting could look vastly different in the future .
Almost any surface in a home , whether flat or curved , could become a light source : walls , curtains , ceilings , cabinets or tables .
Since OLEDs are transparent when turned off , the devices could even be installed as windows or skylights to mimic the feel of natural light after dark - or to serve as the ultimate inconspicuous flat - panel television .
Thompson and Forrest previously invented efficient single - color displays now ready to enter the market in next - generation cell phones .
But subsequent attempts by several groups to create white - light OLEDs fell short .
The biggest issue was the fast burnout time of the blue component , since blue is one of the primary colors needed to make white .
The Nature paper presents a quantum mechanical trick that solves this problem .
First , the researchers followed their standard recipe for making an OLED : placing four ultra - thin organic layers on glass or transparent plastic .
Three of the layers serve as highways for charges to reach a central " emissive " layer .
When the oppositely charged molecules meet in the emissive layer , electrons jump from the negatively charged molecules to the positive ones , and ultimately relax to their starting energy .
In the process , light is emitted , which can be tuned to cover a broad range of wavelengths .
Previous OLEDs used phosphorescent blue , green and red dyes to generate light with greater energy efficiency than all - fluorescence based devices ( phosphorescence and fluorescence , both expressions of energy that is released as excited electrons fall back into their regular orbit , differ mainly in the speed of their response ) .
Thompson and Forrest found that they could substitute a fluorescent dye for blue without sacrificing the superior properties of OLEDs .
In fact , the researchers reported , the fluorescent dye should prolong the lifetime of the blue component and also uses 20 percent less energy .
" We 're hoping this will lead to significantly longer device lifetimes in addition to higher efficiency , " Thompson said .
According to Forrest , the device eventually could achieve three times the efficiency of standard incandescent light bulbs .
" With a future emphasis on manufacturing technology , this structure may provide an important , low - cost and efficient means that will replace incandescent lighting in many different applications , " Forrest wrote .
The tallest remaining hurdle to production of these devices may have nothing to do with the OLED itself , Thompson said , but with the plastic layer to be used as a backing in economical large - area devices .
All mass - produced plastics allow some humidity to pass through to the OLED , eventually degrading it .
" There 's no plastic that 's hermetic enough to make devices that will last a long period , " Thompson said , while predicting that this problem can be solved .
Already , Universal Display Corp. has developed the group 's research into a commercially feasible process for making cell phone screens .

Cycling Tour de France champ suspended over doping test Landis declares innocence ; others question results Tour de France winner Floyd Landis was suspended by his team yesterday after a preliminary test result showed he had abnormal hormonal levels on the day of a remarkable ride in the mountains that essentially clinched the race .
Landis last night declared that he broke no rules , and two prominent specialists raised questions about the findings .
Landis 's ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone in a urine sample exceeded the allowable range under international doping regulations , according to a statement issued by the Switzerland - based Phonak team .
The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) lowered that standard from 6:1 to 4:1 last year .
Team officials went public with the information the day after the UCI , cycling 's governing body , announced that an unnamed rider had an ``adverse analytical finding " during the Tour .
The test will not be considered a formal positive unless it is confirmed by a backup analysis performed on the ``B " urine sample , expected to be completed within a few days .
A spike in the level of the top number can be evidence that an athlete used synthetically - produced testosterone .
However , two leading physicians and crusaders in anti-doping circles deplored the release of the damaging information before the second analysis .
They added that it would have been nonsensical for Landis to use testosterone as an instant fix .
An elite rider who needed to perform well in a climbing stage as Landis did would be likely to turn to stimulants or blood - boosting techniques such as erythropoietin injections to improve oxygen processing capability , rather than using a strength - building substance like testosterone , they said .
``Something seems a little smelly here , " said Dr. Charles Yesalis , a Penn State professor emeritus of exercise and sport science and nationally recognized expert on steroid use .
``Testosterone is a training drug , not a competition drug .
It does n't act that quickly .
It 's not going to change your life in a day or a week .
` `I feel in an odd position defending any Tour de France rider , but if you wanted to make up eight minutes , you 'd blood - dope . "
His view was backed by Dr. Gary Wadler of New York University , who helped craft the current WADA code .
`` You do n't take anabolic steroids in the morning and race in the afternoon , " Wadler said .
`` It takes many weeks to get benefits from them .
There 's no good evidence that they enhance the aerobic system , although they do shorten recovery time and make you more aggressive and assertive .
This makes no sense pharmaceutically . "
In a teleconference with reporters last night , Landis denied taking any prohibited substance .
He said he does not yet have an explanation for his test result and acknowledged he will have a hard time convincing onlookers it occurred naturally given cycling 's long , troubled doping history .
`` All I 'm asking for is that I be given a chance to show that I 'm innocent , " he said .
``Cycling has a traditional way of trying people in the court of public opinion .
I can't stop that , but I would like to be considered innocent until proven guilty because that 's the way we do things in America . "
The 30 - year - old Landis said he takes medication for hypothyroidism and has a medical exemption for cortisone injections to alleviate discomfort in his right hip , fractured in a training crash three years ago .
He plans to have the joint replaced within two months .
He said he does not know if either medication could affect his testosterone levels .
Landis said he had drunk moderate amounts of beer and Jack Daniel 's whiskey the night before the test .
Elite cyclists generally avoid alcohol during major events , but Landis had just suffered a mortifying meltdown in the Alps .
He thought his chances of winning the Tour were slim and was looking for ``a way to get through the night , " he said .
Some studies have shown that alcohol consumption can cause fluctuations in what is referred to as the T/E ratio .
Other factors that can affect it include extreme stress or fatigue and trauma to the testicles .
If a person has a low natural level of epitestosterone , it does n't take much to cause the ratio to shift -- although major swings in short periods are relatively rare , experts say .
The controversial T/E ratio test has been challenged numerous times .
Elite runners Mary Decker Slaney and Dennis Mitchell both appealed positive tests and won arbitrations in the United States , but their suspensions were ultimately upheld by international panels .
Landis became the third American to win the Tour last Sunday , succeeding his former mentor , seven - time champion Lance Armstrong .
His victory came at the end of a Tour whose organizers hoped they were finally making progress to clean up the sport 's premier event .
`` If the [ B sample ] confirms the first result , anger and sadness will dominate the sentiments of all those who were thrilled by the 2006 Tour de France , " race organizers said in a statement released yesterday .
Landis was considered a podium contender even before prerace favorites Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso were among nine riders suspended by their teams for links to a Spanish doping scandal .
He took the lead twice on the strength of strong time - trial performances and solid climbing before suffering a monumental collapse in Stage 16 in the Alps , dropping from first to 11th place , more than eight minutes back .
The following day , Landis embarked on a seemingly impossible mission to make up the time .
He left the peloton in his dust , caught several other breakaway riders , and finished alone and unchallenged in a solo show of force that past five - time champions Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault called the most epic performance in decades .
That evening 's drug test is the one that indicated Landis 's ``unusual " testosterone to epitestosterone level .
Landis would have been tested at least three times before the positive test as the race leader .
For next season , the lead sponsorship of Landis 's team was scheduled to switch from Phonak , a Swiss maker of hearing aids , to iShares , the brand that Britain 's Barclays Bank plc uses for its exchange - traded funds , investment vehicles that work like mutual funds .
iShares has already been a cosponsor of the Phonak team , its logo prominent on the back of Landis 's skinsuit as he raced the Tour de France 's decisive time trial last weekend .
Members of Landis 's inner circle staunchly defended him .
``I believe in this guy 100 percent , and I think it 's bogus , " said sports physiologist Allen Lim , who has worked with Landis the last two seasons .
Former pro Jonathan Vaughters called Landis a ``victim " of the understandable cynicism that has grown up around a sport long riddled with doping scandals .
`` What makes me sick is that we 've put up for so long with people crying wolf and then finding out they lied , and now everyone 's ready to whack the head off of the next guy who 's `positive , ' " Vaughters said .
`` This is the one time [ cycling fans ] should hold out hope .
This is the rare exception .
He 'll arbitrate this and he 'll win , I guarantee you , but that will take a year , and in the interim we have a Tour de France champion who 's completely black . "

Unsupported Version
This article applies to an unsupported version of Ubuntu .

Content Cleanup Required
This article should be cleaned - up to follow the content standards in the Wiki Guide .
More info ...
Per the above , please see and update https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/238383 if changed .
This article is very outdated .
Either needs to be updated or deleted .
This page documents the process of automatically installing Ubuntu on a cluster of machines .
This means one machine will be manually set up as the install server , and all others will be install Ubuntu when booting .
The version used here is hoary , and the installer used is debian - installer ( The default Ubuntu installer ) .
No tricks like FAI or kickstart are needed .
Prerequisites on the server :
Ubuntu - base install
An Ubuntu .iso
nat active on the server or all machines must receive a public dhcp IP address
Several packages need to be installed
Stage 1 : Preparing DHCP & PXE booting
1. First , you will need the MAC addresses for all machines , so they will get unique and constant IP addresses and hostnames .
2 . Now install the packages dhcp3- server and tftpd - hpa ( see Add Applications ) .
3 . Once you have this list , you can edit your /etc/ dhcp3/dhcpd.conf .
NOTE : PXE booting requires that the .iso file is mounted locally , I mounted it under / var / lib / tftpboot / ubuntu /
mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot/ubuntu echo '/ data/ubuntu-5.04-install-i386.iso /var/lib/tftpboot/ubuntu/ auto defaults , loop 0 0 ' >>
/etc /fstab mount -a
The next step is setting up the PXE configuration .
You will need to create two files : one for installing and one for booting from the local disk ( ie : booting the installed system ) .
Create / var / lib / tftpboot / pxelinux.cfg and put these files there .
As you can see , the default action is to run the installer .
You can also set a few options in here ( the kernel command line ) .
As space can be limited , you may save some space on the kernel command line by creating symlinks to relevant files :
cd /var/lib/tftpboot ln -s ubuntu / install / netboot/ubuntu-installer/i386/initrd.gz ubuntu/install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/i386/linux ubuntu/install/netboot/pxelinux.0 ubuntu/install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/
You can see that in the example config files , these symlinks are used .
Stage 2 : Setting up nis and nfs
For cluster machines , nis and nfs are usually used to share login information and parts of the filesystem , so it is necessary to install both on the server .
You will need the packages nis nfs - kernel - server .
Note : the nis package ( not nis itself ) is quite buggy , and it will automatically try to start ypbind .
It also completely ignores preseed , so in a following step we will create a new version of this package .
You just have to wait a bit for ypbind to time out .
When the nis setup asks for a domain , pick one you like .
As soon as ypbind times out , stop nis again with
invoke - rc.d nis stop
Now you need to edit / etc / default / nis and enable the nis server .
You also need to initialize the nis database with
/usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m
You can now start the nis services again
invoke - rc.d nis start
For NFS , you need to edit /etc / exports in order to export required parts of the filesystem .
Exporting / home and / data , should look like :
# /etc/exports : the access control list for filesystems which may be exported # to NFS clients .
See exports ( 5 ) .
/ home 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0( rw,async ) / data 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0( rw,async )
Now restart the nfs server .
invoke - rc.d nfs restart
Stage 3 : Setting up a local mirror and proxy
Installing from a local mirror and using an http proxy for the rest greatly improves the speed of subsequent installs .
Since apt - proxy is quite broken , you should use squid as a generic http proxy .
To recover the reboot , install php or use a CGI script .
You will need the packages : apache2 libapache2 - mod - php4 squid
This example has only one external IP address , so only the master server is connected to the internet .
The other machines are only connected to the master ( and via NAT they can reach the net ) .
If you do not want a public proxy , make sure squid installer only uses eth1 , the internal interface .
You can tell apache to do so to by editing /etc/ apache2/ports.conf .
invoke - rc.d apache2 stop echo ' Listen 192.168.0.1:80 ' >
/etc/apache2/ports.conf echo ' Listen 127.0.0.1:80 ' >>
/etc/apache2/ports.conf invoke-rc.d apache start
You should also edit the squid config .
Now make the apache server an Ubuntu archive by symlinking into the .iso
ln -s /var/lib/ tftpboot/ubuntu/ubuntu /var/www/ubuntu
Stage 4 : preseed
Having everything in place on the server , you can now take care of the client configuration .
The tftpboot will launch the Ubuntu installer .
This installer usually asks questions , but the answers can be preseeded in a so called preseed file .
Points for possible changes : language , package selection ( which is an aptitude pattern ) , first - created user account , and partition manager setup .
Go over these settings and adapt them to your needs .
Stage 5 : Surviving the reboot
The installer reboots after the basic install , which means that the installer will be launched again .
Of course you do n't want this , which is why it is necessary to create a registration system .
As you can see in the preseed file , the preseed / late - command has been set to wget http://192.168.0.1/register.php .
This does nothing on the client side , but the php script creates a PXE boot file for this machine which instructs it to boot from the local drive .
If you want to reinstall a certain machine all you have to do is remove the associated PXE boot file and it will use the default again .
In order for this to work , the www - data user must have write access to / var / lib / tftpboot / pxelinux.cfg .
chown :www-data /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg chmod g+w $_
This is the register .
php script :
<?php function _dechex ( $x ) { return sprintf ( " %02s " , dechex ( $x ) ) ; } $ host = strtoupper ( implode ( '' , array_map ( _dechex , explode ( '.', $ _SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ] ) ) ) ) ; copy (" /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/localboot " , " /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg /$host " ) ; ?>
Stage 6 : postinstall
The postinstall script can be used to do anything you like .
I used it to install a correct nis package on the clients , create a correct NIS config and more bootstrapping things .
Creating a correct NIS package is done as follows ( for Breezy this wo n't be necessary : the package has been fixed ) .
mkdir nispackage cd nispackage apt - get source nis cd nis-3.12/debian
Open the file postinst
comment out line 61 ( the one with db_input
just before line 64 ( the one with if [ " $RET add a line containing RET =domain where domain is the NIS domain you chose
comment out line 106 ( The one with db_text )
Now enter the following sequence of commands :
cd .. apt - get build - dep nis dpkg - buildpackage
Copy the newly generated .deb ( to be found in the nispackage folder ) file to a location where the clients can retrieve them ( either with wget or an nfs mount )
The postinstallscript itself should be placed in / var / www Mine looks like this :
# Step 1 : Initial mount mkdir / data mount -t nfs 192.168.0.1:/data /data -o rw , soft, bg,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,tcp,timeo=600 , intr # Step 2 : Install and configure NIS aptitude -y install portmap libslp1 dpkg - i / data/ nis_3.12-3_i386.deb cp /data/nsswitch.conf

THE footage of Steve Irwin 's death was so harrowing it should be destroyed to prevent it being leaked to the public , the Crocodile Hunter 's friend and manager John Stainton said yesterday .
In an emotional interview broadcast live on CNN around the world , Mr Stainton said he had watched the tape of Irwin suffering the fatal stingray wound .
" It will never see the light of day , " he vowed .
" I would never want that tape shown , " he told CNN 's Larry King , several times breaking down in tears .
When taxi driver Ashley Gibbins called the helpline of NTL hoping to have broadband installed , he was told , that all its operators were busy right now , but if he cared to hold the line his call would be dealt with as soon as possible .
So Mr Gibbins held .
And held .
Then held some more .
Eventually , after an hour , Mr Gibbins decided he had had enough .
He put the phone down and decided to wreak revenge .
By chance , Mr Gibbins discovered he could alter NTL 's recorded message , and after he'd tinkered with it people seeking help were met with something altogether more blunt .
" Hello , you are through to NTL customer services , " they were told .
" We do n't give a fuck about you , basically , and we are not going to handle any of your complaints .
Just fuck off and leave us alone .
Get a life . "
NTL did not see the funny side and called in the police .
Magistrates in Teesside , however , may have had similar experience on corporate helplines themselves .
Mr Gibbins , 26 , from Redcar , Cleveland , was acquitted at Teesside magistrates ' court on Tuesday of an offence under the Communications
Act 2003 of making a grossly offensive message .
The magistrates decided Mr Cleveland 's rant was merely offensive , and did not make the " grossly offensive " standard required for prosecution .
A spokeswoman for Cleveland Crown Prosecution Service said Mr Gibbins admitted he had left the message but denied it was grossly offensive .
" He did accept that he was responsible .
The main question was whether the message was deemed to be offensive or grossly offensive .
" The judiciary heard all the issues before them and they decided in this particular instance that it was not grossly offensive , " said the spokeswoman .
NTL 's media centre put the Guardian on hold , suggested we try another number and then declined to comment .
This will be familiar to anyone who reads John Baez 's This Week 's Finds in Mathematical Physics , but I can't help but show these lovely exact solutions to the gravitational N - body problem .
This one is beautiful in its simplicity : twenty - one point masses moving around in a figure - 8 .
The N - body problem is one of the most famous , and easily stated , problems in mathematical physics : find exact solutions to point masses moving under their mutual Newtonian gravitational forces ( i.e. the inverse - square law ) .
For N=2 the complete set of solutions is straightforward and has been known for a long time -- each body moves in a conic section ( circle , ellipse , parabola or hyperbola ) around the center of mass .
In fact , Kepler found the solution even before Newton came up with the problem !
But let N=3 and chaos breaks loose , quite literally .
For a long time people recognized that the motion of three gravitating bodies would be a difficult problem , but there were hopes to at least characterize the kinds of solutions that might exist ( even if we could n't write down the solutions explicitly ) .
It became a celebrated goal for mathematical physicists , and the very amusing story behind how it was resolved is related in Peter Galison 's book Einstein 's Clocks and Poincare 's Maps .
In 1885 , a mathematical competition was announced in honor of the 60th birthday of King Oscar II of Sweden , and the three - body problem was one of the questions .
( Feel free to muse about the likelihood of the birthday of any contemporary world leader being celebrated by mathematical competitions . )
Henri Poincare was a favorite to win the prize , and he submitted an essay that demonstrated the stability of planetary motions in the three - body problem ( actually the " restricted " problem , in which one test body moves in the gravitational field generated by two others ) .
In other words , without knowing the exact solutions , we could at least be confident that the orbits would n't go crazy ; more technically , solutions starting with very similar initial conditions would give very similar orbits .
Poincare 's work was hailed as brilliant , and he was awarded the prize .
But as his essay was being prepared for publication in Acta Mathematica , a couple of tiny problems were pointed out by Edvard Phragmen , a Swedish mathematician who was an assistant editor at the journal .
Gosta Mittag - Leffler , chief editor , forwarded Phragmen 's questions to Poincare , asking him to fix up these nagging issues before the prize essay appeared in print .
Poincare went to work , but discovered to his consternation that one of the tiny problems was in fact a profoundly devastating possibility that he had n't really taken seriously .
What he ended up proving was the opposite of his original claim -- three - body orbits were not stable at all .
Not only were orbits not periodic , they did n't even approach some sort of asymptotic fixed points .
Now that we have computers to run simulations , this kind of behavior is less surprising ( example here from Steve McMillan -- note how the final " binary " is not made of the same " stars " as the original one ) , but at the time it came as an utter shock .
In his attempt to prove the stability of planetary orbits , Poincare ended up inventing chaos theory .
But the story does n't quite end there .
Mittag - Leffler , convinced that Poincare would be able to tie up the loose threads in his prize essay , went ahead and printed it .
By the time he heard from Poincare that no such tying - up would be forthcoming , the journal had already been mailed to mathematicians throughout Europe .
Mittag - Leffler swung into action , telegraphing Berlin and Paris in an attempt to have all copies of the journal destroyed .
He basically succeeded , but not without creating a minor scandal in elite mathematical circles across the Continent .
( The Wikipedia entry on Poincare tells a much less interesting , and less accurate , version of the story . )
However , just because the general solution to the three - body ( and more - body ) problem is chaotic , does n't mean we can't find special exact solutions in highly - symmetric conditions , and that 's just what Cris Moore and Michael Nauenberg have recently been doing .
The image at the top really is an exact solution to twenty - one equal - mass objects moving in a figure - eight under their mutual gravitational attraction .
They 're moving in a plane , of course , but that 's not strictly necessary ; here 's a close relative of the figure - 8 , perturbed outside the plane .
From there you can just go nuts ; here 's an example with twelve objects orbiting with cubic symmetry -- four distinct periodic paths with three particles each .
Knowledge of this exact solution , plus $ 3.50 , will get you a grande latte at Starbucks .
Mathematicians have all the fun .

The Bush administration long ago secured a special place in history for the audacity with which it manipulates science to suit its political ends .
But it set a new standard of cynicism when it allowed NASA 's leading authority on global warming to be mugged by a 24 - year - old presidential appointee who , quite apart from having no training on that issue , had inflated his résumé .
In early December , James Hansen , the space agency 's top climate specialist , called for accelerated efforts to reduce industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming .
After his speech , he told Andrew C. Revkin of The Times , he was threatened with " dire consequences " if he continued to call for aggressive action .
This was not the first time Dr. Hansen had been rebuked by the Bush team , which has spent the better part of five years avoiding the issue of global warming .
It was merely one piece of a larger pattern of deception and denial .
The administration has sought to influence the policy debate by muzzling the people who disagree with it or -- as was the case with two major reports from the Environmental Protection Agency in 2002 and 2003 -- editing out inconvenient truths or censoring them entirely .
Israel is in violation of U.S. arms - control laws for deploying U.S. - made fighter planes , combat helicopters , and missiles to kill civilians and destroy Lebanon ’s infrastructure in the ongoing six - day devastation of that militarily weak country .
The death toll , according to published reports , is over 200 people  mostly civilians  while the economic losses have been estimated at about $ 100 million per day .
" Section 4 of the [ U.S. ]
Arms Export Control
Act requires that military items transferred to foreign governments by the United States be used solely for internal security and legitimate self - defense , " says Stephen Zunes , professor of politics at the University of San Francisco .
" Since Israeli attacks against Lebanon ’s civilian infrastructure and population centers clearly go beyond legitimate self - defense , the United States is legally obliged to suspend arms transfers to Israel , " Zunes told IPS .
Frida Berrigan , a senior research associate with the Arms Trade Resource Center at the World Policy Institute in New York , is equally outraged at the misuse by Israel of U.S. - supplied weapons .
" As Israel jets bombard locations in Gaza , Haifa , and Beirut , killing civilians ( including as many as seven Canadians vacationing in Aitaroun ) , it is worth remembering that U.S. law is clear about how U.S. - origin weapons and military systems ought to be used , " Berrigan told IPS .
She pointed out that the U.S. Arms Export Control
Act clear states that U.S. origin weapons should not be used for " non-defensive purposes . "
" In light of this clear statement , the United States has an opportunity to stave off further bloodshed and suffering by demanding that its weaponry and military aid not be used in attacks against Lebanon and elsewhere , and challenging Israeli assertions that it is using military force defensively , " she added .
That would demonstrate the kind of " utmost restraint " that world leaders called for at the G8 Summit of the world ’s most industrialized nations , which just ended in St. Petersburg , Russia .
The 25 - member European Union has said that Israel ’s military retaliation against Lebanon is " grossly disproportionate " to the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers last week by the Islamic militant group Hezbollah , which is a coalition partner of the U.S. - supported government in Beirut .
Israel has accused both Syria and Iran of providing rockets and missiles to Hezbollah , which has used these weapons to hit mostly civilian targets inside Israel .
Israel ’s prodigious military power  currently unleashed on a virtually defenseless Lebanon  is sourced primarily to the United States .
Armed mostly with state - of - the - art U.S. - supplied fighter planes and combat helicopters , the Israeli military is capable of matching a combination of all or most of the armies in most Middle Eastern countries , including Iran , Syria , Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia .
The air force has continued to devastate Beirut and its suburbs with no resistance in the skies during six days of incessant bombings , causing civilian deaths and infrastructure destruction .
" The Israeli Air Force now flies only U.S. - origin fighters , a mix of F - 15s and F - 16s , and the rest of the service ’s fleet is almost completely of U.S. origin , " says Tom Baranauskas , a senior Middle East analyst at Forecast International , a leading provider of defense market intelligence services in the United States .
While in earlier years Israel bought from a variety of arms suppliers , with the French in particular being strong sellers to Israel of such items as Mirage fighters , over the past couple of decades the United States has developed into Israel ’s preponderant arms supplier , he added .
" The U.S. domination as Israel ’s arms supplier can be seen in the Congressional Research Service ’s [ CRS ] annual study of arms sales , " Baranauskas told IPS .
He said the latest CRS survey shows a total of $ 8.4 billion of arms deliveries to Israel in the 1997 - 2004 period , with fully $ 7.1 billion or 84.5 percent coming from a single source : the United States .
A major factor in this trend was the rise in U.S. foreign military financing ( FMF )  outright U.S. grants to Israel  which now totals about $ 2.3 billion a year paid for by U.S. taxpayers .
By U.S. law , Baranauskas said , 74 percent of FMF assistance to Israel must be spent on U.S. military products .
This U.S. assistance has now become the main source of financing for Israel ’s major arms procurements , especially its fighter planes .
From a historical perspective , he said , U.S. assistance to Israel during 1950 - 2005 has been staggeringly high : FMF amounting to $ 59.5 billion ; $ 27 billion in foreign military sales ( FMS ) mostly government - to - government arms transactions ; and $ 8 billion in commercial arms sales by the private sector .
Berrigan of the Arms Trade Resource Center said the United States is undoubtedly the primary supplier of Israeli firepower .
In the interest of strengthening Israel ’s security and maintaining the country ’s " qualitative military edge " over neighboring militaries , the U.S. Congress provides Israel with annual FMF grants that represent about 23 percent of its overall defense budget .
Israel ’s 2006 military budget is estimated at $ 7.4 billion .
According to the Congressional Research Service , FMF levels are expected to increase incrementally by $ 60 million a year to a level of $ 2.4 billion by 2008 compared with $ 2.2 billion in 2005 .
" Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid every year since 1976 , " Berrigan said .
Additionally , the United States provides Israel with billions of dollars worth of weaponry .
She pointed out that recent military sales to Israel include propulsion systems for fast patrol boats worth more than $ 15 million from MTU Detroit Diesel ; an $ 8 million contract to Lockheed Martin for high - tech infrared " navigation and targeting " capabilities for Israeli jets ; and a $ 145 million deal with Oshkosh Truck Corp. to build more than 900 armor kits for Israeli medium tactical vehicles .
In December of last year , Lockheed Martin was awarded a $ 29.8 million contract to provide spares part for Israel ’s F - 16 fighter planes .
Berrigan also said that Israel has one of the world ’s largest fleets of F - 16 fighter planes , made in Fort Worth , Texas , and also in Israel by Lockheed Martin Corporation .
Israel has a total of over 378 F - 16s , considered one of the world ’s most advanced fighter planes  besides 117 F - 15s , 94 Skyhawks , 110 Phantoms  all supplied by the United States .
Unfolding Infogami
A few months ago Mike Pope of Evolving English II brought to our attention an employment website called Jobdango , which grafted the last two syllables of fandango onto job to create its domain name .
I described this as a case of cran-morphing , where a segment of a word is reanalyzed as if it were a combinable morpheme preserving some semantic association with the longer word from which the segment is taken ( like the cran - in cranberry recombining in cran- grape and cran-raspberry ) .
Now Pope divulges a new cran-morphish domain name from the fevered minds of Web developers : Infogami , a Wiki - like application launched by Aaron Swartz that lets users build their own websites .
Noting that Microsoft used " Origami " as a working name for the project that became " Ultra - Mobile PC , " Pope writes :
MS 's use is just recasting an ordinary noun as a name .
Swartz actually takes the step of decomposing the term .
So what 's the common semantic , I wonder ?
Small ?
Folding ?
Make cool things out of simple materials ?
I can't quite pull the instances together .
Swartz illuminates the selection of the name in a narrative about his early brainstorming with Paul Graham , Trevor Blackwell , and a woman he calls " 4 of 4 " :
' When would you have the first prototype done ? '
' Well , we 'd hope to work on it over the next term so we'd have it ready over the summer . '
' Oh , wonderful , wonderful . ' he says .
' What about this name ?
Infogami ?
You 're going to always have to spell it out . '
Paul says .
' Is n't it just origami with info at the beginning ? ' 4 of 4 asks .
' Well , it 's confusing , ' Paul says .
' In - FAH - gomee , ' Trevor chimes in .
' All the names with blog in it are probably taken , ' 4 of 4 says .
' No , you do n't want blog in it , ' Paul says .
' You want something bigger , something that can face the world .
You 're not wedded to the name , are you ? '
' No , we just picked it so we could stop discussing the name and move on , ' I said .
' Oh , good , ' Paul says , and moves on .
As is no doubt the case with many startups , a replacement was never found for the original stopgap name .
But Graham must have eventually warmed up to the sound of " Infogami , " as he wrote about it approvingly in a post about what makes a good startup name :
Infogami is a pretty decent name too .
Aaron already had that when we first met him .
It can't conveniently be used as a verb , but it looks and sounds good , and has the advantage that it can naturally expand to cover whatever this software evolves into .
Graham observes that nowadays " cool " startups tend to inhabit " decidedly marginal name space " by using peculiar , less - than - obvious domain names .
He compares it to " when fashionable people started living in lofts in industrial neighborhoods , " where " the features that initially repelled people , like rough concrete walls , have now become a badge of coolness . "
One example Graham gives of a weird - therefore - cool domain name is Flickr , though as we 've seen the substitution of " - er " with " - r " is rapidly losing its cachet of hipness as a flock of Web developers follow Flickr 's lead ( much as the industrial lofts in Brooklyn 's Williamsburg neighborhood are nowhere near as hip as they were a decade ago ) .
So the use of unusual cran-morphs like - dango for " Jobdango " or - gami for " Infogami " is evidently another route into fashionably offbeat name space .
The danger , though , is in deploying a cran - morph that is so unusual that it lacks semantic transparency .
Though the - gami ending was striking enough for bloggers to recognize the metaphor of " Web Origami , " Mike Pope was n't the only one to be a bit baffled by what that metaphor was supposed to indicate .
As a contributor to the Joel on Software discussion group wondered soon after the startup name leaked out , " Infogami — like origami , except information instead of paper ? "
And a commenter on Paul Graham 's piece about startup names raised a potential cross-linguistic problem :
No biggie , but if you speak Japanese infogami sounds weird , as the " gami " in origami just means paper ( kami ) .
The " ori " part means fold .
So infogami sounds like info - paper , not info - folding as I imagine was the intention .
That could conceivably be an issue if Infogami makes it big in Japan , but it 's not something that would trouble Anglophones .
One significant aspect of cran-morphing is that it completely reanalyzes a segment , regardless of what semantic content the segment may have had earlier in its history , whether in English or another originating language .
Cheeseburgers and turkeyburgers do n't have anything to do with the inhabitants of a burg , just as Monicagate and Plamegate do n't have anything to do with gates .
Another possible source of confusion is pronunciation .
The connection to origami implies that the name should be pronounced as [ ˌɪnfoˈgɑmi ] after the typical English pronunciation of [ ˌɔrə ˈgɑmi ] .
But Trevor Blackwell was first tempted to pronounce the name as [ ɪnˈfɑgəmi ] , influenced by similarly stressed forms ending in - gamy like monogamy [ məˈnɑgəmi ] .
On the other hand , perhaps that pronunciation would provide an extra semantic boost : you can choose to read it as either ' the folding of information ' or ' the marriage of information ' !
[ Update # 1 : Sean Palmer emails to say that Steve Ivy was the first to come up with the name " Infogami , " back in March 2002 .
Also , I was remiss in giving examples demonstrating that - gami had risen to the level of a crantacular combining form .
A quick Web search finds plenty of examples of X - gami meaning " ( the art of ) folding X , " such as card - i - gami , diaper - gami , pornogami , penis - gami ( yikes ) , moneygami , and so forth . ]
[ Update # 2 : Dan Brown sends along another example of X - gami : baby - gami .
( Fortunately this entails wrapping , not folding , babies . ) ]

The Asiatic cheetah lives on the edge ( Image : I.R. Iran DOE / CACP / WCS / UNDP-GEF )

This remarkable image of Asiatic cheetahs was captured by automatic equipment in an isolated region of Iran 's Dar-e Anjir Wildlife Refuge .
The picture shows mum and her four youngsters resting in the shade of a tree .
It is quite a catch as the big cat is now extremely rare .
Once ranging from the Red Sea to India , the Asiatic cheetah today numbers fewer than 60 animals on the entire Asian continent , mostly on Iran 's arid central plateau .
" As a species the cheetah is still in dire straits in Iran , so it is extremely encouraging to see an apparently healthy family in their native habitat , " said Dr Peter Zahler , from the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , which has been working with Iranian biologists to survey the cats since 2001 .
" Images like these give hope to conservationists that there is still time to save these magnificent animals . "
Automatic cameras have become a useful conservation tool ( Image : I.R. Iran DOE / CACP / WCS / UNDP-GEF )

The group found a variety of suitable habitats , but also discovered that prey species , such as jebeer gazelle and urial sheep , were scarce .
The latest photographs hint at the gradual recovery of prey populations .
" Cheetahs in Iran live on a knife - edge in very marginal habitat , " said Dr Luke Hunter , coordinator of WCS 's Global Carnivore Program .
" The fact that this female has managed to raise four cubs to six months of age is extremely encouraging .
" Hopefully , this indicates there are areas where the cheetah 's prey species are coming back , a goal the Iranian Department of Environment and UNDP has been working very hard to achieve . "
From a Software User 's Perspective
Bloat
Why is it that Microsoft 's products keep mushrooming in size with each new release always requiring significantly more disk space and more processing power than the last time ?
They might claim it 's because of all the new features they add each time , but that 's only half the story .
The new features and the increased processing requirements are designed to fuel the process of perpetual upgrades .
This is Microsoft 's way of rubbing Intel 's back so that Intel will give Microsoft preferential treatment when it comes out with new chip specs .
It 's also Microsoft 's way of convincing consumers that their newer product versions are better because they are so much bigger .
Their new features are often superfluous but users must still deal with the overhead required by the features even though most will never use the features .
CNN has a good article which explains why bloat is such a bad thing .
Unneeded features make products more cumbersome to use and the addition of new features often sacrifices the performance ( and sometimes the integrity ) of older features .
Why not stick with an older version of the product then ?
Two reasons : 1 ) you only get customer support if you stay current and 2 ) if you need to work with other people using the same program older versions are often incompatible with newer versions , so if anybody is using the newest version then everybody must upgrade .
" The Bloatware Debate " is a technical discussion of how two separate people dissected one particular Microsoft program and found out , to their shock , that it was over 2,000 % larger than it should have been .
It would appear from this discussion that the cumbersome size of Microsoft programs is due not only to the continually growing clutter of useless features but it is also due to careless programming ( perhaps to an even larger degree ) .
Did you realize 486's are still usable machines if you 're running something other than Microsoft 's latest software ?
For instance , Linux worked great on 486's back when they were the top of the line and amazingly enough it did n't stop working on them once the Pentiums came out .
Yes , Linux has evolved since then to take advantage of more powerful computers , but the latest version of Linux will still work well on older equipment .
There are also plenty of other operating systems that work equally well on machines that Microsoft has abandoned support for .
Do n't let your old equipment gather dust - older machines make great IP Masquerading routers ( which allow you to connect multiple computers to the internet at once using only one phone line or cable modem ) or great machines for checking email and chatting online .
If you can't use your older equipment yourself , rest assured that somebody out there ( such as your local school ) could put it to very good use .
Do n't write it off because Windows does n't run on it .
Backward Incompatibility
Also contributing to Microsoft 's goal of putting everybody on a perpetual upgrade cycle is the backward incompatibility in Microsoft 's products .
Once a small number of users adopt a new version of a Microsoft product all other users are pressured to upgrade lest they are unable to interact with files produced by the newer program .
Dan Martinez summed up the situation created with the incompatibility in subsequent versions of Word when he said " while we 're on the subject of file formats , let 's pause for a moment in frank admiration of the way in which Microsoft brazenly built backward - incompatibility into its product .
By initially making it virtually impossible to maintain a heterogenous environment of Word 95 and Word 97 systems , Microsoft offered its customers that most eloquent of arguments for upgrading : the delicate sound of a revolver being cocked somewhere just out of sight . " ( cited from the quote file )
For a more detailed lament of how Microsoft likes to pressure its customers to keep buying the same product over and over by using backward incompatibility , see Zeid Nasser 's page on ' Forced upgrading , ' in the World of Word .
For a more detailed lament of how Microsoft likes to pressure its customers to keep buying the same product over and over by using backward incompatibility , see Zeid Nasser 's page on ' Forced upgrading , ' in the World of Word .
Microsoft freely admits to building software that is incompatible with previous versions of the same product , though this is typically spun as being a trivial , harmless issue .
However , in an incredibly rare display of honesty , Microsoft has published on its very own website an article which calls the backward incompatibility in certain versions of Internet Explorer as being a " horrible drain " on companies .
( The article does n't deride Internet Explorer by name , but it 's clear that the browsers it refers to are Internet Explorer and Netscape . )
Interestingly , this article also serves as an equally rare full admission of guilt that Microsoft makes a practice of releasing incredibly bug - ridden software .
The author is very harsh on what was released as the production version of Internet Explorer and also strongly alludes that software at Microsoft is frequently shipped under strong protests from its developers as to its lack of fitness .
Do n't expect this article to stay on the Microsoft website for long now that we are linking to it - read it while you still can .
If it is no longer available by the time you get to it , you can search for it under the title of " When Is Software Ready ?
Ship It Anyway ! " by author Victor Stone , dated March 29 , 1999 .

Perpetual Upgrading
It 's pretty obvious why the concept of perpetually upgrading is a bad idea for consumers .
Perpetual upgrading encourages Microsoft to ship bug ridden products because they can always charge for the upgrade after the bugs are fixed .
Case in point , Windows 98 was essentially a bug fix for Windows 95 but those who paid for Windows 95 still had to pay for what should have worked right the first time they bought it .
Upgrading also takes valuable time , especially if something goes wrong and troubleshooting is required .
Upgrades from Microsoft are typically installed not because the customer wants to do something with the new version of the product that was n't possible with the previous version , but rather because Microsoft has abandoned the older version of the product or has designed the new version such that it is incompatible with the old version ( unnecessarily in many cases ) and therefore requires upgrading in order to interoperate with copies installed by friends or colleagues and with new computers .
When Netscape was the dominant web browser , Microsoft made a huge push to get people and organizations to move to Internet Explorer .
How did Microsoft reward its customers that made the effort to switch ?
It released subsequent versions of Internet Explorer and related products which encouraged web publishers to write web pages that would only work with the latest versions of Internet Explorer .
It only took a few short years for the main page of Microsoft 's own website , http://www.microsoft.com/ , to stop working properly with the early versions of Internet Explorer which it pushed an unprecedented amount to get people to install .

Microsoft also left these same people that helped Internet Explorer gain the majority market share in the lurch by providing delinquent support for Internet Explorer 5.0 shortly after its release .
Internet Explorer 5.01 SP2 was released in June 19 , 2001 .
In December 13 , 2001 when Microsoft released a critical security upgrade for Internet Explorer , only versions 5.5 and higher were supported ( a patch was finally issued for IE 5.01 nearly 2 months later on February 11 , 2002 , but as of this writing all early versions of IE appear to have been abandoned as they still have no patches ) .
So customers had a choice to make : stay with the version of Internet Explorer they had already invested the time into deploying and worry ( rightly so ) about having their computers hacked for an unknown amount of time ( which turned out to be a lengthy 2 months ) , or invest more time to upgrade to the latest version again , even though they may have just upgraded 6 months earlier and they may have no need for any new features .
To top it all off , even if they did decide to upgrade , the upgrade was reported to be buggy .

Perpetually upgrading has the obvious cost associated with it of new licenses for the new versions , but there are are many additional hidden costs .
For a good example of how the costs of upgrading can balloon to much more than the obvious licensing costs , read about all the problems that ensued when one company made the decision to upgrade their Microsoft software .
In addition to the costs of the new licenses , newer hardware ended up being required , support problems increased ( and support costs money ) , and there was always the looming cost of losing face with upper management because the next necessitated upgrade to come from Microsoft came so quick on the heels of the first upgrade that it made the initial upgrade appear ill - timed and a pointless cost .
Finally , a good illustration is given of how one upgrade can set off a chain of many other required ( and costly ) upgrades because Microsoft 's software is so " integrated " .
Vaporware
Whenever Microsoft spies yet another potential market which it thinks is ripe for taking over it generally announces its intention to move aggressively into that market .
Microsoft frequently announces new products for these markets that they will ship soon regardless of whether or not they have any genuine interest in actually shipping said products .
What this frequently leads to is that people stop buying software in this market because they want to wait for the Microsoft version .
Unfortunately if Microsoft sees the market drying up they usually just walk away and never deliver their promised products .
The end result is that the small software companies in these markets take a very big hit and frequently go under while consumers end up without their promised product .
Caldera has an excellent description of how Microsoft uses vaporware to " curtail adoption of competitive products by deceiving end users " along with an unfortunate example of how Microsoft 's blatant lies led to consumers forgoing the adoption of a superior , available product in anticipation of Microsoft 's non-existent product ( i.e. , a DOS - less consumer Windows which was not available until over a decade later ) .
Caldera 's entire paper is highly recommended reading .

On October 9 , 1996 Bill Gates gave a speech at Unix Expo Plus .
Unix is typically used within the industry on high - end systems where reliability is key and Microsoft at the time was pushing Windows NT as an alternative for mission critical systems .
In the typical Microsoft style of touting some feature as just around the corner so as to downplay the present differences , Mr. Gates stated that " next year Windows NT will move up to take advantage of that 64 - bit address space " .
Those who fell for that promise had to wait much longer than a year to get the promised support that they gave up by foregoing existing Unix products that had this high performance feature at the time .
It was not until over four and a half years later , on May 29 , 2001 that Microsoft announced an available 64 bit version of Windows ( i.e. , Windows XP 64 - Bit Edition ) .

Hostile treatment of customers
In the past , Microsoft has fueled its amazing growth by leveraging its way into new markets in order to acquire new customers .
The problem that Microsoft has been facing recently is that they have come to dominate so many different markets that there are not enough markets left ( where they can leverage their monopoly power ) that can be captured for the purpose of sustaining the growth that their shareholders require .
Consequently , Microsoft has turned its sights back on its existing customers .
Microsoft is finding creative ways to wring more money out of its existing customers , often times with hostile results .
Now is the time to switch to Microsoft alternatives so that you can escape the Microsoft auditors who can make more stringent demands on you than the IRS ( because you agreed to these demands by accepting Microsoft's EULA , or End User License Agreement ) .
One example of Microsoft 's hostility to its existing customers came in September , 2000 .
Microsoft demanded that the Virginia Beach government account for all copies of Microsoft software that were in use within the government and provide proof of purchase for each product .
The reason ?
" Nick Psyhogeos , a Washington , D.C. - based attorney for Microsoft , said the firm has found that government agencies sometimes inadvertently acquire counterfeit software . "
There was no mention of a reason why this particular city government was singled out - they were not investigated because of something which they did to arouse suspicion , but simply because they were a large organization that Microsoft hoped they could frighten more money out of .
The city was presumed guilty until proven innocent and this cost the tax payers a great deal of money as the city reassigned 25 percent of its technical work force to work specifically on the task of generating the information demanded by Microsoft .

Predatory Practices
Microsoft tends to kill off competition by drawing on resources supplied by its OS monopoly to completely out - spend its competitors , by using its customers ' dependence upon existing products to force new products upon them , or by buying its competitors outright .
Probably the most publicized ( but definitely not the first ) example of Microsoft 's leveraging of their monopoly power to take over new markets is their dealing with Netscape .
Microsoft spent millions of dollars creating a competitor to Netscape 's web browser and then gave away the browser for free in an attempt to drive Netscape out of business .
Not only did Microsoft give its browser away for free but it also spent money on promotions so that people who switched to their browser would get other things for free - Microsoft was essentially paying people to use their web browser .
Microsoft would not have been able to do this if it did not have a monopoly on the OS market and Netscape had no possible business defense on this because you can't make money when you have to pay people to use your products .
To make matters worse for Netscape , Microsoft used their influence with full force to prevent OEMs ( an OEM is a computer maker such as Gateway or Dell ) from putting Netscape on any of the computers they shipped .
Microsoft told OEMs that they could not uninstall Internet Explorer and install Netscape 's Navigator even when customers asked specifically for Netscape or they would lose their Windows licenses .
For OEMs , losing their Windows licenses would essentially put them out of business , so they had no alternative but to submit to Microsoft 's demands .
So , Microsoft used their absolute control over something that OEMs could n't do without ( Windows ) to push a totally unrelated product ( Internet Explorer ) into more places than customers wanted and keep other products ( Netscape Navigator ) out even when that 's what customers wanted and what OEMs wanted to give them .
Finally , Microsoft has a habit of killing off competitors by either buying them or their technologies .
Once again , a good example of this is shown with Microsoft 's foray into the web browser market .
Microsoft was late to catch on to the fact that the web was going to revolutionize the way people used computers and once they finally woke up they were dangerously close to having their Windows monopoly destroyed by the greatly reduced importance of operating systems that a web based paradigm would produce .
They needed to do something fast .
They allegedly tried to carve up the market with Netscape by getting Netscape to agree to stop making Windows web browsers while Microsoft would only make Windows web browsers .
Fortunately for consumers , Netscape did not agree to the deal and the web was saved from becoming a Microsoft only technology as surely would have happened .
But this made it even more urgent for Microsoft that they reign in this new market right away while it was still time .
Lacking any decent technology of their own , Microsoft licensed the Mosaic web browser from Spyglass which they turned into Internet Explorer .
So the weapon that Microsoft fashioned in their attempt to defeat Netscape was n't even their own , but technology they bought from someone else .
This was not a one time thing , but a recurring habit of reaping the rewards for other peoples ' work which started way back in the beginning when Bill Gates bought DOS ( no , Microsoft did n't even create the product that was the seed for their entire monopoly ) .
At the time of its publication , " The ( Nearly ) Whole Microsoft Catalog " was a fairly complete list of all the companies and products that Microsoft has swallowed with its ever increasing appetite for total market domination .

Yes , Microsoft royally screwed over Spyglass by licensing their code and then turning around and giving it away for free .
This obviously made it a lot more difficult for Spyglass to sell other licenses since their potential customers could just embed Internet Explorer for free .
Not only did Microsoft destroy Spyglass ' existing market , but Spyglass also accused Microsoft of not paying the required royalties on the code that they licensed .
Spyglass has since been relegated to a niche market , and it is interesting to note that they do n't even mention Internet Explorer as one of their accomplishments in their showcase .

Microsoft forced major internet web site operators to agree not to promote Netscape Navigator and to forego any business relations with Netscape if they wanted featured placement on the Windows desktop .
Yes , you read that correctly - Microsoft did n't just ask for preferential placement of it's own products , it demanded that its competitor 's products not be promoted at all .
So the next time you hear Microsoft say that they are for consumer choice be aware that they are lying through their teeth .

Why do n't you see any computer vendors offering to sell computers that have Windows and some other operating system installed ( this is referred to as a dual - boot system ) ?
Considering that many non-Windows operating systems , such as Linux , are free and have excellent , free tools that would be useful to certain types of people ( for example , engineering students ) , you would think that many OEM's would jump at this chance to differentiate the computers they offer .
However , the fact of the matter is that they can't because the contract that they have which Microsoft allegedly forbids them from offering a non-Windows operating system as a boot option .

In November of 1998 Blue Mountain Arts , a company which allows people to send electronic greeting cards , discovered that two separate Microsoft products , WebTV and Outlook Express ( which is part of Internet Explorer ) , had recently begun to automatically delete greeting cards from Blue Mountain Arts .
Blue Mountain
Arts was an established company in the market for electronic greeting cards and , not surprisingly , at the time that their cards started being automatically deleted by Microsoft products , Microsoft was just beginning the process of entering the same market with their own electronic greeting cards service .
Using their tried and tested tactics , Microsoft used their existing products in unrelated markets ( WebTV and Outlook Express ) to make it look like the competition in the new market was broken , thereby making Microsoft 's own greeting card offering appear more reliable .
Blue Mountain Arts sued Microsoft because of this and the judge acknowledged the predatory nature of Microsoft 's actions by granting a preliminary injunction against Microsoft .

Bundling of inferior products
In a desperate attempt to try and kill Netscape , Microsoft " integrated " its browser into its OS ( well , not really , but that 's what they claim in order to get the US DOJ off their back ) .
What this meant for Microsoft was that they got to keep their monopoly for a little bit longer , but it had much more dire consequences for consumers .
It meant that consumers were now stuck with a very buggy browser and file system viewer because Internet Explorer was such a rush job .
The buggy browser would n't have been too terrible since most people were still smart enough to use Netscape anyway , but Microsoft replaced the standard Explorer ( the file system viewer ) with IE which left users nowhere to hide from the bugs .
If you use Internet Explorer today , be aware that for a significant period after it was introduced it was very unstable and clearly inferior to the competition , but if you wanted to use Windows you had to use IE anyway because it was made a core part of the system ( i.e. , the file viewer ) .
The lesson to be learned is that by using Microsoft products you are putting yourself at the mercy of having pieces of your system which work relatively reliably ( by Microsoft standards ) ripped out from under you and replaced by something broken and inferior every time they find a new competitor they want to kill .
The January 16 , 2000 edition of the Daily Wrap and Flow gives a good summary of major Microsoft components which were bundled with Windows in order to kill competition and which were clearly inferior at the time of their bundling .
Specifically listed are GUIs ( in response to Quarterdeck ) , DOS ( bundling practically killed DrDos ) , disk compression ( used against Stac ) , networking ( used to thwart Lantastic , Novell and others ) , Java ( in an attempt to wrestle the language from Sun Microsystems ) and Internet Explorer ( extremely aggressively bundled so as to obliterate Netscape ) .

Bugs , bugs , and more bugs
Did I mention that Microsoft 's products tend to be full of bugs ?
I 'm sure you know this if you 've used any Microsoft products to any great extent .
It 's pretty sad that people have accepted things like rebooting daily because the OS crashed as a part of computing , but that 's probably because they have n't seen the alternatives .
System administrators who have had experience with other operating systems know that Windows is a nightmare to maintain .
For a taste of what these people must suffer through read this insightful usenet posting by one frustrated sys admin .
He describes some inexplicable problems that crop up in Windows and the vastly inadequate support that Microsoft provides when they arise .
Especially interesting to note is the catch - 22 that Microsoft puts its users in by refusing to give technical support when the user follows the instructions in Microsoft 's own " knowledge base " .
Despite Microsoft 's persistent efforts to portray their products as reliable and free from bugs that are worth caring about , their own internal documentation suggests that the story is quite different in reality .
In a very rare moment of openness and honesty , Microsoft has published on its own website an article which serves as a full admission of guilt that Microsoft makes a practice of releasing incredibly bug - ridden software and that this has adversely affected customers in a " horrible " way .
The author is very harsh on what was released as the production version of Internet Explorer and also strongly alludes that software at Microsoft is frequently shipped under strong protests from its developers as to its lack of fitness .
( Although they are not mentioned by name , it is clear that the browsers the article refers to are Internet Explorer and Netscape . )

Insecurity
Microsoft 's products are notorious for their security holes .
Security holes in Internet Explorer and Windows NT have been widely publicized and are now accepted as a common occurrence when announced .
The public has become largely desensitized to new security holes which is unfortunate because it means that a widespread attack on users ' systems is not only possible but quite easy .
If it 's not such a big deal for you that security is n't a top priority for Microsoft because you do n't keep sensitive information on your computer , think again - if your computer is taken over it could easily be used for such devious tasks as trafficking child pornography , trafficking pirated software , or emailing death threats to the president .
What 's worse is that any such activity would point to your computer and you would have no way of proving that somebody else did it because Windows does not keep logs .
With its .NET strategy , Microsoft is essentially attempting to transform itself from a consumer software company into a bank .
They want to hold all of your personal information and charge you every time it is used ( you will be charged indirectly through the merchant you purchase goods from in a way similar to how merchants must pay the credit card companies each time you make a credit card transaction ) .
This is going to make a bad situation even worse if Microsoft maintains its track record for insecurity .
While the consequences of using insecure consumer software are bad , the consequences of using insecure software that manages your financial and personal information are much , much worse .
This reason alone should be more than enough to avoid Microsoft 's products as their intention is to have .NET permeate everything they release which means that a security problem in an obscure part of .NET could leave all of your software vulnerable even if you are careful about avoiding .NET features .
This News.com article does an excellent job of explaining the root of a lot of Microsoft 's security problems and why there are so many security problems .
The basic idea is that old code at Microsoft is continually retro-fitted for uses other than what it was originally designed for and as a result problems which were originally annoyances and harmless bugs become gaping security holes .
In particular , Microsoft 's retro-fitting of all its legacy code to work with the internet opened up a proverbial Pandora 's box of problems .
Microsoft 's problems with .NET started to show through at a very early stage .
Hotmail users got a surprise in November 2 , 2001 when they learned that simply reading their email left their financial data " wide open " and easy to capture .
While experts said that the particular exploit that was used was easy to fix , it nonetheless was the result of a " inherent flaws " that would be a " pretty complex task " to fix .

On August 5 , 2002 , a gaping hole in Internet Explorer 's security was announced - Microsoft 's implementation of SSL was broken .
What this meant in plain English was that if you were using websites such as banks , brokerages , and stores which protected their communications with your web browser in order to keep things like your bank account and credit card number safe , the protection was compromised and your sensitive information was left unsafe for unscrupulous people to steal .
As a side note , the same bug was found in the open source Konqueror web browser and even though Konqueror was maintained by volunteers rather than a multi-billion dollar corporation , it was fixed drastically faster than Internet Explorer .

In the summer of 2001 , a worm named Code Red began to wreak havoc on the internet .
The worm would infect a computer by exploiting a security vulnerability in Microsoft 's IIS webserver software .
It would then use the infected host to aggressively search for other web servers to infect .
It did not take long for the worm to reach critical mass and put a strain on the internet because so many infected machines were bombarding other machines looking for new hosts to infect .
The damage done led some to call the Code Red strain of virii the " Most Expensive in History of Internet " with damage estimates in the the billions .

From a Technical Perspective
Closed " standards "
It is commonly known that Microsoft 's applications are given an unnatural performance advantage on Windows because they take advantage of secret APIs which give them the extra speed they need .
It 's rather disturbing that Microsoft can't compete on a level playing field and feels the need to tip the field because they own it .
What 's even more disturbing is that they are willing to sacrifice stability and good design principles by " integrating " applications with their OS just to make their applications run faster .
One of Microsoft's " standards " that they keep closely guarded and which gives them tremendous leverage is the format of their " doc " files ( Microsoft Word documents ) .
There is a good write - up of this at Slashdot .
This letter to the editor by Jim Dennis ( search for " Jim Dennis " within the page ) explains how Microsoft uses closed protocols , APIs and file format libraries to maintain its monopoly status and how removal of this advantage would level the playing field .
Mutilation of existing standards
Unfortunately , it 's not enough for Microsoft to make up its own standards which it keeps unpublished .
It also feels the need to hijack existing standards and break them especially if it will help them keep their OS monopoly .
For example , Microsoft felt threatened by the Java standard because it was OS independent so it attempted to twist the standard into something Windows specific , all in the name of giving customers what they want .
News.com has an excellent article on " Microsoft 's holy war on Java " .
Read it and you will marvel at how Microsoft can ever say with a straight face that they do things for the good of their customers .
That article is only the beginning , though .

Whether it was intentional or merely an act of incompetence is unclear , but several Microsoft products were built to output broken HTML ( the language used to create web pages ) .
When viewed with non-Microsoft products , the resulting HTML appears to be filled with grammatical errors .
John Walker gives a good explanation of the situation on his page containing a short program to fix the problem .
Kerberos is a technology created at MIT to make it easy for users to securely prove who they are .
As an example , instead of having to enter a password for every program or web page you want to use , you would enter your password once when you begin your session with the computer and then Kerberos would take care of authenticating you everywhere else so that you do n't have to re-enter your password over and over .
This is a bit of an over - simplification , but suffice is to say that Kerberos is very useful and very well designed .
Kerberos , as with most MIT software projects , was made freely available for anybody to use and integrate into their software .
In typical Microsoft style , Microsoft took the Kerberos standard ( which they got for free , mind you ) , integrated it into Windows and then changed it to be incompatible with Kerberos on every other platform .
If that was n't enough , they refused to freely release details of the changes that they made so that other platforms could be made compatible with their Windows " extensions . "
After much complaining from the tech community , Microsoft eventually released a spec for their changes , but in order to access it you had to agree to a license stating that it was a trade secret ( yes , they wanted to claim trade secret protection on something they had mostly gotten for free from MIT ) !
Some people eventually decided to ignore the license and publish what changes were made anyway , which prompted Microsoft to threaten legal action .
( Note : Microsoft did eventually allow public access to their changes after much outcry .
Nonetheless , their Kerberos implementation still does not allow appropriate interoperability with standard Kerberos software . )

Lack of innovation
It 's disgusting how Microsoft portrays itself as the supreme innovator when just about all the technology that it has was copied off of others ' previous work .
Think about all the major innovations in CS technology and then count how many of them were developed by Microsoft .
I count zero .
This is because Microsoft admittedly does not enter a market until the potential amount of money to be made in it is fairly large .

From the Perspective of Everybody Else
Attempts at taking over appliance markets
When computer chips started popping up in more and more appliances Microsoft could n't bear to see a potential market for software that it did n't control so it threw together something called Windows CE .
What they do n't understand is that people are used to reliable appliances and they wo n't put up with the level of unreliability that accompanies most Microsoft products in their appliances .
I for one absolutely do not want Windows driving my car .
I encourage you to never buy any product which uses Windows CE so that this threat does n't spread .
Attempts at buying the public 's trust
Microsoft 's fierce competitive nature has alienated everybody in the industry to the point where voluntary supporters are virtually nonexistent .
For quite some time Microsoft has resorted to buying public endorsements and there have been documented incidents of Microsoft employees posing as normal software users in public settings without revealing their true identities .
And these are just the incidents that the public has found out about - who knows how many cases have never been exposed for the false endorsements that they actually are ?
So when you see that rare instance of Microsoft support you need to seriously question whether it is genuine .
Microsoft 's 1998 " astroturf " campaign fortunately blew up in its face .
The astroturf campaign was Microsoft 's attempt to create a grassroots movement in its legal battle against the DOJ by paying people to show public support .
It was referred to as astroturf rather than grassroots because the support was completely fake .

MSNBC is also an obvious attempt by Microsoft to buy the good publicity which it does not deserve .
During Microsoft 's 1999 anti-trust trial there were reports of Microsoft encouraging its employees to post messages in public forums stating that " Microsoft is responsible for all good things in computerdom " and that " The government has no right to prevent MS from doing anything .
Period . "
It 's pretty sad when the only people you can get to support you are those that depend upon you for their daily sustenance .
[ Wired Article ] [ Boycott Novell Article ]
The Steve Barkto incident was what opened a lot of people 's eyes to the practice of Microsoft employees mis-representing themselves in public forums .
This is a must read because it offers hard evidence that this practice has in fact taken place at Microsoft .
Outright Deception
The examples of Microsoft 's outright deception are numerous and well documented .
Everybody should be very concerned about this regardless of whether or not you think it directly affects you because it does affect you .
Allowing Microsoft to get away with fudging its way to the top only encourages every other company in existence to do the same while discouraging companies from giving you the whole truth that you need in order to make informed decisions as a consumer and that you have a right to as a member of a civilized society .
This is not even close to an exhaustive list of examples and there will be many more examples added here as we get the time to sift through our news archives .
Common Defenses of Microsoft Debunked
Microsoft 's products are generally not superior .
As an example , Windows is more bloated , much less stable , less secure , much more expensive , and lacking much of the capabilities of Linux , one of its competing operating systems .
The real reason that Microsoft is ahead is that their marketing is superior and because they leverage their existing market share to keep consumers locked into Microsoft specific solutions .
Microsoft should not be punished for its success
Of course it should n't be punished for its success , but it should be punished for using predatory practices to out muscle competition in a way that would not be possible if they did not have their monopoly .
The best way to punish Microsoft is to use the alternatives to their products .
A fringe benefit of using alternatives is that you will generally end up with much better software .

How to give birth the Scientology way
A new arrival is expected in Los Angeles this week : the child of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes .
Reports suggest the babe will be born under the strictures of Scientology , the " religion " practised by Cruise .
But what strictures are they exactly , and do they stop after birth ?
Below we offer a digested guide .
1. According to L Ron Hubbard - founder of Scientology - it is important to stay silent during childbirth .
This is to ensure the avoidance of " engrams ' - impressions formed in the brain because of " physical pain or painful " experiences .
2. Engrams are only relieved through " auditing " - a form of therapy - which is presumably difficult to perform during childbirth .
Morning sickness is an " engram " - causes distress and pain ( well , duh ! )
3. Says Hubbard , in his book Dianetics : " A woman who is pregnant should be given every consideration by a society which has any feeling for its future generations . "
4 . These considerations should apply to those attending a birth .
" Maintain silence in the presence of birth to save both the sanity of the mother and the child .
And the maintaining of silence does not mean a volley of sh's . "
5 . Meanwhile : " Women , you have a right and a reason to demand good treatment . "
6 . He also claims that a great number of midwives and doctors are scientologists themselves .
7 . By the way , life in the womb is not the paradise it has been presented as .
Instead " the womb is wet , uncomfortable and unprotected " .
8 . Even once the child has been born , Scientology can help .
According to Hubbard , emotions are transferred to a child through an electrical wave .
" Therefore anyone who is emotional around a pregnant woman is communicating that emotion straight to the child . "
9 . Childhood illness mostly comes from - you guessed it - engrams .
Prevent this , says Hubbard , by creating a " calm and harmonious atmosphere " for the child .
10 . Furthermore : " Say nothing around a sick child or an injured child .
Smile , appear calm , but say nothing . "
11 . " If she [ the child ] falls , she should be helped - but silently . "
12 . " Drooling sympathy " offered to a child when he is sick or feeling unwell can trigger engrams
13 .
When a young child bounces on a pregnant woman 's lap , her unborn child gets an engram .
14 .
If the husband uses language during sex , " every word is going to be engramic " .
15 . In Scientology , there are those who are prone to engrams and those who are called Clears .
A Clear is a rational person who forms the best solutions he can on the information he has .
16 .
And pray tell how does one become a Clear ?
With " some patience and a little study " , says Hubbard .
Dear Mr. Pollan ,
I am writing to you in the hopes that you can offer some assistance to me regarding a troubling household situation .
My wife has been reading your recent book , The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , and has allowed herself to become carried away with your admittedly persuasive argument about eating more locally and ethically raised food .
At first it was just little stuff , like buying local produce and banning foodstuffs made with high fructose corn syrup .
But then there was the fist - fight at the greenmarket about the sausage that Meg suspected was not humanely made because the woman selling it did not know the names of the pigs that supplied the meat .
“ Just one name , you heartless bitch ! ” she screamed as security escorted her from Union Square .
The restraining order prevents
Meg ’s further presence at the market and I am barely tolerated in her stead .
Lately though , Mr. Pollan , the situation has become much worse .
Meg has completely forsaken her marital duties , turning her evening attentions elsewhere .
It took me a few weeks to discover what she was up to , but she finally admitted to tending a hayfield in an empty lot in Queens .
Oh , did n’t I tell you ?
Meg has purchased a cow .
I do n’t know where this cow is located , but his name is Arthur .
She ’s taking me to meet him before he ’s humanely slaughtered so that , and I quote precisely , “ you know where your food comes from for a change ” .
After the cow news became widely known in our household , Meg turned our extra bedroom into a hay mow , which mow is the subject of our building ’s co-op board meeting next month .
An eighth floor resident complained about the conveyor belt chucking bales into the building ’s alley and the straw situation in the elevator was getting on everyone ’s nerves .
I dare not add to the register of complaints by mentioning my acute hay - fever at this point .
The loss of the bedroom was tolerable , but Meg has also planted a garden that takes up half of our living room .
One day she just took out the hardwood flooring and replacing it with freshly turned soil .
Did you know that you can buy a roto - tiller in Manhattan , Mr. Pollan ?
Well , I do know , and you can definitely buy a roto - tiller at the Home Depot on 23rd Street in Chelsea for a sum close to what your wife might get at a pawn shop for your wristwatch .
So you can see the predicament I ’m in here , Mr. Pollan .
Any advice you can offer to this sneezing , watchless , beleaguered soul would be greatly appreciated .
Yours very sincerely ,
Jason Kottke
P.S. I hope this letter reaches you in a timely manner .
Meg has determined that the USPS uses ethanol - based gasoline in their trucks , so this letter is “ speeding ” its way to you via grass - fed horseback .
Pray for me .
Before anybody asks anything :
I work at a tech support line for MSN users .
Most our customers are reasonable people who genuinely need help .
And then we get calls like this .
This is as true and accurate a transcription as memory will allow .
It just shows how amazingly stupid people can get to be .
Me : Thank you for contacting MSN Technical support .
My name is George and I 'll be your support assistant .
May I please have the telephone number associated with this account ?
Customer : Yes , hello .
I am calling because I can't get in the internet .
Me : Very well , we 'll more than gladly help you with that .

Customer :
You 're kidding me !
My goodness !!
Have you been there long ?
Me : ... uh , Argentina ?
Customer : Yes , what are you , volunteering ?
Me : I live here .
Customer : How'd you get all the way over there ?
Me : Ma'am , I ...
Customer :
You 're american , are n't you ?
Me : No , I 'm not .
Customer : My goodness !!
Well , you have very good English .
Me : Thank you .
Customer :
The other day I called I got this tech support person who had a very heavy Indian accent ...
I could n't understand a WORD of what was being said .
Me : Well , MSN does value diversity ...
Customer : I 'll say !
And now I 'm speaking with an Argentine .
Well , I hope you understand me well , seeing how you 're in another country and all ...

Is somebody asking for my information ?
Who would want my information ?
Me : Hypothetically .
Customer : What ?
Me : Hypothetically speaking .
Customer : Now do n't get all technical on me , I do n't know any of your fancy computer terms .
Me : ...
Okay , ma'am , I need your full name ?
Customer : I 'm Elsie .
Me : First and last name , please .
Customer : Elsie *******.
Do you want my social security number as well !?
Me : No , that 'll be fine .
Thank you for that information , ma'am , is it okay if I call you Elsie ?
Customer : Sure , go ahead .
Me : Elsie , could I please have the e-mail address this account is under ?
Customer : OH , I 've got it written down somewhere ... hold on , let me see here ...
OK , it 's *******@msn.com .
Me : Alrighty .
Thank you for your patience while I gathered that information .
May I please have a brief overview of the reason you 're contacting MSN today ?
Customer : ... But I already TOLD YOU !
I can't get on the Internet !!
Me : ...
Okay , could you be a little bit more specific ?
Customer : Well , what do you wanna know ?
Me : Well , first of all , are you using dialup ?
Customer : The what ?
Me : Dialup .
Customer : ... I 'm sorry , I do n't speak Argentinean .
Me : Do you access the internet using the phone line ?
Customer : No , I use the computer .
Me : ... Do you try signing in using the MSN butterfly ?
Customer : The what ?!
Me : The MSN Butterfly .
Customer : No , the computer , hun , the computer !!
Me : ...
On your desktop , do you see an icon that says " MSN " with a little butterfly ?
Customer : On my desktop ? ...
Let me check ...
No , no butterfly ... why would there be a butterfly on my desktop anyway ?
Me : Okay , let 's go through Programs and search for the MSN software there ...
Customer : I told you to stop it with the fancy computer words !
I do n't have the butterfly !
If I had a butterfly , I would know , OK ?!
Me : ... Alright .
So is it safe to say you do n't have the MSN softw -- program installed ?
Customer : WAIT A MINUTE hold on here ... I PAID for this thing , OK ?
You 're telling me I do n't have the MSN , but I paid for it , do you want me to give you my credit card number so you can check the billing information ?!
Me : No , ma'am , that 'll be fine .
But if you do n't see the MSN butterfly installed I can only assume you do n't have the program installed and you 're using a manual connection .
Customer : I 'm not using a connection .
I told you , I can't get in the internet !!!
God , you foreign people .
Me : Okay , ma'am , so what I 'm gonna do is assist you in the setting up of a manual connection for you to download the MSN Software with , is that okay ?

I believe I lost it .
I believe I yelled .
It was in an empty room , so no animals were harmed in the making of that yell , but still .
I felt frustrated .
And you know what 's really good when you 're feeling frustrated ?
Remembering that you have a newspaper column .
Last year the Ford Motor Co. started to buy ads in several publications aimed at gay readers .
They did so , one presumes , because they realized that gay people buy automobiles , and Ford has , alas , not been selling many automobiles lately .
Then the company got assaulted by the American Family Association , a creation of the Rev. Donald Wildmon , a clever right - wing agitator with a hate - based agenda .
So Ford announced that it would stop advertising in gay publications .
But then , whoops , Ford reversed its reversal and said , never mind , it was going to advertise in gay publications after all .
So then a representative of the AFA announced that it was reinstating its boycott .
" We cannot , and will not , sit by as Ford supports a social agenda aimed at the destruction of the family . "
What a vile sentence .
What a vile sentiment .
What overbusy , underbrained worms these people must be .
I am not yelling .
My older daughter is a lesbian .
She is also the single mother of an adopted child , working to make and sustain a family with jaw - dropping tenacity .
I am a member of that family , but she is the head of it .
The idea that any part of her social agenda involves the destruction of the family is insulting and stupid .
She adopted a child , which means that a child who would not have had a home now has one .
It means that a child who would not have rested safely in a mother 's arms now does so .
These are real family values , not the poison spouted by these thoughtless , gossip - mongering abominations .
Sure , I feel strongly because it's my daughter who 's being smeared , but it ai n't just my daughter .
All over this nation there are gay and lesbian families working hard to make a life for themselves and their children .
I know a few of them .
They could have done it the easy way , stayed in the closet and decided not to endure the hassles of having children , but they did n't .
They wanted a family .
They wanted a lover and companion to share their lives with , and they wanted children to love .
And for this they get insulted by cretins .
The gay and lesbian parents I know are too busy to have an agenda , unless the agenda is " 1. cook dinner , 2 . wash clothes , 3 . find frog . "
They 're doing the usual stuff , teaching manners and insisting on homework and keeping doctor 's appointments and reading bedtime stories .
It 's all very conventional and humdrum ; families with kids often look pretty boring from the outside .
But when you 're in such a family , the last thing you are is bored .
Tired , maybe .
Irritated , occasionally .
Bored , no .
The reality is the mirror image of the stereotype .
The real keepers of the American flame , the real practitioners of daily love and a life of the spirit , are gay and lesbian parents .
They are , gosh darn it , what made this country great .
Someone get a damn fife and drum .
The people who hate America are the members of American Family Association and its ideological fellow travelers .
They 're the ones who do not believe that all people are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights , and that among these rights are life , liberty and pursuit of happiness .
They 're the ones who believe that this country was founded on hate and fear ; they 're the ones who want the hate and fear to continue .
" Where 's Daddy ? "
" He 's out picketing a funeral of a gay veteran . "
" Will he be home in time for the flute recital ? "
" Your father is very busy , dear . "
I mean , render unto me a break .
If your family feels so threatened by my family that you think you have to organize a boycott of a car company , then your family has problems my family can do nothing to solve .
If you think a woman kissing a woman is going to get your daughter hooked on drugs and drive your son into a life of crime -- get home .
Have a pizza .
Talk about stuff .
Go to a ballgame .
That 's what gay and lesbian families do , and it seems to work out fine .
Take a lesson .
And , please , shut the hell up .
Danger : Intemperate language ahead .
If used carefully , this volatile mixture can be handled safely .
If you are a child under 12 , thank you for reading a newspaper , any newspaper .
When Steven Soderbergh releases his next film on January 27 , it will have not only the critics squawking , but Hollywood studio execs , too .
Bubble , an all - digital thriller , is set in an Ohio doll factory , and all of the actors are completely unknown .
But that 's not even the interesting part .
The movie goes out to theaters , DVD , and high - definition cable TV – all on the same day .
It 's an experiment that threatens to uproot the film industry 's long - standing " release window " formula , which staggers a picture 's release on various platforms to maximize profits .
Wired caught up with Soderbergh , director of sex , lies , and videotape , Traffic , and Ocean 's Eleven , while he was in Los Angeles shooting The Good German , with George Clooney and Cate Blanchett .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
WIRED : Why did you decide to release Bubble in all formats at once ?
SODERBERGH : Name any big - title movie that 's come out in the last four years .
It has been available in all formats on the day of release .
It 's called piracy .
Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings , Ocean 's Eleven , and Ocean 's Twelve – I saw them on Canal Street on opening day .
Simultaneous release is already here .
We 're just trying to gain control over it .
So this is a way to combat piracy ?
It can be .
Warner Bros. has talked about going out with low - cost DVDs simultaneously in China because piracy is so huge there .
It will be a while before bigger movies go out in all formats ; in five years , everything will .
Will people keep going to theaters ?
Always .
You 're going to see attendance plateau a bit , but it 's still the number one date destination .
That 's never going away .
Have you been to the movies recently ?
I tried to go to a theater yesterday , but the fire alarm went off .
The theater experience is n't always pleasant .
Theater owners need to address that .
There are often problems with projection ; tickets and concessions are expensive ; theaters are n't always clean ; people talk during the movie .
They 're making it easy for people to stay home .
What 's the reaction in Hollywood to your release experiment ?
People are waiting to see what happens .
A movie that costs only $ 1.6 million does n't have to be a cultural event to turn a profit .
What 's the biggest impact technology is having on filmmaking ?
When the changeover from film to digital happens in theaters in five or 10 years , you 're going to see name filmmakers self - distributing .
Another thing that really excites me : I 'd like to do multiple versions of the same film .
I often do very radical cuts of my own films just to experiment , shake things up , and see if anything comes of it .
I think it would be really interesting to have a movie out in release and then , just a few weeks later say , " Here 's version 2.0 , recut , rescored . "
The other version is still out there – people can see either or both .
For instance , right now I know I could do two very different versions of The Good German .
Have you ever used BitTorrent or other software to download movies ?
No .
I know about it , but I have n't even downloaded music .
I 'm behind the curve .
Should hardware manufacturers be obligated to build copy protection into their devices ?
It 's a tricky question .
I do n't think somebody who creates something should have their rights violated .
Yet we have a culture in which creating something like [ Danger Mouse 's ]
The Grey Album can get you thrown in jail .
That 's sad .
It 's an astonishing , amazing piece of work that should be heard .
Have you thought about making a mash - up ?
I have ideas like that – video mash - ups .
Some of them I 've done privately .
But there 's no way for them to be seen legally .
I wish we could come up with a system that allowed someone to do a Grey Album without having to pay millions of dollars for music rights .
A system in which rights holders share profits of a new piece of work and people can access it without breaking the law .
Give me one idea for a video mash - up .
I was channel surfing the other night and Gus Van Sant 's Psycho was on .
It would be fascinating to do a mash - up of Gus ' version with Hitchcock 's version , because the whole thing with Gus ' version was that he duplicated the original shot by shot .
I 'd watch that !
Yeah !
So right now , I could do that at home and give it to a friend , just as something for them to watch on a Friday night .
But we do n't live in a world where that can be made commercially available .
So it goes underground .
And underground is just a sexier word for illegal .
It 's frustrating .
You shot Bubble with the same kind of high - end digital cinema cameras that George Lucas used for Revenge of the Sith , but the results could n't be more different .
Instead of flashy effects , there 's a stripped - down naturalism .
We wanted to do site - specific films .
You hear that term used for other art forms , but not for cinema .
The writer and I come up with a basic premise , go to a location , and the people fill it up .
We interview people , incorporate their stories , try to make it as organic as possible .
The cameras make that possible .
You can shoot using available light .
I sometimes ran two or three cameras at a time .
In Full Frontal and K Street , I learned to take advantage of the mobility that digital provides .
With Bubble , I wanted to go in the opposite direction and emphasize stillness .
Because there is n't film running through the camera , you get an even more pronounced stillness .
That 's why you do n't see much camera movement in the movie , just a lot of cuts .
With all this technology available , do you think the quality of movies is better today than 30 years ago ?
I think it will be better .
As technology gives filmmakers more freedom , you 'll see them producing work that is more unique , less beholden to the mainstream film template .
That means rethinking the economics .
But I 'm always willing to gamble .
How are you gambling with Bubble ?
There are risks , and then there are risks .
I 'm not working in a coal mine .
Still , everybody involved did it for scale pay , and everyone owns a piece of the profits .
Sounds like the financial model for a startup .
Exactly .
I 'd be thrilled if the model works well enough for me to do that all the time .
Benjamin Franklin : Benjamin Franklin , living in Paris , first conceived the notion of daylight saving time .
He wrote that he was awakened early and was surprised that the sun was up , well before his usual noon rising .
He humorously described how he checked the next two days and found that , yes , it actually did rise so early every day .
Imagine , he said , how many candles could be saved if people awakened earlier , and he whimsically suggested firing cannons in each square at dawn " to wake the sluggards and open their eyes to their true interest . "
William Willett : British builder William Willett was up early for his pre-breakfast horseback ride in 1905 .
He lamented how few people were enjoying the " best part of a summer day " , and he came up with the idea of moving the clocks forward in summer to take advantage of the bright beautiful mornings and to give more light in the evening .
He fought for years to introduce DST in Britain , but died never seeing his idea come to fruition .
COMPUTER viruses , the self - replicating programs that infect workstations and cripple networks , are a hazard to business .
The “ I love you ” worm , which wreaked havoc on May 4th 2000 , spread by sending a copy of itself in an e-mail to everyone in every address book it encountered .
It took just a few mugs in each company to open the attached “ love letter ” to generate thousands upon thousands of messages that overwhelmed systems round the world .
The cost to business was estimated to be $ 10 billion .
The “ I love you ” worm was exceptional , but run -of - the - mill viruses are a constant nuisance .
However , a paper published in this month 's Nature Physics , by Eran Shir of Tel - Aviv University in Israel and his colleagues , has suggested a new way of dealing with them .
A virus spreads by infecting its host , reproducing itself and moving on .
Firewalls and other sorts of anti-virus software — computer programs that attempt to identify , thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious bits of code such as spyware — are one line of defence .
These programs search files for known viruses and monitor what is running for suspicious behaviour .
If a known virus is encountered , it can be stopped .
But new viruses are continually being created .
As soon as a new virus is detected , a second line of defence would be to pass information about it between computers quickly , before they become infected .
And that is what Mr Shir is proposing .
Moreover , the researchers believe it takes a virus to stop a virus .
They would like to propagate the vaccine as an epidemic .
As in the biological world , a big problem with vaccines is that they cannot be created until the virus they seek to stop spreading has emerged .
Vaccines are thus always one step behind .
What Mr Shir and his colleagues outline is a plan to accelerate the spread of a vaccine in a way that allows it to overtake the virus .
Their strategy uses a series of “ honey pots ” .
These pieces of software attract viruses and are employed by anti-virus firms to pick new threats up quickly .
The researchers ' idea is to embed these honey pots within a network so that any virus spreading through the network would be likely to reach them promptly .
The honey pots would then be linked to each other in a separate , overlying network that allowed only vaccines to pass across it .
This separate network would act as a by - pass , enabling the vaccine to overtake the virus and reach uninfected computers first .
A honey pot would automatically identify a new virus , extract its signature and pass this information — the vaccine — to other honey pots using the overlying network .
The honey pots would share this information with other computers on the network .
All uninfected computers would then be able to recognise the new virus as dangerous , and refuse it entry .
The strategy would become more effective as the size of the network grew .
For example , for a network of 50,000 computers , if 0.4 % of them were honey pots , some 5 % of computers would become infected by a virus before they were immunised .
If there were 200,000 computers , the infection rate would fall to about 1 % .
For 200 m computers ( about the number now in America ) , less than a thousandth of a per cent would be infected .

Mr Talabani ( L ) says Iraqi forces are getting stronger
In a news conference in Washington with President George Bush , he said a timed pull - out could encourage terrorism .
But Mr Talabani said he hoped Iraqi forces could take some responsibility from US troops by the end of 2006 .
In an interview with the Washington Post newspaper published on Tuesday , he had seemed to suggest that up to 50,000 US troops could leave this year .
An aide later phoned the newspaper to say the Iraqi president had not meant to imply specific dates .
Continued support
Flanked by US President George W Bush , Mr Talabani said he did not want to do anything without the agreement of the US , as this would demonstrate to insurgents that their resolve had been weakened .
Najaf has already been handed over to Iraq 's security forces
" We will set no timetable for withdrawal .
A timetable will help the terrorists , will encourage them that they could defeat a superpower of the world and Iraqi people , " he said .
" We hope that by the end of 2006 our security forces are up to the level of taking responsibility from many American troops with complete agreement with the Americans . "
Mr Bush said the US would continue to support Iraqi democracy .
" America will stand with the Iraqi people as they move forward with the democratic process , " he said .
" At the same time , American troops will stay on the offensive ...
As Iraqis stand up , Americans will stand down . "
In other developments :
US and Iraqi forces launch an attack on the insurgent stronghold of Haditha capturing one and killing at least four militants , according to the Associated Press news agency
Two Iraqi civilians are killed and seven others injured when a minibus explodes in Hilla , 100 km ( 60 miles ) south of Baghdad
In Baghdad a lorry driver and his assistant are shot dead while trying to deliver concrete walls to fortify polling stations for next month 's referendum on the draft constitution
In a separate incident in Baghdad , five mortar rounds are fired , two of which land in the Green Zone , although they are not reported to have caused any injuries .
Najaf transfer
The US currently has about 140,000 troops stationed in Iraq .
Despite sliding public support for the US presence in Iraq , Mr Bush has refused to set a schedule for a withdrawal .
He has repeated the message that the US must stay the course .
The US has been training home - grown Iraqi troops to take over from their forces to allow a phased withdrawal .
However , many observers say that the Iraqi forces are still far from capable of dealing with the ongoing insurgency .
Earlier this month the US officially handed over military control of the southern city of Najaf to Iraqi forces .
The move was the first of a planned series of security transfers across Iraq , paving the way for an eventual withdrawal of foreign forces .

BBC News , Washington
Some websites exist specifically in order to post gruesome videos
There is no specific policy that bans troops from posting graphic material .
But troops who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan are hearing the message that they should consider carefully what videos they upload to the web .
Sites such as YouTube and Ogrish.com have hundreds or thousands of clips from soldiers , some set to rock music .
At their most graphic , they show the aftermath of suicide bombings and gunfights between coalition forces and insurgents .
Many include troops using foul language .
One soldier who served in Iraq in 2005 told the BBC there was " a tight watch " being kept on video and pictures posted to MySpace , with civilian contractors monitoring the internet on behalf of the Pentagon .
Images ' misused '
The BBC has not been able to confirm that contractors are scouring the internet for inappropriate material from the military .
But US Central Command - which is responsible for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan - does have a team reading blogs and responding to what they consider inaccuracies about the so - called war on terror .
Some troops just want people to know what they have been through
And a longstanding military public affairs officer in Iraq said the Pentagon is also worried about some of the images that are appearing online .
" There 's continuing concern about the use of these videos and stills being used by our enemies to propagate the false notion that our military members are barbaric , warmongers - which is unequivocally not the case .
" And ... many of these videos and photos can harm force protection and operational security measures . "
Ward Carroll is the editor of Military.com , which has a section called Shock and Awe where combat videos are posted .
One of the most popular is called Hostile Demise .
In it , US forces watch what seem to be insurgents depositing weapons in a field , discuss what to do and then get permission from their commander to shoot three people dead and destroy their two vehicles .
" It 's very graphic .
At some level , it 's a view of what happens when you pull the trigger , " Mr Carroll , a former Navy officer , told the BBC .
" It 's sobering , it 's energising , it can be off - putting . "
' War is grotesque '
He said the US Department of Defense would prefer that his website not have such videos .
" The military has an interest in its reputation and its image .
When the popularity of these prurient , violent videos starts to eclipse their ability to control the image , then a concern arises . "
Clamping down is probably a very bad move
Hayden Hewitt ,
Ogrish.com
Military.com exists to celebrate the military , he said , and would never post a video showing dead Americans or innocent bystanders .
" We have had stuff submitted where you could see the aftermath of the explosion .
We ruled that has no value in our mission , " Mr Carroll said .
But such images are precisely the mission of Ogrish.com , according to co-owner Hayden Hewitt .
" There is a distinct misapprehension in the West about what war is like .
They think it 's a gentlemanly thing .
People have forgotten how grotesque war is . "
Mr Hewitt estimated that his website has about 1,000 separate items from Iraq - many more from insurgent websites than from coalition forces .
He said he did not know how many coalition troops had posted video to his site .
But he said it was clear to him why they did so : " Some people do n't want infamy or fame .
They just want people to know what they have been through . "
And he said no policy would stop service members from posting material online if they were determined to do so .
" Clamping down is probably a very bad move , " he said .
One soldier who posted a video summarising his tour of duty in Afghanistan agreed .
" I do n't remember them telling me not to post anything but I 'm pretty sure I 'm not supposed to , " said the veteran , who asked to be identified only as Mike .
" But I posted it when I got out of the military .
I 'm not sure if I would have posted it or not if they told me not to . "
Parents climb through an overgrown garden to make their deliveries
Students at Rawmarsh Comprehensive are not allowed out of the grounds at lunchtime , so some parents are taking their orders for the chip shop instead .
They say pupils are not being given enough time or choice for their meals .
But the school said it aimed to provide good quality food that helped pupils to concentrate in the afternoons .
Julie Critchlow is one of the parents who delivers pupils ' orders from the grounds of a neighbouring cemetery in Rotherham while the school gates are locked .
" The children are n't eating what the school provide in the cafeteria because they do n't like the quality of the food , " she said .
By the time the children have queued to get their lunch they have n't time to eat it
Parent Julie Critchlow
" They prefer to come to us to have their food delivered fresh and hot , which is what they 're asking for .
We 're giving them what they 're asking for . "
The move is being seen as a backlash against TV chef Jamie Oliver 's campaign for healthy school dinners .
But Ms Critchlow insisted it was not just about promoting junk food as they had several orders for jacket potatoes and salad sandwiches alongside those for burgers and fish and chips .
She said their actions had been prompted by the school 's new half hour meal breaks , as pupils did not have long enough to eat .
" They 're like caged animals at the moment , " she said .
" By the time the children have queued to get their lunch they have n't time to eat it . "
From this term , pupils have been given two half hour breaks instead of the previous 15 and 45 minutes .
Parents say they have orders for salad rolls as well as burgers
Head teacher John Lambert said reorganising the school day and keeping pupils on site during breaks had already shown its benefits .
" Our motives are about effective education , " he said .
" Afternoon lateness has dropped to virtually zero and we know they are learning better in the afternoons . "
He said he understood some pupils would resist the changes but believed that parents taking orders at the gates was undermining the school and their children 's education .
" We aim to provide good quality food which is within government healthy eating guidelines and helps the children 's learning in the afternoon , " he said .
" The food that these parents are handing out is not part of a healthy eating diet and on top of that I have to question the morality of delivering it from the grounds of a cemetery .
" I just do n't think it 's helping their children and I do n't think it 's helping their children 's school . "
A meeting is due to be held between parents and staff next week to try to resolve the matter .
BAGHDAD , Iraq , July 18 —
An average of more than 100 civilians per day were killed in Iraq last month , the highest monthly tally of violent deaths since the fall of Baghdad , the United Nations reported today .
The death toll , drawn from Iraqi government agencies , was the most precise measurement of civilian deaths provided by any government organization since the invasion and represented a dramatic increase over daily media reports .
United Nations officials also said that the number of violent deaths had been steadily increasing since at least last summer .
In the first six months of this year , the civilian death toll jumped more than 77 percent , from 1,778 in January to 3,149 in June , the organization said .
This sharp upward trend reflected the dire security situation in Iraq as sectarian violence has worsened and Iraqi and American government forces have been powerless to stop it .
Code as Design : Three Essays by Jack W. Reeves
PDF of All 3 Essays | Discussion Page
The following essays by Jack W. Reeves offer three perspectives on a single theme , namely that programming is fundamentally a design activity and that the only final and true representation of " the design " is the source code itself .
This simple assertion gives rise to a rich discussion — one which Reeves explores fully in these three essays .
What Is Software Design ?
Read Online | Printable Version
The first essay , " What Is Software Design ? , " was first published in the Fall 1992 issue of the now defunct C++ Journal .
After a period of obscurity , in recent years the essay has entered the flow of ideas and discussion in the software development community at large , largely due to its exposure on the web and in Robert Martin 's book Agile Software Development : Principles , Patterns , and Practices .
The essay is published here in its entirety and in its original form .
What Is Software Design : 13 Years Later Read Online | Printable Version
The second essay , " What Is Software Design : 13 Years Later , " is the author ’s first writing on the subject of " code as design " since 1992 .
Over the years Reeves has followed the discussion that grew from the original essay , and here for the first time he responds to the most common arguments he has encountered .
In the course of this task , Reeves also considers certain ideas from the original essay in light of more current trends and techniques .
Letter to the Editor Read Online | Printable Version
The third essay , titled simply " Letter to the Editor , " is the original letter written by Jack W. Reeves to C++ Journal .
The letter is published here for the first time .
It stands as a rewarding essay in its own right , giving first written expression to the themes and ideas found in " What is Software Design ? "
In some aspects it is even more comprehensive and spirited than the essay it inspired .
In the thirteen years since their original publication , these ideas — even today still fresh , challenging , and controversial — have taken hold ( in different ways and to differing degrees ) as key concepts underlying new , increasingly popular techniques and schools of thought such as Agile and craft - based methodologies ; test - first design and test - driven development ; and refactoring .

PRINCE KLEMENS VON METTERNICH , foreign minister of the Austrian Empire during the Napoleonic era and its aftermath , would have no trouble recognising Google .
To him , the world 's most popular web - search engine would closely resemble the Napoleonic France that in his youth humiliated Austria and Europe 's other powers .
Its rivals — Yahoo ! , the largest of the traditional web gateways , eBay , the biggest online auction and trading site , and Microsoft , a software empire that owns MSN , a struggling web portal — would look a lot like Russia , Prussia , and Austria .
Metternich responded by forging an alliance among those three monarchies to create a “ balance of power ” against France .
Google 's enemies , he might say , ought now to do the same thing .
Google announced two new conquests on August 7th .
It struck a deal with Viacom , an “ old ” media firm , under which it will syndicate video clips from Viacom brands such as MTV and Nickelodeon to other websites , and integrate advertisements into them .
This makes
Google the clear leader in the fledgling but promising market for web - video advertising .
It also announced a deal with News Corporation , another media giant , under which it will provide all the search and text - advertising technology on News Corporation 's websites , including MySpace , an enormously popular social - networking site .
These are hard blows for Yahoo ! and MSN , which had also been negotiating with News Corporation .
Both firms have been losing market share in web search to Google over the past year — Google now has half the market .
They have also fallen further behind in their advertising technologies and networks , so that both make less money than Google does from the same number of searches .
Safa Rashtchy , an analyst at Piper Jaffray , a securities firm , estimates that for every advertising dollar that Google makes on a search query , Yahoo ! makes only 60 - 70 cents .
Last month Yahoo !
said that a new advertising algorithm that it had designed to close the gap in profitability will be delayed , and its share price fell by 22 % , its biggest - ever one - day drop .
MSN is further behind Google than Yahoo ! in search , and its parent , Microsoft , faces an even more fundamental threat from the expansionist new power .
Many of Google 's new ventures beyond web search enable users to do things free of charge through their web browsers that they now do using Microsoft software on their personal computers .
Google offers a rudimentary but free online word processor and spreadsheet , for instance .
The smaller eBay , on the other hand , might in one sense claim Google as an ally .
Google 's search results send a lot of traffic to eBay 's auction site , and eBay is one of the biggest advertisers on Google 's network .
But the relationship is imbalanced .
An influential recent study from Berkeley 's Haas School of Business estimated that about 12 % of eBay 's revenues come indirectly from Google , whereas Google gets only 3 % of its revenues from eBay .
Worst of all for eBay , Google is starting to undercut its core business .
Sellers are setting up their own websites and buying text advertisements from Google , and buyers are using its search rather than eBay to connect with sellers directly .
As a result , “ eBay would be wise to strike a deep partnership with Yahoo ! or Microsoft in order to regain a balance of power in the industry , ” said the study 's authors , Julien Decot and Steve Lee , sounding like diplomats at the Congress of Vienna in 1814 .
The alliances are already being struck .
Last year Yahoo ! and Microsoft announced that they would connect their instant - messaging systems — both of which are much more popular than Google 's alternative — and in July they said that they would extend this co-operation to “ voice chat ” ( formerly known as “ calling ” ) .
In May , Yahoo ! and eBay struck an alliance in which eBay will use technology from Yahoo ! to place advertisements on its auction site .
On the other side of the bargain , Yahoo ! will use PayPal , eBay 's online payment mechanism , for transactions from Yahoo ! 's pages .
( Google recently launched a rival payment system of its own . )
The strongest alliance , of course , would be a merger or takeover .
MSN and Yahoo !
both wanted to buy some or all of AOL , a big , troubled internet - access company owned by Time Warner , a media conglomerate .
But Google pre-empted its rivals last winter and bought a defensive stake in AOL .
It still has its search and advertising technology stationed on AOL 's site .
Google may also make its instant - messaging service interoperable with AOL's , the most popular in the world .
Ally or annex ?
With AOL lost to the enemy , what of a deal between Microsoft and either Yahoo ! or eBay ?
Justin Post , an analyst at Merrill Lynch , said recently that Microsoft's “ acquisition probability ” is now so high that it may soon start pushing up the share prices of eBay and Yahoo !
Mr Post thinks that Microsoft is most likely to bid for Yahoo !
This would help Microsoft strategically , he says .
Others are not sure .
“ I do n't see it as a terribly good merger , ” says Mr Rashtchy .
There would be big cultural differences between a media company and a software firm .
He thinks that a merger of Yahoo ! and eBay , on the other hand , might make sense because both live mainly from serving online communities .
Paul Saffo , a Silicon Valley analyst and a fellow of the Institute for the Future , a research group , thinks that any merger between the three middle powers would be a “ grand dramatic gesture ” that would only hasten their decline .
AOL 's merger with Time Warner in 2000 is the relevant warning from recent history .
Big mergers also run counter to a number of other trends on the internet today , which are collectively known as “ Web 2.0 ” .
“ This is the age of mash - ups not mergers , open over closed , ” says Mr Saffo , referring to the open internet standards that allow users to combine , or “ mash ” services .
Another argument against full - blown mergers is that the bigger and more self - absorbed the established powers become , the less likely they are to spot new insurgencies — start - ups such as YouTube , an online video site , for instance , or MySpace .
Their equivalents in Prince Metternich 's day were the nationalist and liberal movements that troubled the continental monarchies , and erupted in the revolutions of 1848 — forcing Metternich to resign and flee into exile in Britain .

So colourful and exotic is the list of substances that have been claimed to heighten sexual appetite that it is hard not to feel a twinge of disappointment on first beholding the latest entry - a small , white plastic nasal inhaler containing an odourless , colourless synthetic chemical called PT - 141 .
Plain as it is , however , there is one thing that distinguishes PT - 141 from the 4,000 years ' worth of recorded medicinal aphrodisiacs that precede it : this one actually works .
And it could reach the market in as little as three years .
The full range of possible risks and side effects has yet to be determined , but already this much is known : a dose of PT - 141 results , in most cases , in a stirring in the loins in as little as 15 minutes .
Women , according to one set of results , feel ' genital warmth , tingling and throbbing ' , not to mention ' a strong desire to have sex ' .
Among men who have been tested with the drug more extensively , the data set is richer : ' With PT - 141 , you feel good , ' reported anonymous patient 007 : ' not only sexually aroused , you feel younger and more energetic . '
According to another patient , ' It helped the libido .
So you have the urge and the desire ...'
Tales of pharmaceutically induced sexual prowess among 58 - year - olds are common enough in the age of the Little Blue Pill , but they do n't typically involve quite so urgent a repertoire .
Or , as patient 128 put it : ' My wife knows .
She can tell the difference between Viagra and PT - 141 . '
The precise mechanisms by which PT - 141 does its job remain unclear , but the rough idea is this : where Viagra acts on the circulatory system , helping blood flow into the penis , PT - 141 goes to the brain itself .
' It 's not merely allowing a sexual response to take place more easily , ' explains Michael A Perelman , co-director of the Human Sexuality Program at New York Presbyterian Hospital and a sexual - medicine adviser on the PT - 141 trials .
' It may be having an effect , literally , on how we think and feel . '
Palatin Technologies , the New Jersey - based maker of PT - 141 , has hopes of its own .
Once the company gets Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval for the drug , Palatin plans to market it to the same people targeted by Viagra : male erectile - dysfunction patients .
Approval as a treatment for female sexual dysfunction may follow .
In the wake of Pfizer 's failed attempts to prove Viagra works for women and amid growing recognition that it also does n't work for large numbers of men , these two markets alone could make PT - 141 a pharmaceutical blockbuster .
But let 's face facts : a drug that makes you not only able but eager and willing is n't going to remain the exclusive property of the severely impaired .
As with Viagra , there will be extensive off - label use of PT - 141 .
Fast - acting and long - lasting , packaged in an easily concealed , single - use nasal inhaler , unaffected by food or alcohol consumption , PT - 141 seems bound to take its place alongside cocaine , poppers and alcohol in the pantheon of club drugs .
But the potential market for PT - 141 is all of us .
Consider the precedent : a little more than four decades ago , it was another drug 's arrival in the marketplace that triggered the sexual revolution .
Before the advent of the birth - control pill , sex and procreation had been eternally , inseparably linked .
After it , the link was pretty much optional .
Momentous things ensued : chiefly women 's liberation and the abortion controversy , all of them arguably the pill 's indirect consequences , all of them reverberating to this day .
And if all that can follow from a drug which simply made pregnancy less a matter of fate than of choice , what then to expect from a drug that does the same thing to passion itself ?
Only when and if PT - 141 reaches the market will we be in a position to even start answering that question .
But , for now , there probably is n't a better way to hone the question than to turn to the rats of the Palatin Technologies research labs .
' In a rat , there 's a mating ritual , ' says Palatin's CEO Carl Spana .
' The female rat will approach the male head - to - head .
She will wiggle her ears , she will wiggle her whiskers , she will nibble at him , and finally she 'll turn and run away . '
If the male chooses not to pursue her , she may return and , as one leading rat sexologist puts it , ' kick him in the face ' .
This tends to do the trick .
The male gives chase , catches the female and climbs on top of her , at which point only two key preparations remain to be completed .
First , so that the female 's low - slung genitalia can be reached from above , her hindquarters will bend upward in a reflexive arching of the back called lordosis .
Second , so that the male may take advantage of this invitation , his penis will emerge from its hiding place under the abdominal fur .
' And then , ' Spana concludes , ' they copulate . '
Spana 's familiarity with the sex life of rats is , of course , no accident : it was the lab rats of Palatin that established the drug 's potential for promoting what 's known in the trade as ' erectogenesis ' .
The experiment , repeated hundreds of times , was a straightforward one .
' You dose and you watch and you count , ' Spana explains .
Every time the penis of a subject rat emerged , observers marked down the event in a notebook .
The subjects , all ' naive ' adults whose last contact with a female was on the day their mothers weaned them , seemed to have had , if anything , slightly less curiosity about their spontaneously generated erections than the researchers .
The typical reaction : ' He notices it 's there , and he grooms it to detumescence , ' says Annette Shadiack , Palatin 's executive director of pre-clinical development .
' And then it happens again . '
The high erection count was good news for Palatin 's management , who were banking on PT - 141 to prove itself an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction .
Two years earlier , and just three years past its start - up , the company had bought the rights to develop a substance called Melanotan II .
Originally isolated by University of Arizona researchers looking for a way to give Caucasians a healthy , sunblocking tan without exposing them to dangerous ultraviolet rays , Melanotan II achieved that and more : it also appeared to facilitate weight loss , increase sexual appetite and act as an anti-inflammatory , too .
Quickly dubbed ' the Barbie drug ' , Melanotan II seemed too good to be true .
In fact , it was too good to be good .
A drug with so many effects , Palatin decided , was not an effectively marketable one .
So Palatin 's researchers set out to isolate the individual effects in the laboratory , experimenting with variations on Melanotan II 's molecular theme .
The compound that became PT - 141 was one of the first variations examined .
The market analysis was encouraging .
As a late entrant in the market for erectile - dysfunction treatments , PT - 141 stood a decent chance of mopping up the floor .
By this stage in Viagra 's life cycle , for instance , it was clear that the drug solved nothing for perhaps 50 per cent of impotent patients , either because their general health was too poor to risk Viagra 's side effects or because it simply did n't work for them .
But existing Viagra users were n't out of play either : PT - 141 had a potential edge not just in ease of use , but in quality of results .
( ' On the five - point scale , ' said patient 041 , ' I would rate the erection I had as a six . ')
And there was a final and especially intriguing possibility : since PT - 141 affects arousal through a different , more brain - centric mechanism than Viagra , might it work for women with sexual dysfunction ?
It was in pursuit of this market that Shadiack approached Concordia University behavioural - neurobiology researcher Jim Pfaus , whose work with sexual response in female rats had caught her attention .
Where the bulk of research into female - rat sexual behaviour has focused on lordosis - that reflexive arching of the lower back that signifies the female is ready - Pfaus has taken what might be called a more feminist approach .
Instead of lordosis 's almost climactic spasm , Pfaus prefers to look at foreplay : the wiggling of ears , kicking of faces , and other acts of solicitation with which female rats reveal their desire to the partner of their choice .
Pfaus discovered that PT - 141 significantly increases the incidence of these behaviours .
He even detected an increase in the rarer phenomenon in which a female rat will throw coyness to the winds and , in a performance worthy of Kim Cattrall , mount the chosen male herself .
And thus the case was made .
Pfaus 's results were powerful evidence not only of PT - 141 's potential as a treatment for women but of its ability to do more than just move blood around .
A male rat 's erection on its own does n't say much about the rat 's state of mind .
A female rat 's coquetry , on the other hand , says all we need to know about her intentions and desires .
Rats are n't people , to be sure , and as test subjects they suffer from a frustrating inability to tell us , in words , how they experience what they 're subjected to .
But that has an upside , too , explains Pfaus .
' The bad thing about animals is they do n't talk .
The good thing is they do n't lie . '
So the testimony of rats - notwithstanding that of the 900 articulate , full - grown human subjects who have since reported enhanced arousal and desire from taking PT - 141 - remains the most objective evaluation the drug has yet received , or ever will .
' I see a lot of couples in my practice who do n't know how to relax , ' says Leonore Tiefer , a professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine .
' That 's fine - it 's a big asset to them in their corporate lifestyle , where they can work 80 hours a week .
They 're trained to multi-task .
Well , it does n't seem that that is really doable when it comes to sex .
And they 're angry about that : they need it to be doable because they only have their five minutes . '
The five - minute meaningful sexual encounter : if ever there was a holy grail for the age of the tight - wired global economy - with its time - strapped labour force and its glut of bright , shiny distractions - that is it .
And if ever there was a reason to be wary of the pharmaceutical industry 's designs on the market for sexual healing , say critics such as Tiefer , it 's the attractiveness of that simple - minded ideal .
Tiefer is one of the leading figures in a movement of academic researchers , sex therapists and women 's - health activists contesting the increasing medicalisation of women 's sexual problems , and when Procter & Gamble sought FDA approval in December 2004 for its ' female sexual - desire disorder ' treatment - a testosterone patch called Intrinsa - her testimony helped sway the agency to deny the request .
Unlike the counting of erections , assessing subjective phenomena such as desire and satisfaction is , she testified , ' subtle , complex - and arbitrary ' .
P&G 's findings were thus too inconclusive to hold their own against the established risks of long - term testosterone use .
' Intrinsa is not a glass of chardonnay , ' Tiefer remarked , ' and yet we have already seen that it may well be promoted with a giggle and a wink as " the female Viagra " . '
Tiefer is just as dubious about PT - 141 , which , as she sees it , is merely the latest expression of a ' big wish ' that 'we could just bypass everything we want to bypass ' on our way to sexual happiness , skipping the complicated , often lifelong work of sorting out all the emotional , physical and autobiographical triggers that turn us off and on .
Her prognosis for the discovery of a drug that will render that work unnecessary ?
' Sorry , it 's never going to happen . '
Even assuming that PT - 141 ultimately performs as well in broad use as it has in trials , even granting that it can improve sex lives as effectively as a lifetime of erotic exploration , the deeper challenge posed by the prospect of a sexual techno - fix remains : is this really the kind of fix we want ?
To have desire available at any time , from the nozzle of an inhaler ?
Good things would come of it , to be sure .
Marriages would be saved , fun would be had .
But sexual Utopia ?
PT - 141 seems just as likely to usher in the age of McNookie : quick , easy couplings low on emotional nutrition .
Sex lives tailored to the demands of a jealous office or an impatient spouse .
A dark age of erotic self - ignorance tarted up in the bright - coloured packaging of a Happy Meal .
Deep in the post - industrial hinterlands of New Jersey , 100 snow - white Sprague - Dawley rats await the coming of darkness .
Darkness falls each day at exactly 6 pm , when an automated switch turns off the fluorescents and sets off a rustling din , like the sound of a sudden downpour , as all at once the rats rouse themselves and start to feed .
They live in see - through high - rises : small Plexiglas cages stacked eight by eight in portable racks , one rat per unit , each unit connected to the outside world by its own HEPA - filtered ventilation system .
Other aspects of everyday life as a lab animal at Palatin Technologies '
New Jersey headquarters include immaculate bedding , healthy supplies of food and water , bone - shaped plastic chew toys and , screwed into the top of each animal 's skull , a small , white , ceramic orb , the injection port through which the rats ' brains are regularly dosed with a close chemical cousin of PT - 141 .
The drug they 're testing now is an obesity drug - designed to block the appetite for food in much the same way PT - 141 stimulates the appetite for sex - and its distinctly human goal of weight loss serves only to heighten the pervading Stuart Little effect here in the lab .
Crowded in their little Plexiglas apartment buildings , sporting their spherical skullcaps , undergoing surgery from time to time with little rat - nose - shaped anaesthetic - gas masks strapped to their small faces - if you did n't know better , you might start to think of these sophisticated rodent urbanites as simply tiny people with fur and whiskers .
The funny thing is , it appears there 's a certain humanlike subjectiveness to the sex life of lab animals as well .
When Jim Pfaus tested PT - 141 on his female rats , he based his experimental design partly on the work of Raul Paredes , a fellow rat sexologist testing the effects of something more elusive : personal autonomy .
That 's a tricky thing to measure , but it can be done .
Paredes did it like this : first , he looked at rat couples living in standard , box - shaped cages and recorded the details of their sexual behaviour .
Then , he altered the cages in only one particular : he divided them into two chambers with a clear wall broken only by one opening , too small for the males to get through but just right for the females .
Architecturally it was a minor change , but what it did for the females was huge .
It let them get away from the males whenever they chose to , and thereby made it entirely their choice whether to have sex .
Paredes then observed the rats ' behaviour in this altered setting .
Here 's what he found : the effects of giving a female rat greater personal control over her sex life are essentially the same as those of giving her PT - 141 .
Autonomy , in other words , is as real an aphrodisiac as any substance known to science .
This does n't surprise Leonore Tiefer , who sees evidence for it every working day , in sex lives that suffer in direct proportion to her clients ' ignorance about desire in general and their own in particular .
For Tiefer , striving to understand yourself is the sexiest sort of autonomy there is , and nothing betrays that autonomy like handing over the job to someone else , whether it 's your lover , your doctor , or , worst of all , big pharmaceutical companies .
Jim Pfaus , not surprisingly , sees things a little differently .
As it happens , Pfaus and Tiefer are friendly acquaintances , and he 's sympathetic to her critiques of the industry .
' She 's on a roll , and I think she has some valid points , ' says Pfaus .
But all the same : ' What do we tell postmenopausal women who have lost their desire , despite being in a loving and caring relationship ?
" Sorry , there 's nothing we can do , " or worse , " Sorry , but you should n't be having sex anyway " ? '
The argument is a strong one .
But so is Tiefer's .
Each defends a vital sort of autonomy - the power of self - knowledge on the one hand ; on the other , the freedom to grasp whatever tools of self - improvement are available to us .
And if , after all the trials are done and the prescriptions are filled , PT - 141 diminishes the former as much as it expands the latter , who 's to say which matters more ?
Add up all the pluses and minuses , and in the end the sum may be zero .
In short , no net change one way or the other in the world 's total supply of sexual happiness .
But then , no one 's asking PT - 141 to change the world .
It 's enough to hope that someday , when you need it most , it just might get you through the night .

It looks good , but are consumers getting the best deal possible ?
Starbucks does .
Why would a company deliberately damage its best product ?
Many hi-tech companies do that , and even my favourite local restaurant does .
It does n't sound like a winning formula , but it's at the heart of the way many companies do business .
Take the secret cappuccino , which you can buy in two of the leading coffee chains , Starbucks and Coffee Republic .
The sales assistants know what the drink is and they have a little button on their cash tills to ring it up .
It 's cheaper than the other drinks on offer , but it does n't appear on the menu .
Starbucks claims that 's because they do n't have room on the menu board .
Coffee Republic does n't even have that excuse : there 's a blank space with no price where this drink should be listed .
It 's called the " short cappuccino " , and it 's smaller , cheaper and better than the smallest size on the menu , the " tall " .
Pricing battling
So what is going on ?
It 's all part of an attempt to aim different prices at different types of customer .
Any shop would love to be able to charge high prices whenever they could , while still offering low prices to customers who would otherwise shop somewhere else .
Consumers may have more goods to choose from than they think
Of course , if shops just asked their customers whether they would like a discount , every customer would say " yes " , so shops need to get a bit smarter about working out which customers will pay which price .
Some of the attempts are obvious , such as discounts for students or pensioners .
You did n't think it was out of a sense of social justice , did you ?
Companies simply charge more to people who have jobs , because those people are willing to pay more .
Similarly , when a restaurant or a travel agent offers free meals or accommodation for kids , that 's just a way of charging more to childless people who usually have more disposable income .
But the really clever tricks are where companies tweak their product line in an attempt to persuade customers to identify whether they are lavish or stingy - the lavish customers are simply turkeys voting for Christmas .
The confusing menu boards at coffee chains are designed to collect a few votes from the turkeys .
Choose the secret cappuccino and you are effectively beating the coffee shop down to a bargain - basement price at which they make little money .
Choose something off the menu and you 're a more profitable customer : the biggest , most lavish drinks generate the highest profits .
Coffee companies hide or downplay the cheaper drinks in the hope that customers will buy something pricier .
The same but different
They are not alone .
Supermarkets package their cheapest products to look more like famine relief than something you 'd want to pay for .
It 's not because they can't afford sexy packaging even for their cheapest foods - it 's because they want to persuade richer customers to buy something more expensive instead .
Economists call this " product sabotage " and it can reach extreme levels .
In the hi-tech world it is common to produce a high - specification product , sold at a premium price , and then sell the same product more cheaply with some of the functions disabled .
High - tech firms have long offered a number of product choices
Intel did this with its 486 computer chip in the early 1990s , and IBM did it with a printer : the economy version for home users was simply the top - of - the - range model with a chip in it to slow it down .
These tactics might seem sneaky or unethical , and they certainly do n't go down well with customers .
Yet frustrating as it is , product sabotage is often the cheapest way to produce two different versions of a product .
For the hi-tech industry the alternative is to design the whole product twice .
And two different versions are what you need if you want to reach price - sensitive customers .
Pick and choose
If companies were forced to abandon their attempts at price targeting , it would usually be the cheaper deals that disappeared .
These tactics can certainly work to the advantage of price - savvy customers if they 're willing to put up with a little bit of hassle .
My favourite restaurant offers the usual great food much more cheaply if you eat at the bar , and put up with systematic abuse from the barman .
It would n't work for a business lunch or a romantic meal , but it 's just fine if I want to take my wife somewhere affordable .

Experts fear birds will carry the virus across borders
David Nabarro , who is charged with co-ordinating responses to bird flu , said a mutation of the virus affecting Asia could trigger new outbreaks .
" It 's like a combination of global warming and HIV / Aids 10 times faster than it 's running at the moment , " Dr Nabarro told the BBC .
But the World Health Organisation has distanced itself from the figure .
The WHO spokesman on influenza , Dick Thompson , told a news conference in Geneva that the WHO 's official estimate of the number of people who could die was between two million and 7.4 million .
QUICK GUIDE
Bird flu
" There is obvious confusion , and I think that has to be straightened out .
I do n't think you will hear Dr Nabarro say the same sort of thing again , " Mr Thompson said .
Bird flu has swept through poultry and wild birds in Asia since 2003 .
It has killed huge numbers of birds and led to more than 60 human deaths .
Prepared for worst
" The range of deaths could be anything between 5 m and 150 m , " the UN's new co-ordinator for avian and human influenza said in his BBC interview .
Dr Nabarro said he stood by the figure drawn from the work of epidemiologists around the world .
" My reason for giving the higher figure is simply that I want to be sure that when this next flu pandemic does come along , that we are prepared for the worst as well as for the mildest , " he said .
In an earlier interview with the BBC , he said the likelihood that the Asian virus could mutate and jump to humans was high .
" The consequences in terms of human life when the pandemic does start are going to be extraordinary and very damaging , " he said .
Because it has moved to wild migratory birds there is a possibility " that the first outbreak could happen even in Africa or in the Middle East " , he warned .
The comments came as agriculture ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations ( Asean ) endorsed a three - year plan to combat the spread of the virus , and pledged $ 2 m to fund research and training .
H5N1 BIRD FLU VIRUS
Principally an avian disease , first seen in humans in Hong Kong , 1997 Almost all human cases thought to be contracted from birds Isolated cases of human - to - human transmission in Hong Kong and Vietnam , but none confirmed
In pictures : Indonesia alert Q&A : Avian flu
" I believe that the work we 're doing over the next few months will make the difference between , for example , whether the next pandemic leads us in the direction of 150 or in the direction of five . "
The appointment of Dr Nabarro is an indication of how seriously the UN is taking the threat , the BBC's UN correspondent Suzannah Price says .
In his new role , he is meant to ensure the UN has a co-ordinated response to bird flu and that it helps global efforts to prepare for any human flu pandemic , our correspondent says .
America 's idea of what constituted torture " is not the same as ours and does n't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries " , says judge
Three British residents detained at Guantánamo Bay were today given the go - ahead to seek a high court order requiring the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , to press the US for their release .
The three detainees involved in the case are not British citizens but were long - term residents in the UK before their detention at the US naval base in Cuba .
Mr Justice Collins , a high court judge in London , said that a factor in his ruling today was that there were allegations of torture at the detention facility .
The judge 's decision came after a day - long hearing during which he commented that America 's idea of what constituted torture " is not the same as ours and does n't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries " .
Mr Justice Collins has a reputation for making controversial remarks and his pronouncements from the treatment of Gypsies to laws on terrorism and immigration have brought howls of disapproval from both Conservative and Labour politicians .
He said the men and their families living in the UK had an arguable case that the British government was under an obligation to act on their behalf .
However , the judge stressed his decision was " no guarantee " that the three men , Bisher al - Rawi , Jamil el - Banna and Omar Deghayes , and their families , would win their case .
There were formidable arguments against them , the judge said .
His remarks today coincided with a UN report which urged that the Guantánamo facility should be shut down and called on the US government to refrain from any practice " amounting to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " .
After the judge 's decision today , the full case against Mr Straw is expected to be heard in mid-March .
Nine British citizens who had been detained at Guantánamo Bay have all been flown back to the UK and released without charge .
The British government pushed Washington to secure the release of the Britons - and human rights groups have called for the same pressure to be exerted by the UK over long term UK residents .
Gareth Peirce , the solicitor for the three men , said after today 's hearing : " After so many years of such bitter disappointment , this is the first ray of light that we have had - the first ability to hope that this might be the beginning of the end for the ordeal of these three families . "
Earlier , Rabinder Singh QC , for the men and their families , had told the judge the case arose out of what had been described by a law lord as the " utter lawlessness at Guantánamo Bay " , where people were being detained indefinitely without trial .
Mr Rawi , 37 , an Iraqi national who had lived in Britain since 1985 , and his Jordanian business partner Mr Banna , who was granted refugee status in 2000 , were detained three years ago in Gambia - " far from any theatre of war " , said Mr Singh .
They were alleged to have been associated with al - Qaida through their connection with the radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada .
Mr Singh said Mr Rawi's contact with Qatada was " expressly approved and encouraged by British intelligence " to whom he supplied information about the cleric .
The judge was told that intelligence operatives assured Mr Rawi that , should he run into trouble , they would intervene and assist him .
But the British government was subsequently unwilling to make material available to him when a hearing on his case was held at Guantánamo Bay , the QC said .
Mr Banna was said to have been in possession of " a homemade electronic device " at the time of his arrest .
It was , in fact , a battery charger bought from Argos and cleared by the UK authorities before he went to Gambia .
Mr Deghayes was detained in Pakistan .
His name was said to be on the FBI 's " most wanted " list .
But the photograph in his file was of a " totally different individual " , said Mr Singh .
Mr Justice Collins was told that Mr Deghayes had been rendered virtually blind in one eye by the use of pepper spray and the gouging of his eye during his detention , yet was still being constantly subjected to high light levels .
The government 's counsel , Philip Sales , said the foreign secretary had already decided to reconsider Mr Rawi 's case because of its particular circumstances .
His argument that permission should not be granted in the other cases because the detainees did not have British nationality was rejected by Mr Justice Collins .

Why is everyone is rushing to create the best walled garden for other peoples stuff ?
From their random musings , to their pictures and videos , it seems that everyone has bought into the idea that if you collect enough UGC ( Unlikely to Generate Cash ) a business will magically appear .
The alchemist running UGC sites would have us believe that they can harness the magical powers of the Long Tail and transform UGC lead into advertising gold .
While I ’m no expert in the properties of power law distributions , nothing I ’ve read about the Long Tail would indicate that a million audiences of one is the same as one audience of million .
Chief among these new age shamans is YouTube , the uber popular video sharing site where you can observe everything from on air flatulence by geriatric broadcasters to the incoherent gamblings of teenage girls in tight clothing ( the pyromaniacal antics of their male counterparts are also available if thats your preference ) .
As the reigning leader of UGC ( Unwatchable Generic Crud ) video aggregation , and the only one with stats available online , YouTube , provided an easy source of raw data , around which to do a bit of musing .
The fact that I want a signed copy of Chris Anderson ’s new book , which will be out in the US in 10 days , has absolutely nothing to do with the timing of this post .
My meticulous collection of data ( copy and paste job ) , biting analysis ( conjecture buried in verbosity ) and witty prose is my small ( very small ) contribution to the knowledge in the field .
And I really want a signed copy !
Heads , Bodies and Tails , oh my
I started off by gathering the rankings info ( excel version here ) for the “ Most Viewed ” videos on 7/1 and 7/3 at different times during the day .
I pulled two sets since it didnt occur to me that a daily ranking of popular files wouldnt be worth much when taken at 10 am .
I also didnt anticipate that my time and and YouTube ’s time would be different and that this might cause variances in the data but more on that later .
Anyway , with some usable ranking data in hand I then needed some total numbers to use as a benchmark .
YouTube claims that its daily viewership is 70 million , I ’ve also seen the numbers 52 million and 35 million daily views bandied about in the media so both of are in the spreadsheet .
I sent an email to the good folks at YouTube asking for the number of downloads since launch to compare against the All Time Top 100 ranking they have on the site but didnt hear back from them in time for this post .
I will add it to the Editgrid sheet if they send me that info .
If YouTube has 70 million daily views as it claims , then its tail is indeed very long .
The top 100 viewed video clips were watched just over 2 million times as of 10 am on 7/1 .
Thats 2 million out of 70 million leaving a tail 68 million views long .
The same is true on 7/3 just 1.93 million views of the top 100 clips , leaving a tail several multiples larger then the head .
Wag the dog indeed !
YouTube is currently serving 70 million videos per day to six million unique users daily , with more than 60,000 videos being uploaded per day .
- YouTube PR
With a tail as large as YouTubes , I wanted to know what traffic looked like as you moved from the top 100 clips in terms of popularity to the top 1,000 and beyond .
I called on Reggie Smith , to help answer this question .
Using powers of analysis and perception well beyond anything I posses , Reggie worked out how to apply of one of the many Power Law distributions to the data I collected which allowed me to put a viewership number on any rank along YouTubes long tail .
While all this play with Excel allowed me to chanel my deeply repressed inner MBA , the really useful insight to me is how very deep into the tail users are driven .
According to the model , even the 1,000,000th ranked video clip on YouTube would be able to gather a dedicated audience of 4 bored souls .
If you happen to be ranked the 59,998th video on the site dont fret you would still attract a whopping 40 viewers .
How do you effectivly talk to people venturing this far down the tail ?
From social involvement to consumption , how do you engage them in conversation thats meaningful and relavent ?
I ’m not a Hater I Just Read a Lot
This isnt a rant against the Long Tail , UGC ( Unnerving Grotesque Capers ) or even content aggregators ( ie middlemen Dinosaurs ) .
However , anyone that actually reads any of Chris Andersons musings on the Long Tail you ’ll note that he is talking about commerce , the buying and selling of stuff .
The observations , based on similar observations of many others , are about the increased efficiency that result when you start selling and buying online .
Despite the stories that tend to focus on the mass potential of YouTube , its real strength will never be its approximation of the broadcasting ’s large audiences and one - way messaging .
Smart marketers ready to experiment with matching advertising messages to profile info , keywords , tags , video content or even comments may be able to take advantage of YouTube ’s long tail .
The rest will ape the broadcast model in a non-broadcast medium and fail .
NOTES :
The Edit Grid model is still in development and there are two versions online .
This one will be the latest version and “ Editable ” version is left open for your ideas , contributions and corrections .

Google will have to turn over some of the data requested by the Department of Justice , according to a ruling just handed down by US District Judge James Ware .
The DoJ had subpoenaed search records from a one - week period covering 1 million random web addresses in an attempt to make its case for reviving the Child Online Protection Act , which was struck down in 2004 .
Google fought back , leading to today 's ruling .
US District Judge James
Ware ruled that Google will need to hand over a portion of the requested data to the DoJ , but has not yet specified the full scope of his ruling .
However , he indicated that he had significant reservations about requiring the search engine to comply with all of the terms of the subpoena due to the " perception by the public that this is subject to government scrutiny . "
Indeed , the entire case has brought the issue of how much privacy ( here 's a hint : very little ) Internet users can expect to have .
Google is not alone in keeping track of users ' queries and identifying information such as IP addresses and whether the searcher was signed into her Google account , to name a couple .
The ACLU had filed a brief supporting Google , citing possible violations of privacy .
For its part , Google wanted to keep the information confidential because it claimed that its release would disclose some of Google 's trade secrets and " proprietary systems . "
In addition , the company said that the government had failed to demonstrate that the data would lead to admissible evidence and that the subpoena imposed an expensive and unwarranted burden without sufficient justification .
It 's also likely that the company wants to demonstrate that it was committed to keeping data about its users out of the hands of the government during a time when it has come under scrutiny for its dealings with the People 's Republic of China .
Originally , the DoJ requested a month 's worth of search records , but later narrowed the timeframe down to a week .
In addition , it has promised to compensate Google for the costs of compliance .
By examining the data from Google and other search engines ( which apparently complied fully with the subpoena 's they received ) , the government hopes to demonstrate the ease with which filtering software designed to keep minors from viewing pornography and other content online can be circumvented .
Judge Ware expects to make the decision as to what extent Google will have to comply with the subpoena " very quickly . "
Chances are good that Google will appeal this ruling .
Absolute Powerpoint
Can a software package edit our thoughts
by Ian Parker
Before there were presentations , there were conversations , which were a little like presentations but used fewer bullet points , and no one had to dim the lights .
A woman we can call Sarah Wyndham , a defense - industry consultant living in Alexandria , Virginia , recently began to feel that her two daughters were n't listening when she asked them to clean their bedrooms and do their chores .
So , one morning , she sat down at her computer , opened Microsoft 's PowerPoint program , and typed :
Family Matters
An approach for positive change to the
Wyndham family team
On a new page , she wrote :
Lack of organization leads to confusion and frustration among all family members .
Disorganization is detrimental to grades and to your social life .
Disorganization leads to inefficiencies that impact the entire family .
Instead of pleading for domestic harmony , Sarah Wyndham was pitching for it .
Soon she had eighteen pages of large type , supplemented by a color photograph of a generic happy family riding bicycles , and , on the final page , a drawing key - the key to success .
The briefing was given only once , last fall .
The experience was so upsetting to her children that the threat of a second showing was enough to make one of the Wyndham girls burst into tears .
PowerPoint , which can be found on two hundred and fifty million computers around the world , is software you impose on other people .
It allows you to arrange text and graphics in a series of pages , which you can project , slide by slide , from a laptop computer onto a screen , or print as a booklet ( as Sarah Wyndham did ) .
The usual metaphor for everyday software is the tool , but that does n't seem to be right here .
PowerPoint is more like a suit of clothes , or a car , or plastic surgery .
You take it out with you .
You are judged by it - you insist on being judged by it .
It is by definition a social instrument , turning middle managers into bullet - point dandies .
But PowerPoint also has a private , interior influence .
It edits ideas .
It is , almost surreptitiously , a business manual as well as a business suit , with an opinion - an oddly pedantic , prescriptive opinion - about the way we should think .
It helps you make a case , but it also makes its own case : about how to organize information , how much information to organize , how to look at the world .
One feature of this is the AutoContent Wizard , which supplies templates - " Managing Organizational Change " or " Communicating Bad News , " say - that are so close to finished presentations you barely need to do more then add your company logo .
The " Motivating a Team " template , for example , includes a slide headed " Conduct a Creative Thinking Session " :
Ask :
In what ways can we ...?
- Assess the situation .
Get the facts .
- Generate possible solutions with green light , nonjudgmental thinking .
- Select the best solution .
The final injunction is " Have an inspirational close . "
It 's easy to avoid these extreme templates - many people do - as well as embellishments like clip art , animations , and sound effects .
But it 's hard to shake off AutoContent 's spirit : even the most easygoing PowerPoint template insists on a heading followed by bullet points , so that the user is shepherded toward a staccato , summarizing frame of mind , of the kind parodied , for example , in a PowerPoint Gettysburg Address posted on the Internet : " Dedicate portion of field - fitting ! "
Because PowerPoint can be an impressive antidote to fear - converting public - speaking dread into moviemaking pleasure - there seems to be no great impulse to fight this influence , as you might fight the unrelenting animated paperclip in Microsoft Word .
Rather , PowerPoint 's restraints seem to be soothing - so much so that where Microsoft has not written rules , businesses write them for themselves .
A leading U.S. computer manufacturer has distributed guidelines to its employees about PowerPoint presentations , insisting on something it calls the " Rules of Seven " : " Seven ( 7 ) bullets or lines per page , seven ( 7 ) words per line . "
Today , after Microsoft 's decade of dizzying growth , there are great tracts of corporate America where to appear at a meeting without PowerPoint would be unwelcome and vaguely pretentious , like wearing no shoes .
In darkened rooms at industrial plants and ad agencies , at sales pitches and conferences , this is how people are communicating : no paragraphs , no pronouns - the world condensed into a few upbeat slides , with seven or so words on a line , seven or so lines on a slide .
And now it 's happening during sermons and university lectures and family arguments , too .
A New Jersey PowerPoint user recently wrote in an online discussion , " Last week I caught myself planning out ( in my head ) the slides I would need to explain to my wife why we could n't afford a vacation this year . "
Somehow , a piece of software designed , fifteen years ago , to meet a simple business need has become a way of organizing thought at kindergarten show - and - tells .
" Oh , Lord , " one of the early developers said to me .
" What have we done ? "
Forty years ago , a workplace meeting was a discussion with your immediate colleagues .
Engineers would meet with other engineers and talk in the language of engineering .
A manager might make an appearance - acting as an interpreter , a bridge to the rest of the company - but no one from the marketing or production or sales department would be there .
Somebody might have gone to the trouble of cranking out mimeographs - that would be the person with purple fingers .
But the structure of American industry changed in the nineteen - sixties and seventies .
Clifford Nass , who teaches in the Department of Communication at Stanford , says , " Companies were n't discovering things in the laboratory and then trying to convince consumers to buy them .
They were discovering - or creating - consumer demand , figuring out what they can convince consumers they need , then going to the laboratory and saying , ' Build this ! '
People were saying , ' We can create demand .
Even if demand does n't exist , we know how to market this . '
SpaghettiOs is the great example .
The guy came up with the jingle first : ' The neat round spaghetti you can eat with a spoon . :
And he said , ' Hey !
Make spaghetti in the shape of small circles ! ' "
As Jerry Porras , a professor of organizational behavior and change at Stanford Graduate School of Business , says , " When technologies no longer just drove the product out but the customer sucked it out , then you had to know what the customer wanted , and that meant a lot more interaction inside the company . "
There are new conversations : Can we make this ?
How do we sell this if we make it ?
Can we do it in blue ?
America began to go to more meetings .
By the early nineteen - eighties , when the story of PowerPoint starts , employees had to find ways to talk to colleagues from other departments , colleagues who spoke a different language , brought together by SpaghettiOs and by the simple fact that technology was generating more information .
There was more to know and , as the notion of a job for life eroded , more reason to know it .
In this environment , visual aids were bound to thrive .
In 1975 , fifty thousand overhead projectors were sold in America .
By 1985 , that figure had increased to more than a hundred and twenty thousand .
Overheads , which were developed in the mid-forties for use by the police , and were then widely used in bowling alleys and schools , did not fully enter business life until the mid seventies , when a transparency film that could survive the heat of a photocopier became available .
Now anything on a sheet of paper could be transferred to an overhead slide .
Overheads were cheaper than the popular alternative , the 35 - mm slide ( which needed graphics professionals ) , and they were easier to use .
But they restricted you to your typewriter 's font - rather , your secretary 's typewriter 's font - or your skill with Letraset and a felt - tipped pen .
A businessman could n't generate a handsome , professional - looking font in his own office .
In 1980 , though , it was clear that a future of widespread personal computers - and laser printers and screens that showed the very thing you were about to print - was tantalizingly close .
In the Mountain View , California , laboratory of Bell - Northern Research , computer - research scientists had set up a great mainframe computer , a graphics workstation , a phototypesetter , and the earliest Canon laser printer , which was the size of a bathtub and took six men to carry into the building - together , a cumbersome approximation of what would later fit on a coffee table and cost a thousand dollars .
With much trial and error , and jogging from one room to another , you could use this collection of machines as a kind of word processor .
Whitfield Diffie had access to this equipment .
A mathematician , a former peacenik , and an enemy of exclusive government control of encryption systems , Diffie had secured a place for himself in computing legend in 1976 , when he and a colleague , Martin Hellman , announced the discovery of a new method of protecting secrets electronically - public - key cryptography .
At Bell - Northern , Diffie was researching the security of telephone systems .
In 1981 , preparing to give a presentation with 35 - mm. slides , he wrote a little program , tinkering with some graphics software designed by a B.N.R. colleague , that allowed you to draw a black frame on a piece of paper .
Diffie expanded it so that the page could show a number of frames , and text inside each frame , with space for commentary around them .
In other words , he produced a storyboard - a slide show on paper - that could be sent to the designers who made up the slides , and that would also serve as a script for his lecture .
( At this stage , he was n't photocopying what he had produced to make overhead transparencies , although scientists in other facilities were doing that . )
With a few days ' effort , Diffie had pointed the way to PowerPoint .
Diffie has long gray hair and likes to wear English suits .
Today , he works for Sun Microsystems , as an internal consultant on encryption matters .
I recently had lunch with him in Palo Alto , and for the first time he publicly acknowledged his presence at the birth of PowerPoint .
It was an odd piece of news : as if Lenin had invented the stapler .
Yes , he said , PowerPoint was " based on " his work at B.N.R .
This is not of great consequence to Diffie , whose reputation in his own field is so high that he is one of the few computer scientists to receive erotically charged fan mail .
He said he was " mildly miffed " to have made no money from the PowerPoint connection , but he has no interest in beginning a feud with an old friend .
" Bob was the one who had the vision to understand how important it was to the world , " he said .
" And I did n't . "
Bob is Bob Gaskins , the man who has to take final responsibility for the drawn blinds of high - rise offices around the world and the bullet points dashing across computer screens inside .
His account of PowerPoint 's parentage does not exactly match Diffie's , but he readily accepts his former colleague as " my inspiration . "
In the late nineteen - seventies and early eighties , Gaskins was B.N.R.'s head of computer - science research .
A former Berkeley Ph.D. student , he had a family background in industrial photographic supplies and grew up around overhead projectors and inks and gels .
In 1982 , he returned for a six - month overseas business trip and , with a vivid sense of the future impact of the Apple Macintosh and of Microsoft 's Windows ( both of which were in development ) , he wrote a list of fifty commercial possibilities - Arabic typesetting , menus , signs .
And then he looked around his own laboratory and realized what had happened while he was away : following Diffie 's lead , his colleagues were trying to make overheads to pitch their projects for funding , despite the difficulties of using the equipment .
( What you saw was not at all what you got . )
" Our mainframe was buckling under the load , " Gaskins says .
He now had his idea : a graphics program that would work with Windows and the Macintosh , and that would put together , and edit , a string of single pages , or " slides . "
In 1984 , he left B.N.R. , joined an ailing Silicon Valley software firm , Forethought , in exchange for a sizeable share of the company , and hired a software developer , Dennis Austin .
They began work on a program called Presenter .
After a trademark problem , and an epiphany Gaskins had in the shower , Presenter became PowerPoint .
Gaskins is a precise , bookish man who lives with his wife in a meticulously restored and furnished nineteenth - century house in the Fillmore district of San Francisco .
He has recently discovered an interest in antique concertinas .
When I visited him , he was persuaded to play a tune , and he gave me a copy of a forthcoming paper he had co-written : " A Wheatstone Twelve - Sided ' Edeophone ' Concertina with Pre-MacCann Chromatic Duet Fingering . "
Gaskins is skeptical about the product that PowerPoint has become - AutoContent and animated fades between slides - but he is devoted to the simpler thing that it was , and he led me through a well - preserved archive of PowerPoint memorabilia , including the souvenir program for the PowerPoint reunion party , in 1997 , which had a quiz filled with in - jokes about font size and programming languages .
He also found an old business plan from 1984 .
One phrase - the only one in italics - read , " Allows the content - originator to control the presentation . "
For Gaskins , that had always been the point : to get rid of the intermediaries - graphic designers - and never mind the consequences .
Whenever colleagues sought to restrict the design possibilities of the program ( to make a design disaster less likely ) , Gaskins would overrule them , quoting Thoreau : " I came into this world , not chiefly to make this a good place to live in , but to live in it , be it good or bad . "
PowerPoint 1.0 went on sale in April , 1987 - available only for the Macintosh , and only in black - and - white .
It generated text - and - graphics pages that a photocopier could turn into overhead transparencies .
( This was before laptop computers and portable projectors made PowerPoint a tool for live electronic presentations .
Gaskins thinks he may have been the first person to use the program in the modern way , in a Paris hotel in 1992 - which is like being the first person ever to tap a microphone and say , " Can you hear me at the back ? " )
The Macintosh market was small and specialized , but within this market PowerPoint - the first product of its kind - was a hit .
" I ca n't describe how wonderful it was , " Gaskins says .
" When we demonstrated at trade shows , we were mobbed . "
Shortly after the launch , Forethought accepted an acquisition offer of fourteen million dollars from Microsoft .
Microsoft paid cash and allowed Bob Gaskins and his colleagues to remain partly self - governing in Silicon Valley , far from the Microsoft campus , in Redmond , Washington .
Microsoft soon regretted the terms of the deal ; PowerPoint workers became known for a troublesome independence of spirit ( and for rewarding themselves , now and then , with beautifully staged parties - caviar , string quartets , Renaissance - period fancy dress ) .
PowerPoint had been created , in part , as a response to the new corporate world of interdepartmental communication .
Those involved with the program now experienced the phenomenon at first hand .
In 1990 , the first PowerPoint for Windows was launched , alongside Windows 3.0 .
And PowerPoint quickly became what Gaskins calls " a cog in the great machine . "
The PowerPoint programmers were forced to make unwelcome changes , partly because in 1990 Word , Excel , and PowerPoint began to be integrated into Microsoft Office - a strategy that would eventually make PowerPoint invincible - and partly in response to market research .
AutoContent was added in the mid-nineties , when Microsoft learned that some would - be presenters were uncomfortable with a blank PowerPoint page - it was hard to get started .
" We said , ' What we need is some automatic content ! ' " a former Microsoft developer recalls , laughing .
" ' Punch the button and you 'll have a presentation . ' "
The idea , he thought , was " crazy . "
And the name was meant as a joke .
But Microsoft took the idea and kept the name - a rare example of a product named in outright mockery of its target customers .
Gaskins left PowerPoint in 1992 , and many of his colleagues followed soon after .
Now rich from Microsoft stock , and beginning the concertina - collecting phase of their careers , they watched as their old product made its way into the heart of American business culture .
By 1993 , PowerPoint had a majority share of the presentation market .
In 1995 , the average user created four and a half presentations a month .
Three years later , the monthly average was nine .
PowerPoint began to appear in cartoon strips and everyday conversation .
A few years ago , Bob Gaskins was at a presentations - heavy conference in Britain .
The organizer brought the proceedings to a sudden stop , saying , " I 've just been told that the inventor of PowerPoint is in the audience - will he please identify himself so we can recognize his contribution to the advancement of science ? "
Gaskins stood up .
The audience laughed and applauded .
Cathleen Belleville , a former graphic designer who worked at PowerPoint as a product planner from 1989 to 1995 , was amazed to see a clip - art series she had created become modern business icons .
The images were androgynous silhouette stick figures ( she called them Screen Beans ) , modelled on a former college roommate : a little figure clicking its heels ; another with an inspirational light bulb above its head .
One Screen Bean .
the patron saint of PowerPoint - a figure that stands beneath a question mark , scratching its head in puzzlement - is so popular that a lawyer at a New York firm who has seen many PowerPoint presentations claims never to have seen one without the head - scratcher .
Belleville herself has seen her Beans all over the world , reprinted on baseball caps , blown up fifteen feet high in a Hamburg bank .
" I told my mom , ' You know , my artwork is in danger of being more famous than the " Mona Lisa . " ' "
Above the counter in a laundromat on Third Avenue in New York , a sign explains that no responsibility can be taken for deliveries to doorman buildings .
And there , next to the words , is the famous puzzled figure .
It is hard to understand the puzzlement .
Doorman ?
Delivery ?
But perhaps this is simply how a modern poster clears its throat :
Belleville has created the international sign for " sign . "
According to Microsoft estimates , at least thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day .
The program has about ninety - five per cent of the presentations - software market .
And so perhaps it was inevitable that it would migrate out of business and into other areas of our lives .
I recently spoke to Sew Meng Chung , a Malaysian research engineer living in Singapore who got married in 1999 .
He told me that , as his guests took their seats for a wedding party in the Goodwood Park Hotel , they were treated to a PowerPoint presentation : a hundred and thirty photographs - one fading into the next every four or five seconds , to musical accompaniment .
" They were baby photos , and courtship photos , and photos taken with our friends and family , " he told me .
I also spoke to Terry Taylor , who runs a Web site called eBibleTeacher.com , which supplies materials for churches that use electronic visual aids .
" Jesus was a storyteller , and he gave graphic images , " Taylor said .
" He would say , ' Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow , ' and all indications are that there were lilies in the field when he was talking , you know .
He used illustrations . "
Taylor estimates that fifteen per cent of American churches now have video projectors , and many use PowerPoint regularly for announcements , for song lyrics , and to accompany preaching .
( Taylor has seen more than one sermon featuring the head - scratching figure . )
Visitors to Taylor 's site can download photographs of locations in the Holy Land , as well as complete PowerPoint sermons - for example , " Making Your Marriage Great " :
Find out what you are doing to harm your marriage and heal it .
Financial irresponsibility
Temper
Pornography
Substance abuse
You name it !
When PowerPoint is used to flash hymn lyrics , or make a quick pitch to a new client , or produce an eye - catching laundromat poster , it 's easy to understand the enthusiasm of , say , Tony Kurz , the vice - president for sales and marketing of a New York - based Internet company , who told me , " I love PowerPoint .
It 's a brilliant application .
I can take you through at exactly the pace I want to take you . "
There are probably worse ways to transmit fifty or a hundred words of text , or information that is mainly visual - ways that involve more droning , more drifting .
And PowerPoint demands at least some rudimentary preparation : a PowerPoint presenter is , by definition , not thinking about his or her material for the very first time .
Steven Pinker , the author of " The Language Instinct " and a psychology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , says that PowerPoint can give visual shape to an argument .
" Language is a linear medium : one damn word after another , " he says .
" But ideas are multidimensional ...
When properly employed , PowerPoint makes the logical structure of an argument more transparent .
Two channels sending the same information are better than one . "
Still , it 's hard to be perfectly comfortable with a product whose developers occasionally find themselves trying to suppress its use .
Jolene Rocchio , who is a product planner for Microsoft Office ( and is upbeat about PowerPoint in general , ) told me that , at a recent meeting of a nonprofit organization in San Francisco , she argued against a speaker 's using PowerPoint at a future conference .
" I said , ' I think we just need her to get up and speak . ' "
On an earlier occasion , Rocchio said , the same speaker had tried to use PowerPoint and the projector did n't work , " and everybody was , like , cheering .
They just wanted to hear this woman speak , and they wanted it to be from her heart .
And the PowerPoint almost alienated her audience . "
This is the most common complaint about PowerPoint .
Instead of human contact , we are given human display .
" I think that we as a people have become unaccustomed to having real conversations with each other , where actually give and take to arrive at a new answer .
We present to each other , instead of discussing , " Cathy Belleville says .
Tad Simons , the editor of the magazine " Presentations " ( whose second - grade son used PowerPoint for show - and - tell ) , is familiar with the sin of triple delivery , where precisely the same text is seen on the screen , spoken aloud , and printed on the handout in front of you ( the " leave - behind , " as it is known in some circles ) .
" The thing that makes my heart sing is when somebody pressed the ' B ' button and the screen goes black and you can actually talk to the person , " Simons told me .
In 1997 , Sun Microsystems ' chairman and C.E.O. , Scott McNealy , " banned " PowerPoint ( a ban widely disregarded by his staff ) .
The move might have been driven , in part , by Sun 's public - relations needs as a Microsoft rival , but , according to McNealy , there were genuine productivity issues .
" Why did we ban it ?
Let me put it this way :
If I want to tell my forty thousand employees to attack , the word ' attack ' in ASCII is forty - eight bits .
As a Microsoft Word document , it 's 90,112 bits .
Put that same word in a PowerPoint slide and it becomes 458,048 bits .
That 's a pig through the python when you try to send it over the Net . "
McNealy 's concern is shared by the American military .
Enormously elaborate PowerPoint files ( generated by presentation - obsessives -- so- called PowerPoint Rangers ) were said to be clogging up the military 's bandwidth .
Last year , to the delight of many under his command , General Henry H. Shelton , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , issued an order to U.S. bases around the world insisting on simpler presentations .
PowerPoint was developed to give public speakers control over design decisions .
But it 's possible that those speakers should be making other , more important decisions .
" In the past , I think we had an inefficient system , where executives passed all of their work to secretaries , " Cathy Belleville says .
" But now we 've got highly paid people sitting there formatting slides - spending hours formatting slides - because it 's more fun to do that than concentrate on what you 're going to say .
It would be much more efficient to offload that work onto someone who could do it in a tenth of the time , and be paid less .
Millions of executives around the world are sitting there going , ' Arial ?
Times Roman ?
Twenty - four point ?
Eighteen point ? ' "
In the glow of a PowerPoint show , the world is condensed , simplified , and smoothed over -- yet bright and hyperreal -- like the cityscape background in a PlayStation motor race .
PowerPoint is strangely adept at disguising the fragile foundations of a proposal , the emptiness of a business plan ; usually , the audience is respectfully still ( only venture capitalists dare to dictate the pace of someone else 's slide show ) , and , with the visual distraction of a dancing pie chart , a speaker can quickly move past the laughable flaw in his argument .
If anyone notices , it 's too late -- the narrative presses on .
Last year , three researchers at Arizona State University , including Robert Cialdini , a professor of psychology and the author of " Influence : Science and Practice , " conducted an experiment in which they presented three groups of volunteers with information about Andrew , a fictional high - school student under consideration for a university football scholarship .
One group was given Andrew 's football statistics typed on a piece of paper .
The second group was shown bar graphs .
Those in the third group were given a PowerPoint presentation , in which animated bar graphs grew before their eyes .
Given Andrew 's record , what kind of prospect was he ?
According to Cialdini , when Andrew was PowerPointed , viewers saw him as a greater potential asset to the football team .
The first group rated Andrew four and a half on a scale of one to seven ; the second rated him five ; and the PowerPoint group rated him six .
PowerPoint gave him power .
The experiment was repeated , with three groups of sports fans that were accustomed to digesting sports statistics ; this time , the first two groups gave Andrew the same rating .
But the group that saw the PowerPoint presentation still could n't resist it .
Again , Andrew got a six .
PowerPoint seems to be a way for organizations to turn expensive , expert decision - makers into novice decision - makers .
" It 's frightening , " Cialdini says .
He always preferred to use slides when he spoke to business groups , but one high - tech company recently hinted that his authority suffered as a result .
" They said , ' You know what , Bob ?
You 've got to get into PowerPoint , otherwise people are n't going to respond . '
So I made the transfer . "
Clifford Nass has an office overlooking the Oval lawn at Stanford , a university where the use of PowerPoint is so widespread that to refrain from using it is sometimes seen as a mark of seniority and privilege , like egg on one 's tie .
Nass once worked for Intel , and then got a Ph.D. in sociology , and now he writes about and lectures on the ways people think about computers .
But , before embarking on any of that , Professor Nass was a professional magician - Cliff Conjure - so he has some confidence in his abilities as a public performer .
According to Nass , who now gives PowerPoint lectures because his students asked him to , PowerPoint " lifts the floor " of public speaking : a lecture is less likely to be poor if the speaker is using the program .
" What PowerPoint does is very efficiently deliver content , " Nass told me .
" What students gain is a lot more information - not just facts but rules , ways of thinking , examples . "
At the same time , PowerPoint " lowers the ceiling , " Nass says .
" What you miss is the process .
The classes I remember most , the professors I remember most , were the ones where you could watch how they thought .
You do n't remember what they said , the details .
It was ' What an elegant way to wrap around a problem ! '
PowerPoint takes that away .
PowerPoint gives you the outcome , but it removes the process . "
" What I miss is , when I used to lecture without PowerPoint , every now and then I 'd get a cool idea , " he went on .
" I remember once it just hit me .
I 'm lecturing , and all of a sudden I go , ' God !
" The Wizard of Oz " !
The scene at the end of " The Wizard of Oz " ! ' "
Nass , telling this story , was almost shouting .
( The lecture , he later explained , was about definitions of " the human " applied to computers . )
" I just went for it -- twenty - five minutes .
And to this day students who were in that class remember it .
That could n't happen now : ' Where the hell is the slide ? ' "
PowerPoint could lead us to believe that information is all there is .
According to Nass , PowerPoint empowers the provider of simple content ( and that was the task Bob Gaskins originally set for it ) , but it risks squeezing out the provider of process -- that is to say , the rhetorician , the storyteller , the poet , the person whose thoughts cannot be arranged in the shape of an AutoContent slide .
" I hate to admit this , " Nass said , " but I actually removed a book from my syllabus last year because I could n't figure out how to PowerPoint it .
It 's a lovely book called ' Interface Culture , ' by Steven Johnson , but it 's very discursive ; the charm of it is the throwaways .
When I read this book , I thought , My head 's filled with ideas , and now I 've got to write out exactly what those ideas are , and - they 're not neat . "
He could n't get the book into bullet points ; every time he put something down , he realized that it was n't quite right .
Eventually , he abandoned the attempt , and instead of a lecture , he gave his students a recommendation .
He told them it was a good book , urged them to read it , and moved on to the next bullet point .
From the New Yorker - May 28 , 2001
Update ( March 2013 ) : C-REPL was a neat hack , but a more principled implementation of the same goal exists in Cling .
Many programming languages come with a REPL ( read - eval - print loop ) , which allows you to type in code line by line and see what it does .
This is quite useful for prototyping , experimentation , and debugging code .
Other programming languages , and especially C , use a " compile - run " model , and do n't provide a REPL .
Let 's fix that .
What you get
This approach is actually more of a read - eval loop , as c- repl does n't know much about the types and parse trees of the code it 's running .
But unlike other approaches to solving the " C interpreter " problem , c- repl works directly with unmodified libraries and system headers .
This means you can experiment with a new library without writing a test program or any bindings .
Or just use it as a simple calculator , content in knowing it is much faster than your neighbors using irb , like driving a Ferarri on city streets .
Some especially cute frosting features : - tab - completion of in - scope symbols - inspection of in - scope variables ( via the .t command )
Example Session
Here 's an example session demonstrating using c-repl :
% ./c-repl > int x = 3 > ++x > .p x int : 4 > printf ( " %d %p
" , x , &x ) 4 0xb7f1b53 c > .t fprintf fprintf ( FILE * const stream , char const * const format ) > # include < unistd.h > > getp< TAB > getpagesize getpass getpgid getpgrp getpid getppid > printf ( " %d
" , getpid ( ) ) 19094
How to get and use it
See GitHub , but c-repl is unmaintained and I do n't recommend you use it .

Disposable Personal Income as a % of GDP
On last night 's show , we discussed the vanishing savings rate ( Dismissed as unimportant by Jim Glassman ) and the Asset to Debt ratio -- which is reminscent of the same old argument in 1999 :
The asset then was equities , the asset today is real estate .
Lets now look at a different ratio :
U.S. Disposable Personal Income as a % of Gross Domestic Product ( Current $ )
Source : Mike Panzner
The total amount of money Americans have to spend after taxes relative to overall output of goods and services has hit the lowest level in 25 years .
Remember , Debts are forever , while Assets are subject to markets forces and variable pricing !

How has this Glassman guy become so famous ?
Did he tell people to get out of equities in 2000 ?
I have n't seen CNBC in a while but did n't Bernstein cohost this week or a few days this week ?
Even though he reduced his bond exposure and dumped that into stocks and cash , he 's still underweight stocks and likely upped his equity allocation because of pressure from management as so many indices are making cycle or all time highs .
Because his statements do n't jive with his actions .
He recently made the statement the earnings are the most cyclical based in 50 years and he thought we were at the earnings top .
No revelation of earnings top .
But quite a revelation in the cyclicality of the earnings .
That means earnings quality sucks and could also collapse instead of just tail off somewhat .
And the market PE is likely artificially inflated short term .
Throw in the unfunded pensions , options expensing and a few other pretty pictures including below average returns in pension investments over the next few years and you have a market that is n't so cheap .

Bush And Nixon Battle It Out ( Update )
Six months ago I graphed Bush and Nixon 's approval and disapproval ratings against each other .
With a new Gallup poll showing Bush 's approval rating at an all time low ( for Gallup ) of 34 % , I thought now would be a good time to do an update .
Note that while Bush 's approval rating is still a bit higher than Nixon 's at a comparable point in his presidency , Bush 's disapproval rating is almost exactly the same as Nixon 's just before he resigned .
In fact , at 63 % , Bush 's current disapproval rating was only exceeded by Nixon 's in two Gallup pollsÃ ƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â‚ ¬ÂMarch , 1974 ( 65 % ) and the final poll in July , 1974 just before Nixon left office ( 66 % ) .
For instance , in June , 1974 Nixon 's disapproval rating was only 58 % , noticeably lower than Bush 's is today .
I think this one is going down to the wire .
( All polls are Gallup . )
Could it be splitsville for Matthew McConaughey and Lance Armstrong , celebdom 's most visible new BFFs ?
A report today by New York Daily News ' Ben Widdicombe says that Jake Gyllenhaal has edged out Matt for the plum role of playing Lance in an upcoming film version of Armstrong 's life story , even though it 's been McConaughey who 's logged the most time with the cycling legend in recent weeks , as faithfully chronicled by TMZ .
The saga began in earnest last month at the Tour de France , where Lance and Jake ( himself an avid cyclist ) hung out together to watch the competition , fueling speculation that Gyllenhaal was preparing for a role in the Armstrong biopic being developed by Sony .
And then , in late July , the trio was spotted biking together in Malibu -- who knows how competitive that seemingly innocent ride must 've been , with Jake and Matt vying for Lance 's approval ?
Miami -- wine - shopping , clubbing , or having an intimate jog on the beach , in the rain .
Today , however , it seems that the seat of power has shifted . . . to Jake .
Where those driving directions really come from
On the ground with the modern mapmakers who tally , track and measure every road in America .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) - Mapquest said it would take 41 minutes for me to drive from Columbus Circle in Manhattan to Far Rockaway in Queens .
Google Maps estimated the trip at 39 minutes .
I looked at the route and figured it for an hour .
About an hour later , I was in Far Rockaway riding around with two of the people who create the raw material for driving directions like those spun out by Mapquest , Google and any number of portable navigation systems .
Navteq employees Christopher Arcari ( left ) and Jean Pierre Loize ( right ) with their specially equipped Ford Escape .
On a map inside the vehicle , a line of overlapping green arrows indicates our path .

Navteq supplies the raw map data that underlies those directions .
That data is n't as raw as you might think , though .
Unlike paper maps , Navteq 's digital maps have to include details about which roads are one way , which way , and things like whether left turns are illegal Monday through Friday , excluding holidays , from 7:00 a.m to 10:00 a.m. unless you 're driving a bus .
Users who rely on this data to guide them from one place to another expect an extremely high degree of accuracy .
People who use paper maps understand that their map may be old and that the map can't tell them which way they 're allowed to go at a given intersection .
People using computer programs just expect them to be right .
To check those sorts of details , Navteq relies on hundreds of Geographic Analysts like the two men I was with , Senior Geographic Analyst Christopher Arcari and Geographic Analyst I Jean Pierre Loize .
They spend about half their time driving around gathering data about every road , large and small , in their designated region of the country .
The other half of their time is spent sorting out all that data .
If you ever rely on a computer program to get you through Far Rockaway , you owe these men a good deal of thanks because , I 'll tell you , there was a lot wrong with Far Rockaway when we got there .
For starters , several blocks worth of streets were simply gone .
In what is doubtless a welcome sign of improvement for the otherwise blighted section of beachfront we were cruising through , several housing developments were going up .
Some were nearly completed and already had new streets with names like Auquatic Place and Beach Breeze Place .
Others were just fenced in plots of dirt .
Inside the white Ford Escape SUV , Arcari noted the " possible new streets " on an electronic writing pad .
As he wrote them , the words appeared overlaying a map on a computer screen attached to the vehicle 's dashboard .
Inside a locked metal box in the back of the SUV , all the changes were recorded in a laptop computer hooked up to the SUV .
The only unusual things visible from the outside of the SUV were a small white cone on top housing a high - powered satellite receiver and magnetic " Navteq " signs on the doors .
The signs could be removed to allow the SUV to travel in areas where commercial traffic is n't supposed to go .
The missing streets created a problem beyond simply making their current map inaccurate .
They also meant that the two main roads through the area were , in a routing sense , cut off from each other .
That could create a problem for you , the end user , at some point if you wanted to drive through that area .
All streets , you see , are classified by their speed limits and by a number between one and five corresponding to their suitability for long - distance driving .
A " 5 " would be a nice long stretch of interstate .
A " 1 " would be a rutted local road .
On the map displayed on the SUV 's computer screen , we could see two red roads running along for miles without connecting , then each veered off in its own direction .
That was a problem .
We had to find an appropriate road to " upgrade , " creating a link between those two roads , Rockaway Freeway and Beach Channel Drive .
We found a likely candidate in a place where the two roads veered close to one another .
Loize drove the Escape through the intersection going one way then another .
There were no signs telling us that was n't legal at any time , so there it was .
With a few pokes of his pen , Arcari upgraded the road from a " 2 " to a " 3 " .
It turned red on the map and a new bridge was created .
Then we cruised around some more , a trail of green arrows on the computer screen marking our path as we went .
A tiny video camera facing out the truck 's windshield snapped a wide - angle image every three seconds as we traveled .
The resulting images can be used to note street signs and double - check other features .
Along the way , Arcari noted road construction that needed to be checked on later .
There was a lot of road construction going on .
To do this kind of work , Loize explained to me , you have to think like a routing program .
Routing programs calculate a path based on speed limits , the suitability of roads and distance .
While Navteq supplies the raw data , the calculations are up to the routing company 's computer software .
They can't always take into account real - world traffic patterns , Arcari explained , which is one reason the results can sometimes seem a little screwy to people who drive the streets every day .
It 's also one reason my guess about how long it would take to reach Far Rockaway was so much closer than the Web sites ' estimates .
" There will always be local knowledge , " he said .
A nondescript grass discovered in the Oregon countryside is hardly an alien invasion .
Yet the plant – a genetically modified form of a grass commonly grown on golf courses – is worrying the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) enough that it is running its first full environmental impact assessment of a GM plant .
It is the first time a GM plant has escaped into the wild in the US , and it has managed it before securing USDA approval .
The plant , creeping bentgrass ( Agrostis stolonifera , carries a bacterial gene that makes it immune to the potent herbicide glyphosate , better known as Roundup . …
George C. Deutsch , the young presidential appointee at NASA who told public affairs workers to limit reporters ' access to a top climate scientist and told a Web designer to add the word " theory " at every mention of the Big Bang , resigned yesterday , agency officials said .
Mr. Deutsch 's resignation came on the same day that officials at Texas A&M University confirmed that he did not graduate from there , as his résumé on file at the agency asserted .
Officials at NASA headquarters declined to discuss the reason for the resignation .
" Under NASA policy , it is inappropriate to discuss personnel matters , " said Dean Acosta , the deputy assistant administrator for public affairs and Mr. Deutsch 's boss .
The resignation came as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was preparing to review its policies for communicating science to the public .
The review was ordered Friday by Michael D. Griffin , the NASA administrator , after a week in which many agency scientists and midlevel public affairs officials described to The New York Times instances in which they said political pressure was applied to limit or flavor discussions of topics uncomfortable to the Bush administration , particularly global warming .
Tact Filters
I came up with this idea several years ago in a conversation with a friend at MIT , who was regularly finding herself upset by other people who worked in her lab .
The analogy worked so well in helping her to understand her co-workers that I decided to write it up and put it on the web .
I 've gotten quite a few email messages since then from other people who have also found it helpful .
All people have a " tact filter " , which applies tact in one direction to everything that passes through it .
Most " normal people " have the tact filter positioned to apply tact in the outgoing direction .
Thus whatever normal people say gets the appropriate amount of tact applied to it before they say it .
This is because when they were growing up , their parents continually drilled into their heads statements like , " If you ca n't say something nice , do n't say anything at all ! "
" Nerds , " on the other hand , have their tact filter positioned to apply tact in the incoming direction .
Thus , whatever anyone says to them gets the appropriate amount of tact added when they hear it .
This is because when nerds were growing up , they continually got picked on , and their parents continually drilled into their heads statements like , " They 're just saying those mean things because they 're jealous .
They do n't really mean it . "
When normal people talk to each other , both people usually apply the appropriate amount of tact to everything they say , and no one 's feelings get hurt .
When nerds talk to each other , both people usually apply the appropriate amount of tact to everything they hear , and no one 's feelings get hurt .
However , when normal people talk to nerds , the nerds often get frustrated because the normal people seem to be dodging the real issues and not saying what they really mean .
Worse yet , when nerds talk to normal people , the normal people 's feelings often get hurt because the nerds do n't apply tact , assuming the normal person will take their blunt statements and apply whatever tact is necessary .
So , nerds need to understand that normal people have to apply tact to everything they say ; they become really uncomfortable if they can't do this .
Normal people need to understand that despite the fact that nerds are usually tactless , things they say are almost never meant personally and should n't be taken that way .
Both types of people need to be extra patient when dealing with someone whose tact filter is backwards relative to their own .
Reflections on this Essay after Ten Years
During the ten years since I wrote up the Tact Filter theory and put it on the ( then fledgeling ) web , I 've gotten quite a bit of fan mail about it .
I 've been tempted to make some minor edits ( such as substituting " geek " for " nerd " ) , but I think that 's better left to this addendum .

Практическая Психодинамика
Всем , кто интересуется динамикой психологических процессов в обществе , личности и в человеческих группа х
Amid all the brouhaha over whether I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Karl Rove , or any number of Bush administration insiders had a hand in leaking the name of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame , the essential crime at the core of the investigation  and its probable starting point  often gets lost in the shuffle .
The “ outing ” of Plame was not an end in itself : the outers did n’t just one day decide that they were going to go after her and Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson , her husband , because they were in a vindictive mood .
They were out to get them because Wilson drew attention to the provenance of the infamous “ 16 words ” uttered by President Bush in his 2003 state of the union address , in which Bush claimed that Iraq had sought out uranium in “ an African country ” in order to make a nuclear bomb .
Perhaps without knowing it , Wilson  in taking an interest in this subject  was getting too close to the enormous fraud at the center of the War Party ’s propaganda campaign .
The African country Bush spoke of is Niger , where much of the world ’s uranium is mined under the watchful eye of a French consortium  and where it would be extremely difficult , if not close to impossible , for the Iraqis to walk off with the tons of uranium required to produce weapons - grade materials .
This accountability issue was no doubt a major reason for the skepticism the Niger uranium story engendered in Ambassador Wilson , who was sent to Niger by the CIA to check out the facts  and came back with a negative report .
Wilson was therefore shocked to hear the president reiterate a claim that had been previously and definitively debunked , and went public with his mission and its results  but not before the source of that claim had been brutally and publicly refuted by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
In early October 2002 , Italian journalist Elisabetta Burba , a writer for Italy ’s Panorama magazine , delivered some documents to the U.S. embassy in Rome : a cache of letters and other papers purporting to be correspondence between officials of the Niger government and the Iraqis relating to the acquisition of uranium “ yellowcake . ”
The documents soon found their way to Washington , D.C. , where key administration officials were quick to incorporate them into their “ talking points ” for war with Iraq  and into Bush ’s Jan. 28 , 2003 speech .
When the IAEA asked to see evidence of the administration ’s contentions , they were put off , until finally the Niger uranium documents were handed over .
It took IAEA scientists just a few hours to demonstrate that the documents were not only forgeries , but were particularly crude ones at that  an amateur could have debunked them using Google .
As the Washington Post reported , one administration official ’s response was “ We fell for it . “
And how !  but that was n’t the end of it , by any means .
After all , someone had deliberately set up the American government with false information and badly embarrassed George W. Bush , who had taken the Niger uranium canard and run with it in a very public way .
An investigation was launched just as Robert Novak ’s column outing Plame appeared  mid-July 2003 .
Whoever leaked Plame ’s name and CIA affiliation was trying to scare off any further inquiries into the whole Niger uranium funny business , underscoring the key question in all this : who was behind the Niger uranium forgeries ?
Even as the FBI was following the trail of the forgers , the Italians were looking into the matter from their end .
A parliamentary committee was charged with investigating , and they issued a heavily redacted report : now , I am told by a former CIA operations officer , the report has aroused some interest on this side of the Atlantic .
According to a source in the Italian embassy , Patrick J. “ Bulldog ” Fitzgerald asked for and “ has finally been given a full copy of the Italian parliamentary oversight report on the forged Niger uranium document , ” the former CIA officer tells me :
“ Previous versions of the report were redacted and had all the names removed , though it was possible to guess who was involved .
This version names Michael Ledeen as the conduit for the report and indicates that former CIA officers Duane Clarridge and Alan Wolf were the principal forgers .
All three had business interests with Chalabi . ”
Alan Wolf died about a year and a half ago of cancer .
He served as chief of the CIA ’s Near East Division as well as the European Division , and was also CIA chief of station in Rome after Clarridge .
According to my source , “ he and Clarridge and Ledeen were all very close and also close to Chalabi . ”
The former CIA officer says Wolf “ was Clarridge ’s Agency godfather .
Significantly , both Clarridge and Wolf also spent considerable time in the Africa division , so they both had the Africa and Rome connection and both were close to Ledeen , closing the loop . ”
A veteran of the Iran - Contra scandal , Ledeen played an important role in the “ arms for hostages ” scheme by setting up meetings between the American government and the Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar .
Not all that unexpected coming from a self - proclaimed advocate of Machiavelli ’s amoralism .
Today , Ledeen is among the most visible and radical neoconservative ideologues whose passion for a campaign of serial “ regime - change ” in the Middle East is undiminished by the Iraqi debacle .
Just as the Roman senator Cato the Elder finished his perorations with the command “ Carthage must be destroyed , ” so Michael “ Creative Destruction ” Ledeen closes his hopped - up warmongering essays with “ Faster , please ! , ” an exhortation presumably addressed to his confreres in the Bush administration .
Ledeen has kept the neocon faith  and the same friends  for all these years .
He ’s still buddies with Ghorbanifar .
In December 2001 , he had a meeting in Rome with Ghorbanifar in the company of the Pentagon ’s top Iran specialist , Larry Franklin , and Harold Rhode , assigned to the Office of Net Assessment , a Pentagon think tank .
Also at the Rome conclave : a number of Ghorbanifar ’s Iranian friends , including a former senior official of the Revolutionary Guard .
Rounding out the distinguished guest list , we have the Italian delegation , consisting of SISMI head honcho Nicolo Pollari , the head of Italy ’s military intelligence agency , and Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino , a neocon favorite .
Once again , Ledeen plays the middleman  but what kind of a deal was he trying to negotiate ?
Franklin , we now know , was busy spying for Israel during this period , handing over classified information to AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman : he has been indicted and has turned state ’s evidence : the trial is set to begin in January .
To this day , Franklin maintains he was just trying to get AIPAC ’s assistance in moving a more pro-Israel agenda in policymaking circles .
Rhode is an ideologue of a similar coloration .
Together with Franklin , Rhode helped set up the Defense Department ’s Office of Special Plans , which stove - piped phony “ intelligence ” provided by Ahmed Chalabi‘s Iraqi National Congress and hyped the case for war .
Rhode and Franklin worked hand in hand with Chalabi , and , as United Press International intelligence correspondent Richard Sale reports , they had certain interests in common :
“ According to one former senior U.S. intelligence official who maintained excellent contacts with serving U.S. intelligence officials in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad , ‘ Rhode practically lived out of ( Ahmed ) Chalabi ’s office . ’
This same source quoted the intelligence official with the CPA as saying , ‘ Rhode was observed by CIA operatives as being constantly on his cell phone to Israel , ’ and that the information that the intelligence officials overheard him passing to Israel was ‘ mind - boggling , ’ this source said .
It dealt with U.S. plans , military deployments , political projects , discussion of Iraq assets , and a host of other sensitive topics , the former senior U.S. intelligence official said . ”
No wonder my source tells me that “ Fitzgerald asked the Italians if he could share the report with Paul McNulty , ” the prosecutor in the AIPAC case .
There are plenty of links between the two investigations : they are , in a sense , the same investigation , since many of the same people are involved .
McNulty is delving into a single aspect of the cabal ’s activities , while Fitzgerald seems to have broadened his probe to include not only the outing of Plame , but also the origin of the Niger uranium forgeries and other instances of classified information leakage via the vice president ’s office .
I am hardly the first to implicate Ledeen in connection with the Niger uranium forgeries .
Former CIA counterterrorism officials Vince Cannistraro and Larry Johnson have pointed the finger in Ledeen ’s direction .
As the latter put it :
“ Italy ’s SISME [ sic ] also reportedly had a hand in producing the forged documents delivered to the U.S. embassy in Rome in early October 2003 [ sic : should be 2002  Ed. ] that purported to show a deal with Iraq to buy uranium .
Many in the intelligence community are convinced that a prominent neocon with long - standing ties to SISME played a role in the forgery .
The truth of that proposition remains to be proven .
This much is certain , either SISME or someone with ties to SISME , helped forge and circulate those documents which some tried to use to bolster the case to go to war with Iraq . ”
Cannistraro , asked by an interviewer if Ledeen was involved with the forgers , said “ you ’d be very close . ”
The cast of characters involved in Niger - gate is like old home week in the government scandal sweepstakes .
Aside from Ledeen , whose storied ( or is that checkered ? ) history is well - known , we have Clarridge , first head of the Counterterrorism Center set up by Bill Casey under Reagan , who deserves a column all by himself .
His close relationship with Ledeen dates from his time as chief of station in Rome in the late 1970s .
Clarridge was indicted for lying to prosecutors during the Iran - Contra imbroglio , but given a presidential pardon .
His book , A Spy for All Seasons , was the first real “ tell - all ” book about the Agency .
During the Reagan administration , he purportedly was the intellectual author of the notorious “ Psychological Operations in Guerilla Warfare , ” a CIA how - to manual instructing the Nicaraguan contras in the fine art of terrorism , including bombings , assassinations , and violence directed at noncombatants .
It was Clarridge who came up with the bright idea of mining Nicaragua ’s harbors , which led to the unprecedented condemnation of the U.S. government ’s actions in the World Court .
He was reportedly slated to become a top counterterrorism official in the National Security Council , but was nixed .
He now lives in San Diego , Calif. , and pursues a number of business and ideological interests , including Dax Resources Corp. , which runs a 24 - hour Global Response Center and advertises its facility at kidnap prevention and counterterrorism , noting that “ we can also undertake special operations , including technical countermeasures . ”
The Niger uranium forgeries surely qualify as “ technical countermeasures , ” popping up as they did just as the administration ‘s assertions about Iraq ’s alleged nuclear ambitions and capability were being questioned .
As Seymour Hersh pointed out , CIA director George Tenet appeared at a crucial congressional briefing , on the eve of the vote on authorizing the war , and
“ Declared , as he had done before , that a shipment of high - strength aluminum tubes that was intercepted on its way to Iraq had been meant for the construction of centrifuges that could be used to produce enriched uranium .
The suitability of the tubes for that purpose had been disputed , but this time the argument that Iraq had a nuclear program under way was buttressed by a new and striking fact : the CIA had recently received intelligence showing that , between 1999 and 2001 , Iraq had attempted to buy five hundred tons of uranium oxide from Niger , one of the world ’s largest producers . ”
The story of how the Niger uranium forgeries got past all the safeguards , how the actual documents were never seen by the CIA until after the president ’s 2003 speech , and who was pushing to include a reference to Saddam ’s alleged efforts to procure uranium in “ an African nation ” as one of the president ’s major talking points  these are all subjects of interest to a prosecutor attempting to prove charges of conspiracy to lie us into war .
There must be a special law that covers government employees , including high officials , who transmit tainted information and poison the well of U.S. intelligence - gathering efforts .
I ’m sure Fitzgerald will have no trouble finding it .
Fitzgerald ’s reported interest in the Italian parliamentary report indicates just how his investigation is broadening .
The forgeries , the lies fed to us by Ahmed Chalabi and his fellow “ heroes in error , ” the leakage of vital U.S. secrets to the Iranians  all point to the existence of the conspiracy the prosecutor is tasked with uncovering .
In the course of their campaign of deception , the conspirators not only outed a CIA agent who was working in the vital area of nuclear proliferation , they also passed on classified information to foreign nationals , including the Israelis and the Iranians .
They committed forgery and God knows what other crimes .
Before Fitzgerald is done , we ’ll see the warlords of Washington hauled before a court of the people .
We ’ll hear the whole sordid story of how a band of exiles , at least two foreign intelligence agencies , and a cabal of neoconservatives inside the Pentagon and the vice president ’s office bamboozled Congress and the American people into going to war .
As the indictments come down , so will the elaborate narrative so carefully constructed by the War Party in the run-up to war be exposed as a tissue of fabrication , forgery , and fraud .
The 90 million - year - old dinosaur was excavated from a site in central Argentina
Enlarge Image
The 90 million - year - old reptile belongs to the same sickle - clawed group of dinosaurs as Velociraptor and feathered dinosaurs from China .
Buitreraptor gonzalezorum , from the Neuquén Basin in central Argentina may provide tantalising evidence that powered flight evolved twice .
Details of the discovery appear in the academic journal Nature .
One theory suggests the lineage of dinosaurs the new animal belonged to , the dromaeosaurs , originated in the Cretaceous Period ( 144 to 65 million years ago ) .
But this discovery suggests their lineage can be traced further back in time , to the Jurassic ( 206 to 144 million years ago ) , experts say .
Continental movement
It would mean dromaeosaurs were around when the present - day continents of Earth were organised into a single landmass .
This giant landmass later split into northern and southern parts , called Laurasia and Gondwana respectively .
The animal was about the size of a rooster
These include Giganotosaurus , a 13 - 14 m - long behemoth that is the largest known meat - eating dinosaur .
Until recently , the dinosaur group had only been found in Cretaceous rocks of Asia and North America , continents that were part of Laurasia .
The new discovery , named Buitreraptor , provides definitive evidence that dromaeosaurs also lived in South America - part of Gondwana .
They must have originated when all of the continents were still assembled in a single landmass - during the Jurassic .
When the landmass split in two , the dromaeosaurs diverged into northern and southern groups .
Family rift
Analysis by the authors of the Nature paper show Buitreraptor and Rahonavis , a fossil animal from Madagascar previously considered a primitive bird , form a southern branch of the dromaeosaur family tree .
This branch is distinct from Laurasian dromaeosaurids , including Velociraptor and some of the famous feathered dinosaurs from China .
Birds are commonly thought to have evolved from this group .
The authors say the discovery Rahonavis and Buitreraptor have long and wing - like forelimbs could imply that flight evolved twice , once in birds and once among this group of Gondwanan dromaeosaurs .
The specimen will be on show at the Chicago Field Museum 's Evolving Planet exhibition that opens in March .

Local 75 officers failed city drug tests Cocaine use most prevalent , raising concern Since Boston police started annual drug testing in 1999 , 75 officers have failed the tests , and 26 of them flunked a second test and were fired , newly released statistics show .
Acting Police Commissioner Albert Goslin said an additional 20 of the officers who tested positive left the department on their own , which he said is because they could not handle the frequent follow - up checks .
Of the 75 officers , 61 tested positive for cocaine , 14 for marijuana , two for ecstasy , and one for heroin , according to the figures , obtained by the Globe through a public records request .
( Some officers had more than one drug in their system ) .
Some specialists and department observers said they were alarmed by the number of officers testing positive for a ``hard " drug such as cocaine and questioned the department 's policy that allows an officer to remain on the force after a positive drug test .
An officer is not fired until a second positive test .
`` It seems like it's a chronic problem , " said Darnell A. Williams , president and CEO of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts .
`` Here we 're trying to deal with the guns and the drugs on the street level , but we have a more strident problem inside the department when we have that many people testing positive for drugs , especially cocaine . "
The department 's drug testing policy is already under scrutiny , after reports that the alleged ringleader in a corruption case tested positive for cocaine in 1999 , yet kept his job under the rules that call only for suspensions and treatment even for positive tests for drugs such as cocaine and heroin .
Unlike Boston , the New York and Los Angeles police departments dismiss officers after a first positive drug test .
Eugene O'Donnell , a former New York City police officer who is now a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice , said he believes the Boston police may have an unusually high number of hard - drug users because of its two - strikes policy .
The New York Police Department has a very low drug test failure rate because of its zero tolerance policy , he said .
`` Once you establish that people are fired , it does change the complexion , " he said .
`` If an agency says you can use drugs . . . it stands to reason you 're going to have a higher rate of people using drugs . "
While 75 Boston officers failed drug tests out of a total force of about 2,000 sworn officers since 1999 , at the much larger Los Angeles Police Department , 14 officers have flunked the drug test since March 2000 .
It employs 9,354 officers , of whom about 3,000 are subjected to random urine tests each year .
A spokeswoman for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said that of the 150,000 federal employees who took random drug tests in 2004 , 0.4 percent failed .
In 1999 , when the most Boston officers failed drug tests , the rate was more than double that , about 1.1 percent .
Goslin said the testing policy and treatment have cut the number of positive tests since then .
Boston police test for cocaine , heroin , amphetamines , PCP , and marijuana -- the standard list recommended by the federal government for workplace testing .
Officers can also be tested for other drugs with reasonable suspicion .
Officers are tested before they join the force , again while on probationary duty , then annually within 30 days of their birthday .
They are also tested if they get promoted or assigned to a special unit such as narcotics or organized crime .
If they test positive for any drug , officers receive a 45 - day unpaid suspension and must get treatment .
Once they return to duty , they are subject to random testing for three years , in addition to regular testing .
Goslin said it is not fair to compare the department to other law enforcement agencies , which he said typically use a less sophisticated urinalysis test that does not detect drugs taken more than a few days before the test .
He said the Boston police method of testing officers ' hair is more reliable and can catch drug use dating back three months .
``I would expect our rate to be higher , " Goslin said in an interview .
Los Angeles police test urine for drugs , and New York police test hair .
Goslin also said that Boston police test every officer annually , which is more regularly than many police departments , where a smaller number of officers are tested at random each year .
Therefore , he said , all officers are n't screened consistently .
The annual testing began in 1999 after years of negotiating with the city 's powerful police unions , which had objected to the tests .
In exchange for salary and benefit increases , the unions agreed to a system that gives officers warning by scheduling tests within 30 days of their birthday .
The city 's hair - testing method has also been disputed .
Fifty - seven percent of officers who failed an initial drug test since 1999 were African - American , which troubles critics who believe blacks are more likely to get false positive results because of the texture of their hair .
Last year , seven former Boston police officers -- all African - Americans who lost their jobs because of what they say were false positives -- sued the department , alleging the hair test is biased .
The suit is pending .
Goslin defended the test .
`` The science is very good and can withstand any level of scrutiny , " he said .
Goslin said he is not surprised that the vast majority of officers who failed the tests had used cocaine .
`` In the '60s it would be marijuana ; now it seems to be cocaine , " he said .
But Mark A. de Bernardo , a labor lawyer in Virginia who is executive director of the Institute for a Drug - Free Workplace , said he is startled by the number of Boston officers who used cocaine .
He said that while no one tracks national numbers on law enforcement officers who test positive for drugs , it is unusual for so many of the positive results to be for cocaine .
`` In typical drug testing , the number of marijuana positives is going to be three , four , five times the number of cocaine positives , " he said .
`` That 's alarming that cocaine would seem to be the drug of choice for the drug abusers in the Boston Police Department . "
He said the number of drug - using officers might be higher than what the testing shows because of the predictability of Boston 's annual testing .
``Anybody who fails a drug test when they know a year advance within 30 days of when it 's going to be . . . is a person who I consider to be an addict , " he said .
``I 'd assume that this is just a percentage of those that actually engage in actual drug use because it 's not true random testing . "
He also said that by giving officers a second chance , Boston police are straying from the standard set by most other employees where workers are responsible for public safety .
However , the Urban League 's Williams said he believes the department is right to give officers a second chance , especially since in many cases it seems to work .
Of the 75 officers who tested positive since 1999 , only about a third failed a second test .
Goslin said after the initial wave of positive tests in 1999 , the policy has successfully cut drug use .
``People took the policy seriously and went to get help on their own , and that caused the numbers to drop drastically , " he said .
`` And it dropped every year the policy has been in existence . "

The US has not put in place measures to limit its emissions , and the Inuit are bearing the brunt
Donald Goldberg
The Inuit Circumpolar Conference ( ICC ) claims the US is failing to control emissions of greenhouse gases , damaging livelihoods in the Arctic .
Its petition to the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights demands that the US limits its emissions .
Temperatures in the Arctic are rising at about twice the global average .
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment , a vast scientific study which took four years to compile , found that the region will warm by four to seven degrees Celsius by the end of the century , with summer sea ice disappearing within 60 years .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that impacts are already being felt , with seasonal melting leading to the collapse of buildings and a reduction in some fish stocks .
The petition , filed on behalf of the ICC by the Center for International Environmental Law ( CIEL ) , says US policies on greenhouse gas emissions are a major factor driving these changes .
" The United States is the world 's largest greenhouse gas emitter ; it has turned its back on the Kyoto Protocol and has not put in place measures to limit its emissions , " said CIEL 's senior attorney Donald Goldberg .
" The Inuit are bearing the brunt , " he told the BBC News website .
Violation of rights
The petition asks the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights to investigate the harm caused to Inuit by global warming , and to declare the US " ... in violation of rights affirmed in the 1948 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and other instruments of international law . "
If the Commission rules in favour of the Inuit , it could refer the US to the Inter - American Court of Human Rights for a legal judgement .
Both the Commission and the Court work within the framework of the American Convention on Human Rights .
As the US has not ratified the Convention , a ruling by the Commission would be largely symbolic ; but Donald Goldberg believes that does not make it worthless .
" If the Commission finds the US has violated human rights , it 's a serious matter , " he said .
" States do n't like to be classified as violators of human rights ; and in any case , there is a domestic legal mechanism called the Alien Torts Claims
Act which might allow us to use a Commission judgement in national litigation . "
The petition is the latest in a series of legal or quasi-legal cases filed against the US government and others over climate change .
The US is being asked to protect coral species threatened by climate change , Australian authorities have been forced to review procedures plans for approving coal - fired power stations , while an application in Germany would force the government to declare what greenhouse gas emissions are produced by projects supported by its export credit agency .
The biggest victory for legal campaigns on climate , co-ordinated by the group Climate Justice , came in November when a Nigerian court ordered oil companies to stop " gas flaring " - burning off gas from their oil wells .

Top court turns down Wal - Mart -- cities can ban big - box stores / Justices decline to take up appeal of Turlock ordinance 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The California Supreme Court rejected Wal - Mart 's appeal Wednesday of a ruling that allows cities and counties in the state to outlaw big - box superstores .
The April 5 ruling by the Court of Appeal in Fresno upheld an ordinance enacted in 2004 by Turlock ( Stanislaus County ) that was backed by neighborhood supermarkets and labor unions .
The court , setting a statewide precedent , said local governments can enact such restrictions to prevent the collapse of local businesses and resulting urban blight .
The state 's high court denied review Wednesday without comment .
It was Turlock 's second legal victory over Wal - Mart this month .
On July 3 , a federal judge in Fresno dismissed the company 's constitutional challenge to the ordinance , saying the city was not interfering with interstate commerce or discriminating illegally against one type of store .
Rick Jarvis , a lawyer for Turlock , said Wednesday 's state court action allows a city to " make its own land - use plans and decide for itself what 's good for the community . "
It will also " make it much more difficult for Wal - Mart to file expensive legal challenges against other jurisdictions that decide to adopt similar ordinances , " he said .
Wal - Mart spokesman John Simley said the company was disappointed but believed the effect of the Turlock law would be limited .
The appeals court ruling " is narrowly based on facts that are specific to Turlock , " he said .
He said Wal - Mart had not yet decided whether to appeal last week 's federal court ruling .
The Arkansas - based retail giant has been trying to establish a California network of discount supercenters -- stores that exceed 100,000 square feet and contain full - size grocery stores -- and has encountered resistance .
Wal - Mart estimates that 20 cities and counties in Northern California have passed ordinances seeking to limit or block the stores .
San Francisco , Oakland and Martinez have banned them .
A ban on supercenters in unincorporated areas of Contra Costa County was enacted by the Board of Supervisors in 2003 but repealed by voters in 2004 .
Alameda County supervisors then rescinded a similar ordinance , but adopted a more limited measure this March that requires big - box retailers to describe the effect of new stores on the local economy and give details of employees ' pay and benefits .
Turlock has a Wal - Mart store but responded to the company 's plans for a supercenter by passing the ordinance in 2004 .
Without mentioning Wal - Mart , the law prohibits any retail store larger than 100,000 feet that devotes more than 5 percent of its space to nontaxable items such as groceries .
The City Council said the purpose was to preserve neighborhood shopping centers .
In its April 5 ruling , the appeals court said the city 's motives were legal , even if its action hurt competition .
" While zoning ordinances may not legitimately be used to control economic competition , they may be used to address the urban / suburban decay " that can result from the entry of a large new business , the court said .
The case is Wal - Mart Stores vs. Turlock , S143488 .
A UK student is flogging pixels on a web page to help raise $ 1 m to fund his way through university .
Alex Tew , 21 , who will be reading Business Management , says people can buy the pixels to display an ad or a logo on his Million Dollar Homepage which in turn can create a link to their website .
The pixels are sold in squares of 100 to create a tiddly icon .
Larger groupings can also be bought to make logos stand out .
Tew told El Reg that the scheme was all " legit and completely above board " .
" I think this will mostly appeal to businesses and perhaps larger companies will buy up lots of pixels to have a more prominent position on the site , " he said .
Faced with the spiralling cost of tuition fees and beer , Tew said he would rather " not to be riddled with debt when I graduate , so I decided to think of a way to make money before I start " .
And if he ends up with any extra cash left after his studies he plans to plough that money into a business .
So far Tew has sold more than a 1,000 pixels , including 100 to a dating network , 100 to a marketing firm and 400 to his brother 's go - karting business .
Sheesh - what some people will do to raise a bit of cash .
Last year Bristol University student Rosie Reid raised £ 8,400 by auctioning her virginity online to help fund her education .
And there are plenty of people prepared to have logos tattooed on their bodies for some dosh , mostly from GoldenPalace.com . ®
Pablo Picasso , the first living artist to be featured in the Louvre , influenced the artistic world in a uniquely original way .
So why is he known for saying “ Good artists copy , great artists steal ” ?
It ’s true .
Picasso really said , “ Good artists copy , great artists steal . ”
Or at least , since his death in 1973 , everyone believes he said that .
But why ?
Why would someone as original as Picasso say something as ironic as that ?
And what did he mean ?
Google Picasso’s quote , and you ’ll find plenty of opinions and interpretations as to what he really meant .
My intent here , then , is to uncover one possible interpretation .
This interpretation involves three levels of design , each of which :
involves some aspect of copying or stealing , shows increasing design maturity , and adapts Picasso ’s quote to modern graphic design .
Three Levels of Design
To help you understand my reasoning , I ’ve segmented this interpretation into three levels .
Are these the only three levels of design ?
Of course not .
They ’re only a guide to help improve your design maturity as related to copying and stealing .
I ’ve included short case studies to effectively demonstrate the primary concept at each level — at least , that ’s the intent .
You be the judge as to whether or not they ’re effective examples .
Level 1 : Copy , Do n’t Create
I ’m all for being as original as possible , but a beginning Web designer ( or any designer , for that matter ) should start out by copying other well - created designs .
Gerry McGovern , Web copywriting guru , makes the same argument for writers :
One of the simplest tricks that professional writers learn can greatly ease the process of getting ready to write : look for a model of the kind of article you need to do , then dissect it , analyze it – and copy it .
. . .
Novice writers often make two mistakes : they think they need to be entirely original , and they think they need to wait for “ inspiration . ”
Take it from the pros : for most kinds of writing , originality and inspiration are overrated .
Replace the instances of “ writers ” and “ writing ” in Gerry ’s quote with “ designers ” and “ Web design ” and the message is the same : copy , do n’t create .
Surprisingly , there ’s a positive side effect to copying : conventionality .
Building on the same foundation as other sites — specifically , layout and information architecture — often leads to intuitiveness and familiarity for the end user .
By no mistake do BarnesAndNoble.com and Amazon.com have similar navigation structures .
Additionally , if your career is anything like mine , you hardly ever enjoy the luxury Michelangelo relished as he expended four long years completing the Sistine Chapel ceiling .
Often , we have only four months — more likely , four weeks .
So , in a commercial art environment such as Web design , copying is almost mandatory , given the time constraints and budget limitations we face .
Case Study
The source :
The result :
IDI ’s corporate Website , created over two years ago , exemplifies Level 1 design very appropriately .
Most of us working on the project at the time — including myself , the Art Director — had less than two years of Web design experience .
We needed a polished source to act as the foundation for the layout of our site .
After hours of searching , we found that Nike ’s Canada Website was the perfect fit .
The design style was technically appealing .
The layout architecture was simple , yet strong .
The only thing lacking was additional text to draw visitors in .
So we took Nike ’s design and ran with it .
You do n’t have to struggle to see the adapted result is close to the original source .
Level 2 : Steal From Yourself
Simply put , one of the best sources from which you can steal is yourself .
Think about it .
You probably have a folder on your hard drive that contains dozens of designs that were never used or completed .
You ’ve created designs that have been a success with clients .
And more importantly , your distinctive design style is probably a selling point for many of your clients .
Why not tap into some of the great work you ’ve created that was either unused or never fully completed ?
Or even better , reinvent some of your work that was highly successful in establishing your personal style ?
Case Study
The source :
The result :
The final design for the ARRAY Website was the result of discarded design usage .
The QuicksiteBuilder layout was created a few years ago , but never made it past the comping stage ( notice the filler text and Rubberball watermark on the comp graphic ) .
Instead of starting at ground zero with the ARRAY Website — which did make it to production — I chose to create the layout using elements from the unused QuicksiteBuilder comp design .
QuicksiteBuilder and ARRAY are similar products , making a ‘ steal ’ the ideal solution .
The style established by the photo of the woman , the headline and sub - headline , and the three column highlights were all a direct result of personal stealing .
Level 3 : Steal From Discrete Sources
A good design friend of mine , Jesse Bennett , adorns his signature on message board posts with a quote by Albert Einstein : “ The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources . ”
Perhaps the easiest way to ‘ hide ’ your sources is simply to use sources that are already hidden .
“ Picasso hardly meant that great artists steal popular designs whose original source is known to everyone , ” says Wes George , writer for The Mac Observer and financial Mac nut .
“ What Picasso did mean was that great artists rummage through the great junk heap of lost , bypassed , and forgotten ideas to find the rare jewels , and then incorporate such languishing gems into their own personal artistic legacy …
Picasso implied that great artists do n’t get caught stealing because what they appropriate they transform so thoroughly into their own persona , that everyone ends up thinking the great idea was theirs in the first place . ”
Level 3 entails the difficult process of searching through magazines , books , Websites , historical artifacts , cultural compositions and other rich design sources to locate those unused and forgotten ideas
Wes speaks of .
Case Study
The source :
The result :
Recently , I was asked to design the logo for a T - shirt to be offered to IDI ’s Quality Assurance ( QA ) department .
The design for the logo shown above was ‘ stolen ’ from MasterClips ’ vector clip art collection .
As I thumbed through the catalog , I somehow landed on the clip art shown in red .
Although created years ago , the looped design had a trendy Generation X feel to it — exactly what I was looking for , as the majority of the QA department were Gen X’ers .
The chances of someone else having used this particular piece of clip art were very slim .
And the chances of the intended audience — or anyone else for that matter — being familiar with such a piece were even slimmer .
Translation ?
A perfect source for stealing .
A Warning
This article would n’t be complete without a warning to be careful when copying well - known sources .
If I were to summarize this warning in one sentence , this would be my golden verbiage : copy the inspiration , not the outcome .
For example , since the introduction of the iMac , Apple ’s design has been inspired by a very liquid and visually tangible look and feel , coupled with a “ less is more ” attitude .
A beautifully rendered copy of the inspiration behind Apple ’s design leads to something like MailFrontier.com
At the opposite end of the spectrum , a horribly blatant copy of the outcome of Apple ’s design leads to something like uSight.com
In short , be careful what you copy , and how you copy .
Take the time to make the design your own , or you ’ll land a spot as the latest design thief on Pirated - Sites.com .
