Michelle Obama is the first lady of the United States .
This is a busy time of year in the Obama household .
Like so many parents all across this country , I watch with a mixture of pride and anxiety as my daughters stuff their backpacks , kiss me goodbye , and move ahead in another school year without so much as a backwards glance .
My girls are now making new friends , tackling challenging new subjects , and moving closer to becoming the strong , confident women I know they can be .
But when I see them come home , bursting with excitement about something they have learned or someone they have met , I can't help but think that some of the most influential people in my daughters ' lives wo n't be the ones they socialize with on the playground or read about in the pages of a book — they will be the people who stand up every day in front of their classrooms .
We all remember the impact a special teacher had on us — a teacher who refused to let us fall through the cracks ; who pushed us and believed in us when we doubted ourselves ; who sparked in us a lifelong curiosity and passion for learning .
Decades later , we remember the way they made us feel and the things they inspired us to do — how they challenged us and changed our lives .
So it 's not surprising that studies show that the single most important factor affecting students ' achievement is the caliber of their teachers .
And when we think about the qualities that make an outstanding teacher — boundless energy and endless patience ; vision and a sense of purpose ; the creativity to help us see the world in a different way ; commitment to helping us discover and fulfill our potential — we realize :
These are also the qualities of a great leader .
Today , more than ever before , we need precisely this kind of leadership in our classrooms .
As the president has frequently said , in a 21st - century global economy where jobs can be shipped to any place with an Internet connection and children here in America will be competing with children around the world for the same jobs , a good education is no longer just one road to opportunity — it is the only road .
And good teachers are n't just critical for the success of our students .
They are the key to the success of our economy .
But the reality is that with each passing year , we are losing more and more of our most experienced teachers .
More than half of our nation 's teachers and principals are baby boomers .
And in the next four years , as many as one third of America 's 3.2 million teachers could retire .
The U.S. Department of Education projects that by 2014 , just five short years from now , our nation 's schools will hire as many as 1 million new teachers .
And the challenge to our schools is not just an overall teacher shortage but a shortage of good teachers in the schools where they are most essential : high - need schools that face some of the most daunting obstacles but have students with so much potential .
We also have a shortage of teachers in subjects like math and science that we know will be critical to our children 's future .
Today , we need a new generation of leaders to take their place in our nation 's schools .
We need passionate , talented , committed men and women to step up and devote themselves to preparing our students to succeed in this new century .
We need universities to double down on their efforts to prepare teachers and to improve and expand effective alternative routes to certify teachers .
We need to encourage more experienced professionals to consider teaching as the next chapter in their careers .
And we need to treat teachers like the professionals they are by providing good salaries and high - quality professional development opportunities .
We need parents to do their part as well to match that leadership in the classroom with leadership at home .
We need to set limits and turn off the TV .
We need to put away those video games and make sure that homework gets done .
We need to reinforce the example that 's being set and the lessons being taught at school and make sure that learning continues at home .
And we need government to support significant efforts to recruit and retain teachers and to reward high - performing teachers .
Along those lines , President Obama is already investing more than $ 3 billion to turn around struggling schools .
And he has proposed a nationwide Teacher Recruitment Program to attract more people to the profession , especially in high - need schools .
I look forward to being involved with this program and encouraging people across America to put their leadership skills to work in our nation 's schools .
Much work lies ahead , and it wo n't be easy .
But I am confident that with a new generation of outstanding leaders in our classrooms , we can make a lasting difference in the lives of our young people and a lasting impact on the life of this nation .

1 . Pong is the first graphical videogame
Several graphics - based games existed before Pong .
Tennis for Two ( right ) is among the first videogames ever , and used an oscilloscope to display a bouncing ball .
This was in 1958 !
Later in 1972 , the first game “ console ” was premiered : The Magnavox Odyssey .
Its games had ultra-exciting one - word titles like “ Hockey ” and “ Invasion , ” and vector graphics that were totally rad…or swell …or whatever people said in 1972 .
Above : The Magnavox Odyssey in all its analog - ey glory ( photo courtesy of the Electronic Entertainment Museum )
Magnavox actually sued Nolan Bushnell , founder of Atari and creator of Pong , on the grounds that Pong was too similar to the Odyssey ’s Tennis game .
So not only was Pong not the first graphical game to be released ( it was also released in 1972 , but the Odyssey was being prototyped as early as 1966 ) , it was accused of patent infringement ( the case was settled out of court ) .
Above : Just look how far we ’ve come … for one thing , we no longer put wood paneling on absolutely every flat surface
And pushing aside the graphical aspect for a moment , who could forget Hunt the Wumpus ?
This landmark text - based BASIC game was created by Gregory Yob , and is among the very first computer games ever made .
It is also the only game credited to Yob , whose head is now in neurosuspension at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation .
Not making this up , his brain is frozen .
But we digress - the game was created in around 1972 ( what a year for games , right ? ) , and took the mainframes by storm .
There are twenty rooms in the game , one Wumpus ( the Wumpus is bad ) , super bats which drop the player into random rooms , and bottomless pits .
The goal is to fire an arrow into the room which contains the Wumpus without entering that room , which leads to death ( because the Wumpus is bad ) .
Oh , bottomless pits are bad too .
Okay , so it was n’t much of a game compared to modern standards , but it was more complex than anything which existed at the time , and it influenced an entire genre of adventure games , both text - based and graphical .
Those super bats even reappeared in the almighty Zork .
To reduce the origins of gaming to Pong alone is a drastic oversimplification , especially when the real history of games involvespeople being frozen in cryonics labs .
2 . Hard scientific evidence proves that violent games increase violent behavior
There have been many studies on the effects of violent videogames on the psyche , but none of them have produced concrete results .
Those who damn games just love to show us “ brain scans ” which ( they say ) indicate an increase in aggression when playing violent games .
It ’s sensational , for sure , but their conclusions are not unquestionable , and MRI studies in general are questionable , as brilliantly illustrated by this UC Santa Barbara study , in which a dead salmon was scanned to point out the necessity for some serious chance correction .
The dead fish registered apparent brain activity when shown pictures of humans interacting .
Above : Love researchers with senses of humor
And for every study which reports that violence in videogames leads to self - reported aggression or scary - looking brain scans , another study is done which concludes that there is no direct link between videogame violence and real violence .
“ The school shooting / violent video game link : Causal relationship or moral panic ? ” by researcher Christopher J. Ferguson , for example , concluded that no connection between violent videogames and school shootings has been established scientifically .
And that ’s just one of many .
Above :
We ’re going to go rent some attack helicopters later so we can mimic GTA like good products of sensational media
Jeffrey Goldstein , Ph.D. , has brilliantly ( well , he is a doctor and all ) outlined themajor criticismsof those studies which claim to have found a link between violence and videogames .
For example , how does one measure aggression ?
Not very well at all .
From Goldstein ’s essay :
It is not possible to observe real aggression in the laboratory , so researchers must improvise indirect measures and indicators of potential aggression .
Here are some of the dependent variables used in video game research :
• Hitting a bobo doll ( Schutte , Malouff , Post - Gordon & Rodasta , 1988 )
• Coding children ’s interpretations of ambiguous stories ( for example , a child is hit in the back with a ball ) .
Responses were coded for the amount of " negative and violent content " ( Kirsh , 1998 )
• Listing aggressive thoughts and feelings ( Calvert & Tan , 1994 )
• Administering blasts of white noise to an unseen person , in the ‘ teacher - learner ’ paradigm , in which errors on a ‘ learning task ’ are ‘ punished . ’
( Anderson & Dill , 2000 ; Wiegman , van Schie & Modde , 1997 ) .
• Withholding money from another .
Winkel , Novak & Hopson ( 1987 ) tested 8th grade students in a situation in which they played teacher and were to deduct money for errors made by another student .
This served as a measure of aggression .
•‘Killing ’ characters in a video game ( Anderson & Morrow , 1995 ; Ask , 1999 ; Ask , Autoustinos , & Winefield , 2000 ) .
• Time elapsed to recognize aggressive words .
In their experiment , Anderson and Dill ( 2000 ) required university students to play a violent video game for 15 minutes on 3 separate occasions , preceded and followed by cognitive ( word recognition test ) , affective , or behavioral ( white noise ) measures of aggression .
The only significant findings among these many dependent measures were with the word recognition test , which they take to represent " aggressive thinking . "
The speed with which aggression - related words are identified is said to reflect this .
The validity of this measure of cognitive schemas is dubious .
Word recognition is typically used to reflect perceptual or semantic salience ( Grainger & Dijkstra , 1996 ) , a phenomena that has no necessary connection to aggressive behavior .
Wow , sounds like really conclusive stuff : kids who play violent games kill more characters in violent games !
We ’re not saying that there is proof either way - no real conclusions about games and their connection or non-connection to real violence have been drawn yet .
Just do n’t let anyone bully you into believing that “ science has proven ” that your hobby is dangerous , because it is n’t true .
John Julius Norwich is an earnest and somewhat stiff - backed editor .
So it 's not entirely surprising that he reveals in his introduction that he is " braced for objections " over his selections for " The Great Cities in History , " a collection of essays and images .
He anticipates that readers will ask , for instance , why Timbuktu is included and not Toronto , why Meroe ( an ancient Nubian city ) is included and not Melbourne .
It 's a dull question , and Norwich answers it dully , by pointing to the " in history " part of the book 's title .
The better answer would have been that there 's not a shred of romance in Toronto and Melbourne ....
A fictionalised account of the final moments in the life of Alan Turing is to be premiered via The Independent website this weekend .
In the first collaboration of its kind between a national newspaper and an independent production company , the radio drama featuring History Boys and Desperate Romantics star Samuel Barnett portrays the Bletchley Park code breaker on his death in 1954 after eating an apple laced with cyanide following his conviction for gross indecency .
Turing ’s
Test examines the scientist ’s legacy in the field of artificial intelligence and the personal tragedy of his suicide through a deathbed dialogue with a “ machine ” played by actor Paul Kendrick .

The Made In Manchester ( MIM ) production comes amid mounting concern within the independent sector that the continued domination of the BBC is thwarting creativity in genres such as radio drama and comedy which have long enjoyed reputations for innovation both among performers and audiences .
Ashley Byrne , creative director of MIN said the newspaper website was the ideal outlet for topical short - form content and would reach out to new audiences .
“ Writers , actors and directors are frustrated by the conventional commissioning processes in TV and radio and want the chance to take risks on new work , ” he said .
Roger Alton , editor of The Independent , said Turing was a fitting subject for the play .
“ He was one of the great British heroes of the 20th century whose death is a terrible scar on British justice .
It is a great privilege to make this new drama available on The Independent web site , and is part of the great tradition of innovation which has always characterised The Independent . ”
An internet campaign to persuade the British Government to issue a posthumous pardon to Turing , who underwent brutal chemical castration “ treatment ” for his homosexuality , was signed by thousands of supporters across the world including scientist Richard Dawkins , actor Stephen Fry and novelist Ian McEwan .
The shame of the court case meant Turing was dropped from sensitive government work despite his vital war role and pioneering role at the forefront of computer science .
Gordon Brown issued a statement in Septmber condemning the official treatment of Turing as “ appalling ” .
Actor Samuel Barnett said : “ There are so many things we have to be thankful to Alan Turing for and I ’m delighted to have been given the opportunity to play him in Turing ’s Test . ”

Why are we asking this now ?
Scientists in the United States led by Renee Reijo Pera of Stanford University School of Medicine have made primitive sperm and egg cells from stem cells taken from spare human embryos left over after IVF treatment .
The emphasis is on " primitive " because they are not the fully - formed , mature sperm or eggs that are normally involved in conception .
In scientific terms these cells are " germ cells " , the immature cells that can , ultimately , give rise to sperm and eggs if they are allowed to develop further .
Why have they done this ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The aim is to understand the complicated biological processes behind the formation of human sperm and eggs .
Eventually , it may be possible to use this information to make what are called " in vitro - derived gametes " or synthetic sperm and eggs .
This would be of great benefit to men and women who cannot produce their own gametes because it would allow them to become parents of their own biological children .
But the basic scientific information gathered from this study would in any case further our understanding of how human sperm and eggs are formed , which would be very useful in terms of developing new treatments for both and male and female infertility .
What is the use of being able to make sperm and eggs from IVF embryos ?
If it becomes possible to make sperm and eggs from spare IVF embryos it shows that the technique is a viable method of producing synthetic gametes in a test tube .
However , ideally it would be important to do the same with cloned human embryos , derived from the skin cells of the person who is infertile .
This will mean that infertile men could produce their own sperm , and infertile women could make their own eggs .
It might even be possible for men to produce eggs and women to produce sperm , enabling same - sex couples to produce their own biological children with an equal genetic inheritance from each gay parent .
How far did the scientists get in making sperm and eggs ?
The germ cells of both men and women start developing early in the life of a human embryo , long before adolescence and even birth .
Dr Reijo Pera and her colleagues were able to identify the cells of the early IVF embryos that were destined to become these germ cells with the help of a green fluorescent marker gene that was only turned on in those embryonic cells earmarked for making sperm and eggs .
Dr Reijo Pera then tinkered with a number of known genes thought to be involved in germ - cell development and identified three , named DAZ , DAZL and BOULE , that are vital for a germ cell to mature into an egg or a sperm cell .
She found that the DAZL gene was necessary to transform an embryonic stem cell into a germ cell , and the two other genes were important in the later developmental stages involving a type of cell division known as meiosis , which is critical for making sperm and eggs .
Dr Reijo Pera and her team managed to get quite a long way towards making mature sperm cells resulting from meiosis , but the egg cells were at a less - mature stage with incomplete meiotic cell division .
What is meiosis and why is it so important in the formation of sperm and eggs ?
Normally , when cells divide into two , they keep the same number of chromosomes in each of the " daughter " cells .
However , the unique feature of sperm and eggs is that the number of chromosomes are halved ( to 23 in humans ) .
This is important because when the male and female sex cells fuse together during conception , the chromosomes of the fertilised egg must revert to the normal number of chromosomes , which is 46 in humans .
In other words , meiosis is a type of cell division that allows the number of chromosomes of the " mother cell " to divide in half .
So any attempt to make synthetic gametes in the laboratory has to stimulate meiotic cell division so that the resulting , synthetic sperm and the eggs each have only 23 chromosomes .
This is one of the reasons why making sperm and eggs from embryonic stem cells is so much more complicated than making the other specialised tissues of the body , such as heart muscle or brain cells , from embryonic stem cells .

What did the scientists say about their research ?
" Our goal is to understand how you make eggs and sperm , " said Dr Reijo Pera .
" We know almost nothing about human reproductive development , and this gives us a new way to investigate it .
The hope is some day to help those who are infertile .
Ten to 15 per cent of couples are infertile .
About half of these cases are due to an inability to make eggs or sperm , and yet deleting or increasing the expression of genes in the womb to understand why is both impossible and unethical .
" Figuring out the genetic ' recipe ' needed to develop human germ cells in the laboratory will give us the tools we need to trace what 's going wrong for those people . "
What did other scientists say about the research ?
One leading figure in the field , Darren Griffin , professor of genetics at the University of Kent , said : " This is a very elegant study .
Although the [ study ] describes the transformation of stem cells into cells that are akin to gametes , it is important to note that the main significance of the work is not to attempt to generate gametes for couples who do not produce them naturally .
Rather , the work describes a system in which various aspects of germ - cell development can be studied in a dish , rather than relying on animal models or removing bits of people 's gonads . "
Allan Pacey , lecturer in andrology at Sheffield University , said : " Ultimately , this may help us to find a cure for male infertility .
Not necessarily by making sperm in the laboratory , which I personally think that is unlikely , but by identifying new targets for drugs or genes that may stimulate sperm production to occur naturally .
This is a long way off , but it is a laudable dream . "
So how far off are we from synthetic sperm and eggs , and what are the ethical implications ?
Some commentators believe it is at least five years away .
Other studies in mice have shown that it is possible to produce viable sperm , but synthetic eggs could be more of a problem .
One study purporting to produce human sperm earlier this year had to be retracted because of editing errors in the scientific paper , although the scientists involved believe the science itself was sound .
As regards the ethics , the law in Britain currently bans the use of synthetic gametes in IVF treatment .
But if they are shown to be safe , or at least as safe as naturally - produced sperm and eggs , there should be no overwhelming scientific objection to their use for treating male or female infertility .
However , many people may not be happy with the idea allowing same - sex couples to use he technique in order have their own biological children .
Should we welcome the idea of making human sperm and eggs in a test tube ?
Yes ...
* It offers the hope of children for both infertile men and women who cannot make their own gametes
* Even if scientists do n't make eggs and sperm , our understanding of infertility will be advanced
* One day it might lead to same - sex couples having their own biological children
No ...
* This research is based on studies with human embryos and as such it is unethical
* It will lead to future develpments in this field that many will find unwelcome
* It is tinkering with nature and in any case the world is already suffering from human overpopulation
Brooke has her note .
I have mine .
They are tucked away in our briefcases ; always with us , never out of reach .
I found mine in the black backpack that we took to Elena ’s wish trip .
Brooke found her letter in the side pocket of her briefcase , where Elena had put it many months before .
These are two of many letters that Elena hid for us in the last nine months of her life — some hidden between books on the bookshelf , in the corners of our dresser drawers , or between dishes in the china cabinet .
Each note deliberately left professing her love for her family .
They are constant reminders of her determination and her inspiration .
She knew somehow that one day we would need them to continue .

Reborn in Christ is among a growing number of evangelical churches in Brazil that are finding ways to connect with younger people to swell their ranks .
From fight nights to reggae music to video games and on - site tattoo parlors , the churches have helped make evangelicalism the fastest - growing spiritual movement in Brazil .
Evangelical Christian churches are luring Brazilians away from Roman Catholicism , the dominant religion in Brazil .
In 1950 , 94 percent of Brazilians said they were Catholic , but that number fell steadily to 74 percent by 2000 .
Meanwhile , the percentage of those who described themselves as evangelicals grew by five times in that period , reaching 15 percent in 2000 .
A new government census is due out next year .
Despite Brazil ’s deep connection to Catholicism , more and more Brazilians want to experiment and choose their own religion , said Silvia Fernandes , a professor at the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro , who wrote a book about Brazil ’s evangelical movement .
She said more Brazilians were attracted to evangelical churches , or Pentecostalism , for the “ flexibility of the religious expression . ”
They see churches like Reborn as places where they can express themselves more freely , and “ not only look for solutions to personal problems , but also find a place to meet and socialize . ”
Pastor Meira said that for young people seeking salvation , evangelism could fill a void .
“ Here they enter the church , sometimes to see a fight competition , they receive the word of Jesus Christ , and they begin a transformation .
They will get off drugs , start to respect their parents and start to cure the illnesses of the soul , like anxiety , depression , drugs and alcohol , prostitution , ” he said .

PITTSBURGH - A suburban Pittsburgh man slept soundly as his home caught on fire and partially collapsed .
It was n't until firefighters did a walk - through of the home more than two hours later that he woke up .
Ross Township Fire Marshal John Reubi says he was " flabbergasted " that anyone survived the blaze .
It broke out around 2:40 a.m. Sunday and was reported by a passer - by .
Firefighters were initially unable to search for victims because part of the roof collapsed .
After controlling the fire , firefighters walked through and found the man in a bedroom .
Reubi says it appeared the man had no idea what was going on .
Officials say the house had several additions , perhaps shielding the man 's room from flames .
He was treated for smoke inhalation .
AN INNOVATIVE way to unclog our roads or a Big Brother plan to keep watch over motorists ?
That is the debate sparked by a paper recommending vehicles be forced to carry a tracking device so they could be charged extra for driving on main roads and during peak hour .
The proposal to introduce so - called telematic technology was one of the policy ideas to combat congestion , recommended by La Trobe University academics , Harry Clarke and David Prentice , in a paper commissioned by the Treasury review into taxation .
The devices - similar to those used in truck fleets - would feed information to a database that would then levy charges , which would vary according to vehicle type , the road being used and the time of day .
Dr Prentice said that by charging more for busier roads and during peak hours , motorists would change their travel habits and ease congestion , which is projected to cost $ 20.4 billion by 2020 unless action is taken .

Here are some Statutory Instruments which show that the benighted National Identity Register and Scheme is creeping ahead slowly , presumably starting to come into force for the airside workers at Manchester and City of London airports after the 20th October 2009 :
SI 2009 No. 2574 - The Identity Cards Act 2006 ( National Identity Registration Number ) Regulations 2009
(2) A National Identity Registration Number shall provide no information in respect of a person other than that an entry in the Register has been made and that the entry has been given that number .
( 3 ) The process by which a National Identity Registration Number is given to an entry in the Register shall have no regard to any other reference number or code assigned to the person in respect of whom the entry has been made .
Note the wording " ... shall provide no information in respect of a person other than ... " and " ... no regard to any other reference number or code assigned to the person .. "
Will this force the NIRN to be properly random , using well established cryptographic hash techniques ?
Or will the Home Office repeat the disaster of the having number series sequences grouped around the date of issue , which provided a way into breaking the on on - chip encryption of say the first version of the United Kingdom Biometric Passport , allowing it to be read remotely and to be be cloned
See the Wikipedia article section on Biometric Passport Attacks
There cannot be a simple counter which is incremented sequentially as each new ID Card is issued , and there must be no Office Location prefixes or series which distinguish say the Manchester Airport numbers from the London City Airport Numbers etc .

We wonder if the people working for these companies realise that the badly draughted Identity Cards Act 2006 section 29 Tampering with the Register makes them criminally liable , with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and / or an unlimited fine , for the slightest error in hardware or software or configuration , i.e. any " conduct "
where it makes it more difficult or impossible for such information to be retrieved in a legible form from a computer on which it is stored by the Secretary of State , or contributes to making that more difficult or impossible .
and where
* " conduct " includes acts and omissions ; and
* " modification " includes a temporary modification .
It also applies to non UK citizens , and to conduct outside of the United Kingdom i.e. the whole universe .
These criminal penalties trump any of the Terms and Conditions in the small print of any ( civil law ) Contract signed by these companies with the Home Office
No less a legal authority than Baroness Scotland of Asthal , who is now the Attorney General ( mired in scandal by her own illegal worker documentation legislation and also over second home expenses claims ) , confirmed , when she was the Home Office Minister steering the Identity Cards Bill 2005 through the House of Lords , that the wording of this clause ( which has passed unchanged into law under the Identity Cards Act 2006 ) , would make it illegal for Trades Unionists and others working on the the National Identity Register / Scheme systems , from taking any " industrial action " such as going on strike .

Oct. 16 , 2009 ( Baltimore ) --
Researchers believe that there may be a link between a vaccine against cervical cancer and a rapidly progressive , fatal disease in two young women .
Both the timing of the symptoms and autopsy results “ suggest a link between ” the Gardasil vaccine and the fatal cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease , says Catherine Lomen - Hoerth , MD , director of the ALS Center at University of California San Francisco Medical Center .
With only two confirmed cases , “ we do n’t know for sure if it ’s coincidence or if they ’re connected [ to the vaccine ] , ” she tells WebMD .
“ We hope that by raising awareness , we will become aware of any other cases . "
Pam Eisele , a spokeswoman for Merck & Co. , which makes the vaccine , says the company cannot comment specifically on the cases as it has not seen the data .
“ However , after carefully reviewing all the information available to us about reported adverse events , including reports of deaths , Merck does not believe these events have been caused by Gardasil , ” she says .
The vaccine has been given to more than 7 million girls and young women nationwide .

Abstract
This paper traces the history of the development and use of the Open Source TeX typesetting program .
This software was developed over three decades and came into competition with a variety of open - source and proprietary alternatives .
TeX was an early and very successful open - source project that imposed its standards in a particularly competitive environment and inspired many advances in the typesetting industry .
While developers working under proprietary and open - source licenses responded to different sets of motivations , this did not mean they could abstract from each other 's development decisions .
The development of each type of software evolved in a symbiotic way .
The strengths and weaknesses of both development methods were starkly revealed in the process .
A pattern of semi-altruistic open - source development emerged , whereby developers considered non-developers ' needs in order to make TeX more attractive to a broader audience and more competitive vs. proprietary alternatives .
Self - use motivations for development were complemented by direct and indirect network effect considerations .
This paper contributes to a better understanding of the long - term welfare effect of the emergence and growing importance of open - source development methods .
That is what the US Department of Labor is saying to everyone and anyone who wants to get their foot in the door .
You are SOL .
There is no such thing as an unpaid intern anymore .
Our government at its finest .
This summer , in response to the changing sports media landscape , I wanted to create a “ media pool ” for the Mavs .
I wanted to assemble a group of unpaid interns that would acquire video , write game reports , track unique stats , do interviews , interact with fans , and then compile all of this incremental media and provide it free to any and every outlet we could think of .
If a middle school newspaper or website wanted up to the minute Mavs reports , check .
We had em .
Social networks ?
All the content you need .
Of course we would update our Mavs.com , mavswiki.com , friends .
mavs.com websites and offer the content to any and every blogger out there .
The good news is that we would create fresh content and make it available in realtime .
Call it “ Event Driven ” media .
The bad news is that there was no way we were going to be able to charge for it .
Nor was there any assurances that we could generate enough traffic for the content that we could reasonably believe that we could earn any advertising revenue .
In fact , it probably would have cost us more to try to sell advertising via ad networks ( contracts , monitoring , reports ) than we could recoup in ad revenues .
Given we were lightyears from this being a self sustaining business , and that with the economy in the shitter we didnt have excess financial resources to subsidize this effort , I decided to use unapid interns .
One silver lining of a “ great recession ” that we are now in is that there are a lot of incredibly talented people without jobs , or who have lost their jobs .
I did n’t care if they were 18 years old or 73 years old .
I thought we could assemble a talented group who would enjoy the internships and could also gain valuable experience to add to their resumes .
When the economy opened up , one of two things would hopefully occur .
We were generating revenue from this effort and we could hire them , or they had just built up their resumes and improved their chances of finding a paying job .
Makes sense right ?
Wrong .
Enter the US Government .
This is what our HR person , who his supersmart and really knows his stuff came back with
“ The law says that interns have to be paid unless they are perfoming work that is of no value to the organization ; ie. , helps them in some way but we get no benefit from their work .
Thus we would have to create work that is useless to us if we choose not to pay them .
How silly is that ? ”
Silly indeed .
My response :
“ So u r sayin g there r no legally unpaid interns in the state or country ? ”
This is what he sent me , proving that our government was truly ridiculous :
Unpaid Internships – Common but Illegal
A common , but frequently unreported labor violation is the use of unpaid interns in violation of minimum wage and possibly overtime laws .
The scenario is fairly typical : a company offers an opportunity to ‘ break into the business ’ in exchange for the intern working for free .
You see many examples of this in the entertainment industry .
In fact , despite jobs sites such as Craigslist prohibiting the posting of unpaid “ internships , ” you can almost always find one posted .
Some companies try to get around the law by requiring that the internship be part of a college program .
However , there is no exception to the law allowed just because the “ intern ” may receive college credit .
While it might be possible for a college credit course to require some type of training for a company , the vast majority of these internships are in violation of Federal as well as California labor laws .
In order to qualify as an unpaid internship , the requirement is simple : no work can be performed that is of any benefit at all to the company .
That is , you can not deliver mail , sort files , file papers , organize a person ’s calendar , conduct market research , write reports , watch television shows and report on them , read scripts , schedule interviews , or any other job that assists the employer in any way in running their business .
Examples of internships that have been legal are where the job is a “ dummy ” job .
For example , there was a case of an internship for working on a train .
The company had the interns driving trains from one end of their yard to the other under close supervision .
The moving of the trains was completely unnecessary and was just being done to train the potential employees .
As such , no “ work ” was being performed , so the internship was legal .
On the other hand , if the workers were moving the trains as part of the regular re-positioning of the trains , but were still performing it under close supervision , they would be required to be paid for the work .
Thus , if in the entertainment industry , you read scripts that have already been read and rejected by the company and the company will not use your input in any way but is simply instructing you on how to read scripts , then they would not need to pay you for your time .
However , if you read the scripts and perform any work that is used by anyone in the company to make any type of decision about that script , then you must be paid for your time .
Another common type of unpaid internship is in martial arts schools that require students to teach classes in order to receive additional belts .
This practice is illegal unless the student is paid for the time .
Because the act of teaching a class is work that benefits the employer , it must be paid for .
The U.S. Department of Labor has outlined a list of criteria that ALL must be met in order for an internship to be unpaid .
The training , even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer , is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school ;
The training is for the benefit of the trainee ;
The trainees do not displace regular employees , but work under close observation ;
The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer ’s operations may actually be impeded ;
The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the training period ; and The employer and the trainee understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training .
From the above list , # 4 is really the key one – all the others will follow from whether the employer derives any immediate benefit from the activities .
The main reason that you do not see more lawsuits regarding unpaid internships is that the interns are very unlikely to sue .
In most cases , they fear being blacklisted , as they will undoubtedly need to use the internship as a reference to get any future work .
This is where California ’s Private Attorney General Act comes in .
Because this law allows anyone at the company to sue for labor violations , even if they themselves are not affected by the violation , it is now possible for these companies to be brought into compliance with the law .
If you work for a company that uses unpaid interns and would like to put an end to this illegal practice , you should consider bringing a Private Attorney General cause of action .
Of course , if the internship is work , not only minimum wage must be paid , but also California overtime ( 8 in a day / 40 in a week ) as well as meal and rest breaks .
Welcome to the USA of the 2009 .
Where the government , both Republicans and Democrats , thinks that doing nothing is a far better alternative than being productive and gaining experience !
Where our politicians would rather see you pay out of your pocket to go back to school rather than get valuable on the job experience .
If you are in a position where you think an unpaid internship would benefit you and your career , please contact your local state representative and senator and let them know how stupid you think this law is .
And in the meantime , for all of you who have been sending me emails asking for an unpaid internship and telling me how valuable the experience would be to you .
Now you know why I dont respond .

While we were watching that shiny balloon last week , the internet was abuzz over the news that deep - space exploration just became much faster — and more likely .
It ’s what Zandar , Mighty Destroyer of Stupid , calls an “ Epic Civ4 Technology Win . ”
Two developments coincide to make this possible .
The first is called a “ plasma rocket . ”
While that sounds very Star Trek-y , it ’s actually a new variation on the “ ion engine ” propulsion system proposed by Werner Von Braun ’s colleague Hermann Oberth and first used on the Deep Space 1 mission .
But the VASIMR engine ( Variable Specific - Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket ) is much faster .
Here ’s a short video of one being test - fired at an Ad Astra lab :
Basically , the VASIMR engine creates plasma .
That ’s really , really hot matter .
It ’s so hot that it provides thrust .
It ’s enough to provide a gentle nudge in gravity , but in the vacuum of space it ’s enough to accelerate .
Plus , you do n’t use fuel nearly as fast as a chemical rocket .
So the plasma rocket wo n’t get your spaceship off the ground by itself .
You still need an old - fashioned liftoff rocket .
But once in orbit , this new rocket can do a neat trick : by combining the VASIMR plasma rocket with the Earth ’s gravity to create a slingshot effect , it can cut transits to Mars down to just thirty - nine days .
That ’s fast enough to think about putting humans on Mars .
Surprisingly , or perhaps not , there are plenty of scientists who would like to go .
Automated lunar tugs could resupply a moon base or pre-position supplies for a Mars base , making human travel more possible and safer .
In fact , the entire solar system is more open to exploration .
With better thrust , deep - space probes can take more equipment and solve some real mysteries .
Here ’s a sample animation of a mission to Titan , Saturn ’s moon , using both new technologies :
The new engine was designed by former NASA astronaut Ronald Chang - Diaz in cooperation with NASA .
Scientists at Ad Astra ’s Houston laboratory have focused on building the engine ’s power while Costa Rica works on endurance .
Globalization is critical in getting humans off this lone rock .
As for what lies beyond the solar system …well , there have been some developments .
And what do you know …we CAN build a flying saucer !
It must have seemed a routine assignment for one of the Daily Mail 's star columnists : a catty take on the death of Boyzone star Stephen Gately which pandered to the prejudices of its readers .
But the paper was forced to withdraw advertising from part of its web site after an extraordinary internet campaign prompted by a Jan Moir article questioning the role Gately 's lifestyle and sexuality played in his death last Saturday .
Marks & Spencer was among the major firms whose adverts were taken down following outrage at Moir 's article , headlined " There was nothing ' natural ' about Stephen Gately 's death " .
Complaints poured in to the Press Complaints Commission at the fastest rate in its history , causing its website to crash .
The Mail also removed adverts for Nestle , Visit England , Kodak and National Express .
Moir wrote that the circumstances surrounding Gately 's death at 33 " are more than a little sleazy " and told how he and his civil partner , Andrew Cowles , had taken a Bulgarian man to their flat in Mallorca after a night clubbing , and that Gately reportedly smoked cannabis on the night he died .
She said : " Under the carapace of glittering , hedonistic celebrity , the ooze of a very different and more dangerous lifestyle has seeped out for all to see . "
A postmortem on Tuesday showed that Gately died of natural causes .
A court official in Mallorca said the singer suffered a pulmonary oedema , an accumulation of fluid on the lungs .
Moir 's article , published on the eve of the singer 's funeral in Dublin , sparked a storm of protest on the internet , led by Stephen Fry and Derren Brown on the messaging site Twitter , on which they have a combined following of almost one million .
Fry wrote : " I gather a repulsive nobody writing in a paper no one of any decency would be seen dead with has written something loathsome and inhumane .
Disgusted with Daily Mail 's Jan Moir ?
Complain where it matters .
She breaches 1,3,5 & 12 of the code . "
By this evening the PCC had handled 1,000 emails and calls complaining about inaccuracies , insensitivity to Gately 's family and alleged homophobia .
The PCC 's deputy director , Stephen Abell , said officials contacted Boyzone 's PR company yesterday " to let them know what had happened and to make themselves available if they wanted to complain " .
The names and numbers of the corporate advertisers on the article 's web page were posted on a Facebook group called " The Daily Mail should retract Jan Moir 's hateful , homophobic article " .
" We have asked the Daily Mail to move our advert away from the article , " said a spokesman for Marks & Spencer .
Asked why , he said : " That is a matter for the Daily Mail . "
A spokesman for Nestle said it had received several complaints , and added : " The views in the article are not shared by Nestle .
We have always emphasised the importance of mutual respect and tolerance . "
James Bromley , Mail Online managing director , told New Media
Age magazine that the decision to remove the ads was taken by Mail Online after it " saw the strong reaction " .
As outrage grewtoday , the Mail changed the headline on Moir 's piece to " A strange , lonely and troubling death … " and late this afternoon Moir published a clarification of her article .
" When I wrote that 'he would want to set an example to any impressionable young men who may want to emulate what they might see as his glamorous routine , ' I was referring to the drugs and the casual invitation extended to a stranger , " she said .
" Not to the fact of his homosexuality .
In writing that 'it strikes another blow to the happy - ever - after myth of civil partnerships '
I was suggesting that civil partnerships – the introduction of which I am on the record in supporting – have proved just to be as problematic as marriages . "
She questioned how many of those complaining about her piece had read it completely and said that she had been subject to " a heavily orchestrated internet campaign " .
" I think it is mischievous in the extreme to suggest that my article has homophobic and bigoted undertones , " she said .
At times , reaction on the internet became disturbing .
Moir 's home address was reportedly posted , and the false allegation that the Daily Mail had claimed Gately had been murdered by his partner was repeated on Twitter .
Moir has previously employed innuendo when commenting on homosexual public figures .
In an article in August about Peter Mandelson , the business secretary , she wrote that " with his blue suede shoes , his peach mansion and his green tea devotionals , he is like a rock star camping it up on a farewell tour " , and said he has spent years " clawing his way up the soil pipe of politics " .
Gately 's body arrived back in Dublin from Palma airport today .
The remaining members of Boyzone are expected to sing at his funeral at St Lawrence O'Toole Church .
Gately came out in 1999 after a security guard for Boyzone went to a tabloid newspaper about his sexuality .

I 've made this twice now .
I bought the smallest cat box I could find and the first time it barely covered the bottom .
The second time I made up 2 vanilla cake mixes and one chocolate and it filled the pan alot better .
Also the second time I added the pudding before it set and it was alot easier to mix .
It was a big hit both times however got lots of laughs .
I would love to meet the twisted mind who first thought it up ... genius .

We laughed the entire time making this cake .
We could n't believe how " real " it looked !
We followed others advice : no liner peanut butter sandwich cookies cheese cake pudding and crushed up butterfinger bars in cake .
Use the 4 inch long tootsie rolls and mircrowave for about 15 - 20 seconds .
Let them set a few minutes and then take off the plate .
They only needed a little shaping .
It ended up tasting pretty good !
You will never have more fun making a cake !

Got gross reviews and that 's what it 's meant for right !?
This is the second time I 've made this and to make it more tasteful I used two boxes Marble cake mix and two chocolate ready made pudding containers .
I also used a tub of Creamy Fudge frosting which I microwaved and mixed with the pudding .
This definitely moistened it and made it taste more like " chocolate cake " than dried cake with some pudding globs .
I took the leftover frosting and drizzled on top of the cake before putting the cookie crumbs on it .
You could use any type of cake mix and frosting because it 's basically hidden underneath the cookie crumbs anyway .

Rating : 3 stars Overall this recipe was a great effect .
It really " grossed " everybody out but it really was tasty .
But it was n't as realistic on the first try so I made some changes to the recipe .
First I got rid of the chocolate cake mix and opted for another white mix .
Then I used Oreo cookies instead of vanilla creams .
I still used a few vanilla creams with the green food coloring mixed in .
And lastly I sprinkled the whole thing with powdered sugar to mimic the baking soda that lots of folks put in their litter boxes .

The pan is almost empty .
The cake tasted great and was perfect for the kids but of course the real knock - out was the way it looked .
It was truly disgusting and had the parents gagging and snickering .
I used Little Debbie brownies rolled into poop - shapes instead of tootsie rolls which I thought would harden too easily .
They looked even more realistic than the tootsie rolls .
I also used an entire cup of cookie crumbs dyed green for the topping and it looked really authentic .
Great recipe !

The Not -So - Great Mall of China : Welcome to the world 's largest ( and loneliest ) shopping centre
It was trumpeted as the world 's largest retail mall , with shoppers able to browse through 1,500 stores , take a stroll along a mock Venetian canal or even have lunch in front of an 85ft replica of the Arc de Triomphe .
But the New South China Mall , which opened in 2005 , stands empty with 99 per cent of its shops having remained unleased and attractions including a 553 - metre indoor and outdoor roller coaster standing idle .
It was designed to attract an average of more than 70,000 visitors a day to the city of Dongguan , but has less than a dozen shops in its 9.6 million sq ft of floor space .
Abandoned : The New South China Mall is the largest in the world , with space for 1,500 stores , but has less than 12 shops
Just before it opened the mall , which is located in China 's southern Pearl River Delta , it was heralded by the New York Times as part of ' China 's astonishing new consumer culture ' .
The mall 's developer , Hu Guirong , sent a team travelling around the world for two years in search of ideas .
It features seven zones modelled on different parts of the world , including a replica of the bell tower of St Mark 's Square in Venice , as well and area dedicated to downtown San Francisco .
Eerie : Shop workers walk underneath a 550 m rollercoaster in the deserted amusement centre
Vast : A man on a tricycle passes a Russian - styled triumphal arch at the 9.6 million sq ft shopping centre
Attraction : A bored attendant makes a phone call next to the ghost train ride at the mall
David Hand , a retail analyst at Jones LaSalle in Beijing , said : ' They set out to the be the biggest , and hoped that being the biggest would be the attracting factor .
' It has n't delivered .
' The Chinese love shopping , they love brands , and they love international products , even though the average income is low .
' New shoppers are born everyday .
We wo n't run out of them . '
Run down :
The mall sign stands unlit and , right , an abandoned gondola on the mock Venetian canal
Continental :
The mall also features a Venetian canal , replica of the Arc de Triomphe , downtown San Francisco and themes from Las Vegas
China has been hit hard by the global recession , and the city of Dongguan is known for its popularity with low - paid factory workers .
The only occupied areas of the mall are near the entrance , where several Western fast food chains sell burgers next to an abandoned go - kart track .
Dick Groves , a retail consultant based in Hong Kong , said the failure of the New South China Mall was down to inexperience in leasing business and an undisciplined financial system .
' When it 's easy to get financing without having to convince someone of the project 's feasability , and without having to show pre-leasing commitment , you can start to get into trouble , ' he told The National .
Failure : Only Western fast food restuarants have survived at the mall 's entrance
Fun fair : A family look at a pirate ship ride in the mall 's amusement centre , which does attract some visitors
Around 500 new malls have been built in China over the last five years .
“ I wondered about the explorers who ’d sailed their ships to the end of the world .
How terrified they must have been when they risked falling over the edge ; how amazed to discover , instead , places they had seen only in their dreams . ”

Derek Sivers is no longer saying “ yes ” to projects he ’s only sort of interested in – it ’s either “ HELL YEAH ” or “ no . ”
Now that ’s a mantra to live by - “ HELL YEAH ” or “ no . ”
Do what you love .
Work on projects you believe in .
Be passionate about everything you do – and do n’t commit to anything you are n’t prepared to fully throw yourself into .
His philosophy is simple , and I love it because it falls in line with my latest push to let go of some commitments .
Before applying it to every decision , though , I want to discuss why Derek Sivers undertook this new philosophy and then consider this – does this philosophy lead us to pass up opportunities we really should be saying “ yes ” to ?
Where It All Began – Why “ HELL YEAH ” or “ no ” ?
The whole premise of “ HELL YEAH ” or “ no ” is Sivers has “ taken on too much .
Saying yes to less is the way out . ”
The specific example he used was three conferences that were going to require 12 days of his time , along with expensive flights and hotel stays .
After initially committing to these conferences , he later realized was n’t that excited about attending them .
My read of his analysis was as follows :
He had signed up for three conferences and “ had said yes to all of them out of habit or obligation ” ( “ yes ” ) .
He later realized he was not completely enthusiastic about attending , and that they were going to suck up valuable time and money for him to be there .
) .
He later realized he was not completely enthusiastic about attending , and that they were going to suck up valuable time and money for him to be there .
He had another project he was passionate about and really wanted to work on ( a “ HELL YEAH ” )
)
He found time for his project by canceling his attendance at said conferences ( “ no ” )
Laid out like this , I agree with his analysis and can see the reasoning behind his actions .
When Is “ HELL YEAH ” or “ no ” Appropriate – And When Is It Not ?
If you ’re busy , overwhelmed with commitments and have trouble finding a moment to breathe in your jam - packed day – then I absolutely agree you should ask yourself whether that new project is a HELL YEAH .
If you ’ve already got a ton of things going on , there ’s no reason to commit to yet another project if you ’re not passionate about it – there ’s no way you ’ll find time for it .
On the other hand , if your time is not being utilized at a high rate , before using HELL YEAH ( or a lack thereof ) as a determining factor , ask yourself – am I going to do something productive with the time I save by not taking on this project , or is this just a cop out ?
You do n’t have to say yes to everything that comes your way – but I would at least consider dipping your toes in if you do n’t have a better option .
Do n’t Write It Off Just Because You Don’t Think It’s A HELL YEAH
I do n’t advocate everyone attempting to do everything – but I do think it ’s important to choose to live your life .
We do a great disservice to ourselves when we shut out opportunities , just because we assume we would not be interested in them .
I have a number of personal examples , and I ’ll share a few .
When I first started running , it was n’t a HELL YEAH – it was just something I tried out for a couple weeks .
Now for years I have run 3 - 6 times a week and love using it as an excuse to take a break from my computer to go get some air – and inspiration .
When I first started developing software as a hobby , it was n’t a HELL YEAH – it was just be fooling around with some code and programming .
That led to me majoring in Computer Science , earning a Master ’s degree in Computer Science , and having a successful career as a software engineer where I ’ve met incredibly intelligent people and been part of some amazing projects .
In fact , just about every important hobby in my life from guitar to yoga to weight training started out as something I had a small interest in , and grew into being a part of who I am .
If you want to really consider what might never have been , you might be interested to know that even Steve Wozniak , Steve Job ’s cofounder , did n’t initially want to leave HP to start Apple :
“ … I told Mike and Steve that I would n’t leave HP , ” recalls Woz .
“ My love was n’t starting a company and making money , it was designing computers and writing software .
Things I could do without a company .
I loved HP and wanted the greater job security .
Steve went into a frenzy and had my relatives and friends call me and convince me that it was OK to start a company and just be an engineer . ”
The Flip Side To HELL YEAH – Time For HELL WHY NOT
So , do n’t commit to projects when you ca n’t do them justice – and if you are overwhelmed , then I think a “ HELL YEAH ” or “ no ” analysis is the right choice for you .
Until you get to the point where you simply cannot spend even a few moments trying something new , however , I say ask yourself instead :
HELL WHY NOT ?
“ Hey , want to meet up for some coffee ? ” “ Oh , well I ’m kind of in the middle of some things … HELL WHY NOT , sure I ’ll come . ”
, sure I ’ll come . ”
“ Hey , let ’s go check out this band I like . ”
“ It ’s really not my thing …HELL WHY NOT it ’s just a concert . ”
If you do n’t have a HELL WHY NOT , maybe it ’s time for you to start saying yes .
Even if it is just a meek yes .
Even if it is just a “ let ’s see where this goes ” yes .
You never know what opportunities are passing you by – so grab them when they come your way and see where they take you .
The price of gold has hit a new all - time high of $ 1,043.77 an ounce after a decline in the dollar boosted the attractiveness of metals to investors .
Copper prices also rose above $ 6,000 a tonne , as the weaker dollar made metals cheaper for non-US investors .
The dollar fell after a newspaper report - later denied - said that Gulf nations wished to replace the greenback as the main oil currency .
The rise in metal prices lifted shares in mining firms .
Mining stocks were among the biggest risers on the UK's main FTSE 100 share index , with Fresnillo adding 10 % and both Kazakhmys and Vedanta up 9 % .
Dollar influence
Now a lot of investors are buying gold because they are concerned about the impact of higher inflation
Adrian Ash , head of research at UK gold brokerage BullionVault.com
Dollar falls on oil plan report Check live commodity prices Analysts said concern about the possibility of higher inflation in the US as its economy recovers was another factor in lowering the price of the dollar , further boosting the appeal of gold .
The last time the spot price of gold hit a new high was in March 2008 , when it reached $ 1,032.80 an ounce .
Analysts said the price of gold could rise still further towards the end of the year if the dollar remained weak .
The price of gold is also typically strong in the October to December period because of the higher demand for jewellery in the run-up to Christmas and the Indian festival of Diwali .
Demand for gold is currently strong in India , and Indian communities around the world ahead of the festival of lights , which this year falls on 17 October .
This is because gold jewellery is typically given as presents .
Haven purchase Adrian Ash , head of research at UK gold brokerage BullionVault.com , said a growing number of private investors were buying the precious metal as a haven against both instability in the financial markets and fears over inflation .
" The bottom line is that after Northern Rock and the wider crisis in the financial markets , more and more people really started to move into gold , " he said .
" Gold is a physical investment , they own it outright , so they are not exposed to any bank 's financial survival .
" Now a lot of investors are buying gold because they are concerned about the impact of higher inflation - they are fearful about how much governments are borrowing , and how much money central banks such as the Bank of England are putting into the economy . "
Mr Ash predicts that gold prices will continue to rise , but does caution that it can be a volatile commodity .
Other precious metals also saw their prices rise on Tuesday , with silver up 3 % to $ 17.11 an ounce , and platinum adding 0.9 % to $ 1,305 an ounce .
The price of copper was up 2.4 % to $ 6,060 a tonne .

US communication authorities are investigating allegations by telecoms group AT&T that Google has an unfair advantage because Google Voice is not covered by federal rules that govern phone service providers .
Earlier this month , AT&T said Google is not playing by the same rules as its competitors by claiming that its Google Voice telephony management application is not a traditional phone service .
This is enabling Google to block calls to rural areas to save access costs , which competitors bound by a 2007 Federal Communication Commission ( FCC ) ruling are prohibited from doing .
Google Voice opponents say although the application has a web interface , it uses regular phone lines , unlike Skype and other systems that use internet data channels .
In response to the AT&T complaints , the FCC has asked Google to explain its reasons for blocking the calls , according to the Financial Times .
Google said in a blog post that it avoids making connections to local phone networks because they charge " exorbitant " termination rates for calls .
They also partner with adult sex chat lines and conference calling centres that result in " ludicrously high charges " , Google lawyer Richard Whitt wrote on the company 's public policy blog .
In its official complaint , AT&T called on the FCC to ensure that any new rules are applied not just to network operators , but also to providers of internet applications , content and services .
Anything less would be ineffective , legally suspect and , in all events , a direct repudiation of president Barack Obama 's call for a level playing field , said Robert Quinn , a senior vice president at AT&T .
Fans , researchers , historians and even the players argue all the time about who was the fastest pitcher of all - time .
The most widely quoted response is Nolan Ryan , whose fastball was " officially " clocked by the Guinness Book of World Records at 100.9 miles per hour in a game played on August 20 , 1974 , versus the Detroit Tigers .
A record that 's still included in the book .
Fascinating accounts , stories , and even myths about how fast - or not so fast - a pitch has gone are common in the annals of the game .
One such account allegedly took place during a Spring Training game in 1968 .
A rookie catcher named Johnny Bench was behind the plate and eight - year veteran Jim Maloney was on the mound .
Bench continuously called for breaking balls and Maloney continuously shook him off .
Frustrated , the two met at the mound where Bench bluntly said , " Your fastball 's not popping . "
Maloney , also blunt , replied , " % * $@ you . "
The rookie returned to his position behind the plate and called for a curve , only to be shaken off again .
Bench gave in to the veteran ( who had recently strung together four consecutive seasons with 200 + strikeouts ) and signaled for a fastball .
Maloney delivered .
Before the pitch reached the plate Bench dropped his glove and caught the ball bare - handed - or so the story goes .
Stories about the fastest pitchers in history have also appeared in the Associated Press .
Radar ( RA dio D etection A nd R anging ) guns were first introduced in 1935 and the media has covered their evolution with great interest .
Two early stories about this emerging technology and its application towards baseball pitching speeds are reprinted below :
Meter to Record Feller 's Speed
CLEVELAND ( AP ) —
A series of photo - electric cells may settle all those arguments over who is the speedball king of the major leagues .
A few amateurs warmed up yesterday on a new pitching speed meter .
Today it will test the salary wings of Bob Feller , and any other members of the Cleveland and Boston American loop clubs who are willing .
Other American League clubs will be given a chance at it later .
John A. Crawford of the Cleveland Plain Dealer thought the idea would be useful in selection of pitching and other talents .
President Alvin Bradley of the Cleveland Indians agreed and Rex D. McDill , Cleveland electronics engineer , built the machine .
" A kid pitcher has to have a fast ball to succeed in the big leagues , " said Bradley , " for he can never learn how to pitch faster .
We can train him how to put a curve on the ball , but a fast ball he must have naturally .
This machine will tell us at once whether he has the fast ball .
The same goes for an infielder . "
First Miss Cappy Ogiun , a visitor from Orlando , Fla. , tried her speed yesterday .
Her best was 40 feet per second .
A varied assortment of men followed .
The best throw was 86 feet a second , the second best 84 .
A man of about 60 years old did a foot for each of his years .
Sponsors recalled that back in 1917 , in Bridgeport ( Conn . ) arms laboratory , Walter Johnson recorded 134 feet per second , Christy Mathewson 127 and " Smoky Joe " Wood 124 .
They used a gravity drop interval recorder .
The new meter , which gives an immediate reading which engineers said compared with standard laboratory meter accuracy , is built in a trailer .
You throw into a hole two feet square .
Just inside is a set of photo - electric tubes , and five feet back is another set .
The device measures the ball 's speed between the two points and flashes it on a scale facing the pitcher .

Smoky Joe Wood often said , " I threw so hard , I thought my arm would fly right off my body . "
Walter Johnson , often cited as the fastest throwing pitcher in Major League history by experts , believed that Wood was faster than himself and once said , " Mister , no man alive can throw a baseball harder than Joe Wood . "
Both were mentioned in the Meter to Record Feller 's Speed article above and the unit of measure was feet per second .
Modern measurements / clockings are done in miles per hour in the United States and kilometers per hour in Canada & Japan .
Baseball Almanac is pleased to provide you with a velocity calculator which you can use to convert these various formats and compare pitchers - both modern and historical .

So how fast was Feller ?
The Meter to Record Feller 's Speed article mentioned it was specifically going to examine his pitching speed .
Satchel Paige , who could bring on the heat himself , believed Feller was the fastest and told teammates , " If anybody threw that ball any harder than Rapid Robert , then the human eye could n't follow it . "
Feller once mentioned that he was clocked at 104 mph at Lincoln Park in Chicago .
He also claimed he was clocked at 107.9 mph in a demonstration in 1946 at Griffith Stadium .
At the Aberdeen Proving Grounds he was measured using the ever - popular speeding motorcycle test , once used in 1914 with Walter Johnson who reached 99.7 mph , and Feller reached 98.6 mph .
The results of the test from the " new meter " were reported the day after the initial article :
Humphreys ' ' Hard ' Un ' Faster Than Feller 's , Meter Shows
CLEVELAND ( AP ) - Three Boston Red Sox threw a baseball 122 feet a second into a new photo - electric pitching meter yesterday .
Three Cleveland Indians could do only 119 feet .
Pitchers were not included in yesterday 's test but " unofficially , " Bob Feller of Cleveland threw three balls into the meter from a distance of 20 feet .
The best mark he recorded was 119 feet .
His less - touted teammate , pitcher Johnny Humphreys , recorded 127 feet .
There will be a contest for pitchers later .
Jimmy Foxx , Jim Tabor , and Roger Cramer made it a clean Boston sweep with a first - place tie in yesterday 's fielders contest .
The best the Indians could do was a tie at 119 feet by Ben Chapman , Julius Solters and Jim Shilling .
Cleveland men who developed the speed meter said the only comparable scientific marks were made in 1917 .
Walter Johnsonthrew the ball 134 feet a second , Christy Mathewson127 and " Smoky Joe " Wood124 .
Their speeds were shown by a gravity drop interval recorder .
Source : Richmond ( VA ) Times Dispatch , June 7 , 1939 .
The results from the " contest for pitchers " have never been found .
Since machine testing was rare and uncommon we are left with a scientific void about historical flamethrowers .
Early comments about fastball pitchers can be found in many old newspapers and offer some interesting insight into who was considered fastest during this early era :
" He ( Lefty Grove ) was the fastest pitcher who ever lived . " - Ford Frick
" Smokey Joe ( Williams ) could throw harder than all of them . "
- Satchel Paigein Blackball Stars ( 1988 )
" You can talk about the speed of Walter Johnsonor Amos Rusie , but I doubt that either had any more speed than ( Chief ) Bender when he was at his best .
He was not physically as strong as some others , but he had long , tapering fingers and a peculiar whip to his arm that certainly drove that baseball through the air . "
- Eddie Collins
" You ca n't hit what you ca n't see . " - Joe Tinker talking about Rube Marquard .
Another fascinating account of a fastball pitcher , who is often credited as one of the fastest ever , was described in great detail by baseball historian Jonathan Fraser Light .
The " twist " here is this pitcher never appeared in a Major League game !
Steve Dalkowski .
" To understand how Dalkowski , a chunky little man with thick glasses and a perpetually dazed expression , became a legend in his own time ... "
Pat Jordan in The Suitors of Spring ( 1974 ) .
The fastest pitcher ever may have been 1950s phenom and flameout Steve Dalkowski .
Dalkowski signed with the Orioles in 1957 at age 21 .
After nine years of erratic pitching he was released in 1966 , never having made it to the Major Leagues .
Despite his failure , he has been described as the fastest pitcher ever .
Ted Williams once stood in a spring training batting cage and took one pitch from Dalkowski .
Williams swore he never saw the ball and claimed that Dalkowski probably was the fastest pitcher who ever lived .
Others who claimed he was the fastest ever were Paul Richards , Harry Brecheen and Earl Weaver .
They all thought he was faster than Bob Feller and Walter Johnson , though none of them probably saw Johnson pitch .
In 1958 the Orioles sent Dalkowski to the Aberdeen Proving Grounds , a military installation where Feller was once clocked .
Feller was clocked at 98.6 mph .
Dalkowski was clocked at only 93.5 , but a few mitigating factors existed :
1 ) Dalkowski had pitched in a game the day before , so he could be expected to throw 5 - 10 mph slower than usual ;
2 ) there was no mound to pitch from , which Feller had enjoyed , and this would drop his velocity by 5 - 8 mph ;
3 ) he had to pitch for 40 minutes before the machine could measure his speed , and he was exhausted by the time there was a reading .
Other sources reported that the measuring device was a tube and that he took a long time to finally throw one into the tube .
It was estimated that Dalkowski's fastball at times reached 105 mph .
Dalkowski was not physically imposing , standing only 5 ' 8 " and wearing thick glasses .
He had legendary wildness , which kept him out of the Major Leagues .
In 995 minor league innings , he walked 1,354 batters and struck out 1,396 .
He walked 21 in one minor league game and struck out 21 in another .
In high school he pitched a no-hitter while walking 18 and striking out 18 .
He threw 283 pitches in a complete game against Aberdeen and once threw 120 pitches in only two innings .
He played in nine leagues in nine years .
In 1963 for Elmira he finally started throwing strikes .
During spring training in 1964 , Dalkowski was with the Major League club .
After fielding a sacrifice bunt by pitcher Jim Bouton in spring training , Dalkowski's arm went dead and he never recovered .
He drifted to various jobs and landed in Bakersfield , California , where he was arrested many times for fighting .
He once threw a ball at least 450 feet on a bet .
He was supposed to throw the ball from the outfield wall to home plate , but he threw it well above the plate into the press box .
He once threw a pitch so hard that the catcher missed the ball and it shattered an umpire 's mask .
Dalkowski was the basis for wild fastball pitcher Nuke LaLoosh in the movie Bull Durham .
Source : The Cultural Encyclopedia of Baseball , 1997 .
Radar guns now routinely measure the modern pitcher 's performance and the magic fastball number is now set at 100 miles per hour .
Scoreboards in nearly every ballpark - including High Schools - now flash pitch speeds for the world to see .
Breaking the 100 mph plateau makes news that can often travel to the front office at nearly the same speed .
" You should see the scouts , " said Braves speed gun handler Jim Guadagno , " They 're like kids with new toys when they see that 100 light up on their guns .
Three digits !
Nobody else in the league can do that . "
The pitcher Guadagno was referring to was Mark Wohlers and since then other hurlers have joined this unique fraternity :

So who is the fastest pitcher in baseball ?
Baseball Almanac honestly does not know .
Major League Baseball does not recognize radar speeds as an official statistic .
The Elias Sports Bureau , Stats Inc and The Sporting News are all highly respected resources who publish some form of record book every season , yet none of them recognize any pitcher as the fastest ever .
Nobody really knows , but we do hope this article has shed some light on the topic and at least provided you with additional material to argue with your friends about .
There are times when I think a seat on the sports administration gravy train might just be the very best place in the world : great food , first - class travel , the best seats for the big matches , fancy handbags and so on .
And then I remember they sometimes have to make tough decisions - 50/50 calls that will leave lots of people annoyed no matter which way you call it - and wonder if I really would like that responsibility .
World cycling 's bosses are facing one of those lunch - spoiling dilemmas right now and the decision they appear to have made has certainly annoyed a lot of people , many of them British .
But before anybody accuses them of plotting to do us in now that we 're good at something we should perhaps try to understand why preventing British cyclists from defending hard - won Olympic titles is not the open - and - shut case of incompetence / insensitivity / anti-British prejudice it might seem at first glance .
Underlying all this - the proposed changes to the London 2012 track cycling programme , the scrapping of traditional events , the introduction of new ones , the complaints and predictions of doom - is a glaring injustice that simply must be addressed : men have more chances to win Olympic medals than women do .
Bradley Wiggins ' storming ride in Beijing might be the last ever Olympic men's individual pursuit
In Beijing there were 165 men 's events and only 127 for women .
This meant that 58 % of the 11,000 athletes at the Games were male - the inequality is even worse at the Winter Olympics .
This is more than just a bit embarrassing for a movement that considers itself liberal and meritocratic , it also falls short of the International Olympic Committee 's ( IOC ) own charter and could even be illegal in many countries ( particularly when you consider the public money involved in staging these celebrations of humanity ) .
Simple , you might be thinking , just introduce more events for the women , 165 gold - medal opportunities each .
If only it was that easy .
Leaving aside any debate on the attraction of women 's Greco - Roman wrestling or men's synchronised swimming , there is one massive problem with adding events to the Olympic programme : cost .
More events , means more athletes , more coaches , more officials , more rooms , more vehicles , more , more , more .
The price tag of an Olympics is already at the upper end of what most governments think they can reasonably expect their electorates to go for and the IOC knows it .
Asking for more is out of the question .
So if the federations that run the Olympic sports want new events they 're going to have to give up some old ones .
Which brings us to track cycling : Beijing 's Laoshan Velodrome was a fantastic venue for top sport , and the scene of many of Team GB 's proudest moments , but it was hardly an equal - opportunities workplace .
Of the 10 events , only three were for female cyclists .
While this meant Sir Chris
Hoy was able to sprint to three golds and a knighthood , Victoria Pendleton had to make do with one and some magazine work .
This disgraceful situation left cycling 's governing body , the UCI , open to considerable criticism .
And it certainly came , much of it from Britain .
But say what you like about the UCI , and many do , nobody can say it did n't listen .
At London 2012 , it has decreed , there will be five events for men and five for women : sprint , team sprint , keirin , team pursuit and omnium .
So out go the men 's madison and points races , the women 's points and both individual pursuits , and in comes a women 's team sprint , keirin , team pursuit and two omniums .
Those changes are provisional but nobody is expecting the IOC to do anything other than rubber - stamp them at its next board meeting in December .
So , with one bureaucratic flourish , equality between the sexes has been delivered in the velodrome .
But what about equality between the cyclists ?
The five chosen events can be broken down into three for sprinters like Hoy and Pendleton , one for distance riders like Bradley Wiggins and Rebecca Romero , and one , the five - discipline omnium , for all - rounders .
These choices represent a clear shift away from endurance events to more explosive ones , and reaction has divided along those lines ( as the video below demonstrates ) .

Sir Chris Hoy , Victoria Pendleton , Geraint Thomas and Lizzie Armitstead on the changes to the 2012 programme
Pendleton , unsurprisingly , is delighted .
Sprint king
Hoy is pleased for his female counterparts but acknowledges it is hard on the distance riders .
Romero and Wiggins , individual pursuit specialists , are furious .
The former described the changes as " ludicrous " , while the latter said the proposals would " kill off " endurance cycling on the track .
Wiggins , a three - time world and double Olympic champion , was hoping to go for an unprecedented third straight victory in his home city in 2012 , and Romero will also now be deprived of the chance to defend her Olympic title .
If that 's not bad enough , Wiggo has also lost his ride in the madison and Romero her second medal shot in the points race .
And it 's not just these two in the GB team left wondering if they have upset the cycling gods .
Beijing medallists like Steven Burke , Wendy Houvenaghel and Geraint Thomas can all feel aggrieved about the UCI 's " radical " tinkering .
But the link between the individual pursuit and Britain goes deeper than that .
Domestic riders have won 21 world titles in the event in the last half century .
The greats of British track cycling - Beryl Burton , Graeme Obree , Hugh Porter et al - have specialised in this most pure of contests .
And you could argue that Chris Boardman 's individual pursuit triumph in 1992 was the catalyst for Britain 's recent Olympic renaissance .
The lessons learned by Boardman and his young coach Peter Keen have transformed Team GB from being nice - but - nowhere types to success - hungry medal machines .
So it is more than just another event for British cyclists and while none of them disputes the need to address the male / female medal split , they are wondering if other sports would have been given such a firm one - in / one - out ultimatum .
Athletics , the Olympics ' biggest sport , has been allowed to level up its medal split without losing men's events , and swimming , the second biggest sport , has also not had to engage in much horse - trading with the IOC over the years .
Are some Olympic sports more equal than others ?
That , no doubt , will be the topic of much conversation when the track cycling community gathers in Manchester this weekend for the World Cup Series ' opening leg .
I expect there will be also be some water - cooler chat about the omnium , which is n't on the World Cup menu but has appeared at the last few world championships .
Until now cycling 's answer to the pentathlon has failed to tempt the sport 's biggest names ( Thomas refers to it as a " joke event " in the video above ) but that will probably change now there is an Olympic medal to aim for .
One rider who appears made for its jack - of - all - trades demands is Britain 's Lizzie Armitstead .
Remember the name .
It is also worth pointing out that British cycling has been here before .
Hoy was devastated when the UCI took away his speciality , the kilo , to accommodate BMX in Beijing .
The Scot has admitted to almost quitting but he decided to set himself new goals and emerged four years later as the world 's greatest sprinter in both the power events and the more tactical ones .
When I spoke to Hoy about this at the Nationals last week , his message was clear : if you want a new challenge , you 'll find it .
He 's right , of course , His Royal Hoyness usually is .
And who knows , perhaps this is the burning injustice that will motivate Romero to a third Olympic medal in different sports / events ( rowing , track cycling and road cycling ) and Wiggins to Tour de France glory .
The UCI would struggle to scrap that .

Google Maps powered some of the phones carrying a AGPS .
Dedicated services like TomTom , Garmin clearly beated them in features like Turn - by - turn navigation .
Google has done it again , one giant leap ahead of industry by introducing new GPS navigation “ Google Maps Navigation “ .
Google ’s map play brings bad news for the iPhone 3GS even with TomTom navigation App. Google Nav probably wo n’t make way to iPhone and would remain on Android 2.0 Devices ( at least for now ) .
Good news for those who are buying Verizon ’s Motorola Droid .
As we talked in Droid vs. iPhone 3GS , Droid will have better GPS Navigation .
Why ?
Because Google Maps Navigation is free and more feature full .
As this demo video illustrates , the nav program is a useful tool that deftly blends Google ’s map and Street Views with traffic information and Voice commands .
Have a Look :
Too good , I never saw anything like that on Garmin or TomTom .
The $ 100 price for either TomTom GPS software for the iPhone , etc .
To many consumers , these apps will now seem wildly overpriced .
GPS app vendors may have to cut their prices , offer ad - supported free versions ( and I wonder if Google ’s nav app will ultimately take that route ) , or trot out amazing new features to warrant their high costs .
Google Maps Navigation could have a huge impact on the overall smartphone market as well .
This is one the second killer app for Android , after Google Voice .
Of course , the iPhone has its fair share of advantages — 100 K apps come to mind — and Apple has less to fear than the GPS vendors .
It ’s no surprise that both TomTom ’s and Garmin ’s stock prices took a dive on the day of the Google announcement .
Google , someday , will eat the world business with free alternatives .

The Berlin Zoo has welcomed a number of animal babies this year , including an anteater , black panthers , an Asian elephant and jaguars .
Add Lilly here to that tally ; she 's one of three caracal kittens born at the zoo July 17 .
Caracals are native to Africa and parts of the Middle East and India , and because they favor dry places such as the savanna , they 're also sometimes called " desert lynxes . "
( They rather resemble lynxes , but they 're probably actually more closely related to servals . )
They 're renowned for their impressive jumping ability and are able to leap 10 feet to catch a bird midflight .
Beyond their jumping ability , a more obvious characteristic of the caracal is its large ears , complete with long , black tufts at the end .
( Lilly 's tufts are just beginning to grow , but they 'll be much larger when she reaches adulthood . )
In fact , the word " caracal " comes from a Turkish word , karakulak , which means black ear .
Researchers are unsure about the purpose for these tassels , but theories abound .
One suggests that they act as a camouflaging device in tall grass ; another holds that they act as antennae to help caracals hear ; and still another ( the most widely accepted explanation , according to the San Diego Zoo ) suggests that they are used to help caracals communicate .
More photos of Lilly after the jump !
Mr Mueller has long been involved with the Lockerbie case himself
The head of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a scathing attack on Scottish government over the release of the Lockerbie bomber .
In a letter dated 21 August , Robert Mueller said the decision had made " a mockery of justice " and given " comfort to terrorists around the world " .
Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi has received a hero 's welcome in Libya .
The Scottish government replied that it had consulted widely in the US and UK and had made the right decision .
Megrahi , the only person convicted in connection with the 1988 Lockerbie bombing , was found guilty of 270 counts of murder in 2001 .
He was given a life sentence .
But on Thursday the Scottish government freed the 57 - year - old , who is dying from cancer , citing compassionate grounds .
In his letter to Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill , FBI Director Robert Mueller wrote : " Your action in releasing Megrahi is as inexplicable as it is detrimental to the cause of justice .
Indeed your action makes a mockery of the rule of law .
" Your action gives comfort to terrorists around the world . "
You have given those who sought to assure that the persons responsible would be held accountable the back of your hand
Robert Mueller
Letter from Robert Mueller Strong words from FBI Mr Mueller added that the Scottish decision made a mockery of the emotions " of all those affected by the Lockerbie tragedy " .
The FBI director said he was outraged by the move , and criticised Mr MacAskill for failing to consult " partners in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the Lockerbie tragedy " .
He wrote : " You have given those who sought to assure that the persons responsible would be held accountable the back of your hand .
You have given Megrahi a ' jubilant welcome ' in Tripoli , according to the reporting . "
London under pressure Mr Mueller was previously a justice department lawyer leading the investigation into the 1988 bombing .
His letter is also being sent to families of the Lockerbie victims .
Megrahi received a jubilant welcome in Tripoli on Thursday A Scottish Government spokesman said the minister had made the right decision for the " right reasons " on the basis of due process , clear evidence , and recommendations from the parole board and prison governor .
He said : " Compassionate release is not part of the US justice system but it is part of Scotland's .
" Mr MacAskill could not have consulted more widely - he spoke with the US families , the US Attorney General , Secretary of State Clinton and many others .
Mr MacAskill said there was no reason to deny Megrahi compassion " The US authorities indicated that although they were opposed to both prisoner transfer and compassionate release , they made it clear that they regarded compassionate release as far preferable to the transfer agreement , and Mr Mueller should be aware of that . "
The spokesman said that Mr Mueller should also be aware that while many families have opposed Mr MacAskill 's decision many others have supported it .
Meanwhile the British government has come under pressure over allegations that it had a role in the release .
After Megrahi's return , the Libyan leader 's son Saif al - Islam Gaddafi said the decision had been linked to trade ties with the UK .
The Scottish government can take decisions independently of London on justice matters but not foreign affairs .
British Business Secretary Peter Mandelson categorically denied that a deal had been struck with Libya or that it had had any role in the move .

This is what happens when augmented reality becomes too accessible .
How long will it be until we all rely on augmented reality way too much ?
Like we already do , with mobile phones , internet , social media and google .
Augmented reality ( AR ) is a term for a live direct or indirect view of a physical real - world environment whose elements are merged with ( or augmented by ) virtual computer - generated imagery – creating a mixed reality .
The augmentation is conventionally in real - time and in semantic context with environmental elements .
Augmented reality has actually been around for years ( eg : sports scores overlaid on TV during a match screening , or a “ heads up ” display for a Fighter Pilot ) .
However , having it accessible through mobile devices is about to take this to a whole new level .
This will be the new way to get information .
Having this technology integrated with mobile devices makes it so easily accessible that we will not think twice before accepting what it says as the truth .
Augmented reality is already abeing used in many different iPhone apps and online .
Check out these 35 Awesome Augmented Reality Examples .
It is going to offer us a whole new world , which s ome will choose to keep their distance from , and others will attempt to live inside of constantly .
For me , I look forward to the day that I can use the technology to guide me to where I left my car keys .
Owen Schmitt Cracks His Head Open During Pre-Game Intro ( Video )
Total Pro Sports – Owen Schmitt did n’t think the crowd , his team or even himself , were fired up enough before this week ’s game against Jacksonville .
If it was you or me , we might try giving an inspirational speech or something .
Owen Schmitt went in a different , significantly more violent and self - destructive direction .
That steroid problem in the NFL sure is apparent sometimes .
It looked like more of an MMA match than a football game .
The blood is just pouring down his face like he took a hit right on the forehead .
And that doesnt look fake either .
Considering that the Seahawks were down to just one fullback on the roster with the injury to Justin Griffith , it was n’t exactly the most intelligent move .
It did , however , seem to fire up the team .
The Seahawks ended up wrecking the Jaguars 41- 0 .
Schmitt himself had to miss the first play of the game getting his head stitched up .
The immense loss of blood did n’t keep him out for long though , as he came back right after that play .
The ‘ hawks ran a 3 - receiver set that play , but Schmitt returned for the next play .
Oh and if you ’re anything like me you probably have n’t heard of this guy before .
Anyone who has though knows that this behavior is nothing new for Schmitt .
He ’s attempted this sort of nonsense before , although I do n’t see why he would try to get himself pumped up after a random impromptu punt in college .
Makes sense I would n’t get it though , since I ’m not the kind of guy that cracks my own head open intentionally .

Ouch .
The former campaign manager for the failed presidential bid of Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) told a crowd Friday that a presidential campaign of ex-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin would be “ catastrophic . ”
“ I think that she has talents , but my honest view is that she would not be a winning candidate for the Republican candidate in 2012 , and in fact , were she to be the nominee , we would have a catastrophic election result , ” GOP operative Steve Schmidt said .

“ In the year since the election has ended , she has done nothing to expand her appeal beyond the base , ” he added .
“ Th[e ] independent vote is going to be up for grabs in 2012 .
That middle of the electorate is going to be determinative of the outcome of the elections .
I just do n’t see that if you look at the things she has done over the year … that she is going to expand that base in the middle . ”
The little noted remarks were posted on The Atlantic magazine ’s live blog for their conference , “ First Draft of History ” and caught by Eric Kleefield .
Fuller remarks were posted by The Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder .
Kleefield notes that Schmidt is said to have been one of those who pushed for Palin ’s inclusion on the GOP ticket , reportedly saying of criticism from GOP heavyweight Karl Rove : “ Karl ’s wrong .
She ’s an exceptional governor , a reform governor in Alaska . ”
Schmidt has become more iconoclastic in the past year , and took flak after telling a gay newspaper that the Republican Party should embrace gay marriage .
“ I think the Republican Party should not be seen by a broad majority of the electorate as focused with singularity on issues like gay marriage , ” he said .
“ The attitudes of voters about gay marriage and about domestic partnership benefits for gay couples are changing very rapidly and for voters under the age of 30 , they are completely disconnected from what has been Republican orthodoxy on these issues . ”

“ Any campaign that would go out and try to demonize people on the basis of their sexual orientation , ” he added , “ is abhorrent and I suspect that that campaign would be rejected . ”
Schmidt was also an aide to former President George W. Bush .
I cannot even begin to talk about the hijab ( Islamic dress , translated as “ covering ” ) without first looking at the big picture and raising the question of what exactly we are trying to accomplish with our endeavors in this life in this land .
Foremost , let ’s look at the sordid state of affairs that we are contending with ; think of all the things happening in this world :
The earth is being ravaged by industrial toxic technology .
Rainforests are being burned and destroyed .
The atmosphere is being shredded , wildlife and marine life are becoming extinct .
The world lies in wait of nuclear holocaust at the touch of a button , while the slow leak of poisons spreads insidiously into our drinking water and dust particles .
Topsoil erosion from overuse of pesticides has laid much of the earth ’s surface to waste .
Thousands of homes lie vacant while thousands of men , women and children are homeless .
20 to 30 % of Americans now have herpes , which is an incurable disease .
Cancers and auto immune dysfunction are becoming increasingly common .
Allergies are rampant .
This is because our physical bodies are part of this earth , and cannot be separated from the environment .
We are suffering because our mother earth is being devastated and abused .
And I have hardly even touched upon social injustice and political oppression .
Confronted with such a bleak portrait of reality , we must ask , how do we deal with those in power who are responsible for all this ?
In fact , Allah talks about the people of Moses in the Quran who were asking similar questions .
Al hamdulillah , Allah already knew that the Pharoah would meet a sorry end , just as we know that capitalism is on its last legs today , even though it gives the appearance of being very powerful .
Moses did not tell the Israelites to go and kill the Pharoah .
Instead , he told his followers to concentrate their energy on their homes and their communities and to establish their connection with Allah .
This is an example of how we can go about quietly struggling against evil .
And , hijab is precisely one of the symbols of this struggle .
It is a sign that says , “ I believe in Allah and I believe in forbidding what is evil and encouraging what is good . ”
It is an outward acknowledgement of an inner faith for which we are willing to sacrifice our egos and work hard for , in order to bring about positive social change .
In itself , hijab will not free the oppressed , feed the hungry , or create a moral society .
It is a statement to the world that you KNOW you are a person of great value , worthy of being treated with decency and dignity , simply because Allah created you .
Keeping this empowering concept of hijab in mind , lets examine how women are treated in westernized society .
You will see a striking parallel between the way the capitalist world system thinks of the earth and how they view women .
If one word were to describe both , it would be EXPLOITATION .
In America , a lot of girls grow up not having any idea that they are worth anything .
They see how everything is used for its commercial value and they feel insecure about their spiritual worth as human beings .
This is because we see people having to think constantly in terms of consumer products .
For example , the breakfast cereal in the prettiest box will be the most expensive , and this will bear no relation to the nutritional value of the cereal .
And when it comes to women , we see on TV beautiful girls being used to sell everything from laundry detergent to cars , and the society puts such an emphasis on physical attractiveness that young girls will try so hard to look like these fashion models .
When I was 12 years old I started taking diet pills , and I was on a diet for the next ten years until I became Muslim , al hamdulillah .
The truth about American society is that women are expected to sell themselves in order to be successful .
That is , they have to make their bodies into a pretty package in order to be accepted socially or in order to get a job .
Among the lower income , women will find that if they get a job as a waitress they will have to work very hard to act cute and pleasing and even flirtatious , in order to get good tips .
But even professional women have to think in this way in order to get ahead .
My mother , who has a PhD and works as a university administrator , was actually told that it is a department rule that all female employees must wear pantyhose .
This is so sick .
This is saying that no matter how hard you work or how educated you are , first and foremost , you must show your legs .
So , I believe that the hijab is a very firm way to say no to using your body for the sake of gaining commercial advantage .
It is a way of saying that you refuse to participate in the exploitation of living beings for whatever profit .
It says that you know you are worth something beyond being an object of pleasure for any and all .
So in a small yet large way , to wear hijab is to fight against capitalism and greed .
We are evidence that you have a choice .
You can say no to capitalist , exploitation and destruction .
CONFRONTING THE CHALLENGES
It is true that there are many difficulties involved with wearing the hijab in American society .
And we have to be prepared for this and understand where it comes from .
First of all , we have to realize that some people are going to react to you in a hostile manner .
However , it is important to realize that it is not a personal but a political issue .
If someone curses at you for wearing hijab it is because they hate Islam , and it shows that they are racist , sexist , and oblivious to their Creator .
Also , some people ’s behavior may change towards you once you start wearing hijab , from being pleasant to extremely or subtly rude .
Why is that ?
It is because you have rejected the idea that a woman ’s role is to be cute and act stupid in order to make men ’s egos feel good .
You are showing them that you respect yourself and that you know who you are and you do n’t feel it necessary to sell yourself by showing off your beauty just like a box of Sugar Pops .
Also , look at where you are living — there are plenty of places where Muslims are treated with respect .
So if your family is having a really hard time as Muslims it could be that you are living in the wrong neighborhood .
When I lived in a certain suburb , people used to yell at me out of their car windows .
But when I lived in downtown , every time I went out of my house , someone would say to me , “ Asalaam alaikum ! ”
That felt really good , to be recognized as a Muslim .
Another problem you may face is finding a job .
After all , it can not be denied that when you give up that “ cute ” look , a lot of employment opportunities are going to be denied to you .
But then again , broaden your horizon .
If jobs like waitressing are denied to you , others like working in an office or school may still be available .
Hijab can stimulate us to get creative and find new ways of making money , or of meeting your needs without using as much money .
This is a way that forces each family to struggle against greed on an individual level as well .
Thirdly , you must always remember that no matter how educated you are , you still have the right to be supported by your husband and if it is too stressful for you to go out and fight the power every day , you can work in the home without guilt .
The brothers also need to realize that the best treasure you can have is a believing wife .
Lastly , I want to address the fear that a lot of sisters may have that wearing hijab will alienate them from American society .
I have been wearing hijab now for 6 years and I can assure you that actually the opposite is true .
In America , the hijab does not mean seclusion .
In fact , you will be compelled to talk to people constantly because every day you will be asked questions about Islam .
Wearing hijab is like holding up a sign that says , “ If you want to know about Islam , just ask me . ”
Remember that when you put on the hijab you are reaching out to help others .
You are not rejecting them .
Rather , you could really help a lot of women and men too , by creating a positive image of true beauty .
If you could encourage just one girl to save herself from being used , because of the example you have set , think of how much pain and agony you will have helped her to avoid .
And if you could teach just one person the beauty of Islam , is n’t that worth so much ?
On that note , I conclude by saying , we are proud to be Muslim , so why hide it ?
So , verily , with every difficulty , there is ease .
Verily , with every difficulty , there is ease .
Therefore , when you are free from your immediate task , still labor hard , And to your Lord turn all your attention .

Just the existence of such genetic differences between races , proclaimed the author of the Half Sigma blog , a 40 - year - old software developer , means " the egalitarian theory , " that all races are created equal , " is proven false . "
Although few of the bits of human genetic code that vary between individuals have yet been tied to physical or behavioral traits , scientists have found that roughly 10 percent of them are more common in certain continental groups , and can be used to distinguish people of different races .
They say that studying the differences , which arose during the tens of thousands of years human populations evolved on separate continents following their ancestors ' dispersal from humanity 's birthplace in East Africa is crucial to mapping the genetic basis for disease .
Many geneticists are loath to discuss the social implications of their findings .
Still , some acknowledge that as their data and methods are extended to non-medical traits , the field is at what one leading researcher recently called " a very delicate time and a dangerous time . "
" There are clear differences between people of different continental ancestries , " said Marcus Feldman , a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University .
" It 's not there yet for things like IQ , but I can see it coming .
And it has the potential to spark a new era of racism if we do not start explaining it better . "
Feldman said any finding on intelligence was likely to be exceedingly hard to pin down .
But given that some may emerge , he wants to create " ready response teams " of geneticists to put such socially fraught discoveries in perspective .
Some fear that the authority DNA has earned through its use in freeing wrongly convicted inmates , preventing disease and reconstructing family ties , scientists warn , leads people to wrongly elevate genetics over other explanations for differences between groups .
" I 've spent the last 10 years of my life researching how much genetic variability there is between populations , " said Dr. David Altshuler , director of the Program in Medical and Population Genetics at the Broad Institute in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
" But living in America , it is so clear that the economic and social and educational differences have so much more influence than genes .
People just somehow fixate on genetics , even if the influence is very small . "
But on Half Sigma and elsewhere , the conversation is already flashing forward to what might happen if genetically encoded racial differences in socially desirable - or undesirable - traits are identified .
" If I were to believe the ' facts ' in this post , what should I do ? " one reader responded .
" Should I advocate discrimination against blacks because they are less smart ?
Should I not hire them to my company because odds are I could find a smarter white person ?
Stop trying to prove that one group of people are genetically inferior to your group .
Just stop . "
Fears that the mere mention of geoengineering might undermine support for emissions reductions appear to be unfounded
News :
Top science body calls for geoengineering ‘ plan B ’
MOST people and nations now recognise the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous climate change .
However , there is a growing fear that this fragile support for action could be at risk because geoengineering – the large - scale manipulation of the environment to counteract climate change – is now receiving serious attention from scientists , policy - makers and the media .
This is sometimes referred to as the “ moral hazard ” argument .
It holds that even discussing geoengineering …
RFK Jr : $ 100 K Reward 4 Mercury in Vaccines
by MIKE ADAMS ( NATURAL NEWS )
Kennedy , De Niro post $ 100,000 reward to expose mercury in vaccines
CHALLENGE : $ 100,000 to the first person who can find a scientific study proving Thimerosal ( mercury ) is safe to inject into children
( February 15 , 2017 ) As promised , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Chairman of the World Mercury Project ( WMP ) , announced a $ 100,000 payout to anyone who can find a credible scientific study proving Thimerosal is safe to inject into children at the concentrations currently administered in todays vaccines .
From the World Mercury Project website :
" Thimerosal , a mercury - containing preservative , is still in 48 million U.S. flu vaccines each year , tetanus toxoid , meningococcal vaccines and , in massive doses , in the pediatric vaccines given to 100 million children across the developing world .
A Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) review published last month found that the ethylmercury in thimerosal is as profoundly neurotoxic as the heavily regulated methylmercury in fish .

Mayor Hazel McCallion ’s supporters turned out in droves , pleading , imploring , berating and even threatening Mississauga council .
It did n’t work .
Councillors voted 7 - 4 to push ahead with a $ 2.5 million judicial inquiry into the mayor ’s presence in private meetings about her son ’s downtown land deal and broadly related issues .
The vote occurred after hours of dramatic political theatre that had one of Mississauga ’s major developer - builders , Harold Shipp , fighting back tears over the mayor ’s plight .
It will also investigate how OMERS managed to quietly obtain controversial veto powers in its agreement with the city for a 10 per cent stake in Mississauga ’s its hydro utility , Enersource .
The veto , discovered long after the fact , has been a source of contention within council .
Critics claim lawyers added the veto to the documents after council voted to accept the agreement , without council ’s knowledge - or that of the mayor , according to McCallion herself .
The probe will also look into how and why the minutes of a council meeting last year stated that the mayor had declared a conflict of interest in matters involving her son ’s hotel project , while video footage showed she had not .
But first came Wednesday ’s drama .
More than a hundred of the mayor ’s supporters packed council chambers to accuse councillors of conducting a witch hunt .. some saying an independent legal report commissioned by council had cleared her allegations of conflict of interest .
Some , like close McCallion friend Jim Murray , questioned the $ 2 million - plus cost of the inquiry and expressed fears that it could turn ugly and spiral out of control .
“ If you think the residents of this city ca n’t see through this politically motivated search for the truth , you not only insult our intelligence , but you are also badly mistaken , ” said resident Betty Merkely , to cheers .
“ Do not use this search - for - the - truth crusade to besmirch the mayor ’s impeccable reputation . ”
Others , to more cheers , alternately called her the greatest mayor on Earth and compared her to basketball player Michael Jordan , saying she should be put in the mayors ’s Hall of Fame , if one is ever created .
And Shipp , who did n’t name but accused Councillor Carolyn Parrish of leading a gang of councillors against the mayor , said he loved Mississauga and would be damned if council did anything that would make it less than what it is now .
But the majority - councillors Nando Iannicca , Carolyn Parrish , Sue McFadden , Frank Dale , Eve Adams , Carmen Corbasson and George Carlson - held firm , insisting the inquiry was n’t about the wildly popular mayor alone , but the need to untangle the truth and clarify some complex relationships .
“ I do have a problem that official government documents got changed with no satisfactory explanation , ” said Corbasson , adding she also has “ difficulty ” with a council member attending off - site meetings on a city - related issue that would financially benefit a relative .
Defending the inquiry , Parrish said that , besides the propriety of those meetings , there are questions about the city ’s relationship with OMERS .
In addition to Besides the veto , there is also the cash settlement World Class got from OMERS following the collapse of the deal - and the city ’s purchase of the same plot of land for a new Sheridan College campus .
Peter McCallion and partner Tony DeCicco won the settlement after OMERS took their company , World Class Developments , to court .
It was DeCicco ’s affidavit in that filing that revealed the mayor ’s presence at two private meetings , one of them last December in a last - ditch attempt to rescue the deal .
McCallion ’s son and DeCicco , Parrish said , were looking for money when they were contesting OMERS ’ decision to back away from the conditional agreement .
“ In my world , that is blackmail , ” Parrish said about what preceded the settlement .
“ I want those guys looked at . ”
The December meeting came five days after council voted to buy out OMERS ’ interest in Enersource .
McCallion was opposed to the buyout , as was OMERS .
Councillor Nando Iannicca , known for his colourful language , said he was n’t elected to council because of his love for the mayor .
“ I was elected to do the right thing , ” he said , adding that to vote for the inquiry “ is one of the easiest decisions I have made . ”
OMERS ’ spokesperson John Pierce was puzzled why the Enersource issue had been added to the inquiry .
“ Our main concern is our reputation , ” said Pierce .
“ Any inappropriate impact on our reputation is something we would be seeking compensation on . ”

Purves was jailed for nine months at Peebles Sheriff Court
A biker has been jailed for nine months after being caught doing what is believed to be the fastest speed ever recorded on a Scottish road .
Neil Purves , 27 , of Cockburnspath , was detected by police as he travelled at 166 mph on a 60 mph stretch of the A702 near West Linton in the Borders .
He had admitted a charge of dangerous driving in a previous appearance at Peebles Sheriff Court .
Graham Walker , representing Purves , said he had been " seduced by speed " .
In addition to his jail term , Purves has also been disqualified from driving for five years .
Mr Walker told the court : " It is fair to say superbikes have a seductive appeal to them .
" It is fair to say he was seduced by speed . "
' Deeply ashamed '
However , Sheriff John Horsburgh said there was no alternative to a jail term .
He said : " The speed at which you were travelling means a custodial sentence is the only option I have . "
The court heard that Purves , who has since sold his Suzuki GSX - R 1000 motorbike , covered 0.7 of a mile in just 16 seconds on 13 May this year .
His lawyer said he was " deeply ashamed " of the offence .
Procurator Fiscal Morag McLintock told a previous hearing : " We believe this is the highest speed that the police have ever recorded in Scotland .
" A police speed check was taking place when officers were alerted by a high pitched whine from the motorcycle 's engine . "
Last year more than 20 motorists were caught travelling at more than 100 mph on the Dolphinton stretch of the A702 .
It has sparked calls for permanent speed cameras in the area .
TEMPE , Ariz . - Evidence that early modern humans living on the coast of the far southern tip of Africa 72,000 years ago employed pyrotechnology - the controlled use of fire - to increase the quality and efficiency of their stone tool manufacturing process , is being reported in the Aug. 14 issue of the journal Science .
An international team of researchers , including three from the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University , deduce that " this technology required a novel association between fire , its heat , and a structural change in stone with consequent flaking benefits . "
Further , their findings ignite the notion of complex cognition in these early engineers .
" Our illumination of the heat treatment process shows that these early modern humans commanded fire in a nuanced and sophisticated manner , " says lead author Kyle Brown , a doctoral candidate at the University of Cape Town , and field and lab director in Mossel Bay , South Africa , for ASU 's Institute of Human Origins .
" We show that early modern humans at 72,000 years ago , and perhaps as early as 164,000 years ago in coastal South Africa , were using carefully controlled hearths in a complex process to heat stone and change its properties , the process known as heat treatment , " explains Brown .
" Heat treatment technology begins with a genius moment - someone discovers that heating stone makes it easier to flake , " says Curtis Marean , project director and a co-author on the paper .
Marean is a paleoanthropologist with the Institute of Human Origins and a professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University 's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
" This knowledge is then passed on , and in a way unique to humans , the technology is slowly ratcheted up in complexity as the control of the heating process , cooling and flaking grows in sophistication , " Marean says .
This creates a long - chain technological process that the researchers explain requires a complex cognition , and probably language , to learn and teach .
The heating transformed a stone called silcrete , which was rather poor for tool making , into an outstanding raw material that allowed the modern humans to make highly advanced tools .
The eureka moment
The focus of Brown 's research involves experimentally replicating the types of tools and production debris found at African archaeological sites to understand how and why people made and used these tools .
" In numerous field surveys with co-author David Roberts , who is a leading expert on silcrete formation , we were unable to locate stone outcrops with material that matched the fine - grained texture and often reddish color of the silcrete artifacts we excavated at Pinnacle Point , " Brown says .
" The silcrete we had collected was just not suitable for tool production . "
Most of the silcrete they found was intensively flaked .
It was unusual to find a piece larger than a few centimeters .
However , one day in 2007 , while Brown and Marean were at the Pinnacle Point Site 5 - 6 ( PP5 - 6 ) they found a huge flake of silcrete embedded in ash - the largest piece of silcrete they had ever seen on an archaeological site , nearly 10 centimeters in diameter .
" It looked like it had been accidentally lost in a fire pit , " Brown notes .
He recalls how many of the silcrete tools from the site had a sheen or gloss that reminded him of tools he had examined in North American collections that were heat - treated .
" That is when we developed the heat treatment idea , " Marean says .
" The co-association of the ash cemented to the silcrete , the red color of the silcrete , and its inexplicably large size was the genesis conditions of our eureka moment . "
To test their theory , Brown placed some of the silcrete stone beneath their fire pit one evening , building a hot fire over the top .
" When I returned to dig the stone out the following day , the results were amazing .
After heating , the silcrete became a deep red color and was easily flaked .
Most importantly , it looked exactly like silcrete from site PP5 - 6 .
Using heated silcrete we were then able to produce realistic copies of the actual silcrete tools , " Brown says .
Barbequing rocks
" Here are the beginnings of fire and engineering , the origins of pyrotechnology , and the bridge to more recent ceramic and metal technology , " Brown says .
According to Marean , the silcrete bifaces are re-usable tools with many potential functions : effective hunting weapons , excellent knives and items of value for exchange .
" This explains why people would invest so much effort at wood collection and heat treatment for their production , " Marean says .
And , the hearths used to test their theory " were designed to mimic what people in the past may have done .
So , not only did we heat silcrete , but we barbecued ( a ' braai ' in South Africa ) steaks and chops at the same time as measuring the temperature profiles with our thermocouple , " Marean says .
Symbolic behavior and modern human origins
" Our discovery shows that these early modern humans had this complex cognition , " Brown says .
" This expression of cognitive complexity in technology by these early modern humans on the south coast of South Africa provides further evidence that this locality may have been the origin location for the lineage that leads to all modern humans , which appeared between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago in Africa , " explains Marean .
" There is no consensus as to when modern human behavior appears , but by 70,000 years ago there is good evidence for symbolic behavior , " he says .
" Many researchers are looking for technological proxies for complex cognition , and heat treatment is likely one such proxy .
" Prior to our work , heat treatment was widely regarded as first occurring in Europe at about 25,000 years ago , " Marean says .
" We push this back at least 45,000 years , and , perhaps , 139,000 years , and place it on the southern tip of Africa at Pinnacle Point . "
The African location was at the center of another discovery by Marean - the documentation of the earliest evidence for exploitation of marine foods and modification of pigments - reported in the Oct. 17 , 2007 , journal Nature .
" Combined , these results sharply advance our knowledge of modern human origins , and show that something special in human cognition was happening on the coastline of South Africa during this crucial final phase in human origins , " Marean says .
He adds that some time around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago , " these modern humans left the warm confines of Africa and penetrated into the colder glacial environment of Europe and Asia , where they encountered Neanderthals .
" By 35,000 years ago these Neanderthal populations were mostly extinct , and modern humans dominated the land from Spain to China to Australia , " Marean says .
" The command of fire , documented by our study of heat treatment , provides us with a potential explanation for the rapid migration of these Africans across glacial Eurasia - they were masters of fire and heat and stone , a crucial advantage as these tropical people penetrated the cold lands of the Neanderthal , " says Marean .

Other members of the research team and co-authors of " Fire As an Engineering tool of Early Modern Humans , " include David Baun , University of Cape Town ; Andy I.R. Herries , University of New South Wales and University of Liverpool ; Zenobia Jacobs and Michael C. Meyer , University of Wollongong , Australia ; Changal Tribolo , CNRS - University of Bordeaux , France ; David L.

They work together on the South African Coast Paleoclimate , Paleoenvironment , Paleoecology , Paleoanthropology Project , known as SACP4 , which is directed by Marean , funded by the National Science Foundation and the Hyde Family Foundation , and supported by Arizona State University research and academic units including the Institute of Human Origins , Institute for Social Science Research , and School of Human Evolution and Social Change in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
" Our team , working at Pinnacle Point near Mossel Bay , is a leader in revealing the process of how we became who we are today , and we are doing this with state - of - the - art fieldwork and laboratory analysis at this locality , " Marean says .
He notes the specifics of the discovery involved combining thermoluminescence , magnetic analysis , optically stimulated luminescence dating , experimental stone tool production , mechanical testing , and field archaeology .

EL MIRADOR , Guatemala ( Reuters ) - One of Guatemala ’s greatest ancient Mayan cities may have died out in a bloody battle atop a huge pyramid between a royal family and invaders from hundreds of miles away , archaeologists say .

Researchers are carrying out DNA tests on blood samples from hundreds of spear tips and arrowheads dug up with bone fragments and smashed pottery at the summit of the El Tigre pyramid in the Mayan city of El Mirador , buried beneath jungle vegetation 8 km from Guatemala ’s border with Mexico .
Many of the excavated blades are made of obsidian which the archaeologists have traced to a source hundreds of miles away in the Mexican highlands .
They believe the spears belonged to warriors from Teotihuacan , an ancient civilization near Mexico City and an ally of Tikal , which was an enemy city of El Mirador .
“ We ’ve found over 200 of the obsidian tips alone , as well as flint ones , indicating there was a tremendous battle , ” said excavation leader Richard Hansen , a senior scientist in Idaho State University ’s anthropology department who is pushing the pyramid battle theory .
“ It looks like this was the final point of defense for a small group of inhabitants , ” told Reuters .
El Mirador is one of the biggest ancient cities in the Western Hemisphere and is thought to have been home to between 100,000 and 200,000 people at its height .
Historians believe it was built up from around 850 BC and flourished for hundreds of years before it was mysteriously abandoned in 150 AD .
Many archaeologists think the size and elaborate stucco decoration of the buildings in the city are to blame as the inhabitants used up stone , trees and lime plaster in their construction until their resources were entirely depleted .
Hansen ’s team believes a group of some 200 people , thought to be the last remnants of the royal family , stayed in the ruined metropolis until they were attacked by warriors from Teotihuacan .
They believe the invaders were allies of Tikal , around 60 km to the southeast , which resented being dwarfed by the enormous pyramids of El Mirador and was eager to make sure the enemy never recovered .
They think Teotihuacan warriors trapped the survivors in a siege before a bloody battle that sealed the city ’s fate .
MODERN THREAT
Hansen ’s archaeologists found graffiti they believe was left by Teotihuacan fighters who smashed up carved Maya monoliths and left crudely etched skull drawings , known as Tlalocs , on the rock as proof of their victory .
“ The Tlaloc is the war god image of the highland Mexicans ( and we found it ) crudely pecked on these monuments , suggesting that perhaps a hostile event had taken place here , ” Hansen said .
The team sent excavated spear tips to a lab in Missouri where scientists are trying to extract blood samples for DNA tests .
They expect to find one DNA type in blood on the obsidian objects and a different type on the Maya - made flint fragments , suggesting a battle between two racial groups .
El Mirador is home to one of the world ’s biggest pyramids by volume , La Danta , named after the tapirs that roam the dense jungle that hid the pre-Columbian treasures for decades until the site was discovered in the early 20th century .
American archeologists who made an aerial survey of the El Mirador Basin in Guatemala ’s northern Peten region in the 1930s mistook the tree - and vegetation - covered pyramid for a volcano .
Hansen has worked with teams digging at El Mirador for some 30 years .
The site is at risk from looters , poachers and loggers trying to make a living out of the forest , as well as drug traffickers seeking to move cocaine into Mexico .
Last year , President Alvaro Colom announced the creation of a huge park in the Peten region to encompass both El Mirador and the already excavated Tikal , a popular tourist site .
The park will include a silent propane - powered train to lug tourists to the El Mirador ruins , currently only accessible by helicopter or a two - day hike through the jungle .
One of Britain 's most prestigious art galleries has reportedly removed a nude photo of actress Brooke Shields as a child .
The Tate Modern had been planning to include the photo of Shields , aged 10 , wearing heavy make - up and taken from the knees up , in its new Pop Life exhibition which opens to the public on Thursday ( local time ) .
The picture , taken by American artist Richard Prince and called Spiritual America , was removed from display by gallery officials after a visit from the police Obscene Publications Unit , according to The Guardian newspaper .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that officers from the unit had met Tate staff on Wednesday .
" The officers have specialist experience in this field and are keen to work with gallery management to ensure that they do not inadvertently break the law or cause any offence to their visitors , " he said .
The image of Shields was of potential concern to police because it was of a 10 - year - old and could be viewed as sexually provocative , the newspaper reported , quoting sources .
The work , which is a photograph of a photograph , was recently shown in New York at the Guggenheim Museum without attracting major controversy .
A Tate spokeswoman confirmed the display had been " temporarily closed down " and the catalogue for the exhibition withdrawn from sale .
The work was to be accompanied by a warning about its sensitivity .
The Tate had sought legal advice before including the photo in its exhibition .

Police in Istanbul , Turkey fired tear gas and broke out the hose on anti-globalization protesters of the annual World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( I.M.F. ) meetings .
6 Oct 09 | InfoShop News
“ Police in Turkey have used tear gas and water cannons to break up protests against a meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , ” the BBC reports .
Financial Times ( FT ) Chief U.S. correspondent Krishna Guha reports the “ self - styled ‘ group of 30 ’ leading financial figures ” met on Monday where “ present and former policymakers joined bankers and economists ” to suggest the I.M.F. should “ monitor ” the global financial system on a “ near - continuous basis ” .
The BBC adds : “ The I.M.F. is urgently discussing ways to make itself more representative of the new world order where developing countries make up nearly half of the world economy , but only have about one - third of the votes in the I.M.F. ”
Delphine Strauss at the FT reports up to 6,000 — of whom “ appeared to be largely union members or students ” — showed up to demonstrate against the meeting of the oligarchs :
Protesters and passers - by took shelter in doorways as riot police and armoured vehicles cleared Taksim square , the city ’s transport hub .
Some wrapped scarves around their face as protection against clouds of tear gas .
About 100 people were taken into custody , some for throwing stones and petrol bombs as they tried to break through a police cordon and march towards the conference centre , a few hundred yards north of Taksim square , Turkish media reported .
“ There are police everywhere , we had 20 police just on the corner , ” said a receptionist at one hotel on Taksim square , adding that calm had returned with people walking around outside by noon … .
Protesters were authorised to march along Istiklal Street to Taksim––a popular route for demonstrators on most weekends — but not to continue north to the secure area dubbed “ congress valley ” .
Like recent protests in Iran and Pittsburgh , Turkish police justify assaulting the protesters with the rationale that people are ‘ only free [ sic ] to assemble where they ’re ordered to do so ’ .
The assault is n’t so much to subordinate demonstrators as it is to send a message to those already apprehensive to standing up for their natural rights .
The message : ‘ What we say goes ! ’
The protesters are routinely referred to as “ anti-capitalist ” — which is n’t a false application to a vast majority of them , but is used pejoratively and that should not be mistaken because it manufactures avatars of those who “ appeared to be largely union members or students ” as nothing more than reactionary teenage angst and so - called ‘ union thugs ’ calling for the reincarnation of Josef Stalin .
The people are protesting a relative handful of oligarchs within the international banking cartel exploiting the Third World and working people in the so - called “ developed ” and “ developing ” world to enhance its power and prosperity .
To simply call the protests “ anti-capitalist ” is a deliberate miscommunication of the protesters ’ message which would not be radical in a well - informed , free society :
We do not consent to a parasitic elite feeding off of what ’s become their global plantation .
“ The World Bank is pushing at the meetings for rich countries to give it more money so that it can increase its lending activities to poor and middle - income countries , ” Mr. Guha reported with Chris Giles at the FT just before the Istanbul meeting .
“ The bank has already stepped up its lending and is making the case that it is in rich countries ’ ‘ self - interest ’ to provide the bank with more money at a time when their public finances are under severe strain . ”
The World Bank and I.M.F. are revenue - seeking international banking institutions that lend money from for - profit banks to Third World countries at interest .
The money is initially stolen from the productive working classes of the ‘ developed ’ world by the State and handed over to the so - called “ private ” banks to lend back to the State with interest to exercise relatively more excessive usury on those already exploited most .
Monday , Professor Alnoor Ebrahim of Harvard University wrote an op -ed at the FT criticizing these two institutions for its exploitation .
Prof. Ebrahim writes that the policies of the World Bank ’s 65 - year history are contrary to its “ sole purpose of fighting poverty ” .
“ The bank ’s sister institution , the International Monetary Fund , shares this conflict , ” Prof Ebrahim adds .
“ The bank ’s business model fails at the very foundations of its structure .
Its two main sources of revenue , interest payments on loans from borrowing governments and contributions from wealthy member governments , both stand in conflict with its anti-poverty mission . ”
The interest is used to virtually enslave the Third World — eliminating the growth potential — picking the winners and losers from the developing world .
The so - called “ contributions from wealthy member governments ” are anything but contributions .
They ’re investments by force .
Prof. Ebrahim adds :
As with any lender , the bank relies on making loans so that interest payments can provide a steady stream of income .
But this breeds a persistent problem that needs to be addressed .
Because the poorest countries are often unable to keep up with payments , even on low - interest loans , the bank has steadily shifted its lending to those that can — middle - income countries such as Brazil , India and China .
These countries could secure financing in private capital markets , but are attracted to the bank ’s more favourable terms for anti-poverty programmes .
In addition , they know the bank needs them to survive .
So they can push for even better conditions , such as reducing social and environmental safeguards intended to protect the most vulnerable communities and natural resources … .
The second main source of revenue for the bank , contributions from its wealthiest member governments , also compromises its mission to the poor .
Based on a corporate shareholder model , this arrangement gives the strongest voice to its biggest donors .
This governance model has been widely criticised for creating a moral hazard problem - – the countries that wield the most voting power are not accountable to citizens who are affected by their decisions .
The bank needs these infusions of money from the richest members , which support grants and interest - free loans to some of its poorest countries .
But though the shareholder model may be useful for generating funds , it undermines a critical component of development — accountability to the people most affected .
Alan Beattie reports at the FT : “ Most of the fund ’s activity this year has concentrated on central and eastern Europe , where successive governments have struggled with capital flight and current account deficits . ”
But , “ it issued a range of new policy guidelines and lending instruments suggesting an overwhelming imperative to get money out of the door fast with fewer strings attached ” .
“ By allowing a European country leeway , he said ” — David Lubin , emerging markets strategist at Citigroup in London — “ the impression given was ‘ not of an International Monetary Fund but a Euro - Atlantic Monetary Fund ’ .
Mr Lubin said the I.M.F. appeared influenced by the E.U. , which provided 42 % of the total package lent to Latvia and wanted to avoid a devaluation . ”
At the Pittsburgh G - 20 Summit less than two weeks ago , the Anglo - American call to the I.M.F. was for it to implement policies to force down the exchange rate of China ’s currency ( the renminbi ) to save their own , Mr. Guha reported after the Summit .
With Chris Giles , he followed up on his report that the G - 20 was “ unable to agree ” on a currency agreement at the Summit , I.M.F.
Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn “ reiterated his criticism of China ’s ‘ undervalued ’ currency … [ T ]he U.S. and Europe believe the renminbi needs to appreciate to help reduce China ’s still large trade surplus . ”
The World Bank and I.M.F. are being used by the Anglo - American factions to forcefully prevent the implosion of the intrinsically worthless greenback and euro .
Nothing of relieving the odious debt inflicted upon Western workers and the Third World .
Only the preservation of the “ Euro - Atlantic ” financial oligarchy over us .
This is n’t a wide - ranging ‘ conspiracy theory ’ .
It ’s the basic truism that those most greatly affected by decisions — decisions so great as whether or not they eat that day — have the least say in said decision - making processes .
This is most true in the global financial system — not a free - market , but an overt cabal by fiat .
A government - run healthcare program may become an “ option ” for those who do n’t have employer - sponsored healthcare coverage , but a government - run healthcare system will not .
House Democratic leaders quietly stripped a single - payer provision from the House version of the healthcare overhaul Thursday .
The measure would have allowed states to set up their own state - run healthcare systems , where local governments would have become de facto health insurers for residents .

A Democratic aide told Roll Call that there was “ consensus ” to remove the provision , which was proposed by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and inserted by a majority vote in the House Education and Labor Committee .
“ The fact is , the majority of the Democratic Caucus agreed that the most effective way forward was through a competitive marketplace coupled with strong consumer protections and the choice of a public option , ” Education and Labor Committee spokesman Aaron Albright remarked .
Kucinich ’s amendment had been added to the bill in a bipartisan 27 - 19 vote in the Education and Labor Committee .
While supported by liberals , the measure would likely have been a “ poison pill ” for the overhaul bill , where Democrats have struggled to round up votes for a “ robust ” public option .
Kucinich said he was disappointed by the House leaders ’ move .
“ Today , advocates of true health care reform were disappointed to learn that the Kucinich amendment was removed from the latest version of the health care reform bill , ” Kucinich said in a statement .
“ At the end of the day , states may be given the option to opt out , but wo n’t be allowed to opt into a proven system that provides all of a state ’s residents with better health care .

“ Many states are demanding single payer , ” he added .
“ The Lewin Group ’s financial analysis of the California single payer bill that passed the legislature twice found that ‘ the net cost of the program to state and local governments is a savings of about $ 900 million ’ in 2006 alone .
There are also strong single payer movements in Pennsylvania , New York , Illinois , Colorado , and New Mexico . ”
Facing the intransigence of Republicans to support any version of Democratic healthcare reform , the party has had to cater to its conservative and moderate wings to round up the necessary support to get the bill passed .
Concessions have generally involved the watering - down of attempts to create a government - run competitor to private insurance companies .
Kucinich said he could “ only conclude ” his amendment was taken out of the bill “ because of pressure from the insurance companies , ” though moderate Democrats ’ resistance to such a wide - ranging proposal seems equally plausible .

“ If a state wants better health care than can be provided by the federal government in the health care bill we are seeing today , the federal government should not stand in their way , ” the congressman said .
“ The removal of the Kucinich amendment constitutes yet another capitulation to the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries who are already reaping billions of dollars from the bill . ”
Canada , Australia and the United Kingdom all have single payer government run healthcare plans .
The United States ’ healthcare system — where private insurance companies control the market — is largely an anomaly among developed Western economies .
" Although the main interests of the Federal Reserve are macroeconomic in nature , well - functioning financial markets are ancillary to good economic performance .
Conversely , financial instability can compromise economic growth and price stability .
Because of this intimate connection with economic performance , the Federal Reserve has a clear interest in promoting the stability of financial markets . "
- Former Fed Governor Fred Mishkin , 2007 col·lat·er·al / k'lat 'r'l ; k'latr'l / • n. 1 . something pledged as security for repayment of a loan .
Recently , Zero Hedge presented a snapshot analysis of the various securities that made up the triparty repo agreement involving JPM , Lehman and the Fed .
We uncovered numerous bankrupt companies ' equities that were being pledged as collateral for what ultimately was taxpayer exposure .
To our surprise , this discovery is not an exception , and in fact in the days immediately preceding the collapse of Bear Stearns first , and subsequently , Lehman Brothers , the Federal Reserve established and refined a program that permitted banks to pledge virtually any security as collateral , including not just investment grade bonds and higher ranked securities , but also stocks of companies , the riskiest investment possible , and a guaranteed way for taxpayer capital to evaporate in the context of a disintegrating financial system , all with the purpose of bailing out Wall Street 's major institutions .
On two occasions last year : on March 16 , 2008 , and subsequently on September 14 , 2008 , the Federal Reserve first established what is known as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) , and subsequently amended it , so that the Fed , in becoming the lender of last resort , would allow any collateral , up to and including stocks , to be funded by the Federal Reserve 's credit facility , in order to prevent the $ 4.5 trillion repo financing system from imploding .
By doing so , the Federal Reserve effectively gave a Carte Blanche to primary dealers to purchase any and all equities they so desired , with such purchases immediately being funded by the US taxpayer , via the PDCF .
In essence , this was equivalent to the Fed purchasing equities by itself through a Primary Dealer agent .
Readers who have been concerned with the moral hazard provided by the Fed 's monetization of Treasury and Mortgage debt , should be doubly concerned by this Fed action which sent three key messages to Wall Street : i ) it made sure that Primary Dealers would generate massive profits on risky assets as the Fed would provide the funding to acquire any and all stocks ( keep in mind the cost of funding of the PDCF to primary dealers was negligible ) ; ii ) it tipped its hand as to the existence and modus operandi of the rumored " plunge protection team , " iii ) and it made clear that the much maligned , by none other than Chairman Bernanke , concept of " moral hazard " is the one and only systemically relevant doctrine as long as the Fed 's Chairman is in control , and not subject to any auditing auspices .
The fact that PDs used over $ 140 billion of taxpayer money within a few weeks of the program 's expansion in September to fund what one can assume were exclusively equity purchases , demonstrates that the American financial system got the message .
The ( Triparty ) Repo System
Before we get into the details of the Fed 's Primary Dealer Credit Facility , it is prudent to present the beating heart of the American financial system , more so than securitizations or money markets , all of which went into cardiac arrest on several occasions in 2008 : the Triparty Repo system .
As the name implies , a triparty repo transaction involves three parties : a cash lender ( the investor ) , a borrower that will provide collateral against the loan , and a triparty clearing bank .
The triparty clearing bank provides cash and collateral custody accounts for parties to the repo deal and collateral management services .
These services include ensuring that pledged collateral meets the cash lenders ’ requirements , pricing collateral , ensuring collateral sufficiency , and moving cash and collateral between the parties ’ accounts .
Both the investor and the borrower must have accounts at the clearing bank , and all three parties are bound by legal documentation called the triparty repo agreement .
In the United States , there are two triparty clearing banks : the Bank of New York and J.P. Morgan Chase .
One of the operational benefits of triparty repos is that , regardless of the term of the loan , the clearing bank unwinds the transaction each morning , returning the cash to the investor ’s account and the collateral to the borrower ’s account .
Then at the end of the day , the borrower pledges qualifying collateral back to the deal , which once priced , determined as eligible , and deemed sufficient to meet the terms of the deal by the clearing bank , is moved to the investor ’s account while the cash is placed in the borrower ’s account .
In this way , no specific collateral is committed for more than overnight .
This arrangement allows borrowers to pledge whatever eligible collateral they have on hand each day , thus enabling them to manage their securities portfolios more effectively .
An important implication of this daily unwinding , however , is that the counterparty risk for the investor shifts from its repo counterparty to the triparty clearing bank , and the clearing bank becomes exposed to the borrower .
Overnight , the cash investor has the borrower ’s collateral in its account and the borrower has the cash .
If the borrower defaults overnight — say , by filing for bankruptcy — the lender has the collateral in its account and thus is covered and the clearing bank is not affected .
Once the collateral and cash are returned in the morning , however , the clearing bank , which has extended credit to the borrower to finance the original collateral purchase , becomes exposed to the borrower .
Consequently , the clearing bank needs to determine each morning if it is comfortable accepting the exposure to the borrower that the reversal of the transaction will create .
As readers will recall , the reason why Jamie Dimon blew up in his letter to Barclay 's John Varley and in fact threatened with litigation , is that the latter attempted to stuff JPMorgan , as the Lehman triparty clearing house , with about $ 7 billion in collateral for which Barclays had suddenly gotten buyers remorse and decided it had no desire for , after prices plunged in the days after the Lehman bankruptcy .
Triparty repos are a subset of the broader repo market .
As the name implies , a repo is a simple transaction where the holder of a security obtains funds by selling that security to another market participant with the understanding that the security will be repurchased at a fixed price on some future date .
Very much like a simple mortgage transaction , the seller is borrowing funds against the security , usually as a means of financing the original purchase of the security .
The buyer is traditionally a pension fund , a money market mutual fund , or a bank , which makes what it assumes is a safe collateralized investment ( using haircuts , more on that shortly ) , and in exchange it is paid a spread on the money forwarded .
In today 's economy most repos occur as triparty contracts , in which the clearing bank assesses the value of the collateral and imposes a haircut , or the difference between the estimated market value and a downside case for how much a lender can borrow .
Logically , the size of the haircut reflects the collateral 's riskiness .
The following table which we presented previously discloses that haircuts determined by JPMorgan in the JPM / Lehman / Fed triparty repo .
As one can see , the amount of haircut wiggle room is huge , and even when the taxpayer 's money is on the hook for the full repo amount , the haircuts are still relatively tame .
Yet if the fair value of the collateral is not properly determined for in a downside case , it pressures accelerated unwinds as banks are fully aware that what they have marked their securities making up their repos for an above FV .
What results is a scramble for the exits as everyone attempts to unwind their repos first thereby causing a feedback loop where selling begets more selling , and the entire repo market grinds to a halt .
Why are haircuts an issue ?
The repo market is huge .
At its peak it was bigger than the Money Market .
At the Bear Stearns collapse in March 2008 , there was over $ 4.5 trillion in repos ( contrast that to Money Markets which peaked at around $ 3.8 trillion ) , of which the bulk is in overnight repos ( we will get into the maturity variation on repos in a second ) .
The chart below indicates the phenomenal growth of the repo system , as the banking system glutted itself on free and excessive credit over the past decade .
From 1997 , through its peak just over ten years later , the amount of outstanding repos at Primary Dealers increased by over 400 % !
A critical observation is that beginning in about 2005 , the amount of overnight repos quickly overtook the term repo outstandings .
Why is this relevant ?
As the share of overnight repos increased and hit nearly 75 % in 2008 , it created a significant duration funding risk .
The urgent shift to shorter term financing meant that much more of the Primary Dealers ' funding had to be rolled each day , at terms satisfactory to the clearing bank .
With loans coming due quickly , in a downward asset price spiral , dealers have to scramble to raise capital necessary to pay back creditors .
Coupled with lenders tightening credit standards and suddenly imposing larger haircuts on loans ( compare the Lehman to Fed haircuts above ) , and it become immediately obvious how the vicious cycle of deleveraging can accelerate without any natural breaking mechanism .
In fact , a staggering $ 2 trillion worth of repos were extinguished in just over a year between the repo peak of $ 4.5 trillion in March 2008 and the latest reading of $ 2.5 trillion in July 2009 .
A last side - effect of the credit bubble , was the increasing use of subpar and illiquid securities to make up the collateral of repo transactions .
With only so many quality securities outstanding , banks found themselves scratching their heads how to legally continue the providing cheap credit against worse and worse assets .
What resulted was an explosion in toxic junk backing repo agreements .
In fact , according to estimates , " less liquid " collateral hit almost 60 % of all repos at the peak in early 2009 .
The deterioration in underlying collateral quality made the subsequent repo implosion a virtual certainty .
Originally focused on the highest quality collateral - Treasurys and Agency debt ( ironically , Agencies and MBS are not more shunned by the entire investing community than CCC - rated HY paper , compliments of the Fed 's market intervention efforts ) , by 2008 repos were using junk bonds , whole loans , trust receipts and even equities for collateral purposes .
A side effect of more distressed collateral is less liquidity , and of course , when one most needs access to liquidity , i.e. , unwinds of distressed positions , is when the liquidity is gone : in the event of the guaranteed crisis which the Federal Reserve completely failed to anticipate , the selling of illiquid securities would take time and occur and major losses to lenders .
The crisis
The repo market hit an all time high days before Bear Stearns was expected to file for bankruptcy , and then froze .
In the first week of March 2008 , liquidity in the repo market became strained .
Creditors were worried not just about extended counterparty risk , but also about the actual creditworthiness of the collateral posted in repos : for the first time ever the banking system was forced to look at not just its own balance sheet , but those of competitors , and recoiled at what it saw .
An immediate escalation saw repo haircuts increase dramatically , with the one security impacted the most being mortgage - backed securities for obvious reasons , but even traditionally safe securities such as Treasurys saw their haircuts grow substantially .
As the spike in haircuts forced dealers to shun the repo market entirely , they turned to other sources of short - term funding , namely the Eurodollar market ( LIBOR ) .
While the LIBOR market did not become the go to conduit for short - term arrangements during the Bear debacle , following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers all repo bets were off and dealers scrambled to satisfy their near - terms funding needs using LIBOR .
The Resulting spike in the LIBOR rate can be seen in the chart below .
Once 3M LIBOR was at about 5 % , even the Eurodollar market was no longer attractive , leaving the only other option : massive asset firesales .
And here is the liquidity crunch in its full flow - chart glory :
If can not obtain short - term ( overnight or term ) funding in repo market , go to Eurodollar market
If can not obtain short - term funding in Eurodollar market ( LIBOR ) , go to asset sales
If asset sales are impossible due to lack bids , illiquid markets , and collateral consists of toxic MBS and CCC - rated junk bonds , yet margin calls are streaming and repo counterparties are demanding their cash back , go to bankruptcy File for bankruptcy
This would be natural chain of events in a normal capitalist country .
However , America in times of stress is anything but - which is why enter 3.5 ( after 3 and before 4 ) : the Federal Reserve .
What the Fed did was to basically extend credit , first to Bear Stearns ( through JP Morgan which ended up acquiring Bear 's toxic asset mess , now better known as Maiden Lane as it continues to reside on the Fed 's balance sheet ) , and second to Lehman Brothers ( here JPMorgan was not the ultimate beneficiary of the " good bank , " and instead it was merely the clearing agent of the triparty repo which had a very nervous
Fed on one side , stuck with nearly $ 70 billion in worthless securities consisting of anything from defaulted CRE whole loans , to stock in hundreds of bankrupt companies .
Keep in mind this is not the first time the Fed has found itself in this situation : in 1998 , when LTCM blew up , it was a dress rehearsal to the dot , along with the same feedback - loop driven evaporation of liquidity , as haircuts collapsed and nobody wanted to be on contingent to anyone else making rash decision .
Yet there was one notable difference between 1998 and 2008 : roughly $ 3.5 trillion ( or 350 % more ) in outstanding repos : a number equally to about 30 % of the US GDP , and a number sufficient to bring down the entire financial ponzi house of cards .
Enter the Federal Reserve and the doctrine of encouraged moral hazard .
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility
On March 16 , 2008 , finding itself in a quandary as to how to unclog frozen repo markets , the Federal Reserve Board announced the Primary Dealer Credit Facility .
Most notably from the press release is the disclosure on collateral : " Credit extended to primary dealers under this facility may be collateralized by a broad range of investment - grade debt securities . "
Note : not junk bonds , equities or any other toxic trash .
At least at this point the Fed , while acting to preserve liquidity , still retained some semblance of fiduciary responsibility to the U.S. taxpayer .
A formulaic definition of the PDCF is provided below :
The PDCF program is based on the triparty repo legal and operational infrastructure that the Federal Reserve uses to conduct its repo operations .
To access the PDCF , primary dealers communicate a demand for overnight funding to their clearing banks , typically by 5 p.m. ET on business days .
The clearing bank verifies that a sufficient amount of eligible collateral has been pledged to the loan by the primary dealer and notifies the Federal Reserve Bank of New York accordingly .
Once the New York Fed receives notice that a sufficient amount of margin - adjusted eligible collateral has been assigned to its account , it transfers the amount of the loan to the clearing bank for credit to the primary dealer .
The pledged collateral is valued by the clearing banks using vendor pricing services .
Loans are limited to the amount of margin - adjusted eligible collateral pledged by the dealer and assigned to the New York Fed ’s account at the clearing bank .
While loans under the PDCF are collateralized , they are loans made under recourse ; thus , the primary dealer is responsible for repayment even if the collateral loses value overnight .
PDCF loans made to primary dealers increase the total supply of reserves in the banking system , in the same way that discount window loans do .
When the Federal Reserve ’s Open Market Trading Desk was targeting a non-zero federal funds rate , the reserve impact of PDCF loans was offset using a number of tools , including , but not necessarily limited to , reverse repurchase agreements , outright sales or redemptions of Treasury securities , a reduction in the size of conventional repo transactions , and use of the authority to pay interest on reserves .
However , when the FOMC reduced the target fed funds rate to a range from zero to 25 basis points , there was no longer any need to offset or “ sterilize ” these loans .
As it does for loans made to depository institutions through the discount window , the Federal Reserve makes information on PDCF borrowing available each Thursday , generally at 4:30 p.m. ET , through its Statistical Release H.4.1 , “ Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks . ”
The H.4.1 release reports the total amount of PDCF credit outstanding at the close of business on the previous business day as well as the average daily amount of credit outstanding for each week .
The legal authority to establish the PDCF is based on Section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
Section 13 ( 3 ) , passed in 1932 , allows the Federal Reserve to provide credit to individuals , partnerships , or corporations on an emergency basis .
The central bank applied it to primary dealers for the purpose of establishing the PDCF .
So far so good : the Fed was concerned about maintaining liquidity and while one could find fault with some of its proposed haircuts on various security classes ( see table above ) , overall due to the exclusion of risky assets , the Fed was mortgaging purchases of IG - rated collateral and above .
The twist
All through the spring and summer of 2008 , the Fed was confident it had managed to glue the pieces together , and retain some semblance of stability .
Then came that fateful weekend of September 13th about which so much has been written .
In advance of the Lehman collapse , and what the Fed knew would quickly become a lock - up of not just money markets ( which nearly occurred ) , but of the entire repo system , bringing practically all leveraged institutions to a halt and prompt liquidation , the Federal Reserve announced this little discussed amendment to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility :
For immediate release
The Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced several initiatives to provide additional support to financial markets , including enhancements to its existing liquidity facilities .
" In close collaboration with the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission , we have been in ongoing discussions with market participants , including through the weekend , to identify potential market vulnerabilities in the wake of an unwinding of a major financial institution and to consider appropriate official sector and private sector responses , " said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben S. Bernanke .
" The steps we are announcing today , along with significant commitments from the private sector , are intended to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets . "
" We have been and remain in close contact with other U.S. and international regulators , supervisory authorities , and central banks to monitor and share information on conditions in financial markets and firms around the world , " Chairman Bernanke said .
The collateral eligible to be pledged at the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) has been broadened to closely match the types of collateral that can be pledged in the tri-party repo systems of the two major clearing banks .
Previously , PDCF collateral had been limited to investment - grade debt securities .
The collateral for the Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) also has been expanded ; eligible collateral for Schedule 2 auctions will now include all investment - grade debt securities .
Previously , only Treasury securities , agency securities , and AAA - rated mortgage - backed and asset - backed securities could be pledged .
These changes represent a significant broadening in the collateral accepted under both programs and should enhance the effectiveness of these facilities in supporting the liquidity of primary dealers and financial markets more generally .
Also , Schedule 2 TSLF auctions will be conducted each week ; previously , Schedule 2 auctions had been conducted every two weeks .
In addition , the amounts offered under Schedule 2 auctions will be increased to a total of $ 150 billion , from a total of $ 125 billion .
Amounts offered in Schedule 1 auctions will remain at a total of $ 50 billion .
Thus , the total amount offered in the TSLF program will rise to $ 200 billion from $ 175 billion .
The Board also adopted an interim final rule that provides a temporary exception to the limitations in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act .
It allows all insured depository institutions to provide liquidity to their affiliates for assets typically funded in the tri-party repo market .
This exception expires on January 30 , 2009 , unless extended by the Board , and is subject to various conditions to promote safety and soundness .
The bolded text is all you need to know to find the smoking gun for any and all allegations of " plunge protection " or however one wishes to frame the invisible market bid .
On September 14th , 2008 the gloves cames off , when the Fed , stated in a press release no less , that it would provide virtually free taxpayer capital to banks so that they could go to the market and purchase equities !
What was the response ?
In a word : astounding , as bank after bank rushed to purchase however many equities they needed , funded by the Federal Reserve , as PDCF lending skyrocketed from $ 0 to $ 150 in a matter of days ( and $ 59.7 billion overnight on Wednesday , September 17th , a day before the Reserve Fund 's breaking the buck caused a near - run on money market accounts ) .
The demand for Fed backstopped equity purchasing was so large that borrowings under the costless PDCF promptly surpassed those of the Fed 's actual Discount Window which did not go much higher than $ 100 billion in the days after the Lehman bankruptcy .
Implications
Gradually the use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility moderated and around April of 2009 there were no additional borrowings on the program .
However , by this time , none more were needed , as banks did not need to use the PDCF - intermediated mechanism for the Fed to purchase stocks .
Beginning in March 2009 , the Fed was now running the capital markets directly , by pushing prices of " riskless " assets ever higher through its $ 1.7 trillion Quantitative Easing program , thereby making it all too clear to PDs and other financial institutions that moral hazard was once again tolerated and encouraged , as the Fed in essence announced that banks should be acquiring risky assets , as it was the " purchaser of last resort " of riskless ones .
Furthermore , by being a self - professed " lender of last resort " as well , providing a perpetual backstop for an indirect way to bid up equities at a 50 bps funding cost , the Federal Reserve has now managed to singlehandedly take over the entire capital market .
With regards to moral hazard , the Fed had this to say with respect to whether it was encouraging this phenomenon by the promotion of the PDCF :
" Concerns have been raised that the PDCF , by offering primary dealers a liquidity backstop , encourages risky behavior .
In this view , the facility effectively invites primary dealers to delay raising equity because they can instead borrow from the Federal Reserve .
These “ moral hazard ” issues are similar to those that arise in the context of emergency lending to banks .
The countervailing view , however , is that the PDCF functions to protect prudently managed institutions from the damaging consequences of the risks taken by highly leveraged firms .
In the period following the Bear Stearns crisis and again after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the liquidity provided by the PDCF helped reduce the spillover of distress to more conservatively managed firms by enabling these firms to maintain their securities inventories and to fulfill their obligations to creditors and clients . "
Alas , Mr. Bernanke , that has to be the weakest non-explanation explanation ever proffered by the Federal Reserve .
Far from answering the question , it avoids it entirely by stating that the PDCF makes lives tolerable for those who , when the next credit implosion comes around , were not as greedy as the new Bears and the Lehmans of Credit Crunch v2 .
Yet in the meantime , PDs and banks should take full advantage of the Fed 's market manipulating generosity courtesy of such middle - class devaluing constructs as Quantititve Easing , which all it does is kick the can down so the consequences of dealing with Wall Street 's near collapse can be the next administration 's problem , and the PDCF .
We ask when , along with such other financial system crutches as TARP and TLGP , will the Fed finally eliminate the PDCF .
After all the Fed has repeated many times that its sole purpose is to strengthen the US dollar and to work on behalf of America 's hundreds of millions of taxpayers , not the thousands of kleptocrats working on Wall Street .
It would be nice once in our lifetime to see the Fed actually put its ( ironically , that would be our ) money where its mouth is .
Lastly , the bigger question is when will Gramm - Leach - Bliley finally be repealed .
As long as commercial banks and dealers are allowed to commingle their balance sheets , and as long as firms like Goldman which have yet to open even one deposit branch exist and have a riskless balance sheet courtesy of the American taxpayer , nothing will ever change .
The Gramm - Leach - Bliley act from 1999 was the precursor for the current symptom of Too Big To Fail .
And the administration 's response to date has been to make the firms at the top , even more systematically critical , when it should be focusing only on how to disintermediate them from the very fabric of America 's capital markets .
The CPDF provides a glimpse into the Fed's , up to now speculative , and hereby confirmed , willingness to ( in ) directly manipulate equity markets via its Primary Dealer network .
If there is no risk associated with borrowing practically free taxpayer money , it is obvious that banks will manipulate stock prices to the point where nobody but other Primary Dealers who enjoy the same Fed backstop benefits will remain in the market .
As more and more American retail and institutional investors realize the magnitude of the scam , the risk that equity markets will remain an isolated bubble in perpetuity where Primary Dealers simply play around with the Fed 's excess capital , becomes tangible .
And as long as there is no regulatory reform to commence the split of TBTF institutions , as long as financial system crutches persist and as long as the opportunity cost of being wrong is zero ( and borne only by US taxpayers ) , US equity markets will continue to be a scam .
Therefore , Zero Hedge advises all readers to immediately remove all their capital from the stock market , until such time as proactive steps are taken to remedy these numerous concerns , or alternatively suffer the consequences of not only another Fed inflated market bubble , but the even sadder consequences of its unwind .

We probably wo n't get around to actually seeing Michael Moore 's anti-capitalist film until it shows up for free on the internet .
But fortunately Ira Stoll of the Future of Capitalism went to see it and noticed that the funniest part is the credits -- where Michael Moore reveals the capitalists behind his film .
From Stoll :
We see that the movie is presented by " Paramount Vantage " in association with the Weinstein Company .
Bob and Harvey Weinstein are listed as executive producers .
If Mr. Moore appreciates any of the irony here he sure does n't share it with viewers , but for those members of the audience who are in on the secret it 's all kind of amusing .
Paramount Vantage , after all , is controlled by Viacom , on whose board sit none other than Sumner Redstone and former Bear Stearns executive Ace Greenberg , who are n't exactly socialists .
The Weinstein Company announced it was funded with a $ 490 million private placement in which Goldman Sachs advised .
The press release announcing the deal quoted a Goldman spokesman saying , " We are very pleased to be a part of this exciting new venture and look forward to an ongoing relationship with The Weinstein Company . "
Knowing that background puts the rest of the movie in a different context .
Mr. Moore shows Rep. Dennis Kucinich asking rhetorically on the floor of the House of Representatives , " Is this the United States Congress or the board of directors of Goldman Sachs ? "
Later , Mr. Moore shows up at Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan driving an armored Brinks trunk and announcing , " We 're here to get the money back for the American people . "
Maybe Mr. Moore should look in his own pockets .

Just when it looked like every avenue to prevent the extradition of self - confessed NASA Hacker Gary McKinnon had been exhausted , especially when just last week a couple of High Court judges denied him leave to appeal his case to the highest court in the UK , it looks like the hacking cause célèbre has got a reprieve .
In an unexpected twist , Home Secretary Alan Johnson has delayed the extradition proceedings while he considers the medical evidence .
Diagnosed with Asperger 's Syndrome , it has been argued by the Free Gary campaign that to send him to prison in the US would be the equivalent of signing his death warrant .
Certainly there seems to be a groundswell of opinion ( both here and in the US ) that were McKinnon tried in the UK he would most likely face a more lenient sentence .
I myself have argued that he should face the music , as it were , in the UK rather than the US .
I recently stated right here on DaniWeb that " I seriously doubt that McKinnon could get a fair trial in the US where he has already been branded a fugitive from justice ( for merely going through the legal process of appealing against an extradition order , something to which he has every legal and moral right ) and various government and military mouthpieces have made it quite clear that they think the book should be thrown at him and McKinnon should get ' what he deserves ' which would appear to be 60 years in a supermax prison apparently " .
However , I have also made it quite clear that I believe McKinnon should not be let off with a slap on the wrist .
He has broken the law , he admits as much , and must face the consequences - Asperger 's Syndrome or not .
This has , let 's face it , been dragged out long enough now .
McKinnon was arrested way back in 2002 and the 43 year old needs to be prosecuted and tried in a court of law so that he , and everyone else , can move forward .
Gracias a la propaganda del gobierno , es ampliamente conocido que el Paquete Económico 2010 propuesto por el Presidente Felipe Calderón contenía una nueva contribución de 2 % cuya recaudación se utilizaría , supuestamente , para el combate a la pobreza en el país .
Lo que pocos saben , sin embargo , es que el Paquete también contenía una serie de propuestas de nuevos impuestos que parecían estar diseñados para combatir también a la clase media nacional .
La semana pasada , la Cámara de Diputados aprobó finalmente la Ley de Ingresos .
En la versión aprobada se excluyó el llamado impuesto anti-pobreza , aunque se incluyeron la mayor parte de los impuestos anti-clase media propuestos por el Ejecutivo .
Dentro de éstos impuestos destacan el aumento al Impuesto sobre la Renta ( ISR ) para todas las personas que ganan más de 4 salarios mínimos y un Impuesto a las Telecomunicaciones del 3 % .
Con respecto al aumento al ISR , uno se pregunta por qué lo diseñaron como lo hicieron .
De acuerdo a la propuesta del Ejecutivo y a lo aprobado por la Cámara de Diputados , el ISR pasará de 28 a 30 % de manera temporal ( de 2010 a 2012 ) para todos aquellas personas que ganan más de 4 salarios mínimos , es decir , para aquellos que ganan más de $ 6,663 pesos mensuales .
Este monto de ingresos , por cierto , es insuficiente para que una familia de 4 personas no sea considerada en situación de pobreza patrimonial ( se requerirían alrededor de 8 mil pesos al mes para que no fuera considerada pobre ) .
Ahora bien , según el propio dictamen de la iniciativa , el 61 % de la recaudación por este concepto provendría del 7.7 % de los asalariados que percibe más de 20 salarios mínimos mensuales .
Así pues , uno se pregunta porque deben pagar más impuestos las personas o pequeños productores que perciben ingresos relativamente bajos o de nivel medio ( a menos claro , que se considere que 4 salarios mínimos es mucho ) y por qué no se concentra la aplicación del impuesto únicamente en los sectores de la población de mayores ingresos lo que , de paso , no solo aumentaría la recaudación sino que también ayudaría a reducir los abrumadores indicadores de desigualdad que han caracterizado históricamente al país .
Es por ello que una alternativa a esta medida sería aumentar el ISR únicamente a las personas que obtienen ingresos por encima de , digamos , 20 ó 30 salarios mínimos .
Al hacer esto se obtendría una recaudación menor a la que se plantea recaudar ahora , pero se fortalecería la progresividad en la estructura del impuesto sobre la renta .
Por otro lado , con respecto al impuesto a las telecomunicaciones ( telefonía fija , celular , TV de paga e Internet ) es importante señalar que éstas de por sí ya son demasiado caras en México como resultado de la escasa competencia y de la mala regulación en el sector .
Esto ha implicado que el acceso a estos servicios en el país sea relativamente limitado , con lo que se ha excluido a un gran segmento de la población que podría beneficiarse de un mejor acceso a estos servicios .
Así , de acuerdo a una encuesta reciente ( Septiembre , 2009 ) realizada por la empresa Consulta - Mitofsky , apenas en el 56.6 % de los hogares se contaba con servicios de telefonía celular , en 48.6 % con telefonía fija , en menos de una cuarta parte de los hogares se cuenta con acceso a televisión de paga ( 23.6 % ) y menos de una quinta parte tiene acceso a servicios de internet ( 18.6 % ) .
Por cierto que , de los usuarios regulares de internet , el 40 % declaró utilizarlo para el trabajo y el 25 % para la escuela .
Es claro que por los elevados costos de las telecomunicaciones en México , la mayor parte de los usuarios actuales de estos servicios son los hogares de mayores ingresos en el país , sin embargo , precisamente por tratarse de servicios asociados a la diversión , entretenimiento , educación , comunicaciones y tecnología , lo deseable sería que el acceso a estos servicios fuese mayor y no menor , que fuese más democrático no más restrictivo .
Es por ello que un impuesto adicional del 3 % en estos servicios limitaría aun más el acceso a éstos y afectaría directamente a la clase media actual y a la clase media baja que tendrían que destinar recursos adicionales en este tipo de servicios para evitar que la brecha tecnológica entre ellos y las personas de mayores ingresos sigan en aumento .
En suma , tanto la Ley de Ingresos propuesta por el Ejecutivo como la finalmente aprobada por los diputados , están basadas en el mismo principio : aumentar la carga impositiva a los sectores de siempre , es decir , a los contribuyentes cautivos y a la ya de por sí mermada clase media .
Mientras tanto , otras propuestas alternativas como la de aplicar un impuesto a las transacciones financieras ( como ahora ya se está haciendo en Brasil ) , al patrimonio ( lo que hubiera sido realmente una reforma progresiva ) , a las ganancias en la bolsa o a los dividendos ( los cuales , si hubieran estado bien diseñados , se habrían convertido en impuestos dirigidos exclusivamente al segmento de la población de mayores ingresos en el país ) , se quedarán guardados para una mejor ocasión , es decir , para aquella en la que en lugar de aplicar impuestos para combatir a la clase media realmente se busque implementar una reforma fiscal integral que elimine los privilegios y que combata , de fondo y de lleno , a la desigualdad .

The final scenes in Doctor Who are a " brilliant send - off " for David Tennant , his co-star has said .
The Life On Mars actor John Simm returns as The Doctor 's nemesis , The Master , in a two - part Christmas special .
He says he had loads of fun working on David Tennant 's last episodes , which are now complete .
" It 's all done , " he said .
" I 've just spoken to David ( Tennant ) and he has n't seen it either .
We 're doing some dubbing and we go in and do the voice - overs .
" Hopefully we 'll see a bit of it then .
I 'm looking forward to seeing it .
It was a great script and we had such fun doing it .
" It 'll be a brilliant send - off for Mr Tennant .
Last time I did it it was such fun to do .
It was wonderful to be asked back and to be in the very , very last one .
" To go head - to - head with him was a real honour .
It was lovely to be asked .
It was a great , great experience .
We had such fun doing it .
Hopefully it'll come across . "
Simm says one of the main reasons he chose to appear in Doctor Who was because of his son .
He first appeared as The Doctor 's nemesis , The Master , in 2007 in a special three - part end to the last series .
The role means the actor 's eight - year - old son Ryan can now watch at least one of the programmes he appears in .
He said : " The things I usually do on TV or film are quite adult and he does n't get to see it .
" He knew his dad was an actor but I never got the chance to prove it to him because he 's not allowed to watch Life On Mars or Human Traffic or State Of Play .
He would n't get it , thank God .
" It was a great opportunity to make my son proud . "
Oh wow , hey everybody , all the fancy people in New York City , gather ' round and look at this :
It 's fried chicken !
Here is a newsworthy new trend , " foodies " : Chicken , rolled in flour or batter , and fried .
Alert the media !
You are simply not a real foodie yuppie New York City news outlet right at this moment in the gustatory zeitgest if you are not writing articles about fried chicken .
Did you think that fried chicken was just chicken , fried , a food that poor people eat ?
Think again !
It is chicken , fried — a food that rich people eat , now !
New York magazine had a whole motherfucking six - part " guide to the great fried - chicken craze of 2009 " last week .
You thought the best fried chicken was at Popeye 's in a combo meal ?
Nope , it 's at Locanda Verde in the $ 41 prix fixe .
Duh .
The New York Times has a whole Dining section feature on fried chicken today .
You thought that the best fried chicken in NYC has probably always been at storefronts in Harlem and some little shack in backstreet fucking Flatbush ?
Wrong , it's in the East Village , Tribeca , and Carroll Gardens .
In case you did n't know , white , non-Southern people have now mastered fried chicken , and it 's better than ever .
Thanks , New York Times .
Oh Momofuku 's fried chicken was maybe created by an Asian guy , but it still costs $ 100 .
So it gets a pass .
Thanks to yuppie foodies and their media partners here in New York City , fried chicken is now something good to eat .
For the first time ever !
Ms Watts thinks libraries should support small businesses
A north London council has apologised after a woman was refused the loan of a pair of scissors in a library because she " might stab a member of staff " .
Lorna Watts , 26 , a self - employed dressmaker , was turned down at Holborn Library in central London .
She said : " It 's ridiculous - public libraries are supposed to be supportive of small businesses . "
A spokeswoman for Camden Council , which runs the library , has apologised and said it would investigate the incident .
Ms Watts , from Islington , north London , said : " I asked why I could n't borrow a pair of scissors and she said , ' they are sharp , you might stab me ' .
" I then asked to borrow a guillotine to cut up my leaflets but she refused again - because she said I could hit her over the head with it ! "
' Absurd ' policy
She added : " It 's absurd - there are plenty of heavy books I could have hit her with if I wanted to .
" I hardly look very threatening - it 's really sad she could not make a commonsense judgement . "
The businesswoman then visited another three libraries in north London but her request was rejected in each of them .
A spokeswoman for the Health and Safety Executive said there was no policy in place on lending sharp implements .
" People know their own workplaces and must carry out their own risk assessments " , she said .
" But we do ask workplaces to take a common sense approach .
" This could be a case of someone misinterpreting the rules . "
A Camden Council spokeswoman said : " We are sorry we have not reached our usual high standards .
We will investigate fully as soon as possible . "

Here is an interesting video by Pete Schiff that discusses in what instances homes are investments vs. speculation vs. just a place to live .
I agree with Schiff that for most people who own and live in their own home , the best way to think about homes is as shelter .
The mistake many made was thinking that home prices would rise forever , and somehow those rising home prices would support retirement .
We have since seen how fatally flawed that idea is .
Schiff labels as speculators , those buying multiple homes hoping for price appreciation .
Again I concur .
Some who got out at the right time made fortunes , other who held on too long and could not sell or make their mortgage payments went bankrupt .
Those buying homes to rent , ( assuming they know what they are doing , where lease rates will support the mortgage payment - conditions I added ) , can reasonably be called investors .
Those needing huge price appreciation to cover interim losses and those not having a clue as to what they are doing , can also be labeled as speculators .
Homes As Consumables
I strongly agree with Schiff that a home is a consumable .
It has to be maintained or its worth will head to zero .
In fact , homes can be worth less than zero as has happened recently in Detroit .
Please consider
In Detroit , a housing auction of last resort .
On the auction block in Detroit : almost 9,000 homes and lots in various states of abandonment and decay from the tidy owner - occupied to the burned - out shell claimed by squatters .
Despite a minimum bid of $ 500 , less than a fifth of the Detroit land was sold after four days .

What To Expect From Your MRI
October 18 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
Breaking off from the philosophy of punishment , I wanted to talk about the philosophy of religion .
A position that I ’ve encountered a lot recently goes something like this :
“ Considered by broadly scientific standards , as an explanatory hypothesis , belief in a personal , omnipotent , morally perfect God is irrational and unjustified .
But those are the wrong standards to apply : theism is not an explanatory hypothesis , and treating it like a scientific claim misunderstands it . ”
Now , I ’m conflicted about this position .
I think there ’s a valuable point here , but I also think it ’s presented in the opposite way that I would present it – it ’s presented as a defense of religion against rationalistic criticism , whereas I would seek to use it to guide that criticism more effectively .
Because the thing is , I would be quite happy to accept that statements about God are best understood not as positing ‘ one more entity ’ alongside the other entities in the world , but rather as making some more complex sort of philosophical point .
I think such an analysis would often bring out much of what was compelling and relevant in such claims .
For example , you might take the statement “ we should all be grateful to God for His creation ” , and say : ‘ this looks like the same sort of statement as “ Brian should be grateful to Sally for her help with revision ” , i.e. the application of our standard notion of gratitude to a particular case .
But actually , it ’s a statement about that notion of gratitude itself , telling us that it needs to be applied in a certain way , that to be consistent we should extend a foundational sense of gratitude to all objects , rather than taking some as requiring gratitude , some as worthless , and some as deserved . ’
Or something like that .
Similarly , statements that “ God is with your everywhere ” become statements about the application of our concept of solitude ; “ God moves in mysterious ways ” becomes a statement about the application of our concept of mystery .
I would be quite happy to interpret claims about God in these kinds of ways .
Except for a troublesome fact : this is not how religion usually presents them .
Religion habitually and systematically offers these as claims about the existence of a distinct entity .
In doing so , IT submits them to broadly scientific standards of evidence .
And it has to do so , to remain recognisable as religion .
( I should clarify ‘ broadly scientific ’ .
‘ Narrowly scientific ’ would mean ‘ such as would be properly studied by a particular department of science ( physics , geology , etc. ) , using the conceptual equipment of that department ’ .
In this sense , for instance , my belief that other people around me have minds and mental lives , and particular claims about what they ’re thinking and feeling , is not narrowly scientific in nature .
But it is ‘ broadly scientific ’ in that it can be traced back to evidence , and in that it emerges , when thought about carefully , from the critical evaluation of alternative beliefs in terms of their relative ability to explain the available data .
In this sense , the ‘ argument from evil ’ , that God probably does n’t exist because the world is so far from being perfect , and so filled with apparently pointless injustice and suffering , is an example of a ‘ broadly scientific ’ method of reasoning about God – ‘ how well does this theory fit with the available data ’ . )
If interpreting claims about God as being claims about , you know , a real being with certain features called ‘ God ’ , is a misunderstanding of what religion is about , then religion itself is a systematic misunderstanding of what religion is about .
But in that case what it misunderstands should n’t be called ‘ religion ’ , but something different , like ‘ spirituality ’ – with the above claims about the proper application of our emotional concepts being examples of ‘ spiritual ’ claims .
To put it another way , there is a meme that floats about that says : “ natural science , mathematical logic , religion , moral philosophy , etc. are all equally valid modes of reasoning , and should respect each other ’s proper domains . ”
I want to accept this , but just amend it to say “ natural science , mathematical logic , spirituality , moral philosophy , etc. are all equally valid modes of reasoning , and should respect each other ’s proper domains – and religion by its nature does not do this , being an attempt to misappropriate spirituality so as to ‘ invade ’ the domains of science , moral philosophy , etc . ”
I mainly wanted to lay this view out , but I ’m conscious that I should say a bit more to justify it .
For a start , I ’ve simply assumed that , considered by broadly scientific standards , the claim that God exists is unjustified and probably false .
Certainly , I have assumed that – I am quite happy to justify it if necessary , but I wo n’t here for reasons of space : in short , there is no positive evidence , and a lot of apparent negative evidence ( evil , suffering , futility , tragic choices , etc ) .
I ’ve also assumed that it ’s vital to religion to make this kind of ‘ mistake ’ and interpret claims about God as postulating the existence of a distinct entity – that if it did n’t , it would n’t be recognisable as religion .
Why is this ?
To put it briefly , it ’s only by postulating such an entity that religions can be ‘ dualistic ’ – they need to be able to contrast ‘ this world ’ with something else , something beyond it , in order to do most of the stuff they do .
Without dualism , there can be value - dualism between the worthless vanities of this life and the transcendent purity of the things beyond ; there can be no prominent role played by emotions of disgust , since as I have argued in the past , disgust is dualistic in its content ; there can be no elevation of certain groups over others as ‘ pure ’ and ‘ spiritual ’ , and no elevation of certain institutions as ‘ inspired ’ with divine knowledge .
There can be no dualism between rationalistic methods of thought in most of life ( who relies of faith to build an aeroplane ? ) and authorities ‘ beyond criticism ’ in particular areas .
There can be no dualism between the sacred and the profane , except as an explicitly subjective arrangement to suit one ’s emotions .
In short , most of what is recognisably religious has been taken away , and there is simply rationalism with a certain emotional style .

The boundaries of our country sir ?
Why sir , on the north we are bounded by the Aurora Borealis , on the east we are bounded by the rising sun , on the south we are bounded by the procession of the Equinoxes , and on the west by the Day of Judgement — The American Joe Miller 's Jest Book
One question that has always intrigued me is what happens to demonic beings when immigrants move from their homelands .
Irish - Americans remember the fairies , Norwegian - Americans the nisser , Greek - Americans the vryókolas , but only in relation to events remembered in the Old Country .
When I once asked why such demons were not seen in America , my informants giggled confusedly and said , " They 're scared to pass the ocean , it 's too far , " pointing out that Christ and the apostles never came to America .

Sufferers of the baffling ailment known as chronic fatigue syndrome , take hope :
For the first time , there 's good evidence that the symptoms are n't just in your head , and experimental treatments may be coming soon .
Over the past few decades , the syndrome has been a source of intense frustration both to patients diagnosed with it and doctors who try to treat it .
The diffuse collection of symptoms can include incapacitating fatigue , muscle aches , headaches , problems with concentration .
Doctors , meanwhile , have been mystified by the cause of the symptoms , and some have suggested that it's a psychiatric problem , leading to the coining of the dismissive label " yuppie flu . "
Now , researchers report
that 68 of 101 patients with the syndrome , or 67 percent , were infected with an infectious virus , xenotropic murine leukemia virus - related virus , or XMRV .
By contrast , only 3.7 percent of 218 healthy people were infected .
Continuing work after the paper was published has found the virus in nearly 98 percent of about 300 patients with the syndrome , said Dr. Judy A. Mikovits , the lead author of the paper [ The New York Times ] .
While it has n't been proven that the virus causes the syndrome , the link opens new avenues of research and treatment .
The study , published in Science , notes that XMRV is a retrovirus ,
like the HIV virus that causes AIDS .
As with all viruses , a retrovirus copies its genetic code into the DNA of its host but uses RNA -- a working form of DNA -- instead of using DNA to do so [ Reuters ] .
Only last month , the same retrovirus was found in men with aggressive forms of prostate cancer .
The XMRV retrovirus was discovered in the blood - borne immune cells of the patients with chronic fatigue syndrome ; Mikovits says she has a " gut feeling " that it 's the cause of the disease , but acknowledges that it 's too soon to say .
XMRV could also be a relatively harmless " passenger virus " that simply takes hold in people with suppressed immune systems , or it could be
a pathogen that acts in concert with other viruses that have been implicated in the disorder by previous research [ Reuters ] .
One of the next steps is to experiment with treatments .
Mikovits said she and her colleagues were drawing up plans to test antiretroviral drugs — some of the same ones used to treat HIV infection — to see whether they could help patients with chronic fatigue .
If the drugs work , that will help prove that the virus is causing the illness [ The New York Times ] .
Regardless of what researchers ultimately determine about the syndrome 's etiology , the findings are definitely good news for those diagnosed with the ailment , Mikovits says .
" I can't wait to be able to tell my patients , " says Mikovits ....
" It 's going to knock their socks off .
They 've had such a stigma .
People have just assumed they were just complainers who did n't handle stress well " [ Nature News ] .

A Map of Utopia
This utopia matters , because almost everyone has experienced some version of it and because it is not the result of a partisan agenda but rather a broad , unplanned effort to salvage society and take care of the neighbors amid the wreckage .
" A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at , for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always heading , " wrote Oscar Wilde fifteen years before San Francisco 's great quake .
The utopias built by citizens like Anna Holshouser are not yet on that map .
But they should be .
They could change the map of our own beliefs , our sense of what is possible and who we are .
Utopia is in trouble these days .
Many no longer believe that a better world , as opposed to a better life , is possible , and the rhetoric of private well - being trumps public good , at least in the English - speaking world .
And yet the yearning remains — all the riches piled up , the security gates and stock options , are only defenses against a world of insecurity and animosity , piecemeal solutions to a pervasive problem .
Sometimes it seems as though home improvement has trumped the idealistic notion of a better world .
Sometimes .
But utopia flares up in other parts of the world , where hope is fiercer and dreams are larger .
" There is no alternative , " the conservative British prime minister Margaret Thatcher liked to say , but there is , and it appears where it is least expected , as well as where it is most diligently cultivated .
Changing the world is the other way to imagine salvaging the self — and others , for the utopian impulse is generous even when it 's wrongheaded .
And utopias of sorts arise in the present , in Argentina , in Mexico , in countless social , economic , and agricultural experiments in Europe , in India , and in the United States ; among other places .
The map of utopias is cluttered nowadays with experiments by other names , and the very idea is expanding .
It needs to open up a little more to contain disaster communities .
These remarkable societies suggest that , just as many machines reset themselves to their original settings after a power outage , so human beings reset themselves to something altruistic , communitarian , resourceful , and imaginative after a disaster , that we revert to something we already know how to do .
The possibility of paradise is already within us as a default setting .
The two most basic goals of social utopias are to eliminate deprivation — hunger , ignorance , homelessness — and to forge a society in which no one is an outsider , no one is alienated .
By this standard , Holshouser 's free food and warm social atmosphere achieved both , on however tiny a scale , and versions of the Mizpah Café sprung up all over the ruined city .
Some religious attempts at utopia are authoritarian , led by a charismatic leader , by elders , by rigid rules that create outcasts , but the secular utopias have mostly been committed to liberty , democracy , and shared power .
The widespread disdain for revolution and utopia takes as its object lesson the Soviet - style attempts at coercive utopias , in which the original ideals of leveling and sharing go deeply awry , the achievement critiqued in George Orwell 's Animal Farm and 1984 and other dystopian novels .
Many fail to notice that it is not the ideals , the ends , but the coercive and authoritarian means that poison paradise .
There are utopias whose ideals pointedly include freedom from coercion and dispersal of power to the many .
Most utopian visions nowadays include many worlds , many versions , rather than a coercive one true way .
The anthropologist David Graeber writes , " Stalinists and their ilk did not kill because they dreamed great dreams — actually , Stalinists were famous for being rather short on imagination — but because they mistook their dreams for scientific certainties .
This led them to feel they had a right to impose their visions through a machinery of violence . "
There are plenty of failed revolutions and revolutions such as the French Revolution that lapse into bloodbaths — and yet when that revolution was over , France would never be dominated by an absolutist monarchy again ; ordinary French people had more rights , and people around the world had an enlarged sense of the possible .
All revolutions fail because they set their sights heaven - high , but none of them fail to do something , and many increase the amount of liberty , justice , and hope for their heirs .
Unpoliced utopian experiments have arisen often in the United States .
The ascetic rural Shakers have lasted from 1775 , when they arrived in New York from England , into — by the tenuous thread of a few older survivors — the present .
Less stable experiments proliferated in the nineteenth century .
There was , for example , Brook Farm in Massachusetts in the 1840s , in which a lot of bookish idealists tried , not very effectively , to till the earth to realize an ideal union of mental and physical labor and collective life .
There was also the socialist Kaweah Colony in the mountains of California in the 1880s and 1890s ( the land they homesteaded is now part of Sequoia National Park , and the giant tree they named the Karl Marx Tree is now the General Sherman sequoia ) .
Many argue that the United States was founded on utopian dreams , from the conquistador fantasies of a gold - drenched El Dorado to the pioneer reading of the American West as an unfallen Eden the woodsman entered as an ax - swinging Adam .
Some even include the seventeenth - century New England Puritans among the Utopians , though their regime of sober piety , stern patriarchs , and enforced conformity resembles a lot of other peoples ' gulags .
And the Puritans were not social experimentalists ; the pervasive utopian preoccupation with sharing wealth and finding a communal mode of dealing with practical needs and social goals had little to do with them , though it surfaced in other conservative religious movements , such as Mormonism .
I often argue with my friend Sam about what has become of the dream of Utopia .
He believes it has faded with the end of communist and universalist fantasies ; I believe it has evolved into more viable , modest versions .
A certain kind of twentieth - century utopian idealism has died , the kind that believed we could and should erase everything and start over : new language , new society , new ways of organizing power , work , even family , home , and more .
Projects for abandoning the past wholesale and inventing a whole new human being seem , like the idea of one - size - fits - all universalism , more ominous than utopian to us now .
It may be because we now includes people who forcibly lost their language , whether it was Yiddish in Poland or Cree in Canada , that as we lose the past , we cherish it more and look at the devouring mouth of the future with more apprehension .
But we have also learned that you can reinvent the government but not human nature in one fell stroke , and the process of reinventing human nature is a much more subtle , personal , incremental process .
Mostly nowadays we draw our hopes from fragments and traditions from a richly varied past rather than an imagined future .
But disaster throws us into the temporary utopia of a transformed human nature and society , one that is bolder , freer , less attached and divided than in ordinary times , not blank , but not tied down .
Utopianism was a driving force in the nineteenth century .
Union activists sought to improve working conditions and wages for the vast majority of laborers , and many were radicals who also hoped for or worked for a socialist or anarchist revolution that would change the whole society and eliminate the causes of suffering , poverty , and powerlessness rather than merely mitigate some of the effects ( how viable and desirable their versions of the ideal were is another story ) .
The socialist - anarchist Kaweah commune included many union members , while the French commune Icaria - Speranza , eighty miles north of San Francisco , included refugees from the 1848 revolution in France and the Paris Commune , the populist takeover of that city for two months in 1871 .
Gold Touches a New Record
“ Gold continues to climb … stoked by inflation worries , ” says a headline in the International Herald Tribune .
Yesterday , it touched a new record – $ 1,050 – even as the dollar rose , oil slumped under $ 70 and stocks dipped very slightly .
Well , what do you expect ?
The United States added $ 1 trillion to its monetary base in the last year or so .
The federal government is running a deficit of $ 1.7 trillion this year .
And along comes Barack Obama with an idea to stimulate employment – spend more money !
This time , Obama ’s plan is a kind of ‘ Cash for Workers ’ program … in which businesses get a tax credit for hiring new employees .
Gold investors must think the new program will be the straw they ’ve been waiting for .
Government has piled on bales of costly new initiatives on this poor camel ’s back .
Still , he stands up straight .
So , is gold at $ 1,000 a bargain …or a trap ?
Or both .
We begin by asking : where ’s the inflation ?
We do n’t see any inflation .
What we do see is deflation .
Barclays Capital says gold could go to $ 1,500 .
We do n’t know where they got that number .
It could go to $ 15,000 for all we know .
Or it could go down , too .
Our guess is that it will go down enough scare the bejesus out of speculators .
Then , it will soar .
But , hey , we ’re just guessing – along with everyone else .
Sooner or later gold is probably headed to the lunatic moon .
We ’re sticking with the yellow metal .
We do n’t want to miss that ride .
But when ?
Ah…we ’re going to stick our necks out and say “ eventually . ”
We ’re sure we ’re right about this .
Just do n’t ask us for more precision ; we have none .
And what bothers us is that between eventually and now there could be a lot of time and a lot of trouble .
And one trouble that could come up pretty fast is another crash in the stock market .
If the stock markets of the world take another dive … like they did last year … gold will probably go down with them .
Not as much , but down nonetheless .
So , if we were speculating … we ’d probably be short gold and short stocks too .
We ’d bet against bonds too – even though we think they will probably go up in the short run .
The smart , long term money – in both stocks and bonds – is probably on the short side .
Here at The Daily Reckoning , however , we never speculate – except in print .
As to ideas about how the world works we have plenty .
We speculate daily .
As to gold , stocks and commodities , we prefer to hold onto our long - term positions .
What seems fairly sure to us is that this recovery is a fraud .
It ’s a mountebank and a flimflam .
And now approaches a moment of truth – earnings announcements .
Stock market investors bid up shares on the theory that sales and profits would rise .
Will they ?
We do n’t think so .
We think sales are going to be disappointing … and earnings will be even worse .
If so , we ’ll see analysts begin to change their expectations … and announce that the results are “ not as bad as expected . ”
If we get a few really bad announcements – with results much worse than expected – it could sink the rally .
Then again , if we ’re surprised with exceptionally good reports … it could send the market in the other direction .
Good results will also cause us here at The Daily Reckoning to question our position .
Maybe the economy is not sinking into a chronic depression , after all .
Could we be wrong ?
Ha ha…are you kidding , dear reader ?
Of course , we can be wrong .
When we were younger we were uncertain about things .
But now that we ’re older , we ’re not so sure .
Here is what we ’re pretty sure about :
1 ) The credit cycle has topped out .
Americans are saving – think of the poor boomers , 10 years older but not a penny richer than they were in 1999 .
Stocks have gone nowhere but down in real terms .
Houses hit a high in 2006 … now , they ’re off 30 % … and still going down .
Jobs ?
Forget it … there are already 15 million people who are unemployed and about 200,000 more every month .
The job market is unlikely to recover for another 6 - 13 years – that is , after many of the boomers are retired !
And if you are lucky enough to have a job , you ’re not likely to get a raise … not with so much spare capacity in the labor market .
Under those conditions , a consumer boom is very unlikely .
2 ) We know that a period of credit contraction is deflationary .
Prices go down as demand falls .
Buyers disappear from the malls that once knew them , while the factories that produce stuff grow dusty and quiet .
But we know the feds hate falling prices .
And we know they are taking extraordinary actions to get prices to go up .
So far , their efforts have been a giant flop .
Prices are falling in the United States at the fastest pace since the ’50s .
Most of the feds ’ efforts have been directed towards keeping the bankers fat and happy … and getting themselves a bigger share of America ’s output .
They took funds designed to relaunch the US economy , for example , and used them to buy themselves a big position in the auto industry , the financial industry and the insurance industry .
3 ) We know too , by the way they conducted themselves in those affairs , that the feds have become much more aggressive … throwing their weight around in the private sector as never before .
What we do n’t know is how this affects markets in the short term .
So far , consumer prices are falling , but the stock market is enjoying a bounce .
It is a real , new bull market ?
Or just a bear market bounce ?
It is probably a bear market bounce … but it has been going for long enough that we have to at least consider the idea that it is a genuine bull market .
That ’s why the numbers from this quarter are important … they ’ll tell us if the companies themselves are expanding earnings fast enough to justify investors ’ optimism .
4 ) We know too that there is a whole lot of ’ flation going on .
We are just unable to tell you what kind of ’ flation it is .
The monetary base is way up – it increased by $ 1 trillion in the last 12 months .
But the money - in - circulation has barely budged .
The feds give the banks overnight loans at practically zero interest .
Then , the banks lend it back to the feds at nearly 4 % more .
What happens to it then ?
Well , what do you think … it is wasted on typical federal government scams and humbugs .
So , relatively little of the money actually ends up in the consumer economy .
And so , we ca n’t tell you whether the ’flation will have a ‘ in ’ prefix or a ‘ de ’ prefix .
They ’re just two letters .
But they will make a whole alphabet of difference to the economy and to your investments .
5 ) Most important , we are dead sure that the people running America ’s financial policies are jackasses .
We say that with all due respect , which is probably not much .
They have only one idea – and it is a bad one .
They think economies are improved by more consumer spending .
They do n’t seem to care why consumers occasionally cut back on their spending .
All that matters to them is finding ways to get the consumer shopping again .
So they try tax cuts and government spending … bailouts and boondoggles … zero interest lending and federal takeovers … cash for clunkers , cash for houses , cash for employees … .
… trillions worth of claptrap and folderol .
But what a nuisance !
The fool consumer still wo n’t shop !
But they ’re determined to keep trying .
That ’s why we can be pretty sure that , eventually , they ’ll get inflation rates up .
One way or another .
And then , gold at $ 1000 will seem like an outrageous bargain .
Until tomorrow ,

StandWithUs — an " organization that ensures that Israel ’s side of the story is told " — has become increasingly aggressive in challenging the " pro-Israel " credentials of moderate Jewish - American groups , going so far as to suggest that receiving money from Arab donors and supporters of Human Rights Watch undermines a group ’s commitment to Israel and peace .
J Street — the " Pro -Israel and Pro-Peace " advocacy group — faced criticism last week for accepting contributions from donors who have been critical of Israeli government actions .
But an IPS investigation into the tax records of the donors to StandWithUs , which professes to be ideologically neutral , found a web of funders who support organizations that have been accused of anti-Muslim propaganda and encouraging a militant Israeli and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East .
Some of these organizations have tied the origins of Palestinian nationalism to Nazi ideology , and suggested that a vast Muslim conspiracy — in a similar vein to the anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion — is mobilizing to undermine the U.S. constitution and impose Sharia law .
StandWithUs , known in its tax filings as the " Israel Emergency Alliance , " unleashed a flurry of faxes to 160 lawmakers on Oct. 16 expressing concern over their plans to attend the J Street conference , " Driving Change , Securing Peace , " in Washington from Oct. 25 - 28 .
The faxes warned lawmakers that while " J Street claims to be ‘ pro - Israel ’ and ‘ pro- peace ’ and to represent mainstream Jewish opinion , we are troubled because their positions seem to undermine Israel and its search for peace with security .
Their views may also contribute to anti-Israel biases and misinformation . "
Five members of Congress dropped out of the conference .
J Street characterized the campaign as the work of " neoconservatives and their Swift Boat tactics " led by the neoconservative Weekly Standard magazine .
MJ Rosenberg , a senior fellow at Media Matters for America , a research center that monitors " conservative misinformation " in the media , told IPS , " These are essentially opponents of the peace process who believe the only way to support Israel is to oppose a diplomatic solution the conflict . "
The biggest donors to StandWithUs since 2005 , according to a search of publicly available tax returns , were foundations controlled by Susan Wexner , who has contributed over 850,000 dollars to the group .
Wexner ’s family founded The Limited , which currently operates such well - known brands as Victoria ’s Secret , Bath & Body Works , Henri Bendel , C. O. Bigelow , The White Barn Candle Company , and La Senza .
Wexner also made contributions to the Middle East Media Research Institute ( MEMRI ) , the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ( CAMERA ) , and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies ( FDD ) .
MEMRI describes itself as " bridging the language gap which exists between the West and the Middle East , providing timely translations of Arabic , Persian , Turkish , Urdu - Pashtu media , as well as original analysis of political , ideological , intellectual , social , cultural , and religious trends in the Middle East . "
Critics say the group is a propaganda outlet , and accuse it of mistranslation and overstating the prevalence of anti-Semitism in Middle East media .
" My problem with MEMRI is that it poses as a research institute when it ’s basically a propaganda operation , " wrote the Middle East editor for The Guardian , Brian Whittaker , in an email debate with MEMRI President Yigal Carmon .
" As with all propaganda , that involves a certain amount of dishonesty and deception .
The items you translate are chosen largely to suit your political agenda .
They are unrepresentative and give an unfair picture of the Arab media as a whole . "
The executive director of StandWithUs , Roz Rothstein , responded to IPS , " MEMRI is used by every news publication on the planet .
People do n’t look at MEMRI as right - wing .
It ’s just verbatim Arabic translation .
They ’ve never been cited for inaccurate translation . "
In 2007 , CNN correspondent Atika Shubert and Arabic translators accused MEMRI of mistranslating portions of a Palestinian children ’s television program .
" Media watchdog MEMRI translates one caller as saying — quote —
‘ We will annihilate the Jews , " ’ said Shubert .
" But , according to several Arabic speakers used by CNN , the caller actually says ‘ The Jews are killing us . " ’
CAMERA , another media watchdog group , has caught criticism for denying reliable reports of settlement expansions , leading the executive director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies , Donald Wagner , to describe CAMERA as " a well - known source of extremist pro-Israel propaganda that is routinely challenged by Israeli and international human rights and peace organizations for its consistent misrepresentation of the facts in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict . "
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies is a policy institute " founded shortly after 9/11 by a group of visionary philanthropists and policymakers to support the defense of democratic societies under assault by terrorism and militant Islamism , " according to its website .
However , the group has frequently been cited for pushing a hawkish U.S. foreign policy in Iraq and Iran , and the Christian Science Monitor called it one of the " top neocon think tanks . "
Larry and Andrew Hochberg contributed over 400,000 dollars to StandWithUs since 2005 and also contributed to FDD and Honest Reporting , another watchdog group that monitors the media and " exposes cases of bias " against Israel .
Much like MEMRI , Honest Reporting has come under attack for taking words and phrases out of context and for producing the documentary " Obsession : Radical Islam ’s War Against the West . "
Twenty - eight million copies of the film were distributed by direct mail and newspaper inserts before the U.S. presidential election last November .
Regarding the film , Jeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic wrote that it " takes a serious issue , and a serious threat — that of Islamism — and makes it into a cartoon .
Its central argument is that the ‘ Islamofascism ’ of today is not only the equivalent of Nazism , but worse than Nazism .
This is quite a thing for a Jewish organization to argue . "
According to Rothstein , " Obsession is the story of radical Islam . "
" Radical Islam has impacted the Middle East greatly , " she said .
" All this stuff comes from a very fundamentalist religious position and looking at it does not make you right - or left - wing . "
Sandra and Lawrence Post contributed just under 70,000 dollars to StandWithUs since 2005 and contributed to MEMRI and Christians United For Israel ( CUFI ) , a U.S. " pro-Israel " Christian organization founded and chaired by controversial pastor John Hagee .
Neoconservatives and other members of the far - right came into direct conflict with J Street in May 2008 when J Street issued a statement calling on Republican presidential candidate John McCain to " renounce John Hagee once and for all . "
Many Jews took offense with Hagee ’s characterization of Hitler as doing God ’s work by helping to bring Jews to Israel to fulfil Biblical prophesy , and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) found itself in the difficult position of fighting to keep its pro-Israel credentials while not severing its valuable ties to the Christian - Zionist movement and the Christian Right .
Asked if the philanthropy of their donors reflected a right - wing political leaning by StandWithUs , Rothstein rejected the idea .
" I do n’t think it ’s fair since our tent is pretty broad , " she said .
" Some people call us ‘ left of center , others call us ‘ right of center ’ and some call us ‘ center . ’ "
" We see it as our job to help people understand that the founding document of Hamas calls for the elimination of Israel , " Rothstein added .
" If J Street is interested in negotiating with Hamas — who are absolute fundamentalists and violent — it ’s like a phony dream to want to sit down with someone who is intending to kill you . "
Defenders of J Street see StandWithUs and their supporters very differently .
" They ’re attacking J Street because J Street supports [ U.S. President Barack ]
Obama ’s goal of re-starting negotiations , " said Rosenberg .
" In the old days , if any president put pressure on Israel , the Jewish community would rise up against him .
But the community strongly supports this president and these guys are pushing back on Netanyahu ’s behalf . "
( Inter Press Service )
Most of the key online players came out for net neutrality on Monday .
They wrote a letter to the Federal Communications Commission cheering the agency 's impending Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on " policies to preserve the open Internet , " scheduled to be unveiled on Thursday .
Commission Chair Julius Genachowski says he wants to add two more provisions to the FCC's Internet Policy Statement : one that would require ISPs to disclose their network management practices , plus an enforcement mechanism for rule breakers .
Amen , declare the letter writers .
" We believe a process that results in common sense baseline rules is critical to ensuring that the Internet remains a key engine of economic growth , innovation , and global competitiveness , " they say .
" We applaud your leadership in initiating a process to develop rules to ensure that the qualities that have made the Internet so successful are protected . "
Signed : Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com ; Craig Newmark , founder of Craigslist ; Digg founder Kevin Rose ; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook ; Flickr founder Caterina Fake ; and the CEOs or COOs of Skype , Google , eBay , Mozilla , Vuze , Twitter , LinkedIn , Tivo , and Sony ; plus a half dozen more Internet biggies .
With this statement , the dominant developers of the Web as we know it have very publicly declared their interest in the establishment of a stronger net neutrality mechanism at the FCC .
" An open Internet fuels a competitive and efficient marketplace , where consumers make the ultimate choices about which products succeed and which fail , " their statement concludes .
" This allows businesses of all sizes , from the smallest startup to larger corporations , to compete , yielding maximum economic growth and opportunity . "
Great concern
But as the agency 's Open Commission meeting scheduled for Thursday approaches , tremendous pressure is coming from a very different direction , and it argues that the main issue is not innovation so much as investment and jobs .
So say the state Attorney Generals from Washington , Arkansas , Oklahoma , and South Carolina .
The last states ' AG is " very concerned , " he wrote to the FCC , " about any new net neutrality regulations that could adversely impact the communications industry ’s willingness to continue to invest and , thereby , hinder the future growth of the wireless or wireline Internet industry . "
Ditto , warn a veritable army of governors , state representatives , mayors , and local Chambers of Commerce presidents who have suddenly discovered an interest in this issue .
" While much progress has been made , the FCC 's new focus on wireless network neutrality causes me great concern , because of the negative consequences for investment , innovation and jobs in Connecticut , " wrote Tom Buzi , First Selectman of Monroe , Connecticut late last week .
" More regulation means less investment — and fewer jobs . "
Some of this feedback is doubtless being encouraged by the telcos , and we 'll have more on that later .
But interestingly , the organization that has the most direct stake in Internet job creation is sending mixed signals to the FCC on the matter .
On October 15 Larry Cohen , President of the Communications Workers of America sent the FCC a letter warning that any new rules must avoid " an adverse impact on investment and job creation . "
But the filing also acknowledged that some carefully crafted enforcement and transparency regulations might be a good idea .
CWA supported the FCC 's sanctions against Comcast for BitTorrent throttling in 2008 .
The FCC should frame " a proposed fifth principle protecting consumers from unreasonable discrimination , " Cohen emphasized , " that includes appropriately robust carve - outs for managed networks and reasonable network management , while promoting a dynamic , open , and public Internet . "
But while the message from CWA 's top staff acknowledges the complexity of the problem , statements coming the union 's various locals are unabashedly hostile to net neutrality — check out the following , for example , from CWA Local 6201 President Denny Kramer of Dallas , Texas .
" When you talk about the proposed net neutrality regulations that you and your colleagues will consider on October 22 , do you know that you put 738 of these CWA jobs and countless others in Texas at risk due to these onerous , unnecessary regulations ? "
Kramer 's letter asks .
" If our nation is to recover fully from the depths of this terrible recession , it will be because of the sweat and efforts of my brothers and sisters . "
He urged the FCC to " proceed with caution before implementing regulations that may take our country down a path that would reduce investments and limit jobs in an industry sector so crucial to our larger well being . "
A Russian historian investigating the fate of Germans imprisoned in the Soviet Union during the second world war has been arrested , in the latest apparent clampdown on historical research into the Stalin era by the Russian authorities .
Mikhail Suprun was detained last month by officers from Russia 's security services .
They searched his apartment and carried off his entire personal archive .
He has now been charged with violating privacy laws and , if convicted , faces up to four years in jail .
Suprun had been researching Germans sent to Russia 's Arctic gulags .
A professor of history at Arkhangelsk 's Pomorskiy university , his study included German prisoners of war captured by the Red Army as well as Russian - speaking ethnic Germans , many from southern Russia , deported by Stalin .
Both groups ended up in Arkhangelsk camps .
" I had been planning to write two books .
I need another two or three years before I can finish them , " Suprun told the Guardian today .
The historian – who described his arrest as " absurd " – said he had signed an agreement with local officials not to talk further about his case .
But the arrest has provoked outrage in Germany and among leading historians .
It comes amid Kremlin attempts to rehabilitate Stalin and to clamp down on independent historical research – with political repression during the Soviet era and victims of the gulag system now taboo topics .
Today the historian and writer Orlando Figes described Suprun 's arrest as unprecedented , and part of a " Putinite campaign against freedom of historical research and expression " .
Figes , professor of history at Birkbeck college , London University , added : " [ It 's ] potentially quite alarming , if it means that the regime intends to clamp down on the collection of personal data about the Stalin terror . "
Suprun 's project was done in collaboration with Germany 's Red Cross .
The organisation is still trying to establish the fate of thousands of Germans transported to Soviet Russia as prisoners during the war – many of whom never came back .
The German Red Cross today said it was baffled by the historian 's arrest .
It was " completely unacceptable " , Erica Steinbach , a rightwing German MP , added .
Russia 's FSB intelligence agency also arrested a police official who handed Suprun material from the local interior ministry archive .
It includes a list of 40,000 German gulag victims between 1945 and 1956 , deported to the Arkhangelsk region .
It details which camps they were sent to and whether they survived .
The official , Col Alexander Dudaryev , is accused of abusing his position .
" What we are seeing is the rebirth of control over history , " said Rauf Gabidullin , of Arkhangelsk 's movement for human rights .
" The majority of Russians do n't have any idea of the scale of Stalin 's repression .
Those in power are from the KGB .
They do n't want people to know what their KGB predecessors were doing , or its huge scope . "
Asked what life was like in Arkhangelsk 's freezing gulags , overlooking the White Sea , he said : " Terrible .
The winter was extremely long .
The conditions in the barracks were appalling .
The German prisoners who were lucky enough to survive chopped wood .
In other parts of the Soviet Union they constructed buildings , including Moscow state university . "
The Arkhangelsk camps also contained Poles , Greeks , Tartars and other non-Russian ethnic groups .
By the end of the war 11 million Germans were in allied prison camps .
More than a million perished .
Soviet prisoners of war fared even worse .
Of the 5.7 million taken prisoner in Germany 3.3 million died – more than half .
The second world war remains a source of major tension between Russia and its post -Soviet neighbours .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , has repeatedly accused Ukraine , Poland and other eastern European countries of distorting history for political purposes and in May set up a new state commission to prevent what he called the " falsification of history " .
Over the summer Moscow reacted furiously when the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe 's parliamentary assembly , led by the Baltic states , passed a motion equating Nazism with Stalinism .
The Kremlin has also defended the Molotov - Ribbentrop pact – under which Stalin and Hitler carved up eastern Europe – describing it as a tactical agreement no different from other western accommodations with the Nazis .
Today Allison Gill , the director of Human Rights Watch in Moscow , described the Suprun case as " very troubling " .
" It 's part of an attempt to provide a single narrative about what Russia was , and what it means today .
It denies the full complexity of Russia 's history and the fact that individuals had vastly different experiences .
I do n't like it at all , " she said .
Suprun 's research is similar to several other projects carried out over the past two decades by the Russian human rights organisation Memorial .
Memorial has collected the names of tens of thousands of gulag victims , publishing their details in public " memory books " .
Last year police raided Memorial 's office in St Petersburg office , seizing material used by Figes in his book on family life in Stalin 's Russia , The Whisperers .
They later returned it .
Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones are said to have a ' pre-nup '
Family lawyers say they have seen a tenfold increase in recent years in couples signing pre-nuptial agreements on dividing their assets after divorce .
Resolution , a group of 5,700 lawyers , says the number has doubled in a year , a BBC Breakfast investigation found .
The agreements are enforceable in Scotland but not in England and Wales , although courts are paying more attention to them in their rulings .
The Law Commission is to consult on their use in England and Wales .
The Tories say they should become binding - but critics say people may feel pressured into signing them .
Such agreements set out what happens to the assets each party brings into the marriage - and their earnings during it - should they divorce .
A succession of high - profile break - ups , ending in huge settlements , have raised awareness of their role .

Lawyers say the increasing number of independently wealthy women , coupled with greater numbers of people marrying later in life with complicated family arrangements , has increased their popularity .
Resolution 's David Allison said : " There 's been a tenfold increase in ' pre-nups ' .
I 'm doing considerably more now than I have ever done before and that experience is mirrored around the rest of the country .
" People are doing it because they want to be able to sort this stuff out now rather than later on . "
Around 45 % of marriages end in divorce - about 145,000 each year - and while pre-nuptial agreements are still relatively rare , more are coming before the courts .
They are already common in the US and are also binding in many European countries .
Safeguards
The Law Commission is not due to report on the issue until 2012 but the Conservatives want it done more quickly .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Gold diggers do n't turn up with a mule and a pickaxe .
Refusal to consider a pre-nup is a pretty good indication that you are being targeted by one .
Mark K , London , UK Shadow justice minister Henry Bellingham said : " We want to bring in a fairly wide ranging divorce law reform bill and I 'm very keen that part of it will include ' pre- nups ' and make them enforceable in law , subject to very strict safeguards . "
Some family lawyers say people may feel pressurised into signing them and that making them binding would be a disaster .
Family lawyer Marilyn Stowe said : " The whole emphasis is on divorce reform - and I actually think we should be looking much more at marriage .
I have to say if I was asked to enter into a ' pre - nup ' I would n't . "
At the Court of Appeal in July , heiress Katrin Radmacher overturned an earlier decision to award her ex-husband £ 5.8 m of her £ 100 m fortune despite their pre-nuptial agreement .
Experts said the case could help pave the way for such contracts to become legally binding in England and Wales .

Today , I found out that the mysterious yellow mould that wo n't come off my apartment floor is in fact the remains of a condom my room - mate used when she was f*cking her boyfriend in my bed .
Afterwards , she apparently threw it on the floor and let it lie there .
For three weeks .

According to Walter Hill , problems began when he did a rewrite of the script , not knowing that the president of United Artists ( Lindsay Doran ) was very attached to the script .
He also said that the budget of the film was cut halfway through production .

Rio de Janeiro police on Wednesday announced seven more deaths and 17 arrests as drug - fueled violence continued to sweep over parts of the city that this month was named to host the 2016 Olympics .
The death toll has risen to 33 since Saturday , when rival gangs launched a turf war for control of drug trafficking in several favelas , or shantytowns , interspersed among Rio ’s luxury hotels and residential areas .
Gangs are suspected of using high - caliber weapons to shoot down a helicopter on Saturday near the Morro dos Macacos slum , which remains the scene of fighting between rival gangs and police trying to subdue them .
Three of six police officers on board were killed in the crash .
Most of the dead this week were suspected gang members , but the victims also included several bystanders .
On Wednesday , 18 - year - old student Jose Carlos Guimaraes was seriously wounded in the abdomen by a stray bullet during a confrontation between police and criminals at the Vila Cruzeiro favela .

Hundreds of Rio de Janeiro state police have been deployed in a bid to control the violence .
Gov. Sergio Cabral has requested additional forces from the federal government .
The pressure is on local authorities to quell the violence as Rio begins its $ 14 - billion preparations to host the Olympics in 2016 , the first time the Games will be held in South America .
Mayor Eduardo
Paes is on a foreign trip to generate investment in the effort .
In awarding the Games to Rio instead of Chicago , Tokyo or Madrid , the International Olympic Committee made a leap of faith that Rio authorities would bring the city ’s sometimes horrendous crime under control .
Many of the 2014 World Cup soccer matches will also be held in Rio .

The turf war started Saturday when the Red Commandos gang mounted a predawn invasion of Morro dos Macacos , controlled by the Friends of Friends gang .
Police recently increased their presence in five favelas , forcing gangs to fight over other areas .
On Wednesday , police said that among the 17 arrested was Rodrigo Mello , a leader of the Red Commandos .
Mello is said to have ordered the invasion of Morro dos Macacos , the biggest favela not under his gang ’s control .
Ten buses have been burned since Saturday , a form of gang retaliation , and some bus lines have suspended service to the favelas .

Several Brazilian newspapers on Wednesday published a photo of the corpse of a suspected gang member found in a shopping cart .
In an interview with Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper , Ricardo Teixeira , head of the Brazilian Soccer Confederation and co-organizer of the 2014 World Cup , tried to minimize the negative impact of the violence .
“ There was a natural reaction , the same way as when we turn the TV on and see the attacks of crazy kids in the United States killing everyone and shooting everyone , ” he said , referring to cases of school violence .
But Antonio Biscaia , who ran for Rio state governor in 2006 against Cabral , said the city lives in a kind of civil war , alleging that slayings are rising in Rio while declining in the rest of Brazil .

“ Some administrations do n’t want to face the problem because their popularity can get soiled in these areas , with voters from poor communities , ” Biscaia said in a magazine interview .

DETROIT �( CNNMoney.com ) --
Three years ago , with a freshly - minted law degree , Connecticut native Tom Northrop started job hunting in Detroit .
While this seems like a normal step after law school , his prospective employers just did n't get it .
Not many young , single , educated people were moving to Detroit .
They were so surprised they wanted him to put his reasoning down on paper :
He was marrying a girl from the area .
Perhaps it was only to ease their sense of disbelief .
" They did n't understand people coming here who are n't from here , " said his wife Lauren , also a lawyer , over dinner one night at the couple 's home in the upscale suburb of Bloomfield .
Basically , no one moves to Detroit unless they have family ties in the area , she said .
And more often that not , young people just move away .
Along with the exodus of auto jobs over the last few decades , Detroit has also experienced another , maybe even more alarming trend - Its young , smart people leaving for opportunities elsewhere .
Broad numbers are difficult to come by , but nearly a quarter of respondents in a survey for Fusion , the area 's young professional association , said they plan on leaving Detroit within the next two years .
Among the larger population of 4.6 million people , 63,000 households left the greater Detroit area in 2007 alone , according to Internal Revenue Service numbers supplied by the Urban Studies Department at Wayne State University .
City leaders are well aware of this problem , and are working hard to fix it .
As it turns out , young people generally want the same things other people want out of a city - good jobs , safe streets , stuff to do at night , decent schools , quality healthcare , ample parks , easy public transport .
Basically , they want a pleasant life .
" We can't just create new entrepreneurs and then let them leave , " said Mariam Noland , president of the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan .
" We need to do all the things that are going to attract new talent and make this a desirable place to live in , or to come to .
We have to make it so people want to stay . "
To that end , Noland raised $ 100 million in grant money from various foundations , money that is now being used to build the business and cultural institutions that can bring this city back .
That 's a tough prospect in an area hard hit by the dual blow of recession and auto industry bankruptcy .
But Nolan , along with a host of other city leaders , see the broad outlines of a plan .
Jobs -
In a metro area with unemployment running about 50 % higher than the national average , putting people to work is a priority .
Many business leaders do n't think the city can attract big , new auto manufacturing plants like it once did .
The industry has too much capacity even now , and the competition is too tough from other states in the South .
Instead , they 're pushing for Detroit to embrace the new economy .
The tools are similar to ones towns use the world over - minimal bureaucracy and generous tax breaks .
But Detroit hopes to leverage its natural lead in engineering left over from its days of auto dominance into new industries like automotive electronics , software , and alternative energy .
They 've had some success .
Techtown , a business incubator started in 2000 , boasts 98 businesses in everything from televisions to biotechnology .
Wayne County is promoting its " aerotropolis " idea - encouraging business to set up shop by the airport - taking the lead from cities like Dubai and Frankfurt that have used their airports as engines for economic growth .
Attracted by easy air transport and lots of land , General Electric recently announced plans to build a wind power R&D facility near the airport that could bring in 1200 jobs .
General Motors and the battery maker A123 Systems have announced plants for advanced vehicles that together could employ 4,000 or 5,000 people - the size of a large auto plant .
The local Chamber of Commerce is in talks with foreign automakers and parts companies to set up shop in Detroit .
It 's also pushing a plan to make the region a global trade hub , modernizing the extensive road , rail and water links that already exist .
Downtown Detroit , which does n't look nearly as dreary as the ring surrounding it , has attracted some new tenants as well .
The technology firm EDS relocated downtown about 5 years ago , bringing with it some 1,500 jobs .
Quicken Loans is supposed to move downtown shortly , adding another 3,000 to 4,000 employees .
' It 's challenging , and it 's frustrating , " Brian Holdwick , a 43 - year old official at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and life - long Detroiter , said about trying to attract new industries to this city that has seen so much decline .
" But to see something like the ( historic ) Book Cadillac Hotel come back to life , after being shuttered for 23 years , it was very important to me .
It 's very rewarding . "
Safety - Detroit has one of the highest murder rates in the nation .
There have been more killings so far this year in Detroit than in New York City , and New York has nearly 10 times as many people .
" People get jumped , cars get stolen , everyone 's got a story , " said Sean Blackman , a 39 - year old music composer who 's lived in the Detroit area his whole life .
" If you move downtown , it 's just part of the scene . "
Like almost all Detroiters we 've spoken to , Blackman loves the city and is proud to live there .
But it has got to get safer if people are going to stick around , he said .
The police department has embarked on an aggressive strategy to curb the situation , including inter-agency operations that flood troubled neighborhoods with more cops .
A recent campaign put 360 additional police in a six square mile area , with a particular focus on violent crime .
Officers would pay unexpected home visits to violent offenders on parole , often finding guns or other weapons in their possession .
They also increased the number of traffic stops in the hope of ensnaring people involved in bigger crimes .
But in a city with a declining population and troubled businesses , finding money is hard .
The police force has just 3,000 officers now , down from 4,000 ten years ago .
Culture - From Motown to movie stars , Detroit packs a deep roster when it comes to arts and entertainment .
Madonna is from Detroit .
As is Francis Ford Coppola , Robin Williams , and the late George C. Scott .
Cheap rents and an edgy vibe have made Detroit somewhat of a Mecca for young musicians in the garage rock and techno scenes , and a lot of people appreciate the city 's gritty feel .
" The disgusting kinda looks beautiful after a while , " Craig Brown , a 25 - year old guitarist in the local band the Sugarcoats , said over beers one night at a barbecue joint in the city 's up - and - coming Corktown district .
City leaders are also trying to promote more upscale venues .
They 're touting a " cultural corridor , " a strip along one of the main drags in town that includes Wayne State University , the business incubator , two health centers , the symphony , the history museum , and loft - style apartment housing .
" We 're trying to create a density that 's attractive to young talent , " said Noland , the Community Foundation president .
Connecting it all together - Detroit 's redevelopment has taken place in pockets .
The city is a patchwork of places .
Some seem lively , full of businesses and homes .
While others are the epitome of urban decay .
Parts of downtown Detroit seem to be doing well .
They are relatively clean , with a nice new river walk populated with both old and new office buildings , although vacant buildings remain .
One local tour operator said it 's one of the safest downtowns in the country .
Development is trying to expand from downtown along the river , although the new restaurants , lofts , shops and other symbols of gentrification quickly give way to gutted homes and boarded - up store fronts .
The " cultural corridor " and the Eastern Market area - home to one of the oldest public markets in the country as well as a handful of trendy restaurants , are northwest of downtown .
The trick is to grow and connect these lively places so they spark new life in the areas they border .
To do that Detroit needs to shrink .
Thanks to suburban flight of the late 20th century , it 's a city of under a million people that was built to accommodate twice that many .
The city needs to do something with all those empty buildings , and tie the budding neighborhoods together .
There 's talk of turning blighted lots into public parks , greenways , and of installing a light rail system .
" When you let it go , as Detroit did , you have cascading ripples of blight that move out from the center and keep going , " said Carol Schatz , head of the Central City Association of Los Angeles who helped turn around that city 's downtown in the 1990s .
" But when you revitalize the downtown , it goes in the opposite direction . "
The question is , will Detroit be able to get the critical mass going to get things really moving in the opposite direction ?

Ikegami , chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Keio University School of Medicine , is widely regarded as Japan 's top health economist .
In this interview , he explains how Japan 's health care system is able to produce some of the best health statistics in the world while costing less than health care in most other developed nations .
This is an edited transcript of an interview conducted Oct. 15 , 2007 .
We 're looking at health care systems around the world , and a striking thing about Japan is [ it has achieved ] universal coverage and very good results at such a low cost .
How have the Japanese done this ?
Well , there 's the costs explanation to it , [ which ] is that we have better lifestyles and a better nutrition and , apart from the smoking , the public [ health ] factors are pretty good .
But in Japan , too , the [ health ] expenditures were increasing at the same rate as the United States ' in the 1980s , but then it plateaued after the 1990s .
So there must be a system explanation for that , because the costs did not change that much .
So people had a good diet in the ' 80s when costs were rising .
Something changed in the '90s ?
Right .
I think that it 's because the government is able to control the flow of money .
And the way the government controls the flow of money is that we have multiple payers and multiple providers , but there 's a single - payment system -- not a single payer but a single - payment system -- so that all payers must abide by the payment system , and all providers must be paid by the system .
So this is like a valve , so that if the government wants to contain costs , it can cut , ... and that decreases the flow of money , or at least it contains the increase in the flow of money .
This is done by a two - step method .
The first step is that the prime minister himself decides how much the macro increase will be .
How much the total medical expense budget is going to go up ?
Right . ...
Having made that the first step , the second step is how to allocate that [ increase ] among the various procedures and drugs .
And in this we have a completely different approach to that of the United States , where you , in Medicare , ... it 's an across - the - board conversion factor , so that if there 's a 2 percent decrease , it would be applied 2 percent for every single procedure in the surgical and in the medical procedures .
But in Japan this is done on a procedure - by - procedure basis and by a drug - by - drug basis , and the way that is done is that a survey is made of the financial situation of the providers .
So you 're saying the government has the power to determine these prices , what they 're going to pay .
Do n't the providers , hospitals , have power in pricing ?
They can certainly negotiate , but after making the first - step decision I was saying -- prices are going to be decreased by 3 percent -- then everything must be fitted within that .
So certain prices may go up , certain prices may go down , but in general , the final results should be that the overall budget should be as set by the first step , a 3 percent reduction .
Every two years , when they set the cost for things , they publish them in this big telephone - book - like manual .
And everything 's in there ?
Right .
So there 's one price for sutures and another price for stitches ?
Yeah .
If it 's more than 10 square inches , it will be this amount ; if it 's less than 10 square inches , it will be this amount .
So it 's very finely defined .
...
Let 's take an example of how these low costs work .
In Denver , where I live , if you get an MRI of your neck region it's $ 1,200 , and the doctor we visited in Japan says he gets $ 98 for an MRI .
So how do you do that ?
Well , in 2002 the government says that the MRIs , we are paying too much , so in order to be within the total budget , we will cut them by 35 percent .
If I 'm a doctor , why do n't I say , " I 'm not going to do them ; it 's not enough money " ?
You forgot that we have only one payment system .
So if you want to do your MRIs , unless you can get private - pay patients , which is almost impossible in Japan , you go out of business .
...
...
The price of that MRI is so much cheaper in Japan .
Does n't he have to pay the same price , $ 5,000 , for an MRI machine like the man in America ?
Well , it depends on what kind of image density the radiologist wants .
And the MRIs that are available in Japan are much less expensive than those that are typically found in the United States .
So the imaging machine is cheaper ? ...
To me that 's another advantage of negotiating low prices :
Then the supplying industry has to cut its prices , and the MRI makers met this need .
Right .
And MRIs have now become very big in [ the ] export industry .
So the health ministry set a low price , the MRI makers make cheaper machines to help the doctors meet that price , and now Japan is exporting these around the world ?
Right . ...
This is a situation where the market does work in health care .
...
...
How many insurance plans are there in Japan ?
Three thousand five hundred , but that 's because about 2,000 of them are from local government , which are for plans for those who are not employed , and 1,500 is the number of large companies [ which ] have their own .
But for the doctor it does n't matter , because there is one payment form and one set of forms to file .
Right .
Does this also give you a benefit on administrative costs ?
It certainly does , because first of all , it 's much easier to do the books if there 's only one payment system .
...
And then because providers and brands cannot individually negotiate , then you need to have highly educated and highly paid staff in order to do the complicated negotiations .
And an American doctor , as you know , when they file a bill with the insurance company , the claim is denied , constantly denied .
Can an insurance plan in Japan deny a claim ?
It can , but that is a secondary process .
The primary process is that in each of our states there 's a central [ clearinghouse ] , ... and on average they deny about 1 percent in a month of the claims .
Does the doctor then generally forget that or fight it ?
They can appeal , ... but the second part is that the health [ insurance ] brands can also have a secondary review , and then they can ask the state - level [ clearinghouse ] ... to reconsider .
But it 's up to the state level .
...
Is this right that , in Japan , there is just less cutting , less invasive surgery than in other cultures ?
Yes , I think it 's true .
There 's several explanations .
[ One ] is that there 's a cultural explanation , that we do not like to take aggressive treatment .
Also , from the disease perspective , we have less heart disease .
But I think , again , the system answer is the most convincing , and that is that our surgical procedure fees are low , so it does not financially pay so much to undertake these surgical procedures .
And the fourth aspect is that surgeons who do operate are paid a fixed salary .
So there 's no incentive -- as we say , economic incentive -- to undertake that one extra surgery .
So , looking at it purely from the economic point of view , if I 'm a doctor I could make more money treating somebody over years rather than doing surgery on them .
Yeah , a physician focusing on primary care would make more money than the cardiologist .
...
It seems to me that doctors should be livid about this control [ from the government ] ?
Yeah .
Well , again , when you say doctors , each doctor has his or her own stake , and whether that stake can [ have an ] impact on the general policy or not is another issue .
In Japan the private practitioners are very well organized under the Japan Medical Association , so the Japan Medical Association has so far managed to cushion the effect of cost containment on their private practices .
But the hospital physicians are not so well organized , so they have taken a harder hit , and that is why there 's serious talk about paying hospital physicians more .
In America we tend to think of a doctor as a rich guy who drives a Lexus to the country club for dinner .
Is that the image of a doctor in Japan ?
To a certain extent .
But ... it 's only successful doctors in private practice who can have that kind of lifestyle , and not all those in private practice .
As far as those employed in hospitals , ... if they are working in an urban , large medical center , they are going to [ make ] what their peers in the college would be earning in large companies , so there wo n't be that much difference .
If they go to work in the rural hospital , then they might be only twice as much ... as the urban medical center physician .
...
...
And this helps lure people to rural hospitals ?
Yeah , because the rest of the hospital staff , the nurses and others , are more willing to work in rural hospitals at lower wages , so they can afford to pay higher wages to doctors .
...
But this is a whole different notion than the United States , where orthopedic surgeons can get much higher income , especially if they practice in an urban medical center .
...
[ Are these lower wages ] driving down the number of doctors ?
Well , as far as the competition to get into medical school , it 's gone up .
...
A major issue in America is this notion that our big manufacturing companies are strapped with lots of health insurance costs , particularly the auto companies .
...
For example it is often said that GM pays $ 1,600 per car for health care , and I just read recently in a big American newspaper that Toyota pays nothing .
Is that correct ?
That 's completely wrong , because every employer is mandated to provide insurance to their employees .
But since [ health ] expenditures are lower in Japan , the resulting premiums that they must pay are lower .
So the premium rate for large companies is 7.5 percent of [ an employee 's ] total income , and this is paid just over half by the employer and just under half by the employees .
...
The law states that the employer must pay over half .
So it can be from 50 percent to 80 percent , and that 's negotiable .
For an average worker in Japan , … what would the average health care premium be per month ?
Well , the average payment is about $ 3,000 per month , so 7.5 percent of that would be $ 230 .
That 's covering the family , too ?
That covers the family .
At least the employer , we know , pays half ...
So the employee at a decent Japanese company , for his whole family , is paying about $ 140 a month in health care insurance ?
Right .
That 's an incredible bargain by American standards .
You must remember that about one - third of health expenditures is financed by taxes , but at least the health insurance [ premium ] part would be about that amount .
...
Our health expenditure is 8 percent of GDP [ gross domestic product ] , whereas the U.S. 's is 16 percent .
...
...
What medical services are covered in the basic insurance package ?
...
The general rule is that anything that is shown to be effective and safe will be covered .
Anything a doctor would do to you ?
Right .
Is dental care covered ?
Yes .
Mental health ?
Yes .
Visual ?
Not for gratis .
For surgery or something ?
Yes . ...
The care overall in Japan , the quality , is good ?
Well , just the end results , the macro health [ indicators ] of infant mortality and longevity are the best in the world .
If you can say that the health care system has little to do [ with it ] , then you get to the next question :
Why are you going to spend so much money ?
So here we are in a country with the longest life expectancy , good health results , low costs -- sounds like paradise .
Are there problems in paradise ?
I think it 's a mirror image of the United States in that we [ underspend ] on health care .
For example , in the year 2006 , health expenditures only increased by 0.1 percent , whereas the nominal GDP increased by ... 1.5 percent .
Health care went up 1/10 of 1 percent ?
Right , and the reason why the government has this tight control over all prices is because the national government funds one - quarter of health expenditures , ... and the Japanese government now has a huge deficit amounting to 1.5 percent [ of ] GDP , and the debt is still increasing as a result of having to make tax cuts and investing in public works during the 10 years of deficit .
So in order to [ start ] paying back , they are making every effort to cut expenditures .
This is across - the - board cost containment , and health expenditures are under that umbrella .
And remember that this is happening at the time when Japan is having a very rapid growth for the elderly .
According to my calculations , just aging within the population should contribute a 2 percent increase , so the fact that there has been only a 0.1 percent [ increase ] means that real ... expenditures did decrease .
...
The United States overspends on health care .
To me , overspending is a bad thing , I can see that .
You say Japan underspends .
Why is that bad ?
If you can save money , is n't that a good thing ?
The investment must be made .
...
If you want to have the goodies -- the latest device , the latest drug -- that needs to be paid by someone .
And it 's difficult to say if this particular procedure or if this drug prescribed , would it be a most efficient use of resources or not ?
From the patients ' perspective , they do n't want to be efficient for their particular care .
...
In terms of controlling costs , Japanese people appear to be prodigious consumers of health care .
They go to the doctor three times as often as Americans do , [ have ] many more MRIs , many more scans than Americans have .
They stay in the hospital much longer than Americans for the same procedure .
Is that an area where they could control costs ?
Yeah , but the government has made it a policy goal that they should shorten the length of stay .
...
This is going to be [ attached ] to the subsidies that they 're going to give to our new health insurance for the elderly over 75 , so this will have some teeth in it .
But the problem with health care is this :
Health care is like a balloon , that if you squeeze at one end , another end pops up .
So the pressure to decrease the length of stay would result in shifting services to outpatient and to long - term care .
...
Why do Japanese people go to the doctor so often , three times as often as Americans ?
Do they like it ?
Well , the one thing is that total time spent by the patient with the physician may not be that different , because the consultation times are pretty short .
Pretty short ?
Meaning how long ?
If it 's a repeat consultation , it may be five minutes or so .
...
If you 're an elderly patient with a chronic illness , you may like to have a short visit to assure yourself , but if you want to have a long time going over the issues , that may not be a good practice .
But the doctors may say that , since the consultation fees are kept low , they ask the patients to come more often .
But then that 's why the co-payment rate has been increased .
The co-payment is what the patient pays when he shows up at the doctor ; used to be 20 percent of the bill ?
For the employer it used to be zero .
There was no co-payment due until 1980 , and then they introduced 10 percent , and then it went up to 30 percent ... in 2003 .
Do people go to the doctor less often because they have to pay more ?
As part of the government team , we looked at the impact of the increase of the co-payment , and it has a short - term effect .
...
But if you look at the annual records , it does not seem to have ... an effect .
The difference between paying 20 percent of the cost of a visit and 30 percent is how many yen ?
For outpatient , it may seem pretty significant , but once it goes over a certain catastrophic amount , then the co-payment goes down to 1 percent .
...
It 's on a monthly basis , ... and the amount depends on the income .
So if you have a low income , the cutoff point may be about $ 300 , and if you 're high - income , it would be about $ 1,200 .
So people who are sick and have to go to the doctor a lot have a big break on the co-pay ?
Well , I think it 's mostly for inpatients who have very high cost , ... like dialysis and hemophilia .
...
For these particular diseases , the catastrophic [ rate ] kicks in after $ 100 ... per month .
If consecutive months exceed a certain amount , or if there are more members of your household exceed[ing ] that amount , then that amount is lowered for the second month or for the second member of the family .
I think what you 're getting at here is that they 've got a system that makes sure people do n't go broke paying medical bills .
Right .
I think the main goal of a public health insurance system is to prevent people [ from ] going broke .
How many people in Japan go bankrupt because of medical bills ?
None , or at least there should be none , because first of all , they should be covered , and if they 're not covered , then they can get covered by paying back one year 's premiums .
And if they can't pay back the one year 's premium , then they will be on public assistance .
If somebody in Japan loses [ her ] job , does she lose her health insurance , too ?
She loses the employment - based insurance , but then there 's the community - based insurance , which is mandated for her to enroll and for the local government to enroll that person .
Can they turn her down if she has heart disease or something ?
That is forbidden .
...
Neither can the employer deny in hiring someone because of health conditions .
So if lose my job I do n't lose my health insurance ; in fact , I 'm required to buy it , but from the city instead of an employer ?
Yeah .
...
It 's more like taxes rather than having something that you want to pay or must pay .
...
So in Japan you can walk into the hospital and say , " I need to see a heart specialist , " and you can see one that day [ without a referral ] ?
Right , and the government is trying to discourage that by a higher co-pay if you do n't come with a letter , but that is only ... for the first visit ; then everything else is covered .
So it 's not really acting too efficiently or effectively .
...
As a patient , I think that 's great ; I want to walk in and see a specialist without an appointment .
As an economist , what do you think ?
Is that a good system ?
No , but then for that gatekeeper function to be desirable , ... the patient must trust the gatekeeper .
...
But then we have the reverse situation in that the patient may think he needs to be seen by a cardiologist , ... but may actually have another disease or maybe a psychological condition which could be better [ if ] followed up by a primary care physician .
We have a debate going on about health care in America .
Some of the candidates basically say that anything in a foreign country is socialized medicine .
Is Japan using socialized medicine ?
Yeah .
I mean , ... this is all part of the social health insurance system , so it is socialized medicine .
For the government to decide unilaterally that the prices would go up or down , this is a socialized system .
Does the government own the hospitals ?
No . ...
The federal government owns only 10 percent .
...
Ten percent is for the voluntary organizations .
Eighty percent is truly private .
That 's a higher percentage of private hospitals than in the U.S. , is n't it ?
Right .
The doctors are privately employed businesspeople , is that correct ?
Two - thirds of our doctors are employed by hospitals .
One - third are private practitioners working in clinics , but they do not have hospital privileges .
...
So hospitals are private , only 10 percent of the doctors work for the government , to me that 's not the description of socialized medicine : the government running , the government providing , the health care .
But , for example , England 's National Health Service , they have tried to privatize their hospitals by creating foundation trusts .
I think that is a general direction in that it 's just a tradition of the government being both the financing part and the providing part .
They have been trying to split that so that there should be more market efficiency .
It 's the same internal market argument .
Do market efficiencies work in medicine ?
To a certain extent .
For example , the lowering of drug prices and for devices , that is an area where there are tangible aspects of it so that you can compare apples to apples .
But if you are talking about comparing health insurance grants and trying to make them compete , they will compete on cherry - picking .
By picking healthy patients ?
Right .
These health care plans covering basic health care for a worker and his family , do they make a profit ?
No , because they are not allowed to make a profit .
And anything left over is carried over to the next year , and if there 's a lot carried over , then the premium rate would go down .
We 've been hearing about Japan moving toward a more market - oriented system .
Would that be moving toward the American direction ?
... Back when [ Junichiro ]
Koizumi was prime minister , there was a strong movement to allow extra billing .
...
Extra billing is like , for example , using off - label drugs :
The insurance says that this cancer drug can only be used for lung cancer because its studies have been only made for lung cancer , and we do n't know whether that 's effective for other cancer .
Now , the pro-market economy business leaders who were under the prime minister 's council said that this should be deregulated , and providers can bill the part that is covered by the public health insurance to the public health insurance [ and ] the part that is not covered directly to the patient .
But ... they decided , in effect , that the prohibition would remain , so that extra billing and balance billing would not be allowed .
Do you agree ?
Yes .
That 's not a good way to go .
No , I do n't think it 's a good way to go , because the whole notion of choice in health care is very different from the typical market - economy situation .
For example , plastic surgery may be the one area where market forces can work , where there 's time available to make that rational choice ; it is not a life - and - death situation , and the outcome is fairly predictable .
...
Do you think the Japanese people feel that everyone in this country should all have a basic package of medical coverage ?
According to opinion polls , I would not only say basic but egalitarian coverage [ for ] all .
Over 70 percent of the Japanese , when they 're asked that question , say they 're not only in favor of basic coverage , they are in favor of egalitarian coverage .
Do you think we 're going to make [ a ] major change in U.S. health care ?
Aside from Iraq , it would be the biggest election issue in the presidential election .
Instead of a big - bang solution , you would need to have incremental adjustments so that eventually you get there .
So if the presidential term is four years , aim for a three - year plan .
To do it in one term would be quite an achievement .
I think you do need to do it in one term , because there 's no assurance that the president will be re-elected .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The nation 's armed services wrapped up a record year for recruiting as a withering job market and bigger bonuses trumped two unpopular wars .
The Department of Defense said it met or exceeded recruitment goals for all branches of the armed services for fiscal year 2009 , which ended Sept. 30 , for the first time since 1973 , when the draft ended and U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam .
" We 're pleased to report that for the first time since the advent of the all - volunteer force , all of the military components , active and reserve , meet their number as well as their quality goals , " said Bill Carr , deputy undersecretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy , at a Pentagon press conference on Tuesday .
The active - duty Air Force , Marine Corps and Navy all met their goals , as measured by the number of fresh recruits , while the Army achieved 108 % of its recruitment goals , the DOD said .
The Reserves for each branch exceeded their goals for recruitment numbers , and the National Guard matched its goal .
The Pentagon also exceeded its quality goals , as 96 % of the active - duty recruits were high - school graduates , surpassing a 90 % benchmark .
Carr acknowledged that the high level of unemployment in the civilian job market was helping the military draw recruits , and the earning power of recruits puts them in the top 10 % of workers of commensurate age , education and experience .
Recruits typically earn $ 1,399.50 a month as they undergo basic training during their first few months in the military , according to the DOD .
Most enlisted personnel can expect to earn $ 1,568.70 a month by the end of their first year , which translates into an annual salary of $ 18,824.40 .
Carr also attributed recruiting success to new attitudes among young adults that make them more eager to serve , regardless of the state of economy .
He said the generation born between 1978 and 1996 " witnessed 9/11 " and is " more inclined toward service to society " than other generations .
The only real disadvantage to recent recruiting , said Carr , is a decline in medical eligibility from the growing prevalence of obesity in the U.S. population .
One in 20 Americans aged 17 to 24 were considered obese in the 1980s , he said , compared to one in four today .
An Army of One , and a bonus of $ 18,000
According to Beth Asch , military recruiting expert for the Rand Corporation , a non-profit think tank based in Santa Monica , Calif. , economic incentives are the most important factor in drawing recruits .
She said the Army dramatically increased its recruitment bonuses since the start of the Iraq war , to an average of $ 18,000 for the 70 % who are eligible .
" The effect of Iraq has had a negative impact on recruiting , " said Asch .
" [ The military ] responded with a dramatic increase in recruiting resources .
In the case of the Army , the average bonuses tripled . "
For the military overall , 40 % of recruits in 2009 received a sign - on bonus that averaged $ 14,000 , according to the DOD .
Bonuses are provided to recruits for a variety of factors , including $ 5,000 for having a college degree .
Military personnel also received a 3.9 % pay raise in fiscal year 2009 , following a rise of 3.5 % the prior year .
Members of the military also receive free healthcare .
Once the recruits move out of the barracks , they become eligible for a monthly food allowance of $ 323.87 and a monthly housing allowance that averages $ 952 nationwide -- or more , if they have dependents .
In addition , they are not required to pay taxes while serving in a combat zone .
Asch said the pay , bonuses and other benefits are strong enticements to young people trying to make their way in a civilian job market where unemployment is at a 26 - year high of 9.8 % .
" Had there been no change in recruiting resources , had there been no change in the economy , there would have been a significant drop off in recruiting , " she said .
" All our research show that recruits respond to recruiting resources .
The military got lucky in the sense that when the economy worsens , recruitment improves . "
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Les' Melnyk of the Army said the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not dissuaded people from joining the military .
" A lot of people say the wars are hurting recruiting , but the numbers do n't back that up , " he said .
" The expectation there is that you 're going to go to war .
This is not a surprise to anybody , and it has not affected recruitment . "
I ’ve had a lot of fun the last few days following the controversy cause by Joel Spolsky ’s post , The Duct Tape Programmer .
I actually wish the software development part of the blogospehere would produce more posts like it , because it induced such a tremendous response ( both positive and negative ) .
Ultimately we all benefit when everyone chimes in and shares their opinion on an issue ( we all get to learn from each other ) .
Of course now that I have said that , it would be remiss of me not to add my own 2 cents into the mix :) .
The way I see it , Joel stresses 3 distinct points in his post .
Good Programmers Ship Product
Some believe that because Joel has a successful track record of shipping software he must be right ( with some caveats ) .
I have to say that I completely agree with this one , shipping is key .
No matter where you work as a developer , your job is ultimately to deliver value , to the business , to the customers – whatever .
Software that has not shipped can’t deliver any value and is by that definition useless .
So far so good .
The place where I began to have an issue was the clear connotation that ‘ duct tape programmers ’ ship software while everyone else is just holding them back .
To be blunt that is crap ._
You do n’t have to be a Joel - style ‘ duct tape programmer ’ to be delivery focused_ .
Anyone who has ever worked on an agile team can tell you that .
Agile teams do not fit the ‘ duct tape programmer ’ definition that Joel puts forward .
They try to use the right tool for the right job and over - engineering is a no - no ( this does fit the mold ) , but agile teams are also very focused on quality .
That means having processes in place that will assure such quality , unit testing , continuous integration etc .
Whether such quality processes slow you down can be debated ad nauseam , what can not be debated is the fact that the quality does not come at the expense of delivery focus .
The business is fully aware of the fact that such quality measures are in place and are willing to live with it because they ‘ listen to the experts ’ and trust their team to have the best interests of the business at heart .
But , if push were to come to shove and quality needed to be sacrificed to meet a deadline , a good agile team would do it , they would n’t like it , and they would make the business aware of the price they would have to pay , but they would do it .
This I believe , is ‘ duct tape ’ mentality without going cowboy style .
The point I am trying to make is that just like there is more than one way to skin a cat , there is more than one type of ‘ duct tape ’ programmer .
If you ’re currently working on an agile team , then congratulations , you could already be a duct tape programmer , maybe not the same kind as Joel likes but as far as I am concerned , if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck … well you get the picture .
Unit Test Have No Value If They Get In The Way Of Shipping Product
Some people seem a little concerned at Joel ’s cavalier attitude to unit tests .
Read the post closely , he is not really having a go at unit testing ( well he is to some extent ) , what we ’re really talking about is the quality of the talent we work with .
Case in point – the ‘ friggard ’ who writes multi- threaded COM apartments ( whatever the hell that is – I does n’t buildz them Winderz codez :) ) .
The guy is obviously freaking smart , head in the clouds , but smart .
The ‘ duct tape ’ programmer is just as smart , more down to earth but still a bona - fide savant .
Would n’t it be great if we could all work with superstars all the time ?
Problem is , software development is a big industry these days , not everyone can be a genius , a great many are either not experienced enough or simply not talented enough to understand the ‘ friggard ’ , but by that same virtue they can’t really be a duct tape programmers , they would n’t know which brand of duct tape to use .
What I am trying to say is this , really good people ( developers ) will create great software , ship it and make it reasonably high quality no matter what the process , no matter how much unit testing .
Of course the scale and the type of software matters , web apps or desktop apps are pretty well - understood , but even star people will struggle to deliver decent quality when building something highly complex and cutting edge .
However in your regular day to day work , put a bunch of awesome people together , give them an objective , unleash them on it and watch them go , it will be awesome .
Unfortunately most of us do n’t work for Fog Creek or Stack Overflow or whatever , millions of developers work for bank ABC or insurance company XYZ where you ca n’t really rely on the fact that all other developers will quite be at your level of duct tape awesomeness :) .
And this is where stuff like unit tests saves everyone ’s ass , mine yours and the company ’s because when you know your team is not Macgyver enough to patch a go cart on the fly , it kinda helps to make sure your go cart is unlikely to need patching in the first place .
I do n’t necessarily agree with Uncle Bob , there are cases when unit tests can slow us down , but we pay that price for peace of mind .
What if you are lucky enough to work for Melzer and Smelzer accounting with a group of awesome people ?
Does that mean we can all just go guerrilla with our duct tape and achieve new heights of shipping awesomeness ?
Problem is , there is that pesky future to think of .
You ’re not lucky enough to own Melzer and Smelter ( unless your name is Melzer , errr or Smelzer I guess , but then you ’re probably an accountant ) you ’re not always going to be working there , people are gonna come after you leave and they will have to use your code , modify it , enhance it and ship it some more .
Not all these guys are gonna be duct tape genius material and even if they are , it ’s just common courtesy to not leave a dogs breakfast in there hands .
Think of it as paying it forward ( I ’ve said this before and will say it again ) , cause when you come to a new place , no matter how great your software development kung - fu is , if the software you have to work with is a bunch kitten barf you ’re not going to enjoy the stink .
Go Get The Book ?
There is no doubt that Joel writes a damn good blog post , I ’ve got a lot of respect for him and for what he has done in this industry .
Joel is also a clever marketer , the post he wrote was controversial enough that the well - blended promotion of Coders At Work was pretty much seamless ( and no doubt he was aware that would happen ) .
Now , I have no idea if Joel is in any way affiliated with the book , or if he simply promoted it because he liked it so much ( it does seem to be somewhat similar in format to the books he himself released ) , what I do know is that he certainly made me want to go and check out the book .
As someone who studies online and offline marketing as a hobby , I have to give him major kudos for that one .
Well , there you go , that ’s my thinking regarding this whole kettle of fish , hopefully it was at least somewhat coherent :) .
If you have some thoughts about my thinking , do share them with everyone – in the comments .

George Shultz on the Drug War
The former secretary of state has long doubted the wisdom of interdiction .
To remain certified , most of the nation ’s 700,000 doctors are required periodically to take continuing medical education courses .
But for years , critics have said that too many of those courses are little more than drug company marketing in the guise of education .
Sponsorship by the pharmaceutical industry pays an estimated half of the cost of such programs in the United States , which exceeds $ 1 billion a year .
And critics have argued that the national nonprofit group that accredits the course providers has not done enough to fight drug industry influence in the classroom .
On Tuesday , the head of the accrediting group said he was poised to begin taking stronger action .
Dr. Murray Kopelow , chief executive of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education , said he would make public “ within weeks ” a previously confidential listing of classes and companies that violated rules against commercial bias .
And at the urging of a prominent critic who successfully filed a complaint alleging bias in a specific course , Dr. Kopelow said his group was reviewing a proposal that would require educators to notify doctors and furnish corrective materials whenever it is later found that the class material was biased in favor of a drug firm .

Choosing a License
When choosing a license to apply to your project , use an existing license instead of making up a new one .
And do n't just use any existing license — use one of the widely - used , well - recognized existing licenses .
Such licenses are familiar to many people already .
If you use one of them , people wo n't feel they have to read the legalese in order to use your code , because they 'll have already done so for that license a long time ago .
Thus , you reduce or remove one possible barrier to entry for your project .
They are also of a high quality : they are the products of much thought and experience ; indeed most of them are revisions of previous versions of themselves , and the modern versions represent a great deal of accumulated legal and technical wisdom .
Unless your project has truly unusual needs , it is unlikely you could do better , even with a team of lawyers at your disposal .
Below is a list of licenses that in my opinion meets these criteria ; in parentheses are the standard formal abbreviation for the license and an authoritative URL for its full text .
This list is not in order of preference , but rather in roughly descending order from strong copyleft at the top to completely non-copyleft at the bottom .
The exact provisions of each license differ in various interesting ways ( except for MIT and BSD , which differ only in uninteresting ways ) , and there is n't space here to explore all the possible ramifications of each for your project .
However , many good discussions of that sort are available on the Internet ; in particular the Wikipedia pages for these licenses generally give good overviews .
If you have nothing else to guide you and you want a copyleft license , then choose either the GPL - 3.0 or the AGPL - 3.0 — the difference between them will be discussed below — and if you want a non -copyleft license , choose the MIT license .
I 've put those licenses in boldface to reflect this :
GNU General Public License version 3 ( GPL - 3.0 , https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
( , https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ( AGPL - 3.0 , https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)
( , https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)
Mozilla Public License 2.0 ( MPL - 2.0 , https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/)
, https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/)
GNU Library or " Lesser " General Public License version 3 ( LGPL - 3.0 , https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
, https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
Eclipse Public License 1.0 ( EPL - 1.0 , https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)
( Note that version 2 of the EPL was almost ready as of mid-2014 , and may be out by the time you read this . )
, https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)
MIT license ( MIT , https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
( , https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
Apache License 2.0 ( Apache - 2.0 , https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
, https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
BSD 2 - Clause ( " Simplified " or " FreeBSD " ) license ( BSD - 2 - Clause , https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
Note that there are some arguments for choosing the Apache License 2.0 as a default non-copyleft license , and they are nearly as compelling as those for choosing MIT .
In the end , I come down in favor of MIT because it is extremely short , and both widely used and widely recognized .
While the Apache License 2.0 has the advantage of containing some explicit defenses against misuse of software patents , which might be important to your organization depending on the kind of project you 're launching , the MIT license is fully compatible with all versions of the GNU General Public License , meaning that you can distributed , under any version of the GPL , mixed - provenance works that contain MIT - licensed code .
The GPL - compatibility situation for the Apache License , on the other hand , is more complicated — by some interpretations , it is compatible with GPL version 3 only .
Therefore , to avoid giving your downstream redistributors the headache of having to read sentences like the preceding ones , I just recommend the MIT license as the default non-copyleft license for anyone who does n't have a reason to choose otherwise .
The mechanics of applying a license to your project are discussed in the section called “ How to Apply a License to Your Software ” .
New Prince of Persia Title Trademarked
The filing was noticed by Superannuation , which also took note of an Ubisoft character modeler that recently listed his current job as " working on the new Prince of Persia . "
Mechner has not dabbled in video games since 2003's Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time .
More recently , Mechner penned the screenplay for the movie adaptation of Sands , which stars Jake Gyllenhaal and is set for release in May 2010 .
Due to the upcoming film -- and the shared word of " Sands " in the titles -- many internet sleuths are speculating that the new Prince of Persia game will be tied to the movie in some way .
Niether Ubisoft or Mechner have officially commented on the purported project .
VERDICTS & SETTLEMENTS
When you are injured through the actions or negligence of another person , the liable party has one mission — to compensate you with as little money as possible .
Whether you are up against insurance companies , a business owner , or a large corporation , they all want to minimize their liability .
That is where we come in .
We have the experience and resources you need to get the recovery you deserve .
The attorneys at McMillen Urick Tocci Jones know how to negotiate with powerful companies .
We never accept insufficient settlements , and we are not afraid to bring your case to trial to secure fair compensation for your injuries .
The numbers say it all — we have secured millions of dollars in recoveries for clients throughout Beaver County and Western Pennsylvania .
A Sydney man is suing British Airways for up to A$ 600,000 after he was forced to endure a long - haul flight from London to Shanghai in a broken seat , a court has heard .
Richard John Pattison , 64 , sustained an injury to his neck after he had to remain upright for the entire 12 - hour flight when his seat would not recline past its " take - off " position .
The engineer from Concord told the court that during the flight in September 2006 he woke several times to his head " snapping back " after it had fallen forward because of the awkward angle of the seat .
When he complained to airline staff he was told he could not be moved because the flight was full , the court heard .
Mr Pattison , who had been on a business trip at the time of the injury , is suing British Airways for damages , including economic losses that stemmed from the incident .
As a result of his injuries he had to employ more workers and alter his hours of work as chief executive of a plastics manufacturing company , the court heard .
This included sometimes having to send work emails at 3am .
Did you find this arrangement satisfactory ? " asked his counsel , Martin Luitingh .
" No , " he replied .
" It is tiring , it is no life and I 'm married . "
Mr Pattison told the court his neck had been stiff as he walked off the flight but it was not until he woke from a seven - hour sleep after arriving at his hotel that he began to experience excruciating pain .
He could not raise his head from the pillow without assistance and it was too painful to lift his left arm above his waist , the court heard .
A specialist who prepared reports on Mr Pattison 's injury , James Bodel , told the court there was a causal link between the flight and Mr Pattison 's pain .
Dr Bodel said Mr Pattison also had a pre-existing arthritic condition , consistent with ageing , which made his spine " vulnerable " to such injuries .
" It is a very unnatural way to sit in a confined space for a very long period of time without trying to fall asleep , " he said .
" Economy [ class ] is not a very good place to be if you want to enjoy yourself . "
British Airways denies it is liable for Mr Pattison 's injuries , claiming he failed to use a pillow to support his neck and did not adopt an " ergonomically suitable position " during the flight .
Counsel for the airline , Des Fagan , SC , asked Mr Pattison why he had sent a letter of complaint to the airline shortly after the flight which claimed the seat would not recline because there was a storage canister behind it .
" That was my theory at the time , " Mr Pattison said .
" Since then I have seen some information from British Airways that says the seat will recline with the canister there . ''
Mr Fagan said : '' The other position , Mr Pattison , is that your account here today of having asked an attendant to help you and [ that ] the attendant was not successful , was a lie . "
" I do n't tell lies , " he replied .
The hearing , before Judge Garry Neilson , continues .

Between Thursday evening and Friday morning , Linus Torvalds released the fourth release candidate of Linux version 2.6.32 , although , due to the typing error in the first release candidate ( RC1 was mis-labeled RC2 ) , it is called 2.6.32-rc5 instead of 2.6.32-rc4 .
Torvalds released this version only a few days after RC4 , as he and many other kernel hackers will spend the weekend travelling to this year 's Linux Kernel Summit held in Tokyo next week ; therefore few changes are expected to make their way into the Linux kernel 's source code management system during this time .
Another major SCSI driver was merged into the Linux kernel 's main development branch with RC4 and RC5 offers two further network drivers .
Such stragglers can be found in almost any development cycle .
As usual , however , the majority of changes were incorporated during the merge window , which lasts two weeks and was closed by Torvalds with the release of the first RC at the end of September .
The Kernel Log is , therefore , already in a position to provide an overview of some of the major enhancements of Linux 2.6.32 , which is expected to be released at the beginning of December .
We are starting our " What 's coming in 2.6.32 " mini series with the most important changes to the kernel 's network support ; major changes in other kernel areas will be discussed in further editions of the series over the next few weeks .
Wireless
The developers have re-activated the p54 driver 's power saving support .
While , to bypass a bug that is presumed to be hardware - related , they have done the opposite with the iwl4965 driver for Intel 's Wireless Wi -Fi Link 4965AGN , and disabled it .
It is yet uncertain if they will ever be able to re-activate the power saving features .
However , the kernel hackers also improved the driver for Intel Wi-Fi chips , which can now automatically select the appropriate sleep state for the Wi-Fi hardware using information gathered via pm_qos ( Power Management Quality of Service ) .
Following various restructuring measures to the ath9 k driver for many recent Atheros Wi-Fi chips , the developers have extended the driver to support AR9287 Wi-Fi chips ; some rudimentary first components for examining the AR9271 were also incorporated into the kernel .
The MAC8021 Wi-Fi stack now scans for Wi-Fi networks in the background , which allows access point connections to continue transmitting data .
This is an interesting feature for location - based services and roaming , as highlighted in a blog post by Dan Williams , the main developer of NetworkManager .
A new addition is the wl1271 driver for the Wi-Fi part of Texas Instruments ' WiLink 6.0 mobile platform used in the embedded area .
The b43 driver for Wi -Fi chips by Broadcom can now also handle low power PHYs ( LP - PHY ) such as the BCM4312 , which can be found in some notebooks and in the embedded area .
The prism54 driver , which has been superseded by the p54pci driver , is now planned for removal from the kernel in version 2.6.34 .
Networking
Just in time for RC5 , the kernel hackers have incorporated the vmxnet3 driver into the main development branch .
It is able to communicate with the " vmxnet3 virtual ethernet NIC " - a network adaptor that emulates several virtualisation solutions by VMware .
In addition , Linux 2.6.32 will offer the infrastructure required for updating ( " flashing " ) the firmware of network chips using the ethtool program .
The r8169 driver for recent network hardware by Realtek now also supports the RTL8168D chip .
However , this is only one of many network drivers that have been extended to support new hardware – more information about these changes can be found in the commits in the " Minor Gems " section at the end of this article .
The btusb driver is now capable of USB autosuspending – with Bluetooth chips that do n't support remote wake - up , however , the interface must be shut down for the power saving mechanisms to take effect .
The btmrvl and btmrvl_sdio drivers for Bluetooth chips by Marvell ( documentation ) are new additions .
The kernel developers also integrated several mISDN drivers :
avmfritz for AVM PCI cards in the Fritz !
series
netjet for NETJet PCI cards by Traverse Technologies
mISDNinfineon for various ISDN chips by Siemens and Infineon
speedfax for the ISAR DSP chip by Siemens used in Speedfax + hardware
w6692 for PCI cards with Winbond W6692
Another kernel first is a driver for the CAN controller on Atmel AT91SAM9263 chips , which was introduced by a Pengutronix employee ( 1 , 2 ) .
Predominantly introduced by Oracle developers , the code that supports the Reliable Datagram Sockets ( RDS ) protocol created for server clusters now also supports transmissions via TCP .
Minor Gems
The kernel hackers have considerably improved the support of wireless extensions ( WE ) and network namespaces .
Some of these and further minor , but by no means insignificant , changes can be found in the list below .
Like many of the references in the text above , the links point to the relevant commit in the web front end of the main Linux development branch , where the commit comments and the patches themselves provide extensive further information on the respective changes .

Staffordshire terrier cross is sometimes a euphemism for a pit bull
An Australian man who freed his dog from an animal pound 's " death row " and then went on the run has offered to surrender , police say .
Ron Gilbertson 's dog , Max , was going to be put down for mauling sheep .
Mr Gilbertson went to say goodbye to Max last week , but instead cut the dog from his cage and fled , leaving his wife and two children .
Police in South Australia say the renegade pair were located after a search and were prepared to surrender .
" We have found out where he is and he will come in within the next few days to surrender to charges , " Andy Stott of Mount Gambier police said .
Mr Gilbertson faces charges of damaging property and removing a seized dog .
He could also face a large bill for legal costs related to his earlier court attempt to overturn the decision to destroy Max , a Staffordshire terrier cross .
Finwick is an absolute lovely crafted , triple - A flashgame .
In this platformer you guide Finwick and his girlfriend Pentella through different levels , in order to deliver a mail to an ecologist .
It is not so much about the story , but especially gameplay , graphics and soundeffects are totally unique .
Blissful game experience granted .
The only word of critic has to be made about the ingame - dialogues .
They are also crafted very well , but somehow the number and frequency of the speech - bubbles not really fit the rhythm of the game and they are a little bit annoying .
But this is not really a fault .
The first 25 levels are available free .
To unlock the whole game you will spend 5,99 dollar .
The game is played in the browser and it is almost a duty to check out the demo !
This platform - game was made by Small Green Hill and definitely plays in the same league like Samorost or Machinarium by Amanita Design .

My son , Tom , and my daughter , Emily , made the greatest involuntary sacrifices for me to serve , first , the medical profession through leadership of the Australian Medical Association , then the people of Bradfield and my country as its member .
I spent more time , through their 22 years of life , travelling , at meetings , in conferences , in parliaments , at functions and on the phone than I have spent with them .
And I am not alone in this place in that regard .
They were seven years old when I returned as President of the Australian Medical Association from 10 days away in remote Aboriginal communities .
The self - imposed objective was to bring to the awareness of middle Australia the appalling health , premature death and existential despair of Indigenous people .
Returning to Hobart late at night I went to kiss them good night .
Emily roused and I apologised for my long absence .
She replied : ' That 's all right , Daddy .
You 're trying to help the Aborigines . '
Emily and Tom , you are my greatest achievement .
It was for the Aborigines and to play a role in building a better Australia that in September 1994 I resolved to sell my home and move to Sydney .
Having provided medical care to low - income families for almost a decade , I knew that the horizon of MPs in such communities is entirely consumed by life 's day - to - day struggles and I wanted to do more .
But I love Tasmania and have asked that my ashes be spread at Adventure Bay , Bruny Island , 40 or 50 years from now , hopefully .
I am who I am and have done what I have only because of other people .
My father died six days before the 2004 election .
He did not see me go on to be defence minister and Liberal leader .
That is an experience that both the Prime Minister and my leader , the opposition leader , have also had .
My father was a decent , thoughtful and intelligent man possessed of deep concern for the poor , the voiceless and victims of excess .
My mother taught me that life 's value would ultimately be found in the people and the causes to which it was committed .
My mother said that power was an instrument to be used in the service of those who had none and that in that service would be found fulfilment .
I thank the Jesuits for seeking to instil in me the imaginative capacity to see the world through the eyes of other people .
I only came to the parliament through those who believed in me .
Bruce Shepherd has been a second father ; at times , also , like a second son .
We met 20 years ago .
I told him I did not like him .
Uncharacteristically , he refrained from a profanity , offering instead his first advice , ' Never pass an opinion on someone you have not met . '
He later taught me the absolute importance of believing in a cause and bleeding for it .
Rhondda Vanzella made me , politically and personally — through 15 years of selfless sacrifice for Bradfield , the Liberal Party and my family .
Doug Thompson dispensed encouragement , support and always a Slim Dusty story .
Whether campaigning , making wedding plans or managing kids , Doug and Monique were always there .
Don Glover was the Bradfield Liberal who really had the courage to back me at the most crucial time in 1995 .
I was then mentored and supported by Betty Flick , Peter and Norma Beckley , John and Angela Carrick , Les Taylor , Robert Longstaff , Felix Venn Brown , Geoff Selig , Tony and Lee Hall and many , many others .
I would not have arrived here without Bill Heffernan ; nor would I have remained without Tony Staley Nor could I have done anything without my staff : Lee Hall , Ben Franklin , Sarah Cruickshank , Yaron Finkelstein , Simon Berger , Deborah Chan , Jaci Armstrong and ' Hudson ' in my electorate office — to name but a few .
Peter Hendy , Catherine Murphy and Maria Fernandez served me magnificently as chiefs of staff .
To the many ministerial and leader 's staff , especially Peta Credlin , I owe you all a debt that can not be repaid .
You all made me better than I deserve to be .
I can only say to you that John Howard not once ever raised the earring .
But , if he had , I would have had a second one put in !
I thank the Liberal Party for believing in me and for giving me extraordinary undeserved opportunities .
I came to my Liberal belief through life , absorbing it through reflection upon and familiarity with the hard work , self - sacrifice and idealism of just everyday people .
I am a better person and a stronger Liberal for the path that I chose .
It has been an honour to serve Bradfield , an extraordinary electorate populated by educated , hardworking people who are imbued with a deep sense of commitment to service — volunteerism , philanthropy and the best interests of Australia .
These are people who give much but ask little , deserving much better than the devastating environmental vandalism being imposed upon them by the New South Wales government 's rampant overdevelopment .
I arrived here in 1996 in the company of men and women who will forever be accorded a very special place in my life .
Phil Barresi , Gary Nairn , Jo Gash , Dana Vale and Warren Entsch .
It takes an effort to arrive in parliament as a crocodile farmer and cattle producer and leave as a gay rights activist with an earring , but that is Entschy .
Amongst many others , they taught me a great deal .
I had intended to cross the floor in 1997 should the government relax cross-media ownership laws to allow the Packers to get Fairfax .
I did not want to create a future in which they and Mr Murdoch would ultimately control the way my kids were going to think .
I told the Packers so .
I also held strong views on native title — Pauline Hanson had become a lightning rod for grief and anger that many Australians felt about changes in our country from the Keating era that they neither understood nor wanted — and mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory .
Although I wanted to be a minister and to drive policy , I had all but given up believing it would ever happen when , in December 2000 , John Howard asked me to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence .
I was surprised because I sensed that John believed me risky , with an earring and a questionable background for Liberal politics .
But I learned of John Howard that he respected people who challenged him provided they had an intellectually - sustainable basis for their argument and refused to parade it through the media .
I later learned that it was Peter Reith who convinced John Howard to give me a go .
Maligned by unions , the media and their fellow travellers , Peter Reith is one of the finest men that I have met in politics .
We were in Aboriginal Australia together when he was employment minister , accepting my proposal to establish an organisation to facilitate volunteerism in Aboriginal communities .
My proudest achievement as parliamentary secretary for Defence was rebuilding the propellant factory at Mulwala .
Defence had planned to close it , which would have meant we would import all our ammunition and lose 750 direct and indirect jobs , creating a human and social tragedy , not to mention a strategic failure .
Madness .
I relished my four years as Minister for Education , Science and Training .
The then departmental secretary , Peter Shergold , wore a tie adorned with tumbling pigs — all the way through 2002 — and I was a bit too polite to ask him why .
Finally he explained to a large gathering of stakeholders in the Main Committee room at the end of the consultation year on higher education reform that he called it his ' pigs might fly ' tie .
He considered that my chances of getting university reform through the cabinet , let alone a Senate controlled by four Independents , fell into the ' pigs might fly ' category .
But we did get it through : $ 11 billion more for the sector , with limited deregulation , governance reform , performance funding pools , scholarships , 25,000 more publicly - funded places , new medical schools , a transformational opening - up of the private sector and access to income - contingent loans .
The ' pigs ' tie is framed and it now hangs in my office .
Voluntary students unionism was delivered only by belief , persistence , negotiation and a judgment that I exercised at a critical juncture to test it in the Senate without knowing what the outcome would be .
The schools agenda pursued by the current government is essentially that which we drove and legislated in 2004 : national performance benchmarks in literacy and numeracy , a common school starting age , plain - language report cards , national standards for teaching , measurement and publication of school performance , principal autonomy , direct funding to schools , and the development of a national curriculum .
The states had four years to comply , otherwise they would lose the Commonwealth money .
That is why they are doing it .
The Rudd government deserves credit for implementing the agenda , and I thank both the Prime Minister and his government for doing so and for standing up to the intransigence that I experienced from their Labor cousins in the states over the four years that I was the minister .
I also make no apology for requiring schools to fly the Australian flag and to teach values .
It was right to drive values education in the knowledge that character is destiny .
A values - free education risks producing values - free adults .
The problem too often is not that young people have not learned our values ; it is that they have .
I also believed that our nation had failed in creating a culture in which young people felt that their lives were measured by the educational choices that they made .
If they did not get an outstanding university entrance score , a university degree and a BMW then , in some way , they felt they were of lesser value — lesser value to their families and lesser value to their country — than those who did .
It was right to confront this orthodoxy and Renew the political and policy emphasis on apprenticeships .
No person 's life is valued by the educational choices that they make .
We must never return to the class war in school funding .
Those parents who choose to send their children to Catholic and independent schools had to be defended from those who were engaged in the politics of envy .
All those children receive less public money for their education , deserving this nation 's support for their education and parental sacrifice .
I thank John Howard and Peter Costello for their belief in science and research , doubling funding to the Australian Research Council and allocating an additional $ 8.3 billion to the nation 's research and innovation agenda .
Defence remains the most demanding yet personally satisfying role that I have had in my public life .
It was far more demanding than being opposition leader , which was difficult in different and less important ways .
Management of the portfolio , reform of it , major procurements , intelligence , foreign policy and overseeing Australia at war , including 10 deployments , was gruelling .
Acquisition of the four C - 17 Globemasters , the three per cent real compounding increases in Defence spending over the next decade , two additional army battalions , three F100 Aegis equipped air warfare destroyers , two 28,000 - tonne LHDs and a $ 3 billion recruitment and retention package are the most significant legacy decisions that I leave Australia .
I thank then Prime Minister John Howard and then Treasurer Peter Costello for their belief in those decisions and for their support of them .
The most important , though , was de-risking the transition to the Joint Strike Fighter with the purchase of 24 FA18F Super Hornets .
I drove it , I am proud of it , and I was right .
I also record my quiet admiration for a man who made mistakes and recognises them but whom I found , in my dealings with him , to be intelligent , decent , thoughtful and principled .
I regard him as arguably the most misunderstood and misrepresented figure in recent history , and that is President George W. Bush .
It may not be fashionable to say this , but it is true .
I supported the toppling of Saddam Hussein in the post -September 11 world .
He may not , in hindsight , have been an immediate threat , but he was an inevitable one .
To their families , I will never forget SAS Sergeant Matthew Locke , Private Luke Worsley , SAS Signaller Sean McCarthy , Lance Corporal Jason Marks , Trooper David ' Poppy ' Pearce , Captain Mark Bingley and SAS Trooper Josh Porter , who gave their lives on my watch operationally in the service of Australia as a consequence of decisions that I made , that I supported and that I administered .
My life , my attitude to it and that of my country was forever changed by carrying responsibility for equipping them and placing them in harm 's way .
Their sacrifice transcends and endures far beyond any contribution that I have ever made or ever will .
I thank every man and woman who wears the uniform of our three services for what they do in our name , under our flag , in the defence of Australia , its interests and values .
I did not expect to become the Leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party .
I could have sat back after the election defeat in November 2007 and waited .
For my own self interest , I was advised to do so .
But that is not me .
I knew it would be a crucial period for managing individual and collective grief at losing government and losing some of its key figures , embracing our legacy , framing the new government and setting an alternative vision for the country .
I had my reservations about the apology to the forcibly removed generations of Aboriginal Australians .
I respected the legitimate conservative opposition to it in sections of my own party and the Australian community .
I publicly aired my reservations deliberately as a device to bring my party to the ' sorry ' table because I strongly believed that morally and politically it was the right thing to do .
I stand by every word I said that day .
I note that more Indigenous children are being removed today than ever were in the period for which the apology was offered .
Petrol — and Fuelwatch was a crock !— pensioners , carers , wheat marketing , same - sex couples and climate change : nothing was easy but what of value ever is ?
And the cardboard cut - out was my idea !
There are , in my opinion , five key challenges that face this country .
The first is the prosperity that we will offer the next generation of Australians .
It will require amongst other things : continuous taxation reform that is critical to incentive and Australia 's international competitiveness ; a flexible labour market characterised by individual choice and protection ; relentless pursuit of trade liberalisation in the knowledge that isolationism will never make us safer ; major reform of teacher training , which can be done without spending additional money ; appointment of classroom teachers to universities as lecturers , tutors and researchers ; performance benchmarks and financial rewards for teachers ; and quality assurance as a prerequisite for ongoing teacher credentialling .
I ask the Prime Minister also to consider implementing the 2005 report chaired by the late Dr Ken Rowe into the teaching of reading .
It will do more to transform the lives and lift our productivity than any other single measure in Australian schooling .
Also at the time I floated with John Howard , whose blood pressure for some inexplicable reason went up at this point , that in modern Australia , in the 21st century , the CSIRO , which had been established at a time when little research was being done in Australian universities , should be amalgamated with the ANU and that some of its regional important satellite activities amalgamated with relevant regional universities .
I still believe that is the case .
It would immediately give Australia a global top 10 research and teaching institution .
It would drive economies of scale and it would also drive research even more effectively in regional communities relevant to the communities in which it is undertaken .
The second challenge in my view is that of the dysfunctional federation .
The greatest constitutional challenge that faces this nation is the relationship between the three tiers of government , and how the money is raised .
This is obviously quite a different world from that of Henry Parkes and those who gave us the Federation and the Constitution that served us so well for most of the 20th century .
It is now failing us .
It will require bipartisan leadership in a process to develop options for reform and to put them to the Australian people .
Whatever the differences between us politically , it is obvious wherever you live in Australia , whatever your politics , that the relationship between the three tiers of government is at the heart of many of the issues that we debate here on a day - to - day basis .
The third key challenge is that of the environment .
It is time for our generation to begin to live on environmental interest instead of the environmental capital that has sustained us since the industrial revolution .
On climate change , let us not be a nation of intellectual lemmings .
Why introduce the biggest change to the economic architecture in this nation in my lifetime with a tax on everything — massive churning of money through the economy as we emerge from the deepest economic downturn in 80 years — for no environmental gain in the absence of a global agreement ?
To legislate an emissions trading scheme in a country responsible for 1.4 per cent of global emissions before knowing what the three major emitters will do defies not only logic ; it also violates Australia 's best interests .
The dictum in medicine in uberimma fides — to always act in the utmost good faith .
The interests of everyday Australians who want action on climate change but are ignorant of the cost to be imposed on them by those who do know what those costs are must surely be placed ahead of political advantage by both sides of politics .
The fourth challenge is that of the defence of Australia and , increasingly , our interests and values throughout the world .
To those Australians who question our deployment to Afghanistan , please understand that our generation is engaged in an epic struggle against resurgent totalitarianism .
This is a global insurgency driven by disparate groups .
They have hijacked the good name of Islam to build a violent political utopia .
More than 100 innocent Australians have already been murdered in Bali , Jakarta and New York at the hands of these people .
They were murdered by people whose attitude to religious freedom , the rights of women and the liberating power of education violates everything for which this country has stood in its short history .
We cannot leave our children held hostage to a force that they may never control .
That is why it is so important that the political will be maintained in the leadership of the country from both sides of the political divide .
The fifth challenge , as I see it , is the cohesion of our society .
Whether it is drug use , gambling , homelessness or the plight of Indigenous Australia , Liberals should be no less concerned for these issues than economic fundamentals .
If we are falsely perceived as accountants aspiring to run an economy rather than men and women committed to building a better society we will be harshly judged .
If all economic and scientific questions were ever solved , all important problems would remain still unanswered .
I also caution the nation 's leadership as I leave .
We have to be very clear about our values and our beliefs , never allowing Australia to become a country of cultural aimlessness .
Whether by birth or by migration , we are Australians defined as we are by our institutions , triumphs , failures , heroes , villains , adversities , literature and culture .
We cannot ever abandon what Arthur Schlesinger described as ' historic purpose ' in building the future that we want .
The Liberal Party 's future lies in its past , never forgetting from where we come , who we are and for whom we exist .
Liberals gave Australia its first refugee , its first woman and its first Aborigine as members of parliament .
Neville Bonner 's life of grace , humility and principle in the face of extraordinary adversity has been an inspiration to me personally .
As the first Aboriginal Australian elected to the parliament , he considered his greatest achievement as being there .
When Robin the Hughes asked him in 1992 , he said :
They no longer spoke of boongs or blacks .
They spoke instead of Aboriginal people .
Robert Menzies , in 1942 , arguably the most important year in Australia 's history since 1788 — a seminal year for the Liberal Party — spoke and wrote of the forgotten people .
I have said this to my colleagues before and I will say it again today .
He wrote : Salary earners , shopkeepers , skilled artisans , professional men and women ... farmers .... politically and economically they are the middle class .
Unorganised and unselfconscious , not rich enough to wield power in its own right and too individualistic for pressure politics , and yet ,
he observed : ... they are the backbone of the nation .... and in their children they see their greatest contribution to it .
Two years later in 1944 , again Sir Robert , to those who had come to Canberra to form what would become the Liberal Party emerging from the political dramas of the UAP , said :
What we must look for is a revival of true liberal thought , one that will work for social justice and security .
True liberals have great and imperative obligations to the weak , sick and unfortunate .
In his vision of Australia , this country would owe to 'every good citizen , not only a chance in life — but a self respecting life . '
As Liberals we must always place our principles and Australia 's best interests ahead of what we think are our political interests .
In my opinion and experience , one follows the other .
Thank you to my many friends and colleagues with whom I have worked , past and present .
Tony Smith , Bruce Billson , Bob Baldwin and Mitch Fifield , you are men of courage and character .
I will never forget it .
Thank you , Peter Costello , to you and your family .
Thank you for the central role that you have played in making this a more confident , prosperous and stronger country .
I thank you for your support of me and I will never forget it .
I wish my leader , Malcolm Turnbull , every well - deserved success for the future that will come through perseverance .
To my Liberal colleagues , that future is in our hands .
It is entirely in our hands .
I also thank Prime Minister Rudd for the considerable courtesies shown to me since we ended hostilities as political leaders .
I thank the Prime Minister also for his commitment to screen every newborn baby for deafness .
If we choose to do so , we can set a vision for our country where every child born profoundly deaf can , with a cochlear implant — if that is what their parents choose — and an appropriate program be able to hear , speak and be fully integrated into a normal school by the time they start at the age of five .
A previous prime minister once said ' no child would live in poverty ' .
All of us support that aspiration but , as Christ himself recognised , there would always be poor .
But this is something that we can do .
There is not a lot of money involved .
Most of it is already in the system .
It requires political will and it also requires a good heart .
I know on this issue especially you have both .
I am asked at the moment — and , Peter Costello , you would be asked the same — whether I would encourage young people to go into politics .
To young Australians , I say never abandon your idealism .
Never give up believing that you can make a difference to your community , your country and the world .
The way each of us lives affects our world .
You can make a decision early in your life to live in a way which changes the world .
Never confuse position with principle and power .
Arguably the most significant backbencher in history was William Wilberforce , who 200 years ago eschewed position to successfully challenge the repugnant economic orthodoxy of human slavery .
Success , in my experience , relies on three things .
The first is to keep an open mind — an open mind to other people and other ideas .
None of us is right about everything , which is part of what is wrong with our system .
Those who close their minds set themselves up for failure .
The second is to constantly nurture and protect the inner integrity of your intellect ; your ability to formulate ideas and express them to challenge and change the attitudes and opinions of other people .
And the third criterion for success is ultimately about the respect that we show to one another , whether in our community , the parliament or , indeed , our world .
To all Australians I say never lose your sceptical attitude to political figures who think themselves better than others or who exploit your hard work .
But I also say , as I leave , that this country is well served — extraordinarily well served — by the men and women across the spectrum that are here : Liberal , National , Labor , Independent , Greens and a variety of other parties .
I came in with a degree of cynicism ; I leave with great confidence that our country is well served by what happens here — as hard as it may be to see it , at times , on the evening news .
Though some are occasionally worthy of scorn , relentless attacks on politicians ' remuneration diminishes the nation that they serve .
I will continue to pursue my vision of the Australia that I believe in .
It should be one in which we value the health and integrity of human life as much as we do achieving our economic objectives .
We should see that the barriers to the creation of wealth are the real enemy of equitable and fair social policy .
We should nurture the idealism of young people , we should urge them always to embrace values for the world that they want , and not just to accept values for the world they think that they are going to get .
Loading Every Australian should know that he or she will be cared for , but in return we expect every Australian to make a contribution to this society from which we all derive a benefit .
Ultimately , we should strive to be an outward - looking , intensely competitive , compassionate country , reconciled with its Indigenous history and imbued with values of hard work , self - sacrifice , tolerance and courage .
Finally — I know you are thinking it : ' He has n't mentioned his wife ' — I thank my wife , Gillian and my daughter , Rebecca .
Gillian endured much on my behalf in the service of my electorate and of Australia .
After losing the Liberal leadership last year , she remarked in a typically understated way , ' It 's not a positive working environment . '
Gillian , for your support , encouragement , love , belief and balanced wisdom , I thank you .
Whatever people think of me — and I know it was harsh — Gillian Adamson would have made an outstanding first lady .
Thank you .

Burning Man is an annual event held in the Black Rock Desert , in Northern Nevada .
It takes its name from the ritual burning of a large wooden effigy on Saturday evening .
The event is described by many participants as an experiment in community , artwork , absurdity , decommodification radical self - expression , and radical self - reliance .
Each year , the event takes place from the last Monday in August until Labor Day , the first Monday in September .
This year more than 43,000 participants took part in this two week event .
Verizon cranked up its hype machine this weekend , preparing the launch of the Droid , Motorola 's Android - powered competitor to the iPhone .
But will it be good enough to trump the iPhone ?
Verizon 's Droid is not a surprise by far .
The Droid is actually the Google Android - powered Motorola Sholes , which we first heard of in July ( see leaked pics and specifications ) .
Only this time , Verizon is ready to show off its flagship smartphone , which is set to go head to head with the iPhone when it launches next month .
What 's interesting is the way Verizon decided to market the Droid .
The iDo n't campaign basically bashes the iPhone , highlighting some of the shortcoming of Apple 's popular smartphone , such as the lack of a physical keyboard , camera flash , multitasking or lack of widgets and customization -- which , of course , Droid does .
To recap the key specs of the Motorola Droid ( aka Sholes ) leaked in August , you can expect a 3.7 - inch capacitive display ( 854 by 480 pixels resolution ) ; 5 - megapixel camera with flash , autofocus and video recorder ; GPS ; Wi - Fi ; Bluetooth 2.0 ; and a 3.5 mm headphone jack .
The Droid is reportedly a three - way effort between Verizon , Motorola , and Google .
We are yet to see official pictures of the Droid , or anything except a Novemeber release date ( known since July ) , but the guys over at Boy Genius Report managed to get a hands - on with the Droid ( courtesy of the picture above ) .
They note that it is running Android 2.0 , it 's thin and very fast , and the keyboard is " pretty usable . "
TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington is already calling the Droid " the real deal , " saying that the device " poses a different and more significant challenge to the iPhone than any other phone to date . "
And it makes sense : a great Google Android device on Verizon 's top network could make a dent in the iPhone sales this holiday season , especially as the hardware capabilities of the Droid are superior in some cases .
However , many vendors have claimed to have iPhone - killer devices , but Apple continues to reign with a loyal following and the 75,000 + strong app store .
So it 's good to see the Verizon Droid as a serious Android - threat to the iPhone , which would force Apple to upgrade and open up its smartphone in the long run .

Coal 's big lobbying group this August sent workers to 264 cities to attend state fairs , visit Kiwanis meetings and set up tables at college campuses , all part of a campaign aimed at powering advocacy for the fuel .
That activity in eight states led to media coverage , a plus for the group , the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , or ACCCE .
" Likely members of Congress would have seen those stories and read those stories and seen there was support for coal , " said Lisa Camooso Miller , an ACCCE spokeswoman .
The effort came just before the Senate was due to return from its August break and consider climate legislation that is likely to have a profound effect on coal .
But none of the money ACCCE spent on that August effort is reflected in the lobbying report it filed with Congress , detailing spending in July , August and September .
The report also fails to capture what ACCCE spent on television advertisements featuring " real people " talking about the importance of coal as a source of low - cost electricity in their lives .
The $ 302,700 that ACCCE told Congress it spent on lobbying in the third quarter does not include the summer spending , the group said , because by law it is not obligated to disclose it .
Congress allows groups that file lobbying reports to choose from three formats for totaling their spending .
One is a narrower disclosure as defined by Congress .
The other two , defined by the Internal Revenue Service , use a far broader definition for lobbying .
ACCCE -- along with groups that include the American Petroleum Institute , the American Wind Energy Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association -- uses the format that excludes grass - roots activity , leaves out most advertising spending and does not show money spent on state and local lobbying .
ACCCE and the other trade groups say they are following the law and that they fully reveal all lobbying expenses to the IRS .
While grass - roots activities " might be influencing Congress , " said Ronald Jacobs , an attorney with Venable LLP who works for ACCCE , " on the other hand , it 's not captured in the definition of lobbying disclosures , so it 's not reported . "
But government watchdogs find the uneven disclosure in filing to Congress troubling , especially as more groups use grass - roots work , advertising and community - based efforts to sway lawmakers ' votes .
" The stakes are too high , " said Tyson Slocum , director of the energy program at Public Citizen .
" On every major issue , you see sophisticated efforts to sway the debate one way or another .
The outside D.C. grass - roots activity , that sometimes is having the most influence on swinging the public debate . "
" Everything hinges on the impact that these grass - roots or AstroTurf campaigns have , " Slocum added , " so it 's really significant . "
Because Congress allows different filing methods , Slocum said it is impossible to compare companies and trade groups and see which ones carry the biggest lobbying wallets .
( Public Citizen , which does some lobbying , files under the same method as ACCCE and those others .
In the third quarter , it reported $ 50,000 in lobbying .
Slocum said the group does not do state lobbying and does very little grass - roots activity . )
ACCCE reports lobbying as it is required under the federal law as written by Congress , spokeswoman Miller said .
" We did n't write the law , " Miller said .
" Certainly , the IRS has defined it one way and the Lobbying Disclosure Act [ passed by Congress ] defines it another . "
" We work every day to ensure that we comply with the rules as they are written , " Miller added .
Concerns about how lobbying expenditures are reported comes as the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming investigates whether ACCCE failed to properly disclose all of its lobbying spending .
Committee Chairman Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) asked the trade group whether its lobbying reports should include money paid to the Hawthorn Group , a public relations firm , according to a document viewed by E&E.
ACCCE paid the Hawthorn Group , among other things , to coordinate an effort to stop the House climate bill from passing .
The committee already is investigating ACCCE for its ties to a subcontractor that in June sent forged letters to House members urging them to vote against climate legislation .
While the Oct. 21 letter Markey sent to ACCCE focuses on the Hawthorn Group and its subcontractors , the grass - roots efforts ACCCE funded this summer also are troubling , committee spokesman Eben Burnham - Snyder said .
" What are these activities ?
They 're trying to influence a member of Congress to vote a certain way , " Burnham - Snyder said .
" To any common - sense observer , it does appear to be something that 's a little out of whack . "
ACCCE 's summer campaign , called " America 's Power Army , " was run by the Hawthorn Group and subcontractor Lincoln Strategies , which also worked on the effort to contact lawmakers about the House energy bill .
Lobbying formats vary
The formats that Congress allows companies and organizations to use for their lobbying disclosures are known as methods A , B and C .
Method A , which ACCCE uses , is based on the Lobbying Disclosure Act that Congress passed in 1995 .
It allows groups to estimate lobbying expenditures using definitions created by that law and a 2007 ethics reform law .
In general , method A focuses on visits and calls to lawmakers , aides and the administration and " efforts in support of such contacts , " which groups that file under method A generally define as time spent preparing a position paper or meeting with experts to formulate strategy .
Methods B and C use the IRS definition of lobbying , which includes all federal , state and local efforts , advertising and grass - roots outreach to the public .
It is more limited , however , in whom it considers a " covered official . "
Talking about policy with a " covered official " is considered lobbying .
Method B is for nonprofits and method C is used by for - profit companies and groups .
A previous filing by ACCCE reveals how much more it spends than what is captured under method A. ACCCE this year switched to method A from the IRS definition , which it used in 2008 .
Changing methods meant ACCCE reported a lobbying amount more than 10 times smaller than what it reported when it used the IRS guideline .
In the third quarter of 2008 , when using method C , ACCCE reported spending $ 3.8 million on lobbying efforts .
The same period this year , it reported $ 302,700 .
ACCCE switched reporting methods " after many , many media comparisons " of the trade group 's expenditures to those of other groups that used the less expansive standard , spokeswoman Miller said .
" There was no account taken for option A or option B , " Miller said .
" In order for a fair comparison , we decided to file the way other organizations in our area were filing .
In order to provide a fair comparison , we decided to file under option A . "
Differences between methods
When it approved the Lobbying Disclosure Act , Congress allowed the three choices because companies said that they did not want to have to keep different sets of books , according to an official at the Senate Office of Public Records who asked not to be identified , citing the policy of the office .
Some companies , the official said , wanted to file the same paperwork they file with the IRS in their form 990 .
Many nonprofits chose method B , the official said , because they do not want to threaten their nonprofit status by inviting a comparison between their 990 IRS report and what they file in a lobbying report .
Nonprofits in general can do very little lobbying , unless they create another arm separate from the nonprofit entity .
Even if they are filing under method A , groups must report some grass - roots lobbying and advertising , the official said .
An example would include an advertisement that urges people to contact Congress when that group 's lobbyist is telling a lawmaker that there is grass - roots support for the position the company is taking .
If organizations send people to state fairs and universities to drum up support for the position a lobbyist is making , the official said , that should be counted .
But the lobbying reporting under method A does not require groups to itemize their expenses .
And , the expert said , there is scant oversight .
" We can't audit and investigate under the law , " the official said .
" We see a figure .
We can't really question unless it seems ridiculously low . "
That is part of the problem , said Slocum with Public Citizen .
" Anytime you have a law that has no real enforcement and largely voluntary compliance , you 're going to get lots of fudging , " Slocum said .
Attorneys for both ACCCE and the American Petroleum Institute , which also funded community outreach efforts this summer , said the federal Lobbying Disclosure
Act clearly excludes grass - roots activities .
Proof of that , said Jacobs , attorney for ACCCE , is that Congress in 2007 when it formulated an ethics reform bill considered adding grass - roots activities to what would be reportable as federal lobbying .
Grass - roots work ultimately was not included in the legislation .
Who picks which method ?
A trade group for the oil and gas industry , API funded 19 rallies across the country in August and September , intended in part to drive phone calls , e-mails and letters to lawmakers about climate legislation .
Those expenses were not reflected in the group 's third - quarter lobbying report because API files using method A .
It reported $ 2.2 million in lobbying expenses for those three months .
" We feel we 're giving a more precise reporting , " said John Wagner , senior attorney for API .
" We report what the IRS wants , " and for federal lobbying , he said , API reports what the Lobbying Disclosure Act rules require .
" We report it , " Wagner said of grass - roots efforts .
" We just do n't report it under the [ Lobbying Disclosure Act ] .
That 's not really what the LDA is after .
It is a specific definition of lobbying . "
The Solar Energy Industries Association also files under method A .
It reported spending $ 342,000 in the third quarter .
" In our case , we really focus on federal lobbying , " said Monique Hanis , spokeswoman for the trade group .
She added , " There is a tiny smidgen of grass roots . "
The group does n't lobby at the state level , she said , and its advertising is " very , very limited " and usually is done as part of a coalition .
The National Association of Manufacturers is among those trade groups that files under method C , using the IRS lobbying definitions .
It is done that way for simplicity because the calculations are done for the IRS , said spokeswoman Erin Streeter .
The National Mining Association , a trade group for coal companies , also files under method C .
For the third quarter of 2009 , it reported $ 743,025 in lobbying expenses .
" We have to report all of our expenses to the IRS .
We just do one report , " said Carol Raulston , spokeswoman for the National Mining Association .
" So it 's for ease of reporting . "
The trade group does not do any state lobbying , Raulston said .
Grass - roots efforts are mostly online , she said , to save money .

Business reporter , BBC News , Plymouth
As biblical levels of rain pour down on Plymouth 's streets , Ken Holder still manages to have a smile on his soaked face as he cycles though the deluge with a heavy rucksack of post on his back .
He 's been working since 7.30 in the morning , and wo n't stop until 7.30 at night , riding up and down the Devon city 's notoriously steep roads collecting and delivering mail .
And while Royal Mail workers are beginning a two - day nationwide strike , Mr Holder , 39 , will definitely still be working .
This is because Mr Holder is one of Royal Mail 's 29 competitors , and with just one member of staff - himself - he is its smallest rival .
There is only one problem for firms or individuals thinking of switching from the Royal Mail to his services - his company , City Centre Couriers , currently only collects and delivers across three Plymouth postcodes .
I am shattered at the end of the week - I 'm cycling 250 miles each five days , and burning 15,000 calories more than a normal person
Ken Holder , City Centre Couriers
In business as a courier since September of last year , Mr Holder has been in competition with the Royal Mail since March , when he was awarded a licence by postal service regulator Postcomm .
The way this works is that anyone can set themselves up as a courier firm to deliver parcels , but if you wish to deliver standard letters - those weighing 350 grams or less - you need a postal licence from Postcomm .
Armed with his licence , Mr Holder now collects , sorts and delivers 200 letters per day on average , compared with the Royal Mail 's 95 million items .
But while Mr Holder is currently not likely to be giving Royal Mail bosses sleepless nights , he does have plans to grow the business .
' Word of mouth ' " Applying for a licence was surprisingly easy , " he says .
" The application fee was only £ 50 , and it did n't take much longer than a month .
Any firm that wishes to deliver letters needs a licence " The licence is UK - wide , but as the business is essentially just me and my bike , I do n't have the legs - or the time - to deliver outside of Plymouth . "
Mr Holder now collects and delivers the local mail for 12 companies in Plymouth , ranging from solicitors to estate and travel agents , and a roofing firm .
For standard - sized letters he charges 32 pence for guaranteed next day delivery , which compares with 39 p for a first class stamp with the Royal Mail .
" Business is growing slowly through word of mouth , " he says .
" And enquiries have certainly grown in recent weeks as more and more companies are concerned about the Royal Mail strike action . "
Plymouth - based solicitors Foot Anstey is one of Mr Holder 's customers .
' Very disruptive ' Julian Summerhayes , an associate at the firm , said the impact of past Royal Mail strikes had made the firm keen to find a replacement for local deliveries .
CITY CYCLE COURIERS
Full - time staff - One Transport equipment - Bike Turnover - £ 60 to £ 70 per day " As solicitors we still have a great many documents that can't be sent out electronically - deeds , wills and the like , " he says .
" The impact of a Royal Mail strike is always very disruptive for us , so having an alternative service in place does offer considerable peace of mind . "
ROYAL MAIL 121,000 frontline postal staff Transport equipment - More than 30,000 lorries , vans and other motorised vehicles , 33,000 bicycles Annual turnover last year of £ 6.7bn at its main letters and packages business , profit of £ 58 m
One of Mr Holder 's other customers , estate agents Plymouth Homes , puts forward a similar argument .
" How can I say this ?
The Royal Mail has n't always been constantly good , " says director Susan Tamblyn .
" We have letters such as invoices that we definitely want to see delivered , and Ken gives us that guarantee . "
Expansion plans
Another cycle courier business that recently obtained a licence to deliver letters is Coventry - based Yellow Jersey Delivery .
With two full - time members of staff it is twice as big as Mr Holder 's City Centre Couriers , but also only operates in a limited geographical area - six postcodes in Coventry .
" We have only had our mail licence for a couple of months , " says Yellow Jersey director Jonathan Prime .
" We are now delivering approximately 1,000 letters a week , and use about three or four extra workers on a part - time basis .
" We 've certainly had a lot more inquiries in recent weeks .
I would n't say people are unduly concerned about Royal Mail strike action , but they are certainly exploring alternative services . "
The picture is the same at another bicycle - based postal delivery firm , Birmingham - based Cycle 4 U , which has had its post licence for six months , and has five full - time workers .
" Inquiries have doubled this week thanks to the threat of the postal strike , " says owner Stephen Young .
" We are the busiest we have ever been , and are thinking of expanding outside of Birmingham to Wolverhampton and Walsall . "
Meanwhile , a spokeswoman for Postcomm says it has seen a slight increase in licence inquiries in recent weeks .
Environmentally friendly Back in Plymouth , Mr Holder admits he does get tired .
" It 's a great job for me , as I have always been an avid cyclist , but I am shattered at the end of the week - I 'm cycling 250 miles each five days , and burning 15,000 calories more than a normal person , " he says .
" The bonus is that I can eat pretty much what I want . "
To help ease the workload , Mr Holder now employs a student one afternoon a week to help with the collections , and his longer term plan is to consider franchising the business in other cities .
" Some people have told me I should buy a van , but I think a large part of the attraction for customers is that it is just me and my bike - it's as environmentally friendly as possible .
" I 'm currently earning between £ 60 and £ 70 per day , which is n't a lot , but it is still early days .
" There is the odd day I question my sanity , but I really believe the business has a lot of potential , especially as more firms explore alternatives to the Royal Mail . "

So , have you enjoyed the debate over health care reform ?
Have you been impressed by the civility of the discussion and the intellectual honesty of reform opponents ?
If so , you ’ll love the next big debate : the fight over climate change .
The House has already passed a fairly strong cap - and - trade climate bill , the Waxman - Markey act , which if it becomes law would eventually lead to sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
But on climate change , as on health care , the sticking point will be the Senate .
And the usual suspects are doing their best to prevent action .
Some of them still claim that there ’s no such thing as global warming , or at least that the evidence is n’t yet conclusive .
But that argument is wearing thin  as thin as the Arctic pack ice , which has now diminished to the point that shipping companies are opening up new routes through the formerly impassable seas north of Siberia .
Even corporations are losing patience with the deniers : earlier this week Pacific Gas and Electric canceled its membership in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in protest over the chamber ’s “ disingenuous attempts to diminish or distort the reality ” of climate change .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Ohio's governor granted temporary reprieves to two death row inmates just hours after a federal appeals court blocked the execution of one of them -- adding to the mounting confusion over the state 's capital punishment system .
Lawrence Reynolds is on death row for killing his neighbor in 1994 during a robbery in suburban Cleveland .
Earlier Monday , the state 's attorney general 's office asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow Thursday 's execution of Lawrence Reynolds Jr. to go forward as scheduled .
However , Gov. Ted Strickland announced he would delay Reynolds 's execution until March , at the earliest .
Another death row inmate , Darryl Durr , scheduled to be executed in coming weeks , also was granted a reprieve until at least April 2010 .
The conflicting moves came after the botched execution attempt of Romell Broom last month , which raised serious questions about the state 's lethal injection procedures .
" Additional time is needed to fully conduct a thorough and comprehensive review of an alternative or backup lethal injection protocol that is in accordance with Ohio law , " Strickland said in his announcement .
Do n't Miss Execution problems prompt reprieve for inmate
No explanation was offered on why Ohio 's executive branch switched its official position in such a short period of time .
The state was expected to ask the Supreme Court for dismissal of the pending appeal .
Reynolds was sentenced to death for beating and strangling Loretta Mae Foster , his 67 - year - old neighbor , during a home invasion in suburban Cleveland .
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati had blocked Reynolds ' execution Monday , citing problems accessing Broom 's veins in a failed execution attempt last month .
Technicians tried for two hours on September 15 to find suitable veins to insert the chemicals .
Strickland has delayed the execution indefinitely .
Broom will get a hearing before a federal judge next month .
His lawyers argue allowing a second execution attempt would be unconstitutional .
Reynolds ' lawyers have argued the state 's lethal injection protocols violate the Constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
Judges on the appeals court were at odds over the Reynolds appeal .
" Given the important constitutional and humanitarian issues at stake in all death penalty cases , these problems in the Ohio lethal injection protocol are certainly worthy of meaningful consideration , " wrote Judge Boyce Martin .
Judge Jeffrey Sutton dissented .
" Why assume an execution protocol is unconstitutional when one of the humane features of the protocol -- that the state will not continue trying to access a usable vein beyond a sensible time limit -- is being followed ? "

Bordry says the UCI ’s failures may have contributed to the “ clean ” Tour of ’09 .
Photo : Agence France Presse
The head of the French Anti-Doping Agency ( AFLD ) said Wednesday that his organization wo n’t work with the UCI again until it takes steps to correct testing and procedural “ failures ” he observed during this year ’s Tour de France .
In press conference in Paris , AFLD director Pierre Bordry said he was bothered by the absence of positive test results from this year ’s Tour , particularly in light of what he characterized as serious lapses in protocol by anti-doping testers from the UCI .
“ What is surprising is that the UCI does not conduct its controls in keeping with its own rules , which can create opportunities ( for teams or riders ) , ” said Bordry .
“ I am astonished that there were no positive doping tests at this year ’s race . ”
However Britain ’s Barry Broadbent , a UCI doping inspector , says the AFLD claims are wide of the mark , adding that Astana was among the most scrutinized teams at the race .
“ If I were to make a report on the Tour de France , I would say they were the opposite , ” said Broadbent when asked what he thought of a damning report by the AFLD which criticized the UCI ’s anti-doping system at the race .
“ The AFLD were subjecting them to more controls at more inconvenient times than anyone else .
To say that one team had privileges when clearly they were tested more than any other team seems quite ridiculous to me . ”
Bordry said that despite UCI claims to the contrary , he stands by earlier charges that the Astana team was among the most “ blatant ” when it came to delays during doping controls .
In addition to allegations of “ easy treatment ” of Astana , Bordry said that UCI testers failed to properly preserve blood samples taken from several teams during the course of the Tour .
He said that during this year ’s
Tour blood samples were not always kept refrigerated , some riders were difficult to locate and that testers had to sometimes wait up to an hour for a rider to appear after being notified of an impending control .
Jean - Pierre Verdy , director of the team which carries out the controls , said that the latter problem was apparent with one team in particular .
“ It was mostly Astana .
For the other teams it was n’t quite as blatant , ” Verdy said .
“ Where is the ‘ random ’ factor in all of that ? ”
Broadbent , however , said that AFLD doctors were directly involved in most of the testing that took place at this year ’s Tour .
“ We are only observers for the French doctors who do the samples , appointed by the AFLD , ” he noted .
“ We identify the riders , we take charge of the situation , that is we make sure we ’ve got the right people .
“ But from then on the actual procedure of taking the urine sample is conducted by the doctors , in this case appointed by the AFLD and of course ratified by the UCI that they were suitable people .
“ The only tests conducted without AFLD doctors were on rest days .
Other than those rest days , all other tests conducted were by AFLD doctors . ”
Broadbent suggested that the AFLD objections may be motivated by the French agency ’s territorial concerns more than they are by scientific or legal considerations .
“ I do n’t understand where the AFLD is coming from , ” he said .
“ Whether there ’s some inherent problem with the UCI conducting tests in what is the territory of the AFLD , I do n’t know .
“ It would seem that the AFLD do n’t want to work with us , they want to work against us and I would have thought that in the fight against doping it ’s essential that all agencies work together .
“ It must be some political thing , ” he added .
“ I ca n’t understand anyone criticizing the work of two inspectors who seem to be accepted by the riders and teams in the race , despite that we had what was a very demanding job for us and the riders . ”
Bordry indicated that as a consequence of his concerns he would oppose the AFLD working in conjunction with the UCI during next year ’s Tour .
“ I wo n’t be asking to work with the UCI doing the controls in 2010 , ” added Bordry .
“ The international federations must understand that when it comes to anti-doping you have to be rigorous and transparent , otherwise doubts are raised which may not be founded but which are justified by the absence of transparency . ”
“ The way UCI organized the controls was not quite in accordance with the regulations , ” Bordry said , adding that such errors may account for the absence of positive tests from this year ’s Tour .
The press conference is the latest salvo in a war of words between Bordry ’s agency and the UCI that began when the contents of a critical report on anti-doping practices in the race were released to two French newspapers on Monday .
2008 given “ all clear ”
Bordry also noted that retests of 17 riders ’ samples from the 2008 Tour de France showed no signs of the third generation EPO drug , CERA .
At the end of the 2009 Tour , Bordry said the agency wanted to retest samples from 2008 , to ensure that no potential positives had not been missed .
“ Our aim was not to find something suspicious , ” said Bordry .
“ We wanted the security of knowing the truth .
That has been achieved . ”
Sir Paul McCartney has denied he and fellow Beatle John Lennon did not get on .
Speaking to the Radio Times , Sir Paul put some of Lennon 's outbursts down to drugs and talking " crap " he did not mean .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The pair enjoyed one of the best - known and most successful writing partnerships in history , but as their success grew , their relationship appeared to rupture and the band split up in 1970 .
He denied Lennon 's complaints in interviews that he sabotaged songs in the studio by not committing his full creative energy to them .
Sir Paul said : " Oh , he was on drugs , was n't he ?
This is the trouble with history , with journalism .
" John said so much crap that he later said he had n't meant .
It 's bulls ***.
" We were there .
We all enjoyed it .
I never really criticised John .
" I 'm not that critical .
It 's a question of personalities .
" John 's was more abrasive than mine and that was good for his corner of the square that made up the Beatles .
" If we'd had two people like that - forget it - I do n't think it would have worked . "
Sir Paul told the magazine : " The image of John is seriously flawed because he was not the hard , mad man that people think he was .
" He was a very soft - centred guy and we had a lot more in common than people think .
" His favourite song when we were kids was Little White Lies , which was very sentimental .
It was a smoochy old standard that his mum liked .
" Whatever bad things John said about me , he would also slip his glasses down to the end of his nose and say , ' I love you ' .
That 's really what I hold on to .
That 's what I believe .
The rest is showing off . "
Speaking about how the creative bond between the pair developed , Sir Paul said : " The actual reason John and I started writing in earnest was because we'd be at a gig and the bands on before us would play songs we were about to do . "
He added : " Once they 'd done four or five of them we'd go : ' S *** , there goes our set list !'
" I remember saying , ' We 've got to write our own , because then they wo n't be able to access them ' . "
Last week , we asked actual twits why we should follow them .
We received many amusing responses from lots of people , including an unreasonable amount from one Mr. Cargo ( @defconqueso ) who gets th enod this week for both his dogged persistence in winning us over , and the fact he 's actually a pretty funny guy .
Find out what he tweeted to sell us , and more about the man behind the tweets -- all in 140 - character bursts , after the jump .
How he sold us initially ( it was the last one that finally got us onboard ) :
As one of many farts in this hurricane I aim to jam funny , unusual and / or informative debris through the brains of passersby
Furthermore , I aspire to be that single spark from the campfire of Internets that sets your quilt ablaze ( ... in a good way )
That metaphor is one of many with the possible result of the reader sending me a bill for new pants
Seriously , tho , follow me because you wo n't have to stay 200 ft back for fear of being hit w / loose gravel from my rumpal area
@ DenverWestword : What brought you to Twitter ?
@defconqueso : LiveJournal was n't doing it for me anymore -- I needed something faster and harder .
* wipes nose *
@DenverWestword : So LJ was your gateway drug , huh ?
@defconqueso : Friends spent months trying to talk me into branching out ...
In the end I was dragged shrugging and ' Meh , What - the - hell ' - ing into it .
@ DenverWestword : What do you tweet about usually ?
@defconqueso ::
Anything on my mind , trivial or otherwise , really , in between LGBT issues , health care reform , random firings of my brain voices .
It might be the Tourette 's talking .
My next tweet could be something political or ' I farted ' ... depends on how the wind 's blowing I guess
@ DenverWestword :
What keeps you busy offline ( aka in real life ) ?
@defconqueso : Right now I am best described as a fat starving artist .
I job hunt and leave arse - indentations in coffee shop chairs doing Sharpie drawings .
( see here , here and here for examples ) .
Requisite visceral functions and foodstuffs consumption , also .
@ DenverWestword : Finally , open tweeting : Last chance to say something to convince doubters to follow you : GO !
@defconqueso : Wrap Your Fingers Around the Front of Denver 's Jiggly , Bore - Dazzling Internet Conga Line !
( Note : we 're not sure what that means , but we 're pretty sure it 's dirty ... )
Got favorite
Twit we should feature ?
Maybe that 's you ?
Follow us at @DenverWestword , tweet to us why they / you should be followed and we 'll be in touch .

Reporter David Hilzenrath interviews several policy wonks and concludes that the insurers will still have a variety of ways to violate the spirit and intent of the law .
For example :
they could try to cherry - pick through more subtle means .
For example , offering free health club memberships tends to attract people who can use the equipment
Or how about this scam :
to avoid patients with costly , complicated medical conditions , health plans could include in their networks relatively few doctors who specialize in treating those conditions
Some are aware of the problem and trying to find ways to neutralize the abuses .
But , Hilzenrath adds ,
Unless lawmakers tackle the problem effectively , a reformed health - care system could continue to reward insurers for avoiding rather than treating illness
We already know how accomplished they are at that practice , as was evident in the report last month from the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee that in California six of the largest insurers have rejected on annual average nearly one - fourth of all claims since 2002 .
Here 's CNA / NNOC representative Donna Smith debating an insurance executive on the data on CBS Friday .
The insurance trade lobby AHIP ( America 's Health Insurance Plans ) agreed to the idea of what is called " guaranteed issue " , the willingness to sell policies to people even if they did once have acne or a yeast infection .
But only in exchange for an individual mandate forcing everyone not covered to buy insurance .
Big of them .
The mandate alone will be a massive bailout , especially as accompanied by the public subsidies for middle income people to buy private insurance and what are , at best , dubious controls on price gouging by the insurers .
It 's not just that the insurers are greedy -- well maybe just a little -- but that their first obligation is to make profits , not to guarantee care .
As Hilzenrath notes :
AHIP has been trying to shape the legislation in ways that could help insurers attract the healthy and avoid the sick
And , they have long perfected marketing techniques to do so --
From the messages they advertise to the overall level of coverage they provide and the smallest enticements they add to their benefits packages .
Techniques for which they will now have a lot more money to exploit in advertising .
If we should have learned anything about the insurance industry , it 's that they can not be reformed , and will find ways to abuse whatever regulations and restrictions the Congress may impose .
That 's exactly why many of us have continued to advocate for removing their choke hold over our health care system by adopting a single payer / Medicare for all reform .
Rep . Anthony Weiner is sponsoring a Medicare for all amendment that will come up on the House floor presumably sometime this month .
And with the travesty that has been unrolling in the Senate Finance Committee , would n't it be nice to see the House leaders walk into a conference committee session with Baucus and company with a Medicare for all bill on the table .
Ask your Congress member to support Medicare for all , for the best reform .
It might be the best vote they will ever make .
The biggest game development news of the past few days broke at the Unite Conference , a gathering of Unity 3D devs and hopefuls held in San Franciscy this week .
The core engine , which previously cost $ 200 , is now FREE .
Video Game sexual positions journal Gamasutra dished the news in their article In - Depth : Unity Launches Free Option , Announces Xbox 360 Support .
It ’s true : if you go to the Unity 3D site RIGHT NOW , hit their store and ask them if you can pay them any dollars for a copy of Unity , they will say “ No , [ sir or madam ] .
Your money is no good here .
Please have a copy of our software for FREE . ”
Know what else is free ?
Tibet , apparently .
No Such Thing as a Free Lunch ( or Game Engine )
Of course , to a skeptic like me , nothing is free , and this offer is no different .
A free copy of Unity comes with a few stipulations :
the extensions that enable you to target the Wii and the iPhone platforms will still cost you – so contrary to what other sites are reporting , you CANNOT deploy to the Wii , WiiWare or the iPhone with your free copy of Unity .
All of the fanciest features are reserved , of course , for the Pro license , which will still run you $ 1500 American clams .
Something about your first - born .
i dunno .
i did n’t read the fine print .
Sorry , Semiazas .
Where do i sign ?
No Contest
As you know , we bent over backwards trying to win a copy of Unity Indie that the Unity 3D people likely knew damn well was going to become free in the next month .
But we did also win a copy of Unity iPhone Basic ( a retail value of $ 399.00 ) .
i’m just kinda glad that i did n’t shell out for that extra copy of each for our game developer Jeff ( who , as an aside , has LASER HEAT VISION . )
This is , i believe , a very smart move for the Unity folks .
The move to free will hopefully have the impact that Unity is gunning for : a slew of developers trying out the engine now that there ’s essentially no barrier to entry .
And , like Flash in its heyday , to use Unity is to love it .
The tool feels instantly friendly , powerful and full of the promise of making that game you always dreamed of – in all three dees , no less , which for some of us two - dee guys is a bit of a thrill .
Ca n’t I just warm up with two - point - five dees ?
Shameless Plugin
But as Unity removes one barrier , a much larger one remains : the plugin problem .
In order to play Unity 3D games in your browser , you have to install the Unity plugin .
The Unity Web Player weighs in at a very reasonable 3.09 MB , which is not quite twice the size of the Flash Player .
The difference between the two is that while Unity is specifically a game engine , Flash content can pull off all kinds of neat tricks .
People use Flash to create games , web applications , forms , quizzes , entire websites , website elements like navigation bars , ad banners , and , of course , video players .
Flash ’s commitment to video at around version 6 or 7 was where the Flash Player penetration really started to take off , with megasites like YouTube requiring an upgrade with each new version of the Flash player .
Until then , it was always a head - scratcher trying to figure out when to target the new player .
Me : Wow !
Thanks to some new features , Flash 8 is going to save me weeks and weeks of work on this new game .
Can i target Flash Player 8 ?
My Former Employers :
What ’s the penetration rate ?
Me : 78 % .
My Former Employers :
Well , that ’s a little low …
Me : Seventy - eight percent is a little low ?
Three quarters of the civilized world has this software installed on their computers .
My Former Employers :
Yes , but one quarter does not .
Me :
And the people who do n’t are either old or retarded .
My Former Employers :
Go to your room .
Me : I hate this place !
I hate you and your STUPID FACE !
You ’re not the BOSS of me !
My Former Employers : Er , actually …
Me : SHUT UP !! [ tantrum ]
Mommy !
Somebody ’s failing to realize that i’m always right !
That Special Something
Unity faces an uphill battle with its web player penetration .
The engine is not nearly as versatile or as accessible as its two - dimensional cousin , and Unity has yet to discover that magic bullet that will make the Web Player a must - have for Joe Public .
i do n’t think 3D graphics in the browser are enough to compel the average mope to sit through the one - and - a - half - minute plugin download .
So the question becomes “ What is Unity ’s Silver Bullet ? ” For Flash , it was video .
Macromedia searched far and wide for the video technology that would enable them to play movies snappily , and eventually settled on the on2 Video Codec .
That was a game - changer for the technology .
For Unity 3D , perhaps it will be a killer app like Facebook that drives people to install the plugin ?
Or perhaps some sneaky egghead will cook up a neat tech voodoo trick to make the Flash Player install the Unity Web Player ?
Who KNOWS what the future holds ?
( Sandwiches that you can eat straight through your belly - button , i hope . )

Normally , when I admit that I was wrong , I do n’t get a lot of responses basically saying “ no , you were right the first time round ” .
But this time , when I admitted I was wrong about bank nationalization , I ’ve received a lot of pushback along those lines .
Charles ’s comment is representative :
Really ?
How did you come to that conclusion ?
As far as I can see , the “ saved ” banks are retreating on lending to SME and retail , stuffing their balance sheet with safe bonds ( mainly govies ) and recapitalizing themselves by taking advantage of the steepness of the yield curve .
This has enormous opportunity costs for the taxpayer ( these long bonds coupons will have to be paid one day … ) , depresses the “ Real ” economy , and is as close to “ free lunch ” for the banks than anything .
The government , and the taxpayers , bear the burden of banking sector losses and get nothing in return .
A nationalization has the same risks , but enjoys the potential upside .
One key point of my post was that the Obama administration is very good at tempering its initiatives with a clear - eyed view of what is possible and what is n’t .
In the case of the decision not to nationalize the banks ( which , it ’s worth emphasizing , is different from a decision never to nationalize the banks ) , I think we ’re seeing a real appreciation of the breadth of the possible unintended consequences , as well as the practical impossibilities involved in the government trying to run such an enormous banking book with so many different and competing parts .
How much of the decline in bank lending to individuals and small businesses is due to a drop - off in demand , and how much is due to banks ’ increasing risk - aversion ?
It ’s hard to say , but the former is clearly important , and having government - owned banks would n’t change that .
Such lending is normally much more profitable than the big wholesale loans which banks have increasingly been keen on extending of late ; that says to me that they ’d be perfectly willing to make smaller loans if only there were reasonably high - quality demand out there .
I might be wrong , but even if I am , it ’s hard to see how government ownership would change things : government simply does n’t have the ability to micromanage bank lending at that level .
The reason why I wanted to nationalize the banks is that they were suffering from a major liquidity crisis , and they were insolvent on a mark - to - market basis .
In that situation , the government essentially has two options , when the banks are too big to fail .
It needs to provide liquidity either way ; the only question is whether it does so while taking ownership , or whether it leaves the banks to continue in their existing form , in the hope that the markets will recover and they will no longer be mark - to - market insolvent .
The latter is much easier , and is pretty much what happened .
It also has the added advantage that you do n’t have government ownership driving out private - sector risk capital .
As an anonymous Treasury official says in Lizza ’s piece , “ People had money to put into banks .
The nationalization crowd would have had the government putting all that money in . ”
It ’s true that when the government determines that a certain bank is too big to fail , and then lowers interest rates to the point at which the yield curve becomes steep , the result is a recapitalization of that bank through easy profits .
And yes , those profits go to the bank ’s private shareholders .
You can call that a free lunch .
The alternative , for taxpayers , is the possibility of a very expensive lunch indeed .
Here ’s Lizza again :
Furthermore , Summers said , there was a medium - term risk that nationalized banks would lose value , in the same way that the act of foreclosure decreases the value of a home .
Summers pointed to the example of Sweden , which was regularly cited by economists who favored nationalization .
But Summers noted that Sweden did n’t nationalize for two and a half years , by which time the situation had become so severe — interest rates had reached a hundred per cent — that there were no other options .
In addition , Nordbanken , the largest bank nationalized in Sweden , was already eighty per cent government - owned .
Summers concluded by emphasizing that nationalization was a strategy that governments turn to only after it is very clear that nothing else can work .
One of the problems facing Summers and Geithner when they made this decision was how to get the wholesale market in bank debt moving again .
( Remember the TED spread ? )
Given that they could n’t nationalize thousands of banks at once , and given that nationalization was tantamount to an admission that the banking system was insolvent , non-nationalized banks would have found it pretty much impossible to find funding at any level , and there might well have been a much larger number of bank failures than we ’ve seen to date .
The fact is that nationalization is a negative - sum game .
Just because banks are making large profits now , does n’t mean that they would have made just as much under government ownership .
And the political noise surrounding just about any decision that any nationalized bank made , especially as regards pay and bonuses , would have made any other kind of reform ( healthcare , financial - regulation , you name it ) even more difficult than such things have turned out to be sans bank nationalization .
Now that the results of the stress tests have been made public and the debt market has recovered impressively , there ’s a strong case to be made that the banking system is no longer insolvent .
If we could get here without the incredibly drastic measure of nationalization , that ’s a good thing .
Yes , we might have lost a bit of potential upside on our hypothetical equity stake in the big banks .
And yes , it ’s very depressing to see a large chunk of that upside going to the very bankers who helped drive the economy into the current recession in the first place .
But let ’s not kid ourselves that the nationalization option would have been trivially superior in all respects .
A teenage girl whose body was found in a field was said last night to have been lured into a meeting by a man posing on the internet as a 16 - year - old boy .
The body of Ashleigh Hall , 17 , was located on Monday after police were led to the field in Co Durham by a 32 - year - old man who had been arrested for traffic offences on the A177 near Sedgefield .
The man was reported last night to be a convicted sex offender who met Ashleigh through the social networking website Facebook .
He is said to have claimed she suffocated after he tied up , gagged and threw the girl into the boot of his car .
Ashleigh had left her home in Darlington on Sunday , telling her mother she was staying overnight with a friend .

There was no obvious sign of sexual assault and the cause of death is yet to be determined but Detective Chief Inspector Paul Harker confirmed officers had launched a murder inquiry .
He added : " This is a very tragic case , it came about from a strange set of circumstances .
A man was arrested for minor traffic offences who then told the police about the scene .
" This is a very , very unusual event .
My message in terms of meeting people from the internet is please do not do it unless you are absolutely certain it is safe . "
Ashleigh left Hurworth School in Darlington last year after finishing her GCSEs .
Eamonn Farrar , the school 's chief executive , said he was " absolutely stunned " at the death of " our Ashleigh " .
He added : " Ashleigh was the nicest kid in the universe , you 'd never meet a nicer kid .
She 'd always have a smile for you walking down the corridor , she was very polite and no trouble at all . "
A spokesman for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre advised parents to monitor how their children use the internet .
An NSPCC spokesman said : " It is not a good idea to arrange to meet people that you have chatted to online , as you can never be sure they are who they say they are . "

Stealth blades could prove less problematic ( Image : Mark Sykes / SPL )
For all their environmental appeal , wind turbines have few fans in the military or among air traffic controllers .
Strange as it might seem , radar systems easily confuse the turbines ’ rotating blades with passing aircraft .
Now a company has developed a “ stealthy ” , radar - invisible blade that could see many more wind farms springing up across the UK and elsewhere .
The concern over wind turbines is delaying their deployment .
According to the UK Government ’s Department of Energy and Climate Change , plans for over 5 gigawatts of wind power are currently stalled by aviators ’ objections .
It is no less of an issue elsewhere : last month the German army blocked investment in some new wind power projects because of radar interference concerns .
Even in the US , where the population density is lower , the Department of Defense is investigating whether turbines could weaken radar defences .

At the root of the problem is the fact that traditional radar sweeps across an area , scanning a particular location only once every few seconds .
It detects moving objects by looking for a Doppler shift in the reflected radar signals .
If an aircraft flies low over a wind farm , it becomes difficult to distinguish whether those shifts have come from the aircraft ’s movement or the rotating turbine blades .
Concealed blades
One solution would be to require all aircraft that fly over wind farms to carry transponders to identify themselves , says Nicola Vaughan , head of aviation at the British Wind Energy Association .
Indeed , she says transponder - mandatory zones already operate over two offshore wind farms in UK waters .
However , this is more problematic for land - based farms as large numbers of light aircraft , which generally do n’t have transponders , fly over them .
Vestas , a wind turbine manufacturer , may have a better answer .
Last week it carried out the first test of a “ stealthy ” turbine blade , built in collaboration with defence technology company Qinetiq .
It is relatively easy to hide objects from radar by applying an absorbent coating – an approach used to disguise vehicles .
This is no good for wind turbines , though .
“ The mass of the blade is critical , ” says Steve Appleton of Vestas .
Blades can be up to 45 metres long , so slapping on a thick , radar - absorbent coating of paint would add substantial extra weight .
“ The blades flex in the wind too , ” Appleton adds , so any coating is likely to crack and flake off .
Instead , a radar - absorbing blade has been designed from scratch , and in such a way that Vestas ’ existing manufacturing process is n’t significantly altered – so it does n’t push up costs .
Although Vestas is not releasing details of the design as yet , Appleton says the blade behaves like a Salisbury screen – incoming radar waves bounce off two surfaces that are precisely spaced so that the reflections interfere and cancel each other out .
Perfect replicas
To achieve like - for - like generating power , the stealth blade will have to resemble a standard blade as closely as possible .
That must have been a huge challenge for the designers , says Lee Ford , a specialist in radar - absorbing materials at the University of Sheffield in the UK .
“ It ’s not just a case of sticking a Salisbury screen onto the outside , ” he says .
“ They will have had to redesign the internal structure , which is already complicated – the blades are n’t just a piece of metal . ”
Appleton says the new blade successfully reduced radar reflection , but as the test was of a single blade , it is too early to give an exact figure on how much reduction will be achieved in practice .
Still , he says the blades could reduce radar reflectance by an order of magnitude or even more .
“ We could be talking about a reflectance reduced to a few per cent , ” he says .
Stealth blades are not the only potential solution .
Last week the UK government , various wind - power companies and the Crown Estate announced a £ 5.2 million ( $ 8.5 million ) fund to investigate how to bring turbine - spotting technology to radar operated by the National Air Traffic Services – the UK ’s main air navigation service provider .
US contractor Raytheon will work with NATS to develop the technology over the next 19 months , which will include “ enhanced software algorithms for radar processing and tracking ” according to Ginny McAdams of Raytheon .
Sweeping improvements
Technology firm Cambridge Consultants thinks it already has a radar solution to turbine - spotting .
Its “ holographic infill radar ” generates a 3D image of the wind farm 10 times per second , so it can track the movement of reflective objects in the area and distinguish a rotating blade from a fast - moving aircraft ( New Scientist , 25 October 2008 , p 24 ) .
“ We completed a successful trial for the UK Ministry of Defence last year , ” says Gordon Oswald , creator of Holographic Radar .
Aviation authorities in the UK are studying those trials to see whether the technology is suited to widespread use .
Vaughan says that having so many options on the table gives grounds for optimism .
“ It ’s a really big issue , but it ’s very much on the government ’s radar now . ”
EVEN in light of the recent focus on health - care reform , it 's a bit astonishing how little attention has been paid to the wrangling in the Senate over three important Patriot Act powers set to expire at the end of the year .
While some Democratic senators had initially shown interest in using the occasion to review the broad edifice of post–9/11 surveillance powers granted the executive branch , legislators now seem poised to move ahead with reauthorisation absent even the mildest additional civil - liberties safeguards .
The Obama administration had requested reauthorisation of all three " sunsetting " Patriot - Act powers : roving wiretap authority ; license to spy on so - called " lone wolf " terror suspects under the broad aegis of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance act ; and " section 215 " orders , which allow investigators to compel the production of business records or any other " tangible thing " .
Yet the Justice Department had also signaled its openness to " modifications " designed to protect the privacy of Americans and check potential abuses .
Russ Feingold took them up on the offer with an ambitious proposal that would have substantially overhauled the new foreign - intelligence - surveillance architecture .
More modest was a proposal by Patrick Leahy , the Judiciary Committee 's chairman , that would have somewhat constrained the scope of both 215 orders and the controversial " national security letters " , which internal probes found to be subject to endemic misuse .
Yet even the more moderate reforms proved a bridge too far for Dianne Feinstein , who swooped in at the last minute before last week 's legislative mark - up session with her own substitute bill , stripping away even the feeble restraints Mr Leahy had supported .
The reason was the purported fear of FBI officials that these constraints might interfere with a number of " ongoing investigations " , intimated to have sprung from the arrest of suspected bomb plotter Najibullah Zazi .
Over Mr Feingold 's objections , Ms Feinstein 's language was made the template for renewal legislation , and the committee is expected to report a final draft out to the full Senate on Thursday .
It would be a serious mistake for the Senate to forgo a golden opportunity to revisit the broad array of surveillance powers created over the past eight years — at first in the panicked aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , and then in the shadow of a bellicose administration quick to tar opponents as soft on terror .
It is hardly a surprise that investigators prefer the greatest possible latitude in carrying out their inquiries — and there may well be reason to grandfather investigations already in progress under the current rules .
But if the standard practice of the intelligence agencies now involves programmes that cannot proceed without authority to conduct dragnet acquisition of records without even a tenuous secondhand connection to suspected terrorists or their activities , as Mr Leahy 's original bill would have required , there is something wrong with that practice .
The parlous incentive for legislators in the intelligence sphere is always , alas , to defer to the executive : Abuses of power will , by definition , occur in secret — while any intelligence failure is apt to be both visible and blamed on any who had the temerity to call " halt " .
The stage then seems set for yet another show of war - on - terror " toughness " born of cowardice .

Lieberman Marching Further Right in 2010 Subway series : Former Dem veep candidate plans to campaign for GOP .
Oct. 30 , 2009  -- Sounding more like an independent than a Democrat , Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , tells ABC News he will campaign for some Republican candidates during the 2010 midterm elections and may not seek the Democratic Senate nomination when he runs for re-election in 2012 .
" I probably will support some Republican candidates for Congress or Senate in the election in 2010 .
I 'm going to call them as I see them , " Lieberman said in an ABC News " Subway Series " interview aboard the U.S. Capitol Subway System .
Lieberman infuriated fellow Democrats in 2008 by supporting Republican presidential nominee John McCain as well as congressional candidates Sen. Susan Collins , R- Maine , and Rep. Peter King , R - N.Y .
The moves nearly cost Lieberman his chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee , but after promising to be a loyal Democrat he was allowed to keep his gavel .
Now , he says he 'll do it again .
" There 's a hard core of partisan , passionate , hardcore Republicans , " Lieberman said .
" There 's a hard core of partisan Democrats on the other side .
And in between is the larger group , which is people who really want to see the right thing done , or want something good done for this country and them -- and that means , sometimes , the better choice is somebody who 's not a Democrat . "
Asked if he will seek the Democratic nomination when he runs for re-election in 2012 , Lieberman said , " That 's an open question . "
" There are options , " Lieberman said .
" The other , obviously , is to just start as an independent , which is where I ended up in 2006 . "
He finds being an independent " liberating " because , " You 're not tied to a particular inner group and feel that extra pressure to march in lockstep .
I think that the public generally is fed up with all the partisanship , and us against them . "
In 2006 , Lieberman lost the Democratic nomination to liberal challenger Ned Lamont and went on to win re-election as an Independent .
He currently calls himself an independent Democrat , but is counted as part of the Senate Democratic caucus .
In the big campaign in his home state of Connecticut next year , however , Lieberman said he will strongly support Democratic incumbent Sen.
Chris Dodd , who faces a tough re-election battle .
" I believe Sen .
Dodd will get re elected , but it 's not going to be easy .
This is going to be a tough year for incumbents , " Lieberman said .
" I hope I can help him get re-elected . "
In the Senate , Lieberman again has angered Democrats by saying he is adamantly opposed to including a so - called " public option " in the current health care reform bill .
Asked if he would go so far as to " join a Republican filibuster against the entire health bill " if the public option is included , Lieberman said , " Yes , that 's right . "
" Bottom line , " he added , " I 'm saying this public option is so unnecessary to genuine health care reform and so bad for our country and the people of our country that I would vote to stop final vote on this health care reform bill if the public option is part of it . "
Lieberman also weighed in on the Obama administration 's strategy on the war in Afghanistan , saying it is time for the president to make his decision and that he should not wait any longer .
Although President Obama has put off an immigration overhaul until next year , the federal agency in charge of approving visas is planning ahead for the possibility of giving legal status to millions of illegal immigrants , the agency ’s director said Thursday .
“ We are under way to prepare for that , ” Alejandro Mayorkas , the director of the agency , the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services , said in an interview .
Mr. Obama has told immigration officials that a legalization program would be part of legislation the White House would propose , said Mr. Mayorkas , who became director in August .
The agency ’s goal , he said , is to be ready to expand rapidly to handle the gigantic increase in visa applications it would face if the legislation , known as comprehensive immigration reform , passed Congress .
The citizenship agency faces a difficult balancing act , preparing for a potential workload bigger than any it has faced , based on legislation in early stages of discussion that is fiercely opposed by many lawmakers in Congress .
Also , the agency must work to reduce backlogs and delays that have hampered its performance .
There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants who would apply for legal documents .
The Pew Hispanic Center and the Center for Immigration Studies , two research groups in Washington , estimate that at least 10.8 million illegal immigrants live in this country .
But a large number of those would not be eligible for legal status for many reasons , including past immigration violations .

Mobile Development Importance
The mobile usage is increasing dramatically , that most of the big companies are making a massive investment in mobile development .
Walmart , Grigoryan explained that 60 % of its grocery orders come through mobile devices using Walmart 's grocery app .
About React Native
Use of Native Block Components rather than web components
Using Facebook created mobile US framework Reach , and JavaScript developers create native Android and iOS mobile apps .
The Reach Native benefits developers with the ability to reuse code alongside native platform code over - the - air updates rather than through the App Store or Google Play .
Hence offering shorter development and compile times and app creation with much simplicity .
Installation
The Reach Native installation depends on the development platform .
For Windows the node.js , Watchman , Android Studio and React Native command line tools required .
The node.js and Python2 can be installed using windows favorite package manager Chocolatey .
Features
Its framework support all platforms including Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X .
In 2016 , version 0.32 and 0.33 were released making the changes and improvements to the earlier versions .
For controlling the component two types of data used as props and state .
The components are customizable using the parameters referred to as Props .
The parent sets props and remains fixed for the component and if a change is required state used .
No specified syntax or language for the definition of styles and hence is done using JavaScript .
Provides Fetch API for networking
Easily integrates with other Apps
Provides a mechanism for handling gestures like scrolling , tapping a button , or zooming .
The animation API provides interactive and granular control for specific values and LayoutAnimation for the animated global layout transactions .
Divergence Challenge
The divergence between iOS and Android apps causes problems with native mobile applications .
The platforms differ in core functionality like authentication , analytics data , and business orchestration logic create challenges .
Therefore the cross-platform feature of React Native attracts developers to rewrite specific app components .
The Walmart Labs still faces a few problems , so they created a platform team to help React Native , which resulted in the creation of a framework called Electrode Native .
It makes the code scalable , reusable and extensible .
House Democrats dealt South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson a formal rebuke .
Resolution of disapproval passed
House Democrats dealt South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson a formal rebuke Tuesday , taking the rare step of passing a resolution of disapproval for his famous “ You lie ! ” outburst last week in the House chamber .
The vote was 240 - 179 , falling almost exclusively along party lines .

While Democrats said they were defending the rules of the House and enforcing the traditional decorum of the chamber , Republicans mounted a fierce attack on the resolution , saying it was a waste of time after Wilson had duly apologized to President Barack Obama for his outburst during a joint address to Congress .
While a resolution of disapproval is little more than a slap on the wrist , a formal roll call vote like this — permanently entered into the Congressional Record — is extremely rare .
“ What ’s at issue here is of importance to the House and of importance to the country , ” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) proclaimed during the hourlong debate preceding the vote .
“ This House can not stay silent . ”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , who initially opposed such a rebuke , stayed out of the debate and did not speak on the House floor .
And many Democrats indicated that they were ready to move on from this strange chapter in congressional politics .
Wilson himself was defiant to the end , calling the action unnecessary and a waste of time .
He also used his floor speech to criticize the Democratic health care plans and government spending in general .
“ The challenges this country faces are greater than any member of this House , ” Wilson told a packed chamber .
Twelve Democrats voted no on the resolution , and seven Republicans voted yes .
Five Democrats voted “ present . ”
Wilson ’s Republican leaders came to his defense during the debate , accusing Democrats of engaging in a political game .
“ I think this is a sad day for the House of Representatives , ” said Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
“ I think this is a political stunt aimed at distracting the American people from what they really care about , which is health care . ”
“ There ’s been behavior in this chamber that ’s more serious than this , ” said Boehner .
“ None of it required a resolution . ”
“ Last Wednesday was not a good day for the House .
But today is worse , ” said House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana .
Democrats defended the move , saying that Wilson had violated the House ’s rules of decorum and needed a formal reprimand .
“ This is about the rules of the House , ” said House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , who took the lead in bringing the resolution to the floor .
But the Democratic rhetoric during the debate was far cooler than the racial overtones the party had evoked in the hours leading up to the vote .
“ I think there was a racial element , ” said Rep. Steve Cohen , who is white but represents a heavily black Tennessee district .
“ I ’d be sad if any Democrats voted no , and I feel saddened for the Republicans that will vote no . ”
Rep . Hank Johnson , a Georgia Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus , took to CNN to declare , “ We will have people with white hoods running through the countryside again . ”
Hoyer had signaled in an afternoon news conference that the resolution would lack the kind of biting language some had initially expected , saying that he did n’t think Wilson ’s comments were made with any racial connotations and that leaders wanted to rebuke Wilson , but not dramatically , given his immediate apology .
Clyburn today bristled at the notion that he was playing politics with the resolution .
“ This is not a political stunt .
I do not participate in political stunts .
And I think every member here knows that , ” Clyburn said .
In the hours leading up to the vote , Wilson gave little indication that he had any plans to apologize for his outburst last week .
Instead , he launched into a speech defending his criticisms , saying that during the August recess , he had seen unrelenting opposition to Obama ’s health care reform push from constituents .
“ These were passionate events full of honest patriots , ” Wilson said .
As he sat in the chamber awaiting the start of the vote , Wilson nervously wrote notes on a sheet of white paper .
He also chatted with two of his Republican colleagues , Reps.
Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington and Candice Miller of Michigan , at one point reaching into his jacket pocket and handing them what appeared to be pieces of hard candy .
As the vote was set to begin , Rep. Dan Burton ( R - Ind . ) walked over and put his arm around Wilson .
Republican leadership aides said that Wilson had not asked for members to be whipped to vote against the resolution and that there was little expectation of party unity in the final vote .
And while this was mostly a partisan affair , the resolution revealed a deep split between Wilson and his South Carolina colleague , Rep. Bob Inglis , who voted in favor of the resolution .
“ Part 1 : Joe Wilson apologized to President .
Part 2 : He should apologize to House for rule violation .
That would end the matter , ” Inglis wrote on his Twitter account earlier in the day .
“ Joe Wilson analogy : I speed , lose control of my car and hit your car .
Part 1 : I fix your car .
Part 2 : I pay my speeding ticket .
Case closed . ”
But as the vote cleared , Democratic supporters of the bill appeared ready to move on from the incident , which has supplanted health care reform in the headlines for the past week .
“ Today ’s resolution is an opportunity for us to come together and reject incivility , ” said CBC Chairwoman Barbara Lee .
“ Let ’s turn the page . ”

Reports that new city health commissioner Thomas Farley intends to ban smoking in parks has overshadowed another of his initiatives : getting us to take the stairs .
It might seem like a joke to people staggering to their sixth - floor walk - ups , but this is cutting - edge public - health theory .
( One of the first things Farley did on the job was unlock the stairs in the building his department occupies . )
This fall , the city will issue a set of “ active design guidelines ” aimed at increasing stair use .
“ If we engineered physicality out of our lives , ” says Farley , “ we can engineer it right back in . ”
The Benefits
Stair - climbing is a more efficient form of exercise than walking :
Two additional minutes of stair - climbing per day ( approximately three floors ) can burn more than enough calories to eliminate the average adult ’s annual weight gain .
The Approach
The new guidelines will just be suggestions for now , while the city will emphasize to builders that quality stairs increase a building ’s appeal and can help earn coveted LEED credits .
Former Department of Design and Construction assistant commissioner Rick Bell says that other incentives might include tax credits or expedited approvals for stair - friendly buildings as well as “ zoning bonuses ” — essentially , looking favorably on requests from stair - friendly applicants .
Our Elevator Dependency
The first elevator shaft was designed in 1853 for the original Cooper Union .
At the New York World ’s Fair in 1854 , Elisha Otis demonstrated his early safety elevator , a steam - powered version of which was first installed in 1857 at 488 Broadway ( a city landmark , it ’s still there in working condition ) .
By 1968 , new buildings five stories and higher were required to have one .
Forcing People to Walk
Cooper Union ’s new academic building at 41 Cooper Square features luminous , centrally located stairs — and an elevator that stops on only three of the building ’s nine stories .
It ’s not the first building to feature a “ skip- stop ” elevator ; lifts at Baruch College ’s Newman Library and Josep Lluís Sert ’s Riverview housing in Yonkers are similar .
The idea was popularized by Le Corbusier in the twenties to save space by eliminating elevator landings .
Making Stair - Slogging Compelling
At the Soho Apple Store , which features a glass stairway , “ I ’ve never seen anyone use the elevator , ” says Bell .
Stairwells at the Eltona , a housing project in the Bronx , feature glass doors , and those at the Bronx Library Center have windows and an art installation .
Two Stair Strategies :
Inspiring : 67 %
Rise in stair use at a ten - story middle - income housing complex in the bronx after the city started posting “ burn calories , not electricity ” signs .
Annoying
Buildings can discourage elevator use just by making elevators smaller and slower , tactics the city recommends “ especially in low - rise buildings . ”
Karen Lee , deputy commissioner for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , calls these tactics “ the naughty strategy . ”

RAPE ON THE DECLINE RAPE ON THE DECLINE Reported rapes have fallen to the lowest level in 20 years as DNA evidence helps send more rapists to prison and victims are more willing to work with police and prosecutors , victims advocates and crime researchers say .
The FBI estimates 89,000 women reported being raped in 2008 — 29 women for every 100,000 people .
That 's down from a high of 109,062 reported rapes in 1992 — 43 women for every 100,000 people .
Data for 2009 are not yet available .
" We have seen reform in how police work with victims , gather evidence and investigate rape ; we 've seen increased awareness of the crime , and we 've seen better prosecution , " says Michael Males , senior researcher for the Center on Juvenile & Criminal Justice in San Francisco .
" Hospitals now have rape kits that they did n't have 40 years ago " which make it easier to collect an attacker 's DNA and other evidence of a crime .
Rape prosecutions have improved dramatically over the past two decades because of advances in DNA testing to pinpoint a rapist rather than forcing prosecutors to rely solely on a victim 's identification of her attacker , says Kim Gandy , past president of the National Organization for Women and a former prosecutor .
Gandy recalls prosecutors ' reluctance in the 1970s and early 1980s to take rape cases to trial because " no district attorney wants to have a low conviction rate on rape . "
In 1994 , the federal Violence Against Women Act provided $ 1.6 billion to bolster rape prosecutions .
" The level of interest and professionalism dealing with sexual assault cases increased as a result , " says Scott Berkowitz , president of the Rape , Abuse & Incest National Network , a victims ' advocacy group .
Yearly statistics on rape prosecutions are not available , Berkowitz says , but prosecutors have told him they have learned to pursue such cases .
Use of DNA evidence has expanded gradually over the past 15 years and can put a rapist in prison the first time he 's caught , preventing him from harming other women , Berkowitz says .
Many rapists are repeat offenders .
Attitudes about rape also have shifted since high schools and colleges adopted public awareness campaigns in the late 1970s and early 1980s , Berkowitz says .
" There is a much greater understanding that this is a crime , " he says .
Surveys by his group show women are more willing to report rape now than two decades ago because they expect police will believe them .
" You do n't see the nightmarish trials of the 1960s where a woman 's reputation would be brought into question and people would conclude she deserved it , " Males says .
Criminologists say an overall decline in violent crime in the last decade does n't fully explain the decreases in rape .
Some factors that pushed crime down , such as the decline in crack cocaine markets , are unlikely to affect rape , says Richard Rosenfeld , criminology professor at the University of Missouri - St. Louis .
Catching more violent criminals with better policing probably does contribute to the decline , he says .
Berkowitz says he is encouraged by the trends , but " we 've still got a long way to go .
We need to encourage more victims to report to police and guarantee that when they do report , the case is properly investigated . "

The US has appealed for Iran to release the three detained Americans Iran has confirmed that it is holding three Americans thought to have strayed into its territory , a top official in the US says .
National Security Advisor Jim Jones told NBC television that the official confirmation came on Sunday morning .
The US had sent " strong messages " to Tehran urging their release , he said .
The trio are thought to have crossed the border on 1 August while hiking in Iraq 's Kurdish region .
There has been confusion over their whereabouts since .
The deputy governor of Iran 's Kurdistan province said on 4 August that they were being questioned , but the foreign ministry in Tehran said a day later that it could neither confirm nor deny that they were being held .
" The government has officially acknowledged they have them in their custody , " Mr Jones told NBC 's " Meet the Press " .
" That is of this morning that we have that confirmation . "
" We have sent strong messages that we would like these three young people released as soon as possible , " he said .
The Americans have been named by relatives as Shane Bauer , a Middle East - based freelance journalist from Minnesota , his girlfriend , Sarah Shourd , and Joshua Fattal from Pennsylvania , whose father is Iraqi .
The frontier in the area where the trio are thought to have entered Iran is said to be poorly marked .

As the mid­dle - class daugh­ter of a refugee moth­er and a Depres­sion - era father , I grew up strad­dling two worlds .
My par­ents could afford much more than they were will­ing to buy .
Most things that broke could be and were repaired .
My Ger­man grandmother ’s apho­risms lin­gered in the air : ​ “ Waste not , want not , ” ​“ A pen­ny saved is a pen­ny earned , ” ​ “ A stitch in time saves nine . ”
While my parents continued working at the sturdy antique desks they inherited from my grandparents , my children have become the first and last owners of a seemingly endless supply of plastic toys and particle - board furniture .
By the time my own chil­dren were born , Amer­i­ca was flood­ed with cheap and cheap­ly made goods .
So while my par­ents con­tin­ued work­ing at the stur­dy antique desks they inher­it­ed from my grand­par­ents and sleep­ing beneath a hand - cro­cheted bed­spread , my chil­dren and their friends became the first and last own­ers of a seem­ing­ly end­less sup­ply of plas­tic toys and par­ti­cle - board furniture .
I was part of the tran­si­tion­al gen­er­a­tion .
Build­ing blocks were still made of wood .
Com­forters were still filled with down .
I recall the metic­u­lous­ly machined pen­cil sharp­en­ers with ​ “ made in West Ger­many ” stamped on their sides that last­ed until I lost them .
Even the cheap items – the ones ​ “ made in Japan ” – tend­ed to hold up pret­ty well .
Now near­ly every­thing is pro­duced in Chi­na and made to be dis­card­ed .
Accord­ing to a 2008 report by the Eco­nom­ic Pol­i­cy Insti­tute , the Unit­ed States import­ed $ 320 bil­lion in Chi­nese goods in 2007 .
In that year alone , this coun­try import­ed $ 26.3 bil­lion in appar­el and acces­sories , $ 108.5 bil­lion in com­put­ers and elec­tron­ic prod­ucts , and $ 15.3 bil­lion in fur­ni­ture and fix­tures from China .
The man­u­fac­ture , dis­tri­b­u­tion and dis­pos­al of an ever - grow­ing moun­tain of short - lived con­sumer goods has tak­en an enor­mous envi­ron­men­tal toll .
Annie Leonard ’s web­site ​ “ The Sto­ry of Stuff , ” which has gar­nered more than 7 mil­lion views in less than two years , has helped spread aware­ness of that cost far beyond the usu­al envi­ron­men­tal­ist circles .
We can’t , how­ev­er , only blame the quan­ti­ty and qual­i­ty of Chi­nese goods for the envi­ron­men­tal and oth­er con­se­quences of this transocean­ic fac­to­ry - to - waste stream .
For that we can blame the two horse­men of the mod­ern con­sumer apoc­a­lypse : func­tion­al obso­les­cence and fash­ion obsolescence .
Func­tion­al , or planned obso­les­cence is the pur­pose­ful deci­sion by design­ers and man­u­fac­tur­ers to ensure things do n’t last , so that con­sumers must buy new ones .
Fash­ion obso­les­cence is the relat­ed deci­sion to offer new fea­tures and aes­thet­ic changes to entice con­sumers to dis­card their old items in favor of updat­ed and sup­pos­ed­ly bet­ter ones .
Iron­i­cal­ly , prod­uct obso­les­cence was once seen as the rem­e­dy for what ailed our coun­try .
Liz­a­beth Cohen , chair of the His­to­ry Depart­ment at Har­vard Uni­ver­si­ty and author of A Con­sumers ’ Repub­lic : The Pol­i­tics of Mass Con­sump­tion in Post­war Amer­i­ca ( Vin­tage , 2003 ) , traces the ori­gins of mass con­sump­tion to the peri­od imme­di­ate­ly before and after World War II , when a demand - dri­ven econ­o­my was seen as the key to our nation ’s recov­ery and prosperity .
“ In the 1940s and ​’50s , there was a much clos­er con­nec­tion between con­sumer demand and fac­to­ries and jobs , ” Cohen says .
​ “ That was a com­plet­ed cir­cle more than it is today .
When peo­ple were buy­ing things , they were buy­ing things that were made by Amer­i­can workers . ”
The only way to guar­an­tee con­tin­ued demand was to ensure that peo­ple would keep replac­ing the things they owned .
The lit­er­a­ture on planned obso­les­cence makes fre­quent ref­er­ence to state­ments by indus­try ana­lysts and strate­gists of that era .
​ “ Our enor­mous­ly pro­duc­tive econ­o­my … demands that we make con­sump­tion our way of life , that we con­vert the buy­ing and use of goods into rit­u­als , that we seek our spir­i­tu­al sat­is­fac­tion , our ego sat­is­fac­tion , in con­sump­tion , ” retail­ing ana­lyst Vic­tor Lebow said in 1948 .
​ “ We need things con­sumed , burned up , worn out , replaced and dis­card­ed at an ever increas­ing rate . ”
This applied to male as well as female con­sumers , and to styling lines on cars as well as hem­lines on skirts .
Allied Stores Corporation ’s Chair­man B. Earl Puck­ett , speak­ing to fash­ion indus­try lead­ers in 1950 , said , ​“ Basic util­i­ty can­not be the foun­da­tion of a pros­per­ous appar­el indus­try .
We must accel­er­ate obso­les­cence . ”
And Gen­er­al Motors ’ design chief Harley Earl said in 1955 , ​ “ The cre­ation of a desire on the part of mil­lions of car buy­ers each year to trade in last year ’s car on a new one is high­ly impor­tant to the auto­mo­bile industry . ”
Busi­ness peo­ple and politi­cians were n’t the only ones push­ing this idea , Cohen says .
​ “ Labor real­ly bought into this pack­age .
Pur­chas­ing pow­er was the answer to how peo­ple would be employed and have a bet­ter life .
Con­sumers would fuel the pow­ers of fac­to­ries that would pro­vide jobs that would put mon­ey in peo­ples ’ pockets . ”
Since then , Cohen argues , we ’ve con­flat­ed our con­cepts of our­selves as good con­sumers and as good cit­i­zens .
The idea of con­sump­tion as our country ’s eco­nom­ic engine con­tin­ues to this day .
Indeed , after the attacks of Sep­tem­ber 11 , 2001 , Pres­i­dent Bush implored Amer­i­cans to go shop­ping .
And fru­gal as I am and as green as I try to be , dur­ing the recent eco­nom­ic down­turn I ’ve found myself feel­ing that every major pur­chase I make is a per­verse kind of civic duty .
The notion of the cit­i­zen - as - con­sumer clear­ly runs deep .
But things have changed since the 1940s and ​ ’50s .
​ “ When peo­ple were mak­ing goods that last­ed [ back then ] , they were ben­e­fit­ing from the explo­sion of glob­al cap­i­tal­ism and the expand­ing of mar­kets , ” Cohen says .
​ “ Now that we have this glob­al reces­sion , it ’s prob­lem­at­ic .
Where do these com­pa­nies go if they are going to build goods that last ?
How do they prof­it if they do n’t sell new goods ?
I do n’t know the answer to this , but it ’s a prob­lem that pol­i­cy mak­ers , eco­nom­ic plan­ners , labor unions – every­body has to think about . ”
A rad­i­cal­ly obvi­ous idea
Although the green­ing of the Amer­i­can con­sumer has fos­tered some decep­tive green­wash­ing cam­paigns seek­ing to cap­i­tal­ize on our good inten­tions , it has also made it pos­si­ble for us to make bet­ter eco­log­i­cal and eco­nom­ic choices .
A host of clever web­sites now enables con­sumers to cal­cu­late their own eco­log­i­cal foot­prints and offer advice on how to reduce the toll .
These include :
MyFoot​print​.org , where you can find out how many Earths would be nec­es­sary if every­body on the plan­et shared your lifestyle ;
H20 ​Con​serve​.org , where you can tal­ly your water footprint ;
Wattzon​.com , where you can cal­cu­late the ener­gy required to sus­tain your lifestyle .
Some of these cal­cu­la­tions become con­cep­tu­al­ly com­plex as they try to mea­sure the ener­gy required for the extrac­tion and trans­porta­tion of raw mate­ri­als , and the man­u­fac­tur­ing , dis­tri­b­u­tion and ulti­mate dis­pos­al of prod­ucts .
It can all get abstract quite quick­ly , but there ’s a far sim­pler mes­sage embed­ded in all that com­plex­i­ty :
Buy stuff that lasts .
Saul Grif­fith , a 2007 MacArthur Fel­low , ser­i­al inven­tor and co-founder of WattzOn , refers to this as ​ “ heir­loom design ” – a term he intro­duced dur­ing a talk at the Feb­ru­ary 2009 Green­er Gad­gets con­fer­ence in New York .
The best way to low­er the quan­ti­ty of ener­gy required to man­u­fac­ture and dis­trib­ute con­sumer goods , he argues , is to make those prod­ucts not only durable , but repairable and upgradable .
Grif­fith shares this rad­i­cal­ly obvi­ous idea with Tim Coop­er , head of the Cen­tre for Sus­tain­able Con­sump­tion at Sheffield Hal­lam Uni­ver­si­ty in Sheffield , Eng­land , and edi­tor of the forth­com­ing book , Longer Last­ing Solu­tions ( Gow­er , June 2010 ) .
The Cen­tre , which Coop­er found­ed in 1996 , con­ducts research into con­sumers ’ behav­ior as well as the envi­ron­men­tal effects of the choic­es they make .
Coop­er argues for ​ “ prod­uct life exten­sion ” – mak­ing things more durable , using them prop­er­ly , and ensur­ing they are main­tained , repaired , upgrad­ed , and reused .
A key obsta­cle , he says , is the per­cep­tion ( sup­port­ed by pub­lic poli­cies ) that high­er lev­els of con­sump­tion yield greater hap­pi­ness .
After all , an increase in the GNP is con­sid­ered healthy for the econ­o­my and can only be achieved if con­sumers increase their spending .
Coop­er calls for ​ “ slow con­sump­tion , ” the con­sumer pur­chas­ing equiv­a­lent of the Slow Food move­ment ( which seeks to build con­sumer aware­ness and appre­ci­a­tion of food and its con­nec­tion to com­mu­ni­ty and the envi­ron­ment ) .
​ “ The issue to address is what kind of econ­o­my is going to be sus­tain­able in its wider sense – eco­nom­i­cal­ly , envi­ron­men­tal­ly and social­ly , ” he says .
​ “ The cur­rent econ­o­my is not sus­tain­able .
The sheer through­put of ener­gy and mate­ri­als can­not be continued . ”
If prod­ucts were more durable , Coop­er argues , some jobs lost due to the decrease in con­sump­tion would be off­set by the addi­tion of more high­ly skilled main­te­nance and repair jobs .
And where­as the lost jobs might be over­seas , the repair jobs would be local .
​ “ We need to look at new busi­ness mod­els that move away from man­u­fac­tur­ing and sell­ing more and more prod­ucts , ” he says .
Such mod­els might include ​“ prod­ucts that last longer but have asso­ci­at­ed ser­vices attached to them , so that the sup­pli­er guar­an­tees to main­tain , repair and upgrade the prod­ucts for a cer­tain period . ”
This might be a hard sell for con­sumers , how­ev­er .
Coop­er cites the results of a sur­vey in which British home­own­ers were asked what they con­sid­ered the dis­ad­van­tages of longer - last­ing appli­ances .
Twen­ty - three per­cent stat­ed con­cerns about price , while 30 per­cent said they feared these prod­ucts would become ​ “ out of date . ”
He found that con­sumers were often dis­in­clined to have prod­ucts repaired because of the high cost of labor com­pared with the low cost of replace­ment , thanks to the quan­ti­ty of con­sumer goods man­u­fac­tured in coun­tries with low wages and lax envi­ron­men­tal regulations .
When I men­tioned this conun­drum to one of my eco­log­i­cal­ly con­scious friends , she sheep­ish­ly admit­ted she had just dis­card­ed her old DVD play­er because the repair esti­mate was high­er than the cost of a new one .
​ “ The present eco­nom­ic sys­tem does give an advan­tage to the cur­rent econ­o­my , ” Coop­er says , ​ “ and for the con­sumer , replace­ment is often the cheap­er option . ”
That would have to change .
Close encoun­ters of the durable kind
Most of us have had an heir­loom design or prod­uct life exten­sion epiphany at one point or another .
Years ago , along with an untold num­ber of oth­er caf­feine addicts , I suc­cumbed to the then - ubiq­ui­tous ads for Gevalia cof­fee .
Buy a cou­ple pounds of beans and get a free drip cof­feemak­er .
That became the first of a steady stream of plas­tic auto­mat­ic drip cof­fee machines of var­i­ous makes that took up res­i­dence on our coun­ter­top , none of which lived to see their sec­ond birth­days .
Each time one broke , my hus­band and I found that the fea­tures avail­able to us had mul­ti­plied .
We could buy cof­feemak­ers with built - in bean grinders , brew strength con­trols and pro­gram­ma­ble timers .
We had been cor­nered by a com­bi­na­tion of func­tion­al obso­les­cence and fash­ion obsolescence .
Then we dis­cov­ered what any self - respect­ing Ital­ian cof­fee drinker knew all along : A $ 30 cast alu­minum stove­top espres­so mak­er lasts for­ev­er .
Replace the rub­ber gas­ket every cou­ple of years , and you ’ll stay hap­pi­ly caf­feinat­ed for life .
We bought a used ​’70s mod­el on eBay sev­er­al years ago and have been using it every day ever since .
Not every­thing old­er is bet­ter , of course .
Vis­it your local thrift store , and you ’ll be con­front­ed by an exhib­it of the unnec­es­sary and the obso­lete .
Did any­body ever need a bread machine , an ice cream mak­er or an Atari game console ?
And yet , thrift stores are also the repos­i­to­ries of time - test­ed items .
The gar­ments sold there are Dar­win­ian suc­cess sto­ries .
They ’ve sur­vived the wrath of wash­ers and dry­ers and still have sig­nif­i­cant life left in them .
The dish­es may be mis­matched , but they are dish­wash­er and hand - wash­er safe .
And I ’m con­vinced that this is where the world ’s miss­ing tea­spoons come to rest .
If heir­loom design has a line of bou­tiques , this is it .
Heir­loom design has its adher­ents in the design and man­u­fac­tur­ing worlds , too .
Patag­o­nia , based in Ven­tu­ra , Calif. , was found­ed by avid moun­tain climbers who began sell­ing cloth­ing to sup­port their bare­ly prof­itable climb­ing - hard­ware busi­ness .
From the start , the com­pa­ny was ground­ed in con­cern for the envi­ron­ment , and was an ear­ly adopter of sev­er­al social­ly and envi­ron­men­tal­ly respon­si­ble cor­po­rate poli­cies , from donat­ing a per­cent­age of prof­its to envi­ron­men­tal groups to offer­ing employ­ees on - site daycare .
Patag­o­nia prod­ucts are designed to last , and when they do n’t hold up , the com­pa­ny stands behind them .
Its ​“ iron­clad guar­an­tee ” states : ​ “ If one of our prod­ucts does not per­form to your sat­is­fac­tion , return it to the store you bought it from or to Patag­o­nia for a repair , replace­ment or refund . ”
Six­teen years ago , my old­er broth­er gave me a Patag­o­nia fleece jack­et his chil­dren had out­grown .
He pur­chased it around 1987 for his old­est daugh­ter , who wore it until she out­grew it and hand­ed it down to her younger sis­ter .
When she out­grew it , my daugh­ter wore it , and then my son .
At some point , the zip­per broke , so I sent it to Patag­o­nia , which repaired it at no cost .
The jack­et nev­er wore out .
That ’s heir­loom design .
The alter­na­tive to dura­bil­i­ty and repair is reman­u­fac­tur­ing .
After more than two decades in the mod­u­lar car­pet busi­ness , Ray Ander­son , founder and chair of Inter­face Inc. of Lagrange , Ga. , heard a talk by envi­ron­men­tal­ist Paul Hawken and was inspired to green up his com­pa­ny .
In addi­tion to oth­er eco­log­i­cal efforts on the mate­ri­als and pro­duc­tion sides , in 1995 the com­pa­ny intro­duced an ​ “ ever­green lease ” arrange­ment , essen­tial­ly turn­ing car­pet into a ser­vice instead of a prod­uct .
By tak­ing respon­si­bil­i­ty for retriev­ing and reman­u­fac­tur­ing car­pet no longer want­ed by its cus­tomers , Inter­face was able to keep used car­pet out of the waste stream and reduce the need for new materials .
Unfor­tu­nate­ly , the leas­ing con­cept proved com­pli­cat­ed and expen­sive .
The com­pa­ny even­tu­al­ly gave up on it but con­tin­ued to aggres­sive­ly pur­sue dis­card­ed car­pet – both its own and that of oth­er com­pa­nies – so that the mate­ri­als could be reclaimed and reman­u­fac­tured .
Andrew King , a vis­it­ing fel­low in mechan­i­cal engi­neer­ing at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Bris­tol and con­sul­tant with the Cen­tre for Reman­u­fac­tur­ing and Reuse , notes that reman­u­fac­tur­ing is prefer­able to recy­cling because it pre­serves most of a product ’s embod­ied ener­gy while bring­ing it back to its orig­i­nal qual­i­ty .
And it cre­ates jobs .
Here ’s the kick­er :
By empha­siz­ing prod­uct dura­bil­i­ty , ser­vice and reman­u­fac­tur­ing , both of these com­pa­nies have earned extra div­i­dends in the form of cor­po­rate image and cus­tomer loyalty .
In search of solutions
The ques­tion , then , is what would it take to over­come our depen­dence on cheap goods ?
Even though obso­les­cence is no longer a boon for this country ’s man­u­fac­tur­ers , cheap prod­ucts are essen­tial for con­sumers who can bare­ly afford to put food on the table .
If a durable cof­feemak­er costs twice as much as a break­able one but lasts four times as long , it ’s still less attrac­tive to some­one who does n’t have the addi­tion­al cash up front .
Pol­i­cy would have to play a key role in revers­ing this unfor­tu­nate check - out counter cal­cu­la­tion .
Leg­is­la­tion on extend­ed pro­duc­er respon­si­bil­i­ty ( EPR ) , requir­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers to account for the full life - cycle of their prod­ucts from extrac­tion to dis­pos­al , could affect con­sumer cul­ture by mak­ing dis­pos­able items more expen­sive and reviv­ing an inter­est in repair .
Such leg­is­la­tion is com­pli­cat­ed , how­ev­er , by the ongo­ing pres­sure to pro­tect indus­tri­al pro­duc­tion .
​“ Leg­is­la­tion tends to get watered and watered until it gets to be almost a hin­drance to these break­through changes because in order for Big Busi­ness to buy into it , it has to become easy for them , ” King says .
EPR leg­is­la­tion would only be effec­tive if it cre­at­ed a finan­cial incen­tive for indus­try to pro­duce more durable goods and for con­sumers to favor them .
Con­sumers are cer­tain­ly influ­enced by price , but Coop­er holds out hope that they also can be per­suad­ed by hav­ing more of a con­nec­tion to the objects they pur­chase – some­thing referred to as ​“ emo­tion­al­ly durable design . ”
If that sounds too touchy - feely for a cof­fee machine , con­sid­er the dif­fer­ence between a pair of shoes cus­tom - made for you by your local cob­bler and an off - the - rack pair from the shoe store .
Which would you be more like­ly to clean , resole and repair ?
Part of the solu­tion might also be hav­ing more prod­ucts avail­able with­out the bur­den of own­er­ship .
Tool rentals , car - shar­ing and even laun­dro­mats dimin­ish the num­ber of prod­ucts that need to be man­u­fac­tured and place a pre­mi­um on dura­bil­i­ty and longevi­ty .
( This can even be done infor­mal­ly .
We ’ve shared a lawn­mow­er with one of our neigh­bors for years . )
​ “ We should have much more attach­ment to cer­tain prod­ucts but for oth­ers we should see that they are ser­vices , ” King says .
Coop­er warns , how­ev­er , that rental can back­fire in some areas , such as elec­tron­ics .
​ “ The dan­ger of the rental mod­el with tech­nol­o­gy is that as advances are made , peo­ple who rent them might upgrade even more quick­ly than they would at the moment , ” he says .
But even elec­tron­ics could have a small­er eco­log­i­cal foot­print if they could be updat­ed through the use of mod­u­lar design instead of being casu­al­ly dis­card­ed .
​ “ The trick will be to under­stand what does and what does n’t change , ” King says .
King sees con­sumers play­ing a large role in putting pres­sure on indus­try to make the nec­es­sary changes .
​ “ The real issue is cre­at­ing the demand , ” he says .
​ “ I work with a large num­ber of large multi­na­tion­als .
When they assign their design­ers to the chal­lenge – design this for two lives – they rise to the chal­lenge .
They just start to think in a dif­fer­ent way . ”
Ulti­mate­ly , envi­ron­men­tal and eco­nom­ic sus­tain­abil­i­ty wo n’t be pos­si­ble until we become less depen­dent on con­sumer spend­ing , which cur­rent­ly com­pris­es 70 per­cent of the U.S. econ­o­my .
We ca n’t just keep churn­ing out , buy­ing and dis­pos­ing of stuff .
“ We can diver­si­fy the range of goods that are under­pin­ning our econ­o­my and pro­vid­ing us with jobs and some pros­per­i­ty , ” Cohen says .

Marine archaeologists have discovered a 17th - century shipwreck in recent months with a cargo that includes the world 's earliest pocket calculator -- a wooden carpenter 's rule -- while exploring the seabed of the English Channel .
It offers a tantalizing taster of treasures that may lie within nearly 270 wrecks that have been identified , but whose survival is under serious threat from 21st - century trawlers working the busy channel between the Continent and Britain .

The eBook Wars : Endgame !
As the conventional book retailers drag each other to the very bottom in a hilarious price war on unpublished hardcovers , slashing the prices BEYOND ALL HOPE AND SANITY on ten impending titles ( including Stephen King 's " Under the Dome " ) in order to triumph as the most stupid and beleaguered book behemoth ... Wal - Mart = $ 8.99 ( on books that cost $ 30 from the publishers ) Amazon = $ 9.00 Target = $ 8.98 Sears =
If you show them your receipt for any of these books , they will give you nine bucks in store credit ......
Google and the Internet Archive have each announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair that they will begin selling new , for - profit ebooks " in the cloud , " quietly competing for the future while the grey - haired , goggle - eyed American shopkeeps frantically sell - out publishing for Christmas in order to " win the game . "
" WE ARE NOT PUBLISHERS , " Google keeps saying .
" WE ARE NOT PUBLISHERS .
We are just allowing books to be " published . "
We are not airplanes .
We are the sky !
" Apple 's Jesus Tablet is coming !
Barnes and Noble is releasing a new ereader called the Nook !
Unemployment hangs at 20 % ; a pretty good sitting around and reading number !
While everyone else kills themselves to wring the last gasping profits from paper , Google and the Internet Archive are giving away millions of old books for free online , and have announced that they will charge nominal rates for new ones , unless publishers want to gouge customers and have no business .
Normal people are going to read Google 's free books and they are going to reward Google for their generosity by buying Google 's books that are " for sale . "
If you want paper books instead of electronic ones , you can print up books at Espresso Book Machines , coming to a brick - and - mortar retailer near you .
You can't compete against free .
Free ruins everything .
So that 's it , folks .
That 's publishing now .
Choose between Google or the Internet Archive .
At least Google will not suddenly outright own all of out - of - print literature with one grand , multinational " yoink . "
They are going to have to work for it .
Compete .
Maybe Scribd will be able to outmaneuver Google for awhile .
Maybe Barnes and Noble will outfox Amazon on the proprietary market and gain a substantial share , although -- for how long and to what end -- who knows ?
So .
My fellow fiction writers .
Look haaaard into the future .
Ya'll are the ones with the imaginations .
Do you think you are going to get those big advances anymore from Google or some other massive online book publisher ?
Do you think Google is going to help you edit your new novel or get behind you as an artist , taking risks to publicize and advertise your hot new piece of work ?
You are on your own .
And looky here : if your work gets TOO hot , it becomes free on account of rampant and unfightable information piracy .
If your work is only fair - to - middling - lukewarm , it will quickly become lost in the noise , killed by the glut of information and the shrill hell of bad internet porn .
Google is the " commercial " angle .
The Internet Archive is " the public library . "
Random House and the other Huns will keep churning out steady work that can be cloned , copied , and clouded .
So what are we going to do , fiction ?
How are we gonna make sure our art lasts in a world that wants to destroy everything and start over every thirty seconds with a new format and a new design with new extras and new mods and attachments ?
How do you package the power of the internet in order to put it in the hands of your ideal reader ?
How do you make mutable information SOLID ?
I 've got some ideas , but they are just ideas .
The real question is : are ya'll still gonna write if if there is no hope left ?
Broke and goddamned doomed ?
Are ya'll still gonna tell the stories that need telling ?
Which of you can't sleep at night for the buzz of voices in your goddamned ears ?
You will have to pry the pen from Joyce Carol Oates hard fucking fist as the last breath expires from the fire of her raging heart .
How hard will it be to get your pen ?
Which of you would rather be writing screenplays or comic books ?
This is it , fiction .
Moment of truth .
We had a hundred years where fiction was a job .
Maybe now it is something else .
A calling .
Who is here for fiction and who is here for pride , fortune , and glory ?
I 'm gonna just go ahead and draw a line right here .................................................................................. It 's not too late to go to law school .

LOS ANGELES  A position - by - position look at the matchups in the NBA finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Orlando Magic .
CENTER : Andrew Bynum vs. Dwight Howard .
The Lakers sorely missed Bynum last year against Boston , and they need him to play well now against Howard , because having to double - team Orlando 's All - Star means leaving one of its 3 - point shooters open .
But Bynum has n't regained his full mobility after returning from a knee injury and that puts him at a severe disadvantage against Howard , who scored 40 points in the Magic 's clinching victory over Cleveland and authored a 25 - point , 20 - rebound masterpiece last time he visited the Lakers .
Edge : Magic .
POWER FORWARD : Pau Gasol vs. Rashard Lewis .
Intriguing matchup of All - Stars who hurt teams in different ways , Gasol from inside and Lewis from the perimeter .
Gasol was a disappointment against Orlando in the regular season , averaging just 12 points and 8.0 rebounds , but a repeat of those struggles seems unlikely the way he is playing now .
Lewis will continue to cause matchup problems with his 3 - point shooting , as he did against Cleveland 's big forwards , so the Lakers may often use Lamar Odom to defend him away from the basket .
Edge : Even .
SMALL FORWARD : Trevor Ariza vs. Hedo Turkoglu .
Ariza , a former Magic forward , is no longer just a slasher , shooting 50 percent from 3 - point range in the postseason .
He made two key steals on inbounds passes against Denver that helped the Lakers pull out victories , and his athleticism is a key to their defense .
Turkoglu had awful shooting efforts in three of the final four nights in the conference finals , but still finds ways to impact games with his passing and rebounding .
Edge : Magic .
SHOOTING GUARD : Kobe Bryant vs. Courtney Lee. Bryant will likely be guarded often by Mickael Pietrus , the Magic 's best perimeter defender .
Bryant had a 41 - point game and a 28 - point , 13 - rebound , 11 - assist effort against Orlando during the regular season , and he 's desperate to come through in the finals after Boston 's defensive schemes made life miserable for him last June .
Edge : Lakers .
POINT GUARD : Derek Fisher vs. Rafer Alston .
Both will get open shots when their defenders have to help on other players , but neither has consistently made them in the playoffs .
Alston is shooting 38 percent and Fisher only 36 percent -- 23.5 percent from behind the arc .
Still , Alston has had a few strong performances , more of them than Fisher .
Edge : Magic .
RESERVES : Lamar Odom , Luke Walton , Shannon Brown , Jordan Farmar , Sasha Vujacic and Josh Powell vs. Mickael Pietrus , Anthony Johnson , Marcin Gortat , Tony Battie and J.J. Redick .
Orlando does n't go as deep but has received reliable play from the guys it calls on , winning games when Johnson and Gortat had to start after suspensions to Alston and Howard .
The Lakers ' bench was supposed to give them an edge against Boston and instead was a disappointment , but with Odom looking sharp at the end of the conference finals , this is their chance for redemption .
Edge : Lakers .
COACHES : Phil Jackson vs. Stan Van Gundy .
Van Gundy has been criticized by his former center ( Shaquille O'Neal ) and his current one ( Howard ) this season , but hard to find any fault with him these days after leading his team to consecutive series victories over higher - seeded opponents .
Jackson tries again for a 10th title , which would move him ahead of Red Auerbach , and his experience and calm on this stage remain one of the Lakers ' biggest assets .
To win it , he 'll need to find a way to solve the matchup problems the Magic created for their opponents in the East .
Edge : Even . Copyright 2009

The story about Clara was released today , she was born three and a half months too early and she only weighed 0.67 pounds ( 307 gram ) !
Have you seen anything that tiny ?
I was stunned when I saw these images ( courtesy family photos ) and was worried to carry on reading .
But it was happy reading !
She recovered quickly and today she is a happy and a healthy little lady .
It might be because I so clearly remember the birth of my daughter but I felt tears coming seeing these images .
Clara was born in Sweden December 17th last year .
Her father Anders Borg followed her to the emergency room and let his finger rest under her hand – and she gripped it !
The day after she opened her eyes , and after 3 weeks later the parents were allowed to hold her .
Clara at 888 gram ( 1.95 pound ) :
At week 24 she stopped growing and they had a rough time following , but each time the doctors came with grief news Clara gave them good signs of life .
Yesterday she was 10 months and look forward to her birthday December 17th .

British undergraduates are nearly three times more likely to make errors in English than those from overseas , according to new research .
A study of written work produced by final - year students revealed that , on average , they had 52.2 punctuation , grammatical and spelling errors per paper compared with just 18.8 for the international students .
The research is disclosed today by Professor Bernard Lamb , reader in genetics at Imperial College London , and president of the Queen 's English Society , after studying the written work produced in the year by his students .
It will be published in the society 's journal , Quest , next month .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Spelling errors included " flourescence " for " fluorescence " , " alot " for " a lot " , " seperate " for " separate " , " yeild " for " yield " , " relevent " for " relevant " , " introduications " for " introductions " and " pail vains " for " pale veins " .
" There were hundreds of cases of disagreement in number between subjects and verbs ( such as ' male sterility are useful ' , ' fertility in most breeds have low heritability ' ) , " added the research .
Wrong plurals – such as varietys , two theorys and the two hypothesis – were common , it added .
Grammatical errors included " done by my partner and I " and " a women " .
On punctuation , it added : " Semicolons were often used to introduce lists .
Very few students used colons .
" Some never used possessive apostrophes , and there were many apostrophes used in non-possessive plurals – ' the cows rectum ' and ' the harem 's of seals ' .
" There were incomplete sentences , lacking a finite verb or a main clause .
Illogical or ambiguous statements were frequent – ( such as ' Barr bodies can be used to determine sex ( present in females but not in males ) ) ' , ' pass their X chromosome to half their son ' and ' these colonies are then cross with another yeast strain ' . "
The Queen 's English Society blames the errors on a " widespread deterioration in standards " when it comes to promoting the English language in schools .
" We need to raise the very poor standards of English of the home students by more demanding syllabuses and exams , more explicit teaching and examining of English ( including grammar , spelling and punctuation ) and by consistent correction of errors by teachers of all subjects , " Professor Lamb said .
In his article , he adds : " I conclude that many of our schools do a poor job of motivating their pupils to take English standards seriously and are not teaching basic topics such as grammar , spelling and punctuation effectively .
Above all , they are not correcting errors .
One of my final - year home students told me that I was the only lecturer ever to have corrected her English and that she was grateful for it , unlike some others .
We need constructive criticism and correction from primary school onwards .
We need to tell the country that good English matters . "
The survey covered 28 final - year undergraduates ' work – 18 of them British and 10 from overseas ( five Singaporeans , four Chinese and one Indonesian ) .
Two - thirds of the home students made more errors than the worst overseas student .
The Queen 's English Society was founded in 1972 with the aim of encouraging high standards of education in English , promoting English and knowledge , understanding and enjoyment of the language .
It monitors and tries to improve standards of English in the media as well as in schools and says that it will " defend the precision , subtlety and marvellous richness of our language against debasement , unintended ambiguity and lack of clarity " .

CAPE TOWN ( Reuters ) - African farmers said on Monday floods and droughts expected to worsen with climate change have already brought poor harvests , and women workers are turning to prostitution and falling victim to HIV / AIDS .

Testifying at the first pan-African climate hearings , the farmers ’ stories will be relayed at December ’s climate talks in Copenhagen , where Western countries and poorer nations are expected to adopt new carbon emission targets to curb global warming .
Caroline Malema , a smallholder farmer and mother of six from Malawi , said increased cycles of floods and drought meant she was struggling to feed her family and pay for her children to attend school .
Malema said hunger and poverty caused by global warming were leading many women in her village to resort to prostitution out of desperation .
“ Women are suffering because they do n’t harvest more , so women are going about selling their bodies ...
These women at the end of the day are infected with HIV and AIDS , ” she said of her village in Karonga .
Besides AIDS , which has already killed more than 800,000 people in Malawi since 1985 and left more than one million orphans , experts fear an increase in diseases such as malaria and cholera should temperatures rise .
Pastoralist Omar Jibril , from Wajir district in northern Kenya , explained how prolonged droughts had decimated his herd of cattle and goats , while Ugandan farmer Constance Okollet Achom cried as she described the effects of heavy rains and excessive heat .
“ The rich , rich countries who are doing this just have to stop because they are living on our lives , we are dying for them , ” Achom said .
Mary Robinson , honorary president of aid group Oxfam International , said hearing directly from poor African farmers was vital to December ’s deliberations .
“ That is the case we have to make -- that climate change is about the poorest people being made poorer by our conduct and our carbon - rich environment and lifestyle , ” she told Reuters .
The U.N. climate panel says rich nations , blamed by poorer countries for emitting most of the harmful greenhouse gases , should cut emissions between 25 - 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate change .
However , preliminary talks meant to narrow differences over ways to deepen the fight against climate change have stalled on efforts to convince rich nations to make tough emissions cuts and fund the efforts of developing countries .
Africa , the world ’s poorest continent mainly dependent on subsistence agriculture , is expected to bear the brunt of unpredictable weather patterns that could ruin crops , entrenching poverty and malnourishment .
Last week Brian Dunning wrote a thoughful piece about the proper way to give constructive feedback to other skeptics when you disagree with them .
His post resulted in a hot debate in the comments section – a discussion I thought deserved a longer response than I could cram into a comment , so I am responding here .
What I found most interesting reading through the comments was that most people had legitimate points to make , even when they disagreed .
In my opinion this is because we are dealing with a situation in which there are cross purposes or competing , although legitimate , interests .
Specifically , Brian was making the point that as a movement with common goals ( promoting science education , counteracting misinformation from ideologues and charlatans , for example ) it is in our best interest to be constructive and discrete in our internal criticism , rather than showboating for apparent attention .
On the other hand , science and intellectual honesty are among our core values , and these require transparent and open criticism .
Open self - criticism strengthens the movement , it does not weaken it .
I find myself simultaneously agreeing with both points of view , not because I am wishy - washy and do n’t like taking firm positions ( I hope my reputation has established that much ) but because both points of view are valid .
It seems the only option is to seek a thoughtful and nuanced compromise – which is difficult to do , and harder to communicate .
Herding Cats
There is no wonder that Michael Shermer has characterized organizing skeptics as akin to “ herding cats . ”
We as a group are like Groucho Marx who quipped that he would not join any group that would have him as a member .
The skeptical movement , as we loosely call it , is made of people who generally do n’t like belonging to groups or being tagged with labels , and certainly do n’t like being told what to think , say , or write .
We are rugged individualists of intellectualism , and proud of it .
( In fact , some skeptics have even objected to calling what we do a “ movement ” or who bristle at any suggestion of organization . )
In fact , I sometimes get a bit nervous when I find myself in the majority of public opinion on any issue ( not scientific or expert consensus , but mass opinion ) .
This makes me wonder if I am adequately informed and have thought through my opinions , or just absorbed them from the culture .
I ’m not saying the public is always wrong , but rather admitting the tendency to take pride in having a minority opinion that was earned through careful study and consideration .
Before anyone bothers to accuse me of it – yes , this is intellectual elitism , but in a good way – valuing intellect and hard work .
This is no different than valuing athletic or artistic achievements earned through skill and hard work .
The point of this is to paint the context of the debate prompted by Brian ’s post – skeptics value their intellectual independence .
We also recognize that constructive criticism is vital to science and any open intellectual pursuit .
All Together Now
But at the same time we are not just sitting around in our virtual drawing rooms contemplating abstract concepts .
We are trying to change the world , to make it a better place , to raise the level of scientific understanding and appreciation among the public , and to counter anti-scientific agendas from ideologues and the purveyors of pseudoscience .
We are trying to do stuff , together .
In my opinion this makes us colleagues .
Obviously this is a continuum , and not everyone who reads a skeptical blog is engaged in the skeptical movement .
But , if you have a skeptical blog , a podcast , run local meetings , post you - tube videos , or whatever – to some extent , you are a colleague in the skeptical movement .
In my opinion , it is appropriate for colleagues to extend to each other a certain amount of courtesy .
It is certainly not “ required ” ( whatever that could mean in this context ) but does reflect a certain amount of savvy and maturity .
I will tell you specifically how I typically extend courtesy to my skeptical colleagues .
When the Bill Maher - AAI controversy reared its ugly head , I did not immediately fire off a scathing criticism of the AAI ( who I actually consider a tangential colleague , as they are an atheist and not strictly skeptical group , but in any case ) .
I had a discussion with some other colleagues about how to respond .
And prior to any public response we wrote to Richard Dawkins and the AAI to get their side of the story and give them a chance to respond .
I then publicly come out against the AAI for giving Maher a “ science ” award only after they had a chance to respond to our privately expressed concerns .
As a general rule I will always try to give constructive feedback to my fellow skeptics before going public with criticism .
Venue also plays a role – if we are having a public conversation ( on a forum , in blog comments ) I wo n’t censor the dynamic back and forth .
Another aspect of courtesy is to give each other a little benefit of the doubt .
I wo n’t immediately assume the worst about a colleague simply because they get something wrong and start accusing them of not being skeptical .
I admit , I find those accusations the most counterproductive .
I will simply assume that they are reasonable and open , and present them with evidence or arguments of which they might not be aware .
I treat them as I would want to be treated – not publicly swat them down the moment they step over some imaginary line .
Others have extended this courtesy to me also – and it can be public , as long as it ’s polite and not an attack .
I frequently make factual errors in my blog , and have had colleagues point out these errors in the comments section – to which I respond – thanks , I have made the appropriate fixes .
It ’s all good .
But I would have been pissed if they instead wrote an attacking blog accusing me of deliberately omitting information in order to promote my ideology , or of generally being a bad skeptic .
That has happened to me also , but not by anyone I respect .
That is what the jerks over at the Discovery Institute or Age of Autism do – not us .
Further I try to have the humility to consider that maybe I am wrong .
And so my initial contact with my skeptical colleague is more to ask questions and gather information , to discuss the question with them to see what is correct , not just assume I am right and they are wrong .
I am also not pretending to be perfect in this regard .
I am sure I stepped on some toes over the years – I produce so much unscripted content that it ’s bound to happen .
But these are the ideals of courtesy I strive for .
Some of the commenters to Brian ’s blog pointed out that they do n’t feel like colleagues – like those of us who are more prominent in the skeptical movement are inaccessible .
I can understand why someone might assume this perspective .
It is a natural default perspective to take .
I certainly do n’t feel as if I can shoot off an e-mail to Bill Maher and expect that he will read it and respond .
But I will say that the skeptical movement is small and intimate as movements go .
I know we all try to be as accessible as possible .
I read every e-mail I get and make a priority of responding to polite constructive criticism .
So partly my answer is – you are a colleague if you act and behave like one , and we are likely to treat you accordingly .
Yes , I am overloaded with e-mails and comments to monitor , so do n’t take it personally if I do n’t immediately respond to an e-mail .
Have some patience .
But generally the skeptics I know are engaged in activist skepticism because they like communicating , and they genuinely want to be open and accessible .
But on the other hand
But while we are being polite to each other , we should also be uncompromising when it comes to factual accuracy .
No one is suggesting otherwise , and Brian was explicit on this point .
Open discussion , even conflict and disagreement , is a good thing .
It is part of science and skepticism , and it makes our movement intellectually healthy .
I also think it is OK to show this to the public , and perhaps I differ a bit from Brian here .
I do n’t think a united front is as important as a collegial front .
It might even be to our advantage to show that we happily and openly disagree and correct each other .
Rather , I think colleagues should not attack each other in public without fair warning .
There may be a fuzzy line there , but one worth contemplating .
Synthesis
This is a complex issue and I welcome the discussion that Brian ’s post has prompted .
It reflects the mixed feedback I have received over the years .
To summarize what I think are the main points :
Scientific skeptics are an intellectually diverse group .
This diversity is welcome and a sign of the intellectual health and openness of skepticism as a philosophy .
Generally we welcome open self - criticism in the spirit of scientific methodology , honesty , transparency , and valuing truth over conformity .
Individual skeptics have a variety of relationships and attitudes toward organized skepticism .
Like it or not , there is a skeptical movement .
Humans are political and social animals and we instinctively organize ourselves as a way to pursue common goals and promote ( or at least defend ) a common world view .
If you want to function as a member of the skeptical movement , your colleagues will likely expect a certain amount of common courtesy ( just like in any social construct ) .
This means exercising some maturity and humility and keeping criticism constructive .
It does not mean censoring legitimate criticism or alternate or even minority viewpoints .
Of course , this is just my opinion .
A Harvard psych study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology shows that when people are present during torture , they gradually come to believe the torture victim is guilty as a way of assuaging their consciences for their complicity in torture :
Participants in the study met a woman suspected of cheating to win money .
The woman was then " tortured " by having her hand immersed in ice water while study participants listened to the session over an intercom .
She never confessed to anything , but the more she suffered during the torture , the guiltier she was perceived to be …
" Our research suggests that torture may not uncover guilt so much as lead to its perception , " says Gray .
" It is as though people who know of the victim 's pain must somehow convince themselves that it was a good idea — and so come to believe that the person who was tortured deserved it . "
Not all torture victims appear guilty , however .
When participants in the study only listened to a recording of a previous torture session — rather than taking part as witnesses of ongoing torture — they saw the victim who expressed more pain as less guilty .
Gray explains the different results as arising from different levels of complicity .
" Those who feel complicit with the torture have a need to justify the torture , and so link the victim 's pain to blame , " says Gray .
" On the other hand , those distant from torture have no need to justify it and so can sympathize with the suffering of the victim , linking pain to innocence . "
As promised earlier , here are a handful of excerpts from David Stern 's favorite book , Blowing the Whistle , by Tim Donaghy .

On gambling refs :
To have a little fun at the expense of the worst troublemakers , the referees working the game would sometimes make a modest friendly wager amongst themselves : first ref to give one of the bad boys a technical foul would n't have to tip the ball boy that night .
In the NBA , ball boys set up the referees ' locker room and keep it stocked with food and beer for the postgame meal .
We usually ran the kid ragged with a variety of personal requests and then slipped him a $ 20 bill .
Technically , the winner of the bet won twice — he did n't have to pay the kid and he got to call a T on Mr. Foul - Mouthed Big - Shot Du Jour .
After the opening tip , it was hilarious as the three of us immediately focused our full attention on the intended victim , waiting for something , anything , to justify a technical foul .
If the guy so much as looked at one of us and mumbled , we rang him up .
Later in the referees ' locker room , we would down a couple of brews , eat some chicken wings , and laugh like hell .
We had another variation of this gag simply referred to as the " first foul of the game " bet .
While still in the locker room before tip - off , we would make a wager on which of us would call the game 's first foul .
That referee would either have to pay the ball boy or pick up the dinner tab for the other two referees .
Sometimes , the ante would be $ 50 a guy .
Like the technical foul bet , it was hilarious — only this time we were testing each other 's nerves to see who had the guts to hold out the longest before calling a personal foul .
There were occasions when we would hold back for two or three minutes — an eternity in an NBA game — before blowing the whistle .
It did n't matter if bodies were flying all over the place ; no fouls were called because no one wanted to lose the bet .
We played this little game during the regular season and summer league .
After a game , all three refs would gather around the VCR and watch a replay of the game .
Early in the contest , the announcers would say , " Holy cow !
They 're really letting them play tonight ! "
If they only knew ...
During one particular summer game , Duke Callahan , Mark Wunderlich , and I made it to the three - minute mark in the first quarter without calling a foul .
We were running up and down the court , laughing our asses off as the players got hammered with no whistles .
The players were exhausted from the nonstop running when Callahan finally called the first foul because Mikki Moore of the New Jersey Nets literally tackled an opposing player right in front of him .
Too bad for Callahan — he lost the bet .
I became so good at this game that if an obvious foul was committed right in front of me , I would call a travel or a three - second violation instead .
Those violations are not personal fouls , so I was still in the running to win the bet .
The players would look at me with disbelief on their faces as if to say , " What the hell was that ? "

On star treatment :
Relationships between NBA players and referees were generally all over the board — love , hate , and everything in - between .
Some players , even very good ones , were targeted by referees and the league because they were too talented for their own good .
Raja Bell , formerly of the Phoenix Suns and now a member of the Charlotte Bobcats , was one of those players .
A defensive specialist throughout his career , Bell had a reputation for being a " star stopper . "
His defensive skills were so razor sharp that he could shut down a superstar , or at least make him work for his points .
Kobe Bryant was often frustrated by Bell 's tenacity on defense .
Let 's face it , no one completely shuts down a player of Kobe 's caliber , but Bell could frustrate Kobe , take him out of his game , and interrupt his rhythm .
You would think that the NBA would love a guy who plays such great defense .
Think again !
Star stoppers hurt the promotion of marquee players .
Fans do n't pay high prices to see players like Raja Bell — they pay to see superstars like Kobe Bryant score 40 points .
Basketball purists like to see good defense , but the NBA wants the big names to score big points .
If a player of Kobe 's stature collides with the likes of Raja Bell , the call will almost always go for Kobe and against Bell .
As part of our ongoing training and game preparation , NBA referees regularly receive game - action video tape from the league office .
Over the years , I have reviewed many recorded hours of video involving Raja Bell .
The footage I analyzed usually illustrated fouls being called against Bell , rarely for him .
The message was subtle but clear — call fouls against the star stopper because he 's hurting the game .
If Kobe Bryant had two fouls in the first or second quarter and went to the bench , one referee would tell the other two , " Kobe 's got two fouls .
Let 's make sure that if we call a foul on him , it 's an obvious foul , because otherwise he 's gonna go back to the bench .
If he is involved in a play where a foul is called , give the foul to another player . "
Similarly , when games got physically rough , we would huddle up and agree to tighten the game up .
So we started calling fouls on guys who did n't really matter — " ticky - tack " or " touch " fouls where one player just touched another but did n't really impede his progress .
Under regular circumstances these would n't be fouls , but after a skirmish we wanted to regain control .
We would never call these types of fouls on superstars , just on the average players who did n't have star status .
It was important to keep the stars on the floor .
Allen Iverson provides a good example of a player who generated strong reaction , both positive and negative , within the corps of NBA referees .
For instance , veteran referee Steve Javie hated Allen Iverson and was loathe [ sic ] to give him a favorable call .
If Javie was on the court when Iverson was playing , I would always bet on the other team to win or at least cover the spread .
No matter how many times Iverson hit the floor , he rarely saw the foul line .
By contrast , referee Joe Crawford had a grandson who idolized Iverson .
I once saw Crawford bring the boy out of the stands and onto the floor during warm - ups to meet the superstar .
Iverson and Crawford 's grandson were standing there , shaking hands , smiling , talking about all kinds of things .
If Joe Crawford was on the court , I was pretty sure Iverson 's team would win or at least cover the spread .
Madison Square Garden was the place to be for a marquee matchup between the Miami Heat and New York Knicks .
I worked the game with Derrick Stafford and Gary Zielinski , knowing that the Knicks were a sure bet to get favorable treatment that night .
Derrick Stafford had a close relationship with Knicks coach Isiah Thomas , and he despised Heat coach Pat Riley .
I picked the Knicks without batting an eye and settled in for a roller - coaster ride on the court .
During pregame warm -ups , Shaquille O'Neal approached Stafford and asked him to let some air out of the ball .
" Is this the game ball ? " O'Neal asked .
" It 's too hard .
C'mon , D , let a little air out of it . "
Stafford then summoned one of the ball boys , asked for an air needle , and let some air out of the ball , getting a big wink and a smile from O'Neal .

On makeup calls :
I remember one nightmarish game I worked with Joe Crawford and Phil Robinson .
Minnesota and New Orleans were in a tight game going into the last minute , and Crawford told us to make sure that we were 100 percent sure of the call every time we blew the whistle .
When play resumed , Minnesota coach Flip Saunders started yelling at us to make a call .
Robinson got intimidated and blew the whistle on New Orleans .
The only problem was it was n't the right call .
Tim Floyd , the Hornets ' coach , went nuts .
He stormed the court and kicked the ball into the top row of the stadium .
Robinson had to throw him out , and Minnesota won the game . [...]
Later that week , Ronnie Nunn told me that we could have made something up at the other end against Minnesota to even things out .
He even got specific — maybe we should have considered calling a traveling violation on Kevin Garnett .
Talk about the politics of the game !
Of course the official statement from the league office will always read , " There is no such thing as a makeup call . "

On his fellow referees :
Dick Bavetta
Crawford wanted the game over quickly so he could kick back , relax , and have a beer ; [ Dick Bavetta ] wanted it to keep going so he could hear his name on TV .
He actually paid an American Airlines employee to watch all the games he worked and write down everything the TV commentators said about him .
No matter how late the game was over , he'd wake her up for a full report .
He loved the attention .
That very first time Jack and I bet on an NBA game , Dick was on the court .
The team we picked lost the game , but it covered the large point spread and that 's how we won the money .
Because of the matchup that night , I had some notion of who might win the game , but that 's not why I was confident enough to pull the trigger and pick the other team .
The real reason I picked the losing team was that I was just about certain they would cover the spread , no matter how badly they played .
That is where Dick Bavetta comes into the picture .
From my earliest involvement with Bavetta , I learned that he likes to keep games close , and that when a team gets down by double - digit points , he helps the players save face .
He accomplishes this act of mercy by quietly , and frequently , blowing the whistle on the team that 's having the better night .
Team fouls suddenly become one - sided between the contestants , and the score begins to tighten up .
That 's the way Dick Bavetta referees a game — and everyone in the league knew it .
Fellow referee Danny Crawford attended Michael Jordan's Flight School Camp years ago and later told me that he had long conversations with other referees and NBA players about how Bavetta propped up weak teams .
Danny told me that Jordan himself said that everyone in the league knew that Bavetta cheated in games and that the players and coaches just hoped he would be cheating for them on game night .
Cheating ?
That 's a very strong word to use in any sentence that includes the name Dick Bavetta .
Is the conscious act of helping a team crawl back into a contest " cheating " ?
The credo of referees from high school to the NBA is " call them like you see them . "
Of course , that 's a lot different than purposely calling more fouls against one team as opposed to another .
Did Bavetta have a hidden agenda ?
Or was he the ultimate company man , making sure the NBA and its fans got a competitive game most times he was on
the court ?
Studying under Dick Bavetta for 13 years was like pursuing a graduate degree in advanced game manipulation .
He knew how to marshal the tempo and tone of a game better than any referee in the league , by far .
He also knew how to take subtle — and not so subtle — cues from the NBA front office and extend a playoff series or , worse yet , change the complexion of that series .
The 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings presents a stunning example of game and series manipulation at its ugliest .
As the teams prepared for Game 6 at the Staples Center , Sacramento had a 3 – 2 lead in the series .
The referees assigned to work Game 6 were Dick Bavetta , Bob Delaney , and Ted Bernhardt .
As soon as the referees for the game were chosen , the rest of us knew immediately that there would be a Game 7 .
A prolonged series was good for the league , good for the networks , and good for the game .
Oh , and one more thing : it was great for the big- market , star - studded Los Angeles Lakers .
In the pregame meeting prior to Game 6 , the league office sent down word that certain calls — calls that would have benefitted the Lakers — were being missed by the referees .
This was the type of not - so - subtle information that I and other referees were left to interpret .
After receiving the dispatch , Bavetta openly talked about the fact that the league wanted a Game 7 .
" If we give the benefit of the calls to the team that 's down in the series , nobody 's going to complain .
The series will be even at three apiece , and then the better team can win Game 7 , " Bavetta stated .
As history shows , Sacramento lost Game 6 in a wild come - from - behind thriller that saw the Lakers repeatedly sent to the foul line by the referees .
For other NBA referees watching the game on television , it was a shameful performance by Bavetta 's crew , one of the most poorly officiated games of all time .
The 2002 series certainly was n't the first or last time Bavetta weighed in on an important game .
He also worked Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and the Trail Blazers .
The Lakers were down by 13 at the start of the fourth quarter when Bavetta went to work .
The Lakers outscored Portland 31 –13 in the fourth quarter and went on to win the game and the series .
It certainly did n't hurt the Lakers that they got to shoot 37 free throws compared to a paltry 16 for the Trail Blazers .
Two weeks before the 2003 – 04 season ended , Bavetta and I were assigned to officiate a game in Oakland .
That afternoon before the tip - off , we were discussing an upcoming game on our schedule .
It was the last regular - season game we were scheduled to work , pitting Denver against San Antonio .
Denver had lost a game a few weeks prior because of a mistake made by the referees , a loss that could be the difference between them making or missing the playoffs .
Bavetta told me Denver needed the win and that it would look bad for the staff and the league if the Nuggets missed the playoffs by one game .
There were still a few games left on the schedule before the end of the season , and the standings could potentially change .
But on that day in Oakland , Bavetta looked at me and casually stated , " Denver will win if they need the game .
That 's why I 'm on it . "
I was thinking , How is Denver going to win on the road in San Antonio ?
At the time , the Spurs were arguably the best team in the league .
Bavetta answered my question before it was asked .
" Duncan will be on the bench with three fouls within the first five minutes of the game , " he calmly stated .
Bavetta went on to inform me that it was n't the first time the NBA assigned him to a game for a specific purpose .
He cited examples , including the 1993 playoff series when he put New Jersey guard Drazen Petrovic on the bench with quick fouls to help Cleveland beat the Nets .
He also spoke openly about the 2002 Los Angeles–Sacramento series and called himself the NBA 's " go - to guy . "
As it turned out , Denver did n't need the win after all ; they locked up a spot in the playoffs before they got to San Antonio .
In a twist of fate , it was the Spurs that ended up needing the win to have a shot at the division title , and Bavetta generously accommodated .
In our pregame meeting , he talked about how important the game was to San Antonio and how meaningless it was to Denver , and that San Antonio was going to get the benefit of the calls that night .
Armed with this inside information , I called Jack Concannon before the game and told him to bet the Spurs .
To no surprise , we won big .
San Antonio blew Denver out of the building that evening , winning by 26 points .
When Jack called me the following morning , he expressed amazement at the way an NBA game could be manipulated .
Sobering , yes ; amazing , no .
That 's how the game is played in the National Basketball Association .
In a follow - up email to the referee staff and the league office , Crawford railed about the lack of respect players had for referees and the NBA 's failure to back him up .
Then , in a direct shot at the league 's embracing of referees like Dick Bavetta , he fired a sharp rebuke : " I also told [ Stu Jackson ] that the staff is an officiating staff of Dick Bavetta 's — schmoozing and sucking people 's asses to get ahead .
Awful , but it is reality . "
Crawford also touched on the fact that he was being excluded from working the playoffs that year : " Look on the bright side everybody , MORE playoff games for you guys and Dick , maybe you will get to be crew chief in the 7th game of the Finals , which is a travesty in itself you even being in the Finals . "

Tommy Nunez
My favorite Tommy Nunez story is from the 2007 playoffs when the San Antonio Spurs were able to get past the Phoenix Suns in the second round .
Of course , what many fans did n't know was that Phoenix had someone working against them behind the scenes .
Nunez was the group supervisor for that playoff series , and he definitely had a rooting interest .
Nunez loved the Hispanic community in San Antonio and had a lot of friends there .
He had been a referee for 30 years and loved being on the road ; in fact , he said that the whole reason he had become a group supervisor was to keep getting out of the house .
So Nunez wanted to come back to San Antonio for the conference finals .
Plus , he , like many other referees , disliked Suns owner Robert Sarver for the way he treated officials .
Both of these things came into play when he prepared the referees for the games in the staff meetings .
I remember laughing with him and saying , " You would love to keep coming back here . "
He was pointing out everything that Phoenix was able to get away with and never once told us to look for anything in regard to San Antonio .
Nunez should have a championship ring on his finger .

Derrick Stafford and Jess Kersey
Of course , Stafford had some friends in the league , too .
I worked a Knicks game in Madison Square Garden with him on February 26 , 2007 .
New York shot an astounding 39 free throws that night to Miami 's paltry eight .
It seemed like Stafford was working for the Knicks , calling fouls on Miami like crazy .
Isiah Thomas was coaching the Knicks , and after New York 's four - point victory , a guy from the Knicks came to our locker room looking for Stafford , who was in the shower .
He told us that Thomas sent him to retrieve Stafford 's home address ; apparently , Stafford had asked the coach before the game for some autographed sneakers and jerseys for his kids .
Suddenly , it all made sense .
Referee Jess Kersey was another one of Isiah Thomas ' guys .
They 'd talk openly on the phone as if they had known each other since childhood .
Thomas even told Kersey that he was pushing to get Ronnie Nunn removed from the supervisor 's job so that Kersey and Dick Bavetta could take over .
This sort of thing happened all the time , and I kept waiting for a Knicks game when Stafford , Bavetta , and Kersey were working together .
It was like knowing the winning lottery numbers before the drawing !

Steve Javie
And then there was the ongoing feud between Javie and 76ers superstar Allen Iverson .
The rift was so bad that Philadelphia general manager Billy King often called the league office to complain about Javie 's treatment of Iverson during a game .
Iverson was eventually traded to Denver , and in his first game against his former team , he was tossed after two technicals .
Afterward , Iverson implied Javie had a grudge against him , saying , " I thought I got fouled on that play , and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal , and he threw me out .
His fuse is real short anyway , and I should have known that I could n't say anything anyway .
It 's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league .
This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad . "
The league fined Iverson $ 25,000 for his comments , but most of the league referees thought the punishment was too lenient and were upset he was n't suspended .
As a result , we collectively decided to dispense a little justice of our own , sticking it to Iverson whenever we could .
Shortly after the Javie - Iverson incident , I worked a Jazz - Nuggets contest in Denver on January 6 , 2007 .
During the pregame meeting , my fellow referees Bernie Fryer and Gary Zielinski agreed that we were going to strictly enforce the palming rule against Iverson .
Palming the ball was something Iverson loved to do , but if he so much as came close to a palm , we were going to blow the whistle .
Obviously , our actions were in direct retaliation for Iverson 's rant against Javie .
True to form , I immediately excused myself and made an important phone call .
Sticking to our pregame pledge , each of us whistled Iverson for palming in the first quarter — we all wanted in on the fun .
The violations seemed to affect Iverson 's rhythm and he played terribly that night , shooting 5 - for - 19 with five turnovers .
After getting repeatedly whistled all night long , Iverson approached me in an act of submission .
" How long am I going to be punished for Javie ? " he quietly inquired .
" Do n't know what you 're talking about , Allen , " I responded .
EARLIER : The Book The NBA Does n't Want You To Read
Chapters 2 and 3 give Brown 's diagnosis of the problem .
Chapter 2 is about population pressure on land ( food ) and water .
Chapter 3 is about the issues of climate change , and also mentions that oil supply is decreasing .
Brown indicates that he advocates a phaseout of coal because of its climate issues and because it is the " most easily replaced of the three fossil fuels " ( p. 75 ) .
Chapter 1 is an Introduction .
This book really addresses problems of the whole world , not just a single area , such as the United States .
I participated in a conference call with Lester Brown , in which he talked about the book , and several of us asked questions .
In this post , I will give you at least a brief introduction to the book .
Lester Brown released a new book this week called Plan B 4.0 , Mobilization to Save Civilization .
The book is for sale , but it can also be downloaded free as a PDF .
Chapters 4 through 9 are all about solutions .
According to the telephone call , Brown 's goal is to reduce CO2 emissions by 80 % by 2020 , and more after that .
Brown is very ambitious is what he would like to do , in only a few years .
Chapter 4 is about an Energy Efficiency Revolution .
The energy component of Plan B is straightforward .
We raise world energy efficiency enough to at least offset all projected growth in energy use from now until 2020 .
We also turn to wind , solar , geothermal , and other renewable sources to largely replace oil , coal , and natural gas .
In effect , Plan B outlines the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy by 2020 .
Difficult ?
Yes .
Impossible ?
No ! Page 80
The chapter talks about a shift to LED lighting , energy efficient appliances , LEED certified buildings , electrified transport , greater recycling , a smart grid , and retrofitting buildings .
After describing all of these things , he says
One simple way to achieve all these gains is to adopt a carbon tax that would help reflect the full cost of burning fossil fuels .
We recommend increasing this carbon tax by $ 20 per ton each year over the next 10 years , for a total of $ 200 ( $ 55 per ton of CO2 ) , offsetting it with a reduction in income taxes .
High though this may seem , it does not come close to covering all the indirect costs of burning fossil fuels .
It does , however , encourage investment in both efficiency and carbon - free sources of energy .
Page 108
As far as I can see , this is the only mention of paying for all of the changes mentioned in this chapter .
Chapter 5 is about Shifting to Renewable Energy .
According to Chapter 5 :
With the Plan B energy economy of 2020 , the United States will get 44 percent of its electricity from wind farms .
Geothermal power plants will supply another 11 percent .
Photovoltaic cells , most of them on rooftops , will supply 8 percent of electricity , with solar thermal power plants providing 5 percent .
Roughly 7 percent will come from hydropower .
The remaining 25 percent comes from nuclear power , biomass , and natural gas , in that order .
( Page 137 )
I do n't see any indication of how this would be paid for .
I also do n't see any mention of the huge infrastructure changes that would be needed to accommodate such a change , either .
Chapter 6 is about Designing Cities for People .
In this chapter , Brown covers topics such as redesigning cities for people , rather than cars ; redesigning urban transport systems ; the return of bicycles ; reducing urban water use ; farming in the city ; and upgrading squatter settlements .
He even mentions of the idea of starting new cities from scratch .
The chapter concludes :
As the new century advances , the world is reconsidering the urban role of automobiles in one of the most fundamental shifts in transportation thinking in a century .
The challenge is to redesign communities so that public transportation is the centerpiece of urban transport and streets are pedestrian - and bicycle - friendly .
This also means planting trees and gardens and replacing parking lots with parks , playgrounds , and playing fields .
We can design an urban lifestyle that systematically restores health by incorporating exercise into daily routines while reducing carbon emissions and eliminating health - damaging air pollution .
Page 166
Chapter 7 is about Eradicating Poverty and Stabilizing Population .
In this chapter Brown talks about educating everyone , improving nutrition , reducing childhood mortality , curbing the AIDS epidemic , reducing tobacco smoking , stabilizing populations , rescuing failing states , and eliminating poverty .
Unlike previous chapters , this chapter has a budget for its worldwide goals .
This is it :
Chapter 8 is about Restoring the Earth .
Topics include protecting and restoring the forests , by reducing paper use and by developing alternative sources of energy ; planting trees to sequester carbon ; conserving and rebuilding soils ; regenerating fisheries through marine protected areas ; and protecting plant and animal diversity ; and restoring water table .
This section also has a budget .
About restoring water tables , Brown writes :
For stabilizing water tables , we have only a guess [ about costs ] .
The key to stabilizing water tables is raising water productivity , and for this we have the experience gained when the world started to systematically raise land productivity beginning a half - century ago .
The elements needed in a comparable water model are research to develop more water - efficient irrigation practices and technologies , the dissemination ofthese research findings to farmers , and economic incentives that encourage farmers to adopt and use these improved irrigation practices and technologies .
. .
In some countries , the capital needed to fund a program to raise water productivity can come from eliminating subsidies that often encourage the wasteful use ofirrigation water .
Some times these are energy subsidies , as in India ; other times they are subsidies that provide water at prices well below costs , as in the United States .
Removing these subsidies will effectively raise the price of water , thus encouraging its more efficient use .
In terms of additional resources needed worldwide , including research needs and the economic incentives for farmers to use more water - efficient practices and technologies , we assume it will take an annual expenditure of $ 10 billion .
( Page 214 )
Chapter 9 is called Feeding Eight Billion People Well .
Topics include raising land productivity ( higher yielding crops , more fertilizer , double cropping ) , raising water productivity ( more efficient irrigation ) , producing protein more efficiently ( more fish farms , crop residues to grow cows ) ; localization of agriculture ; strategic reductions in demand ( eat less meat ) ; and elevating responsibility for food security .
These are a few of his ideas :
One way to quickly reverse this deteriorating political situation is for the United States to restrict the use of grain to produce fuel for cars .
Given the turmoil in world grain markets over the last three years , it is time for the U.S. government to abolish the subsidies and mandates that aredriving the conversion of grain into fuel .
That would help stabilize grain prices and set the stagefor relaxing the political tensions that have emerged within importing countries .
And finally , we have a role to play as individuals .
Whether we bike , bus , or drive to work will affect carbon emissions , climate change , and food security .
The size of the car we drive to the supermarket and its effect on climate may indirectly affect the size of the bill at the supermarket checkout counter .
If we are living high on the food chain , we can move down , improving our health while helping to stabilize climate .
Food security is something in which we all have a stake — and a responsibility .
Page 237
The last chapter , chapter 10 , is Can We Mobilize Fast Enough ?.
The chapter starts out :
There is much that we do not know about the future .
But one thing we do know is that business as usual will not continue for much longer .
Massive change is inevitable .
“ The death of our civilization is no longer a theoryor an academic possibility ; it is the road we ’re on , ” says Peter Goldmark , former Rockefeller Foundation president and current director of the climate program at the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) .
Can we ﬁnd another road beforetime runs out ?
In this section , he talks about shifting taxes and subsidies ( carbon or gasoline tax ) , phasing out coal , and stabilizing climate .
About stabilizing climate he says :
Earlier we outlined the need to cut net carbon dioxide emissions 80 percent by2020 to minimize the futurerise in temperature .
Here we summarize the Plan B measures for doing so , including both reducing fossil fuel use and increasing biological sequestration .
After energydemand is stabilized by dramatically improving efficiency , replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy for generating electricity and heat will reduce carbon emissions in 2020 by more than 3.2 billion tons .
( See Table 10 –1 . )
The biggest single cut in carbon emissions comes from phasing out the use ofcoal to generate electricity .
Other cuts come from eliminating all the oil and 70 percent of the natural gas used to generate electricity .
41
In the transport sector , the greatly reduced use of oil will eliminate 1.4 billion tons of carbon emissions .
This reduction relies heavily on the shift to plug - in hybrid and all - electric cars that will run on carbon - free sources of electricity such as wind .
The remainder comes largely from shifting long - haul freight from trucks to trains , electrifying freight and passenger trains , and using green electricity to power them .
42 Page 253
Brown talks about a mobilization , in a way similar to war mobilization , and shows war budgets , that could presumably be used for peaceful activities .
He ends about talking about what you and I can do --
One of the questions I hear most frequently is , What can I do ?
People often expect me to talk about lifestyle changes , recycling newspapers , or changing light bulbs .
These are essential , but they are not nearly enough .
We now need to restructure the global economy , and quickly .
It means becoming politically active , working for the needed changes .
Saving civilization is not aspectator sport .
Inform yourself , read about the issues .
If you want to know what happened to earlier civilizations that found themselves in environmental trouble , read Collapseby Jared Diamond or A Short History of Progressby Ronald Wright or The Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter .
If you found this book useful in helping you think about what to do , share it with others .
It can be downloaded free of charge from the Institute ’s Website , earthpolicy.org.68
Pick an issue that ’s meaningful to you , such as tax restructuring , banning inefficient light bulbs , phasing out coal - ﬁred power plants , or working for streets in your community that are pedestrian - and bicycle - friendly , or join a group that is working to stabilize world population .
What could be more exciting and rewarding than getting personally involved in trying to save civilization ?
Clearly Brown believes that technology can save us , if we can make changes quickly enough .
A lot of his ideas are good , if there are really resources available to do them .
I am a doubter in this area , but I will leave the issue to others to discuss .
If the Afghan war then becomes the consuming issue of Obama ’s presidency - as Iraq became for his predecessor , as Vietnam did for Lyndon Johnson , and as Korea did for Harry Truman - the inevitable effect will be to compromise the prospects of reform more broadly .
At home and abroad , the president who advertised himself as an agent of change will instead have inadvertently erected barriers to change .
As for the American people , they will be left to foot the bill .
This is a pivotal moment in US history .
Americans owe it to themselves to be clear about what is at issue .
That issue relates only tangentially relates to Al Qaeda , the Taliban , or the well - being of the Afghan people .
The real question is whether “ change ’ ’ remains possible .
( Source ; h/t Greenwald )
I have n't been writing much about Iraq / Afghanistan because what is there new to say ?
It may seem simplistic ; nevertheless , the only compelling reason to explain this commitment to futility is that it benefits certain very important and powerful interests .
Your normal politician , who understand the steep price fighting them would require , would rather not pay it , and so finds a way to pursue projects that do n't disturb them too much .
If Wall Street owns Washington , it 's a joint venture with the big players in the defense industry .
Insurance and Big Pharma are important players , but not in the same class as defense and Big Finance .
There are other layers of reasons for these policies , but they are all secondary , pretexts , or ex post facto rationalizations , and none alone or in combination would be sufficient to motivate this futile policy , just as WMD , or deposing a dictator , or promoting democracy was never the central motivation for invading Iraq .
These secondary layers have legitimacy only as supporting justifications for the central reason : it serves the power and profit interests of a few narrow but very powerful interests .
That 's what America has become , and Obama and the Dems are either unwilling or unable to do anything to change it .
So nothing changes until Americans use their power - in - numbers to push back against the power - in - wealth that currently dominates the system .
But power - in - wealth knows how to prevent power - in - numbers by tried - and - true , divide - and - conquer tactics .
The culture wars are its current tool , and liberals are as easily manipulated by this play as movement conservatives .
Politics is n't that hard to understand .
It operates according to very basic , very primitive greed and power rules .
We 're in our current predicament because the American people , smitten by the Reagan fantasy , ceded their power to a pack of wolves who , spouting religious , patriotic , and free - market cliches , have largely destroyed a sane , workable New Deal framework , and in doing so nicely set themselves up to rule the hen house for the last thirty years .
This regression was so easy to effect because people with money have enormous power to co-opt the system to benefit themselves and to fund clever propaganda to cover their rapine .
The Republicans took the lead , but the Dems happily followed , so now anybody who speaks out sincerely and passionately for the public interest , or any policy that based in common sense or common decency , is considered either a rube or a far leftist .
So I do n't know that any of us could do better than Obama if we were in his position .
Presidents only look powerful when they do the will of entrenched power .
Resist , and you will be destroyed .
Calls are growing for South Africa to legalise prostitution ahead of next year 's football World Cup in an effort to limit HIV infection among millions of fans visiting the country for the tournament .
A leading health specialist told the Observer that the World Cup presented a huge risk and said there was an urgent need to start registering prostitutes and screening them for the virus .
It is estimated that 50 % of the country 's sex workers are infected .
Professor Ian Sanne , head of the clinical HIV research unit at Johannesburg 's Witwatersrand University , said the party atmosphere being touted by the football authorities , travel companies and the South African government was a green light to alcohol abuse and promiscuity among fans next summer .
Around 3.2 million tickets will be sold for the matches .
A million will go to South African residents , with the rest split between international fans and sponsors .
Twenty thousand England fans are expected to head for South Africa , where those without tickets will be catered for with huge screens and temporary bars across the country .
Sanne said not only would the visitors be at risk , but young South Africans and the sex workers too , opening the way for the virus to spread at a dramatically increased rate .
" HIV / Aids is a problem globally and there is a great need to encourage and enforce better health and responsibility , especially to the young South Africans who could be at risk during the World Cup , " he said .
He called for legal frameworks to regulate the practice of sex workers rather than discriminate against them .
" Interim legalisation of prostitution would be best for the country , rather than leaving it uncontrolled , " he said .
" Sex workers need to register with a board that will regulate their practice and give certification to practise , but they have to go through a mandatory HIV testing process first , and only those who test negative will be allowed to practise . "
South Africa is the centre of the global HIV epidemic , with more than five million adults infected .
An estimated one in two of working prostitutes is living with the virus and the lack of medication led to a quarter of a million people dying of Aids - related illnesses there last year .
The antiretroviral medication that helps prevent HIV developing into full - blown Aids is being taken by fewer than 30 % of those infected .
Infection rates among women aged 15 to 24 declined slightly from 22.1 % in 2007 to 21.7 % in 2008 , but among women in the 30 to 34 age group , the infection rate was 40.4 % in 2008 .
But while Sanne said authorities should use the World Cup as a platform to raise awareness on the need for testing , Aids / HIV campaigners responded furiously that it would take concern for foreigners rather than its own citizens to make the South African government act .
" The clear way forward to help tackle the tens of thousands of women forced into prostitution through poverty is to legalise it now , not to make it a temporary measure for the World Cup , " said Vuyiseka Dubula of the Treatment Action Campaign .
" We need prostitution decriminalised now so we can start to help these women , many of whom have been abused and brutalised from a young age . "
Former South African police commissioner Jackie Selebi , now suspended over corruption allegations , caused widespread dismay when he first suggested legalising prostitution and public drinking for the duration of the World Cup , arguing that it would free his officers to deal with security , but the issue is hugely contentious in a country where the sex trade is regarded as immoral and unacceptable .
A spokesman for the FA said : " They [ English fans ] will all be issued with guidance along with their tickets and we are working now on how best to communicate the dos and don'ts in South Africa to people .

Darling of the haute couture set for the luxurious feel and drape ; villain of vegans and PeTA for the doomed silk worm who labors to spin the fine fiber and then is gassed or boiled alive .
Even though silk is a natural fiber that has been woven into fabric to dress China ’s Empresses since 2900 BC ( back when the entire world population was only 15 million people ) , silk is just starting to be proclaimed as a “ natural ” fabric , but how organic , sustainable , ethical and healthy is silk ?
“ With time and patience the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown ” – Ancient Chinese Proverb .
The finest , most desirable silk comes from the mulberry silkworm , which is actually a caterpillar and not a worm .
Known as the Bombyx mori by entomologists , the mulberry silk worm is a fascinating but tragic bundle of insect life .
Raised by professional keepers in China on trays of mulberry leaves a thousand years before the Roman Empire when wild tribes were roaming Europe living in stick and mud huts , the mulberry silkworm has been totally domesticated and can not live without humans for their care and feeding .
There are no wild silkworms or Bombyx mori moths that roam and feed in the wild .
Across several thousand years of captive breeding , the Bombyx mori evolved into a blind moth that cannot fly and lives only a few days during which it lays about 500 eggs and then dies within four or five days .
The silkworm moth has even lost the ability to eat because of undeveloped structures within their mouth .
A Bombyx mori egg hatches in 10 days and becomes a larva – the silkworm caterpillar .
The silkworm larva will voraciously eat mulberry leaves almost non-stop for 35 days increasing its weight 10,000 times from a tiny speck to a chubby grub .
Silkworms are very delicate and will go off their feed from loud noises , temperature fluctuations of more than a few degrees above or below 76 degrees , or even strong smells .
When it is full grown , the silk worm ( called a pupae ) climbs a twig and begins spinning a cocoon .
This stage of silkworm life is called pupating .
The silkworm produces a fibroin protein compound in two salivary glands called sericteries that is mixed in the mouth of the silkworm with a gooey substance called sericin and forced out through an opening in the silkworm ’s under lip .
When this stream of sticky fluid comes into contact with air , it solidifies and becomes a continuous strand of silk that becomes the silkworm ’s cocoon .
The openings in the under lip of the silkworm are called spinnerets and the process is very similar to spinning manmade “ natural ” fibers such as viscose rayon or lyocell Tencel … except that it is air for silk rather than an acid bath for viscose and lyocell that causes the fibers to solidify .
The silkworm will spin a thousand yards of silk fiber in three days to form its completely enclosed cocoon .
To fashion its cocoon , the silkworm will continually weave its head in a figure eight pattern an estimated 300,000 times while continually spinning and secreting its silk fiber .
The cocoon will be the silkworm ’s home for sixteen days as it morphs from a chubby grub to a furry , winged moth .
What an incredible marvel of Nature ’s intelligence !
But here the story turns down .
When the transformation is complete , the newly formed Bombyx mori moth secretes an alkali fluid that begins to dissolve a hole in the cocoon so that the moth can emerge .
The silk farmers do not want their silk cocoons damaged so they kill the worms by tossing the cocoons into boiling water or hot ovens before they transform into moths and emerge from their cocoons .
A small percentage of silkworms in cocoons are left to live so that a few moths will emerge to lay the next generation of silk machines .
The sightless , flightless and toothless moth will mate almost immediately after emerging from the cocoon and lay 500 silkworm eggs during their first 4 or 5 days and then die .
Total lifespan of the Bombyx mori is about 70 days for those lucky few who are allowed to live and reproduce and about 60 days for those unfortunate ones who are sacrificed for that fabulous Italian silk scarf from Elizabetta or Missoni ' Dianes ' Lotus Print Dress ( $ 2,935 ) from Nordstrom .
A hugely developed industry , called sericulture , has developed around the raising of silkworms for the production of silk .
Silk worms are raised by large corporate silk worm farmers and hobbyists all over the world .
Sericulture companies like Sericulum sell and ship all that the silk grower enthusiast needs from Bombyx mori ova ( silkworm eggs ) in an incubation dish to handling tools .
Silkworms eat only mulberry leaves and you supply your own .
One silkworm produces very little useable silk .
One acre of mulberry trees produces enough foliage to feed silkworms that create 178 pounds of cocoons which can be unraveled into 35 pounds of raw silk .
The mulberry leaves are a renewable and sustainable crop as the trees produce year after year .
One mature mulberry tree will produce enough foliage for 100 silkworms .
The Bombyx mori silkworm is univoltine which means that they only produce one batch of eggs annually .
When the eggs are laid , they enter a diapausal state of suspended development ( hibernation ) , often induced by refrigerating the eggs for nine months .
The silk worm farmers can induce the eggs to hatch at a commercially convenient time .
The modern Silk Road .
To continue the journey from the silkworm egg to the display rack in Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus , dropping the cocoon in hot water not only kills the silkworm , but also dissolves the sticky sericin coating the silk fibers and holding the shape of the cocoon .
Silk workers gently dry and brush the outside of the cocoon to find the end of the silk fiber that made the cocoon .
The cocoon is carefully unraveled and wound around a spool .
Five to ten individual silk fibers from cocoons are wound together to form one silk thread and several silk threads are wound together to form a yarn of silk .
This is raw silk , just pure silk fibers without any chemicals or treatments added , although sometimes the raw silk fibers will be soaked in a 1 % hydrogen peroxide solution for a few hours to refine the creamy color .
Organic and sustainable certification organizations are working on standards for organic silk but they have not yet been finalized and adopted .
Up to this point in our journey down the modern Silk Road , our spool of raw silk threads could easily be produced to comply with emerging sustainable and organic standards for silk and be manufactured into silk eco-fashion and organic clothing … except for this little problem – a 3 inch ethical problem – the Bombyx mori silkworm that is gassed , steamed , or boiled alive to prevent them from escaping from their cocoon as a moth by dissolving a hole in the silk cocoon .
To make one pound of the finest silk , 2600 silkworms must die .
Peace Silk or Vegetarian Silk .
Fortunately for those who love the feel , luster and exceptional fabric properties of silk , there are other more ethical options .
Some Bombyx mori silk producers allow the moths to emerge from the cocoon and then salvage the damaged cocoons .
Because the one continuous silk fiber woven by the silkworm has been broken into many smaller strands by the emerging moth , the cocoon is degummed to remove the sericin and then spun like other fibers such as cotton or hemp rather than being reeled onto spools of one continuous silk strand .
Because of the more humane harvesting of these silk cocoons , this silk is often called peace silk or vegetarian silk .
This silk is slightly discolored by the alkaline solution secreted by the moth to create the hole , and the peace silk is not as strong and has a slightly different look and feel to the knowing designer or connoisseur than conventional Bombyx mori silk .
Because the peace silk is spun as a fiber rather than reeled as a thread , it produces a fabric that is warmer and softer .
Ahimsa silk is also peace silk .
Ahimsa peace silk often comes from the Eri Silk Moth and the Tassar moth and comes mostly from India .
The Ahimsa Peace Silk project in India is working to help develop the peace silk industry in India , train local artisians in the manufacturing of peace silks and raise global awareness for ahimsa peace silks .
Wild Silks .
The Bombyx mori silkworm is not the only silkworm that spins a silk cocoon that can be used to produce silk fabric for silk clothing .
There are many species of wild silk caterpillars that produce silk cocoons used in the production of silk fabrics , sometimes called “ wild silks ” or “ peace silks ” because the silk caterpillars are allowed to live complete and natural lives in the wild without being sacrificed for fashion .
Most wild silkworms are multivoltine , which means that they produce cocoons several times during the year rather than just once a year like the Bombyx mori .
These wild caterpillars spin a silk that is different in texture and color from the domesticated Bombyx mori and the wild silk cocoon strands are shorter because they come from cocoons that have been damaged by the wild silk moth ’s emergence from the cocoon .
One of the highly desirable properties of the Bombyx mori silk fibers due to the unique structure of their fibroin protein is their exceptional ability to absorb dyes ; wild silk caterpillars secrete a slightly different protein structure and their silk fibers tend to not accept dyes as well .
Exquisitely patterned wild silk fabrics are hand loomed in Thailand from the Saturniidae silk worm , and throughout India from a variety of wild silk caterpillars .
One region of India that is especially noted for its exceptional and unique silks is the far northeastern state of Assam , which borders Bangladesh .
Assam produces three different types of silk that are collectively known as Assam silk but which vary greatly in appearance .
The Assam silks are Muga , Eri and Pat .
Muga ( from the semi- domesticated silkworm Antherea assamensis ) is renowned for its glossy fine texture , durability and natural golden amber glow .
Reputed to be the second most costly fabric after Pashmina , Muga silk looks like spun gold and for 600 years only the royal families of Assam where allowed to wear muga silks .
The golden hue increases with time and washing .
Muga silk is naturally stain - resistant and is never bleached or dyed .
Muga silk fabric is naturally organic and untouched by chemicals , but it is not a “ peace ” or “ vegetarian ” silk because the silkworm is killed before it can emerge from the cocoon .
Like cotton and silk , fashion is a blending of compromises .
Eri ( from the domesticated silkworm Philosamia rinini ) is a fine silk that is almost as white in color as the Bombyx mori silks .
Even though Eri is spun from the cocoons of domesticated silkworms , it is a “ peace silk ” because the Antherea assamensis silk caterpillars are not destroyed in the cocoon but are allowed to emerge as moths and live a full lifecycle .
Because the Eri silk fibers are more uneven and the cocoons are damaged when the moth emerges , Eri silk is spun rather than reeled .
Eri silk has the look of wool mixed with cotton but the feel and softness of silk .
Muga and Eri silks are from silkworms that are only found in the Indian state of Assam .
Indigo Handloom , a small eco-fashion company bursting with energy and creativity , is developing a bridge between the ancient handlooming cottage industry found throughout rural India and contemporary modern Western cultures .
With eco-design and sales offices in NYC , Indigo Handloom works closely with a small , select community of handloom artisans in India to create scarves of the most exquisite quality and design .
They offer a number of timelessly beautiful Muga and Eri silk scarves that were crafted on ancient handlooms , many sitting outside small cottages where the artisan weavers can be near their young children .
The handloom industry in India employs 6,500,000 people and makes 23 % of total cloth produced in India .
Handlooming forms an important part of the rich cultural heritage of India and the skilled craftsmen weave the rich cultural heritage of India into garments of astounding beauty , complexity and simplicity – unifying opposites as only the harmonizing tradition of India can .
Handlooming in India is a critical component of sustainable development in poor , rural regions .
Handlooms are environmentally friendly with no external energy requirements so the energy impact is near zero , but the handloom industry is endangered by WTO policies that favor the large , globalized , powerloom textile companies .
Companies such as Indigo Handloom , under the vision of Smita Paul , are providing these local weavers with a venue for bringing their exquisite , eco-friendly fashions to Western markets .
Is silk organic , sustainable , ethical , healthy ?
The quick answer is that silk can be but the consumer must be aware and ask the right questions when shopping .
Silk , like other protein fibers coming from living beings such as sheep and alpacas , can easily be created according to organic guidelines as they begin to be approved .
And many silk fibers are probably already being produced in an organic environment , especially those produced in smaller villages and rural environments .
To boost productions and improve efficiencies , large corporate farms will typically use heavy chemicals .
In the same way , the raising of domesticated silkworms and the life of wild silkworms is , by nature , sustainable .
Silk fabric when produced by weavers on handlooms has a near zero energy footprint and satisfies most of the guidelines for sustainable fabric production .
Silk produced in large powerloomed textiles factories must be evaluated on a company - by - company basis to determine their sustainability .
Ethical silk .
Evaluating the ethics of silk is always a more complex and more personal question .
Animal rights organizations are concerned about the destruction of several thousand domesticated silkworms to produce one pound of silk .
Labor rights and Fair Trade organizations are concerned about the exploitive low wages often paid to silk textile workers .
Healthy Silk .
While being a comparatively healthy and organic natural fiber , silk , like other fibers containing protein chains such as wools and even latex , is an allergen for some people .
Silk allergies can cause asthma or allergic rhinitis with symptoms of runny nose and itchy eyes that are similar to hay fever .
Medical researchers have found a wide variety of causes for a small number of people experiencing silk allergies : some are allergic to wild silk , some to domesticated silk , and some to micro - fine dust that can be given off by spun silk .
Often , the allergies are traced to the diet of the silk worm – such as mulberry or oak leaves – which influence the protein chains found in the silk strands produced by the silk worm .
Some silk allergies come from excessive sericin in silk that has not been adequately degummed .
Sericin is a complex protein produced by the silkworm that is sticky and coats the outside of the silk strand over the fibroin protein core .
During the processing of the silk cocoon strands into silk threads , the silk workers use boiling hot soapy water that is slightly alkaline to degum the silk strands by dissolving much of the outer sericin layer .
The waste silk , also called silk noil , from damaged cocoons and broken strands is often used as filling in silk duvets and lower quality spun silk fabrics .
Sometimes the waste silk / silk noil is not sufficiently degummed resulting in excess sericin in the products that can result in silk allergic reactions for some people .
This process of degumming is also called scouring and is the first step in preparing silk for dyeing .
Scouring and removing the sericin coating allows dyes to more easily penetrate the silk fibers .
After scouring , silk is often bleached – sometimes with sulfur fumes to remove blemishes and leave the silk a uniform creamy color in preparation for dyeing .
Dyed Silk .
As with any fabric , the dyeing of silk can also create health problems for people with chemical sensitivities and MCS .
Because silk fibers are highly absorptive , Bombyx mori silk takes dyes exceptionally well and is one reason for the brilliance and luster of dyed silk fabrics .
Domesticated silk fabrics are typically dyed with a mild acid dye or environmentally low impact fiber reactive dyes .
Textile acid dye processes typically require high levels of chemicals , many of which have been classified by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) as being of moderate to high concern as carcinogens .
Textile acid dyeing also typically discharges large amounts of contaminated waste waters that require treatment .
Low impact fiber reactive dyes have a much smaller environmental footprint but still create some health problems for the chemically sensitive .
Wild silks and spun silks are harder to clean and bleach before dyeing and dyes do not take as well requiring heavier dyeing and more chemical processing before dyeing .
If you wish to avoid dyes , your options are raw silk , natural undyed silk or golden hued Muga silk .
Weighted Silk .
“ Weighting ” is a textile manufacturing practice peculiar to and particular to silk manufacturing and involves the application of metallic salts to add body , luster and physical weight to silk fabric .
The reason for adding metals to silk fabric is to increase the weight of the fabric and , because silk fabric sells by the pound , the extra weight increases the selling price of the fabric .
Generally , only the finer and more expensive reeled silks are weighted rather than the less costly spun silks .
Some of the different salts of metals used to weight silk include chromium , barium , lead , tin , iron and sodium magnesium .
Weighting can increase the weight of a pound of raw silk by three , four , fivefold or more .
Silk can be weighted because it is highly absorptive and the metal salts are easily absorbed into the silk fibers .
Silk was originally weighted to make up for the loss of weight caused by degumming which removes the sericin reducing the weight of silk by about 20 percent .
Silk is one of the strongest natural fibers but the metals used to weight silk cause it to lose much of its strength and durability if the weighting is not done properly .
When shopping for silk , ask if the silk is weighted silk or pure - dyed silk .
Pure - dyed silk is just colored with dye and not weighted .
The metallic salts used to weight silk can cause health risks and problems for some people .
Finishing Silk .
The purpose of the fabric finishing process is to give the fabric its final desired feel , appearance and care properties .
A variety of environmental and health hazards can be introduced during the finishing phase of silk fabrics and garments .
Water - soluble substances such as starch , glue , gelatin and even sugar are sometimes used to finish silk and provide extra body to the fabric .
Silk creases and wrinkles easily , especially when damp or wet .
Some silk clothing manufacturers apply softeners , elastomers , and synthetic resins such as EPSIA – a silicone - containing epoxy crosslinking agent – to increase the dry and wet anti-wrinkling and crease - resistance performance of silk garments .
With the family of silicone epoxy crosslinking agents ( EPSIA , EPSIB and EPTA ) this crease resistance occurs because chemical cross links occur between the silk fibroin strand and the epoxy groups .
Research by Zaisheng Cai and Yiping Qiu in the Textile Research Journal ( January 2003 ) reported “ in conventional epoxide finishing of silk , organic solvents have to be used , which may be hazardous to the health of the exposed workers as well as the environment . ”
Chemical treatments are also added to silk to improve anti-static , water and oil repellency , flame retardant , dimensional stability and other wash - and - wear properties that our easy - care culture seems to expect .
Textile chemicals have become an integral and important component of conventional textile and clothing manufacturing .
Textile chemicals , also know as textile auxiliaries , have two primary purposes : to increase the efficiency and lower the costs of conventional textile manufacturing ; and to create special finishing effects and properties for the clothing .
The first category of textile auxiliaries and chemicals to improve manufacturing efficiencies are used in the spinning , weaving , scouring , bleaching and dyeing processes .
Textile manufacturers claim that these textile chemicals can all be washed and removed from the final garments and are used to save time , reduce labor costs and reduce material costs .
Environmental impact is seldom considered , especially in garment factories in developing countries , and many of the chemicals are discharged as untreated waste waters into rivers and ground water supplies .
The second category of textile chemicals are used mostly in the fabric and garment finishing processes and are intended to be permanent .
These textile auxiliaries are supposed to give clothing special properties such as a smooth silky feel , easy care , mildew resiliency , flame retardant , and easy wear .
Many of these chemicals are also toxic and suspected carcinogens .
So what ’s the silk consumer to do ?
Caveat Emptor – Latin for “ Let the buyer beware " - should be your guiding principal for evaluating all fabrics and clothing .
Knowledge and information are your only resources when every emotional fiber screams out “ I must have that Silk Chiffon Tie Neck Blouse ( $ 198 ) from Brooks Brothers ! ”
The warp and weft of silk fashion is emotion and compromise .
If your primary concern is healthy and organic silk then consider raw silk , noil silk , Muga silks or Eri silks that are undyed or dyed with low - impact , fiber - reactive dyes .
The silk fabric should not be weighted or have any easy care or protective finishes .
Silks produced in small villages by local weavers are usually the most pure .
If you are concerned about the ethics of silk raising then choose wild silk , spun silk or Eri silks which do not destroy the silk worm to harvest the silk cocoons .
Also ask if the silk garments were produced according to Fair Trade principles which protect the workers involved in all phases of producing the clothing .
If you are concerned about sustainable and eco-friendly silk , then seek silks dyed using low - impact and fiber reactive dyes or vegetable dyes without any finishes .
Handloomed silks are the most energy - neutral .
Silk is also biodegradable and will decompose gracefully in landfills .
Although , given its durability , silk is ideal for recycled ecofashion .
NGO's and organizations such as the Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environments are developing programs to assist poor rural communities in conservation efforts and economic development by developing their wild silk industries .
Good Luck and Enjoy .

NEW YORK ( AP ) —
Plans to light the top of the Empire State Building in red and yellow to honor communist China 's 60th anniversary were criticized Wednesday as inappropriate for an icon in the land of the free .
Different colors are routinely used to mark holidays and big events , but opponents question whether it's right to commemorate such a sensitive political issue , particularly when the country has such a poor human rights record .
About 20 supporters of Tibet , which has been ruled by China since shortly after communists took charge in 1949 , protested outside the building during a ceremonial lighting of a scale model inside the lobby .
They chanted " No to China 's empire ; free Tibet now , " and held signs reading , " Empire State Building celebrating 60 years of China 's oppression . "
Lhadon Tethong , executive director of Students for a Free Tibet , called the lighting tribute " outright , blatant approval for a communist totalitarian system . "
" On the one hand , it 's a great public relations coup for the Chinese state , " Tethong said as tourists gawked at the protesters .
" But on the other hand , it 's sure to backfire because the American public and the global public will speak against it . "
At the ceremony , building manager Joseph Bellina called the lights a high honor and said he was " proud " of the relationship between " our countries and our people . "
Chinese Consul General Peng Keyu , who pulled the switch on the glass - encased model , said he was " honored and delighted . "
He said China 's reforms of the last 30 years ago had led to greater openness and " tremendous change . "
Keyu and Bellina did n't address critics and declined to answer questions .

American Superconductor Corporation ( AMSC ) announced that its superconductor electricity pipeline technology has been chosen for the Tres Amigas Project , the first renewable energy market hub in the U.S.
The superconductor electricity pipelines will include transmission - level direct current ( DC ) superconductor power cables powered by AMSC high temperature superconductor ( HTS ) wire and high - powered voltage - source AC / DC power converters .
The Tres Amigas Project , which was announced this week Albuquerque by New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson , focuses on uniting America ’s three power grids for the first time to enable faster adoption of renewable energy and increase the reliability of the U.S. grid .
The three U.S. power grids , or interconnections are known as the Eastern Interconnection , the Western Interconnection and the Texas Interconnection .
Power transmission within these three power grids is accomplished primarily utilizing alternating current ( AC ) power transmission lines .
Power transfer between any two of the Interconnections , however , can only be accomplished through special power electronic conversion stations .
This is commonly achieved by first converting AC power in one grid to DC as an intermediate power form at a substation , then reconverting from DC back to AC before reaching the adjacent grid .
This , in effect , synchronizes power flows .
While there are several relatively small bilateral DC Links existing today between two Interconnections , all three Interconnections have never been united by one system .
The Tres Amigas renewable energy market hub will be a multi-mile , triangular electricity pathway of Superconductor Electricity Pipelines capable of transferring and balancing many gigawatts of renewable power between the three Interconnections .
Similar to highway rotaries used for traffic flow control , multiple power transmission lines from each of the Interconnections will feed power into and out of the Tres Amigas SuperStation through multiple AC / DC converters , each connected by DC superconductor cables .
Tres Amigas , which will be a balancing authority , will help ensure the efficient and reliable flow of power from multiple renewable generation sources in all three power grids to customers across a wide area of the U.S. , Canada and Mexico .
As a merchant transmission system , Tres Amigas will charge a fee for usage of the power hub .
The Tres Amigas renewable energy market hub will be constructed in Clovis , New Mexico , a location that has easy access to all three of the nation ’s power grids .
New Mexico ’s State Land Office already has granted Tres Amigas LLC the right to lease 14,400 acres of land in Clovis for this system .
Tres Amigas , LLC is now in the process of filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) for a declaratory order that transmission lines that connect to Tres Amigas from ERCOT will not come under the jurisdiction of FERC and that Tres Amigas can be operated as a merchant transmission entity .
Following the project ’s approval , AMSC is expected to provide transmission planning services , superconductor wire and the superconductor cable system for the project .
AMSC intends to partner with some of the industry ’s leading superconductor power cable and system component companies to manufacture the cable system to AMSC ’s specification .
“ This is a tremendous opportunity to help unify the United States power grid and achieve the nation ’s renewable energy goals , ” said Greg Yurek , founder and chief executive officer of American Superconductor .
“ The time has come to utilize the latest technologies to not only balance renewable energy flows to get more clean electricity to customers , but also to increase the reliability and security of our power grids .
Tres Amigas will help achieve these important goals . ”
AMSC has acquired a minority equity interest in Tres Amigas LLC for US $ 1.75 million in cash and AMSC stock .
The Mediapoint Advantage
Welcome to Mediapoint , the home of the best large format and flatbed Australian trade printers .
What makes us different to any other wholesale printing company is that we focus on working with trade customers only .
We define trade customers as anyone who is on selling print to their customers .
By doing this we can be the best at print .
That means our customers can be the best at what they do which is helping their customers .
We believe we can help more businesses win by using this tactic rather than being all things to all people .
We believe that companies that deal in trade and direct to market can never be a completely trusted company based on their actions for the trade .
By giving trade work to these companies , it is putting more profits in these companies for their marketing for targeting more retail work .
So we believe the trade ends up losing when this happens .
If you look at our actions we do not do retail work at all .
If you do not believe us , then put us to the test .
Over the years we have developed some of the best processes out of any of the Australian trade printers .
This follows our philosophy of being lean .
By having this mantra , we can get orders fast and pass on the savings to our customers who have more room for margin .
From our wholesale printing customers , we expect them to use our system and to supply print ready artwork .
In return we can offer them fast and reliable trade only products .
The types of customers we predominately work with are printing companies , marketing agencies , print brokers , signage companies and other types of resellers .
We aim to partner with our customers rather than take orders from customers .
Because of this it does not bother us if a customer is ordering micro orders .
From our experience when our trade customers get to know our system and feel confident in it , they end up selling more .
This in turn means their volumes and their profits increase helping them to win .
Over 80 % of our products work that if you order in our system by the cut off time , it will be ready to dispatch the next business day at 1 pm AEST if it fits certain parameters .
As we are dealing with trade customers only , we feel as though we need to give lead times which make it look like our customers are printing it themselves .
We are constantly upgrading and bringing in equipment which allows us to handle more square meters in a shorter amount of time reducing the lead time on larger volume runs as well .
We believe in automation and our utopia is becoming the first large format lights out factory in the world .
We are not tied into any brands or technology .
We believe each piece of kit from each manufacturer has its advantages and disadvantages .
We believe in having an even spread of equipment so we are using the best technology for that product .
You will never hear us say that we only stock this brand of printers .
We believe that is limiting potential advantages to our customers in quality as well as speed .
When people mention Mediapoint , the consistent message is that everyone knows that we are the best at what we do which is large format and flatbed printing .
The reason for this is we are a pure production house and that is all we do .
Being reliable means getting out every order on time to the quality the customer expects .
We do not want our trade customers getting a phone call from their customers saying the quality is not good enough .
That is what we believe being reliable is .
With Print quality , our definition of ‘ quality ’ is simple .
It is no banding in the prints at a high enough dpi for that product and print process to be at the top end of the market .
We believe automation is key to success in all areas of our processes .
From our frontend right up until dispatch .
By doing this it brings down lead times but also cuts out ‘ human error ’ which affects the reliability of all companies .
Being in Print colour management is a key part of our business .
We believe the best process is building solid colour profiles .
In return our customers will need to supply their artwork to our specs .
Because of this we are able to process and output 100 ’s of jobs a day to the highest colour standards .
Companies where you see them needing to constantly print charts and match colours manually on a constant basis , we believe do not have a handle on their colour management .
Reliability does not just fall solely on us .
We need to continue to strive for developing relationships with all our business stakeholders .
Our suppliers and distribution partners need to fall in lines with our criteria .
Even our customers need to adhere to our system and we are not afraid to let our customers know if they are not a fit for us .
We know that if they are not a fit and cause issues to our system it potentially puts all of our other customers jobs at risk .
We believe in production in Australia .
We believe as soon as a company starts thinking of producing in another country their actions about being ‘ reliable ’ is a fabrication .
The reason being is you cannot be reliable if you are losing control of production .
We oversee everything and only print in - house .
I love this video – it sums up so many things that are true and important about music to me .
But how does it work ?
How do we know exactly what notes Bobby wants us to sing , even though the only clue we have is which way he ’s jumping – and how far ?
Part of the answer is that he is singing , and prompting us to sing , in a pentatonic scale .
In western music , we are very used to scales with 8 notes , chosen from 12 “ equal temperament ” semitones – like the white notes on a piano keyboard in C major , for example :
C , D , E , F , G , A , B …
Whereas by contrast , the pentatonic scale has only 5 notes .
Still in C , these are :
C , D , E , G , A …
Another pentatonic scale is formed by the black notes on a piano keyboard .
So what ’s special about these 5 notes ?
Lots of things !
They are :
1. Natural
The simplest , most fundamental musical “ interval ” is the unison – ie .
singing or playing exactly the same note , or more usefully , an octave above or below it .
Following swiftly on the unison ’s heels though is the perfect 5th – C to G , for example .
Fifths are everywhere in music , so much so that they form the basis of both mediaeval plainchant and the Heavy Metal “ power - chord ” .
In fact , the fifth comes so naturally to us that when asked to sing a particular note , many people will naturally sing the fifth , and not even realise they ’re doing it .
And this is the secret of the pentatonic scale – it ’s built entirely from fifths .
Just start on C and move up by a fifth each time :
C , G , D , A , E
Shuffle them about a bit , and you have a pentatonic scale .
But there ’s more to it .
Because of this reliance on fifths , pentatonics are
2. Fundamental
Why are do octaves and fifths sound so natural to our ears ?
Because they are built into the fabric of sound itself .
All musical notes are based on vibrations – be it of a string , skin or a column of air .
The pitch we hear is determined by the simplest form of those vibrations – the fundamental frequency .
But these same strings , skins and air - columns can also vibrate in more complicated ways – anyone who has played with a skipping rope has found that as well as getting the whole rope to oscillate in one big loop , by waggling it harder you can get two , three or even four loops wobbling away .
These different “ modes ” of vibrations are known as “ harmonics ” of the fundamental frequency of vibration ( the “ whole - rope - wobble ” ) , and every acoustic musical note naturally includes a healthy complement of these harmonics – in fact , the number and loudness of the harmonics in the sound of each instrument is what gives it an individial tone or timbre .
So , every musical note is made of a series of harmonics , but what does this have to do with the pentatonic scale ?
Well , the first harmonic of every musical note is an octave above the fundamental .
The next is a perfect fifth .
The next is a fourth , which corresponds to a note that ’s a further octave above the fundamental .
Sound familiar ?
These simple observations tell us why octaves and fifths sound so natural to use – they are literally built into all individual musical notes at the deepest level , and our ears actually spend a great deal of time “ blending ” fifths and octaves into single notes .
No wonder many people can’t tell octaves and fifths apart !
Pentatonics are also :
3. Consonant ( They sound great !)
The fact that the pentatonic scale is built from fifths means it contains almost no clashing or “ disonant ” notes .
Put another way , you can play almost any notes of a pentatonic scale in almost any combination , and they ’ll sound great together .
The most uncomfortable combination you ’re likely to hit on is a major second , but let ’s face it , you need a little conflict to make things interesting , and seconds do n’t sound nearly as ‘ uncomfortable ’ as semitones or the infamous diminished fifth or “ tritone ” ( eg. C to F# ) , which used to sound so unnatural to western ears that it became known in history as the “ devil ’s interval ” !
All this consonance in the pentatonic scale makes it a uniquely pleasing and satisfying key to sing and play in , as well as one that comes naturally to our ears .
In fact , penatonics often play a leading role in both jazz improvisation and rock guitar solos , amongst many other genres .
And even the pentatonic ’s notes themselves are more in tune than other more complex scales .
If you continue moving up through the harmonic series or cycle of fifths , you can eventually fill in all the notes and intervals of the familiar western diatonic scale – but there ’s a catch .
If you tune a piano to sound perfect in the key of C by strictly multiplying the frequencies as occurs in the harmonic series , it will sound terrible in most other keys .
This natural tuning system is known as “ just ” intonation , but because of the need to have pianos that can play in many different keys , western music actually uses “ equal temperament ” scales , meaning that many notes use a “ compromise ” tuning to make playing in multiple keys possible – so they are subtly out of tune with what we instinctively feel they should be .
The pentatonic scale does n’t suffer from this problem .
Finally , the pentatonic scale is :
4. Universal
Pentatonic scales have been used almost everywhere at one time or another .
According to Wikipedia :
Pentatonic scales are very common and are found all over the world , including Celtic folk music , Hungarian folk music , West African music , African - American spirituals , Jazz , American bluesmusic and rock music , Sami joik singing , children ’s songs , the Greek traditional music and songs from Epirus , Northwest Greece and the music of Southern Albania , the tuning of the Ethiopian krar and the Indonesian gamelan , Philippine Kulintang , melodies of Korea , Japan , China , India and Vietnam ( including the folk music of these countries ) , the Afro- Caribbean tradition , Polish highlanders from the Tatra Mountains , and Western Classical composers such as French composer Claude Debussy .
The pentatonic scale is also used on the Great Highland Bagpipe .

Conclusion
So , is what Bobby does in the video clip so very clever after all ?
Yes !
Because as well as the pentatonic scale , he ’s using all kinds of musical & neurological training techniques .
His movements give us cues ; he uses only equal intervals to begin with ; he uses repetition and reinforcement to help us remember what he ’s teaching us and he later “ trains ” us to sing the notes he intends by subtly including higher and lower notes of the scale in the melody he sings before he actually “ asks ” us to sing them .
He ’s a clever chap .
But at the end of the day , he holds all the cards .
He ’s using a truly universal musical language .
After all , this is this is the scale that “ Mary Had A Little Lamb ” is written in , and that counts for a lot ; )
Music is natural , music is joyous , music is shared , music is universal , music is hard wired .
And I love it .
Ever used pentatonics in your music ?
Wonder if others feel the same way ?
If you go back in your memory for about 10 years ago you would remember the world was a much kinder place .
People seemed to see each other more – poking and chatting on Facebook do n’t count .
More importantly , you would always find people helping each other out .
Not to sound like my parents , and to control the amount of selective memory enhancements that I apply , I hit the web looking for examples of how kindness changed with the advent of the web .
One of the first things I came by was a wonderful talk ( embedded at the end of this post ) that was both inspiring and amusing .
From there , I kept on looking for how the web helped to make the world a better place – one person at time .
My findings give the impression that , if anything , the internet enabled many acts of kindness to occur .
According to some , the whole internet could collapse if it were n’t for those acts of kindness .
So here are some places on the net where kindness is alive , well and plentiful !
1. Free Rice
Feel good about yourself and have fun at the same time .
This website will make donations of rice in partnership with the WFP for every word you guess correctly .
Not much can be said about this site other than it ’s all around awesome .

2. Couch Surfing
What is more heart warming than opening up your home to a total stranger and allowing them to stay over without any expectation for anything in return but kindness ?
I know the concept sounds almost creepy , who in this day and age , allows a hitchhiker into his car never mind his home ?
Nonetheless the concept works brilliantly and there are plenty of happy people because of it !

3. Random Acts of Kindness
Part of the World Kindness Movement .
The idea is to inspire other people to be kind to each other and to lead by example .
The site is a resource for materials and ideas on how to be kind to your fellow humans , and how to pass on that message to your students , partners , faith group and so on .
And if the self satisfaction that kindness provides is not enough for you , you can share your random act of kindness too .
Remember to mark November 13th on your calendars !

4. Network for Good
The biggest on - line fund - raising site helping other nonprofits to raise money and communicate with supporters and organizers .
You can call it good and effective social networking and it definitely helped change the way funds are raised .

5. Wikipedia
What ’s more powerful than information ?
Free information but of course !
The impact that Wikipedia had on how information is accessed can not be understated and no one is more thankful than high school and university students !
The fact that a bunch of people that would come together to create , update and maintain an entire encyclopedia – for free - is a testament that there is a lot of kindness to go around in the world .

An Inspiration
Here is a video of Jonathan Zittrain talking about how the web is just a series of random acts of kindness ; a really interesting video ( about 20 min ) .
This was actually were I got the inspiration for this post , and as a matter of fact I think TED is one of the kindest places on the web since it allows a lot of people like me to get inspired and motivated through watching any of their many presentations that provide great insights into humanity and our world at large …
After watching the video , what do you think ?
Do you think the internet and social networks will allow people to express their kindness more often ?
What role do we have in propagating the wave of kindness around the world ?
Is joining a “ feel good group ” on Facebook enough to count as an act of kindness ?
Where do we draw the line ?
CSIRO scientist Dr Lincoln Paterson , who is researching carbon dioxide storage , says all the elements of the technology exist , but have yet to be tied into a power station .
A demonstration project at Loy Yang B is capturing carbon from flue gases .
And in a demonstration near Port Campbell last year , 60,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide was removed from one underground '' reservoir ' ' and piped into another two kilometres away .
'' If cost was not a factor you could do it today … but the reality is you can't ignore cost .
Cost is a critical element of the practicality , '' Paterson says .
Against this backdrop , Australia , a uranium exporter , has about 39 per cent of the world 's most easily accessible uranium ( but political restrictions mean it supplies 19 per cent of the world 's demand ) .
The Federal Government even admits that nuclear power helps reduce greenhouse emissions - but refuses to consider using it .
'' Nuclear power globally is part of the climate change solution , '' says federal Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson .
'' The Government accepts that and we are committed to the development of the uranium mining industry with all the associated safeguards .
Australia , unlike a lot of those other nations , is energy rich , hence our focus on the immediate energy options .
Here there is no requirement on us as a nation to go down the nuclear path .
'' It is the view of the Australian community that we should pursue all energy options other than nuclear . ''
While no proposal to explore nuclear energy has been prepared or is under consideration for cabinet , senior Government figures are speculating about what Australia 's options might be if renewable energy technologies and carbon capture do n't deliver sufficient cuts in emissions and adequate energy supply .
The Government expects Australia 's population to almost double to 35 million by 2049 .
Even with efficiencies , that is going to mean a big increase in electricity demand .
Professor John Price , of Monash University 's mechanical engineering department , says : '' We are reaching a point where there are no choices available to us .
What are we going to do in 10 years ' time ?
We are going to have electric cars .
We are going to have desalination plants in every capital city .
These are huge new demands that are not yet on our electricity system .
'' Nuclear energy requires carbon dioxide production during mining and construction , but after that it 's really zero . ''
Proponents of nuclear power say it is the only way to provide baseload power for a growing economy and meet climate change targets .
But in July three high - profile supporters gave up the cause .
Hugh Morgan , Ron Walker and Robert de Crespigny applied to deregister their company , Australian Nuclear Energy , in recognition of the Government 's hostility .
It had been set up in the last years of the Howard government , as the prime minister appointed former Telstra chief Dr Ziggy Switkowski to head an inquiry , which came down in favour of a domestic nuclear power industry .
Morgan says he believes Australia has left itself vulnerable to a future energy supply disaster by placing its hopes in unproven carbon capture and renewables : '' If you need high - voltage electricity to maintain any significant industry in the country you need regular baseload power that they can rely on in 20 or 30 years .
That is the umbilical cord to everyone else 's industrial investments . ''
He says 450 new nuclear plants are planned or under construction globally , which will double the existing number of plants .
But he fears even if Australia wanted to start building , because of global demand it would be way behind in the queue .
There is one Labor identity who has spoken out in support of an Australian nuclear industry .
National secretary of the Australian Workers ' Union Paul Howes says most of the opposition to nuclear power is seemingly from older people influenced by the Cold War nuclear disarmament movement .
'' People are worried about nuclear waste , but they are only now beginning to consider the environmental costs of coal , '' says Howes .
'' There are new generation reactors being developed which will largely eliminate radioactive waste .
They say nuclear is more expensive , but it becomes cheaper than coal when we add a carbon price as well as the costs of carbon capture . ''
Indeed , energy production has social costs that the independent Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering tried to quantify this year that are not included in any wholesale price .
These include effects on human health , climate and crops .
'' Combining greenhouse and health damage costs for Australia gives representative total external costs of $ 19 a megawatt hour for natural gas , $ 42 a megawatt hour for black coal and $ 52 a megawatt hour for brown coal , '' the academy says .
These '' external costs ' ' were found to be much lower for renewable and nuclear energy : from $ 1.50 for wind power , $ 5 for solar photovoltaic and up to $ 7 a megawatt hour for nuclear energy .
IT IS a sparkling , blue - skied day above the hills of Toora , near Wilsons Promontory .
From a distance the green ridges seem to have been colonised by a troupe of baton twirlers , as the blades of the wind farm respond to a rising south - westerly .
It is about 100 metres to the tops of the blades , prompting critics to lament the industrialisation of the landscape .
Still , wind is the most practical of renewable sources right now , clean and cheap .
Victoria has approved wind farms up to 2000 megawatt capacity ( one megawatt equals 1 million watts , roughly enough to power 400 homes a year ) , with another 2500 megawatts in prospect , but since it is an intermittent resource , wind delivers only a third of its nominated capacity .
If fully deployed , Victoria 's water desalination plant will consume 92 megawatts .
To compensate , AGL will build a wind farm of more than 300 megawatt capacity .
With more than 150 turbines , Macarthur will dwarf Toora 's 12 turbines , but wind energy is only ever a top - up to baseload power .
In Europe , particularly Germany , Denmark and Spain , experience has made energy authorities reinforce wind energy with baseload coal or nuclear up to 90 per cent of their potential .
Martin Ferguson adds that solar photovoltaic energy - which converts sunlight directly to electricity - is not a renewable energy answer .
Solar thermal energy may hold more potential .
A German company , Solar Millennium AG , has built several solar thermal plants in southern Spain that , by storing heat during the day , can run at full power for 7 ½ hours after sunset .
'' Now that we have thermal storage it is no longer true that solar energy is not a baseload electricity source , '' says Diesendorf .
Solar Millennium is looking to Australia for expansion through the Federal Government 's Solar Flagship program , but its existing plants are , at 50 megawatts , less than one - thirtieth the capacity of Hazelwood .
The solar cause also suffered a huge setback last month when Australia 's leading solar energy developer , Solar Systems , which was to build a 154 - megawatt power station in Mildura , went into liquidation .
The persistent doubt is that renewables may not economically deliver sufficient capacity to replace existing power stations .
Nuclear power , which does provide baseload power stations of similar capacity to coal , continues to be deeply opposed by many Australians .
A poll conducted this year by the Uranium Information Centre found the 40 to 55 years age group most trenchantly opposed to nuclear power .
This is the generation that grew up in the shadow of the Cold War ; that experienced the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s ; that witnessed Chernobyl and the breakdown of the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania , overlaid with cultural influences including films such as the apocalyptic Dr Strangelove and the nuclear industry conspiracies The China Syndrome and Silkwood .
In the face of climate change , younger people are less resistant .
However , the climate change threat has not diminished opposition from veteran anti-nuclear campaigner La Trobe University professor Joseph Camilleri .
'' I do n't think we have anywhere near a fully fledged , widely accepted , long - term system of waste disposal .
Until and unless that comes through … to be thinking of a substantial expansion of the industry is foolhardy , '' he says .
Equally pertinent , he says , is that while nuclear power , in theory , may help counter climate change , in practice it is problematic .
The reality is the sizeable expansion of nuclear energy would take place in parts of Asia and Latin America , which may not meet the operational and waste - handling challenges .
There would be serious questions about '' the technical , regulatory and other requirements , and whether on grounds of safety , waste disposal and proliferation they would be able to meet the standard that we currently accept in most parts of the industrialised West '' , Camilleri says .
But so - called fourth - generation nuclear reactors , which yield much more power with less nuclear fuel , actually consume large amounts of their own dangerous waste .
Some have already been successfully tested in pilot plants .
Neverthless , Mark Wakeham , director of Environment Victoria 's anti-Hazelwood campaign , says political and practical obstacles such as the long construction time for nuclear plants , stand in the way .
'' It takes decades and we do n't have decades , '' Wakeham says .
'' Every proposed nuclear power plant in the last two decades internationally has delivered over budget and has been significantly delayed .
Our view is it 's inherently problematic .
It 's a very large consumer of water so there 's very few locations that you could actually site a nuclear power station in Victoria .
Basically it would need to be near Port Phillip Bay or Western Port Bay , and if you reckon it's hard to get a wind farm constructed in Victoria at the moment , try building a nuclear power station . ''
Monash University 's Price , who has worked as an engineer in the UK nuclear power industry , says that the public perception in Australia is at odds with reality .
'' [ Nuclear energy ] is a great deal cheaper than wind power and solar power , though is more expensive than brown coal , '' Price says .
'' There have been very few large accidents .
In fact , only Chernobyl stands out , and that is not a reactor system that would have been approved in the West .
The other reactor systems have all had terrific records . ''
Although the Federal Government remains resolutely anti-nuclear , it has an agency that is quite the reverse .
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ( ANSTO ) runs Australia 's only nuclear plant at Lucas Heights in Sydney 's outer south - west , the 20 - megawatt OPAL reactor , a joint German - Argentinian design that opened last year .
( Lucas Heights was founded in 1958 in the early stages of the Cold War by the Menzies government with a 10 - megawatt reactor , which was mainly used for nuclear medicine . )
HEAD of ANSTO Ziggy Switkowski believes that in its opposition to nuclear power Australia is alone among developed countries committed to deep greenhouse reductions .
'' Australia stands alone in claiming that we are different , that we have a whole range of alternatives that in combination will get us to our target .
It is ambitious but the numbers just do n't work , '' he says .
'' [ We must ] provide for the next generation of baseload electricity generation with clean energy .
The only way to do that is with nuclear power .
There is no other alternative .
'' If we accept we want to move to a carbon - free economy by 2050 , while there will be contributions from solar , wind and geothermal , the largest driver of that transition globally will be nuclear power .
I do n't think the case can be made that Australia is different , because we are not . ''
CSIRO 's Lincoln Paterson says he is no advocate for the nuclear industry , but even accounting for the Chernobyl tragedy , nuclear is relatively low risk considering 6000 or so people die annually from coal mining in China .
'' There is a risk with nuclear , but there 's a pretty horrendous risk if we do nothing , '' Paterson says .
'' I 've flown in and out of Bangladesh and there are 160 million people within 10 metres of sea level , and you start wondering what 's going to happen to them .
'' Wind by itself can't do it .
Carbon capture and storage by itself can't do it .
Nuclear by itself can't do it .
It 's going to require all of those technologies to make a contribution , and that 's going to depend on where you are in the world and what the particular attributes of your country are . ''
It is , Camilleri says , one of the most serious challenges humanity has faced in the past several hundred years , calling for extraordinary political and technical responses .
And we are not there yet .
I understand the arguments for not breaking up or nationalizing the largest banks , both in general and in the middle of a crisis .
Those arguments are predicated on it being a bad idea , either too difficult or legally impossible .
One talking point that I have not heard is that large banks are good for the economy .
This is lobbyist talk , but let ’s hear it anyway .
From Simon Johnson :
Ms. FARRELL : We have created them [ our biggest banks ] , and we ’re sort of past that point , and I think that in some sense , the genie ’s out of the bottle and what we need to do is to manage them and to oversee them , as opposed to hark back to a time that we ’re unlikely to ever come back to or want to come back to . ”
That ’s not an argument .
Under what circumstances would our biggest banks be the best arrangement of the banking sector ?
It ’s important to realize how large the largest banks are .
Here is a list of the Top 50 Bank Holding Companies from the Fed .
I ’m going to give you two charts .
One is a histogram of those top 50 :
Since this is in thousands , e^9 represents trillions above .
Notice how fast the dropoff takes place .
The other is the top 20 , with an additional column for asset size as a multiple of the size of the 20th bank :
One potential argument is that something about the financial sector requires natural monopolies – clear leaders who can overcome informational and trust problems inherit in financial transactions , who can attract the top talent and thus allow the biggest players an extra level of certainty that they are dealing with the best .
Natural monopolies is common thought for sectors with large fixed costs and low - to - zero marginal costs and increasing returns to scale , something not true of banking .
But take a look at that ratio column .
We could take the top 4 banks , break them in half , and the halfs would clock in at ….1st , 2nd , 3rd and 6th .
See how far out the top players are in the histogram ?
Cutting the size of the largest banks would still likely leave them in the front of the pack , perhaps even by a distance .
And it ’s why I ’m skeptical of marginal changes ( higher capital requirements , for instance ) as drivers of shrinking the size of the largest banks , since they would have so far to shrink down .
Another argument is that the scale at which the financial sector moves at these days requires large financial leaders .
James Kwak grabs an obvious example , a large J&J bond issuance of $ 1.6bn , and shows that it splits up fine among several banks .
The managerial responsibility of bond issuers is executed with no problem at mid-sized banks ; I do n’t hear complaints otherwise .
Another argument is that there is some sort of risk management scaling to size .
The larger a bank gets , the better it is at diversifying , attracting risk - management talent , keeping losses down .
Here ’s a graph of expected loss , a measure of how poorly a bank has done , by asset size , taken from the Stress Test ( so reported by the bank ’s own models ) :
Notice the lack of variance among the big players there – they ’ve all taken a big hit in this crisis .
So I do n’t think there ’s a benefit to stability of the institutions themselves .
( Does anyone know how to get access to Bank Holding Documents in large data files ?
I want to aggregate and test this at a larger scale .
Email or comment if you do . )
How about consumers ?
I ’ve seen no evidence that larger banks help consumers , and indeed I ’ve seen evidence that as bank consolidation happens , large banks ‘ respond asymmetrically ’ to interest rate changes , so they raise rates with the Fed faster , and lower rates when the Fed lowers them slowers , milking consumers .
That ’s exactly what you ’d expect someone with market power to do .
In the next week I ’ll see if I can get some historical data in here , but comparing the size , both absolute and relative , of the largest bank - holding companies now against the period from 1980 - 1999 , it does n’t strike me at all that the mergers and consolidation that has taken place has lead to better growth for the country .
The Federal Communications Commission wants to know if consumers are getting the advertising and billing information they need to make good choices about their broadband and / or mobile phone plans , and the answers are coming in from trade and reform groups .
Not surprisingly , they read like alternate reality documents .
To peruse CTIA - The Wireless Association 's 157 - page response to the FCC , you might come away with the impression that mobile owners swoon with joy upon the arrival of their monthly statement .
Meanwhile the comments of the Consumer Federation of America and five similar groups portray a dark , foggy ad landscape where Jane Q. Broadband - user stumbles about , at best only vaguely aware of how many ways her pocket is about to be picked .
But buried within the mountain of PDF feedback the FCC is getting is a somewhat intriguing idea .
Why not simplify the whole disclosure process , the agency 's inquiry asked , by borrowing something from the regulated credit card industry : a " Schumer Box , " as it is called .
CFA and the gang think it 's a grand plan , calling the box " a consumer - friendly format to provide specific and easily comprehensible information , standardized across service providers to enable easy comparison . "
Needless to say , CTIA is far less enthusiastic about the proposal , warning that imposing it on wireless could result in a reduction of services .
So what is this box , anyway ?
Assertive presentations
The Schumer Box , you will not be surprised to learn , is named after United States Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) , who championed the Truth - in - Lending legislation that requires credit card companies to carefully format their services to consumers as so : long term interest rates in at least 18 point type , and other important stuff in 12 point type .
Inside the box , the company must disclose seven categories of information : any annual fee , the annual percentage rate for purchases , rates for cash advances and other services , grace periods , the card 's system of calculating interest , and whatever the card dings for late payments or for going over your credit limit , among other monetary head noogies .
The box requirement went into effect in 2000 .
The United Kingdom implemented its own version in 2004 ( they do n't call it a Schumer box there , of course ) .
New America Foundation 's prototype Schumer Box for broadband customers
Most consumer groups are big boosters of Schumerizing the broadband / wireless industry .
The New America Foundation has gone so far as to offer the FCC its own prototype of a Schumer Box , applied to broadband .
The ExampleCom " Ultra 15 Mbps " broadband service 's boxed bill starts by disclosing the " advertised speed : " 15 Mbps downstream / 2
Mbps upstream .
Then comes the " Minimum Speed at Border Router : " 8 M bps downstream / 384 Kbps upstream , followed by the " Minimum Reliability / Uptime : " 96 percent .
The rest of the disclosure document outlines ExampleCom 's service guarantee terms , its monthly service price and duration of that price if it's a long term plan , service limits ( " Exceeding 100 GB calendar week considered excessive use " in this case ) , extra costs like installation fees , the technology being used to provide service , and ExampleCom 's privacy policies .
" This Broadband Truth - in - Labeling disclosure must be shown to the consumer as part of the sign - up process , " New America urges , " and must be assertively presented again any time the ISP decide to alter the terms in such a way that alters the facts on the original Broadband Truth - in - Labeling disclosure . "
No more fine print
Consumer groups say something like this is necessary because wireless / broadband buyers are " bombarded " with confusing , often contradictory data about the services companies offer .
" When trying to find clear information from providers about actual rather than advertised speeds ; " they write , or about other costs , barriers , and fees , " most consumers ca n’t get a clear signal through all the advertising noise . "
CFA et al cite a Verizon mailer advertisement as an example ( it 's included at the bottom of their filing in Appendix B ) .
The ad offers $ 19.99 a month for DSL , but only in fine print does the reader learn that a one - year agreement is required and the price goes up after six months .
" Fine print is also used to disclose while effectively hiding a one time charge of 'up to $ 55 , ' and mandatory subscription to Verizon telephone service , in order to receive the service at the advertised base price , " the commentary notes .
Highly unreliable
CTIA takes issue with assertions that advertising for wireless services is deceptive .
But the trade group also raises concerns about various aspects of the Schumer Box idea .
First , CTIA notes that wired and wireless broadband services are fundamentally different in some key ways .
It 's much harder to predict actual wireless speeds , as opposed to broadband speeds , the group contends — citing the challenge of assessing how many consumers are sharing a wireless area , as opposed to , say , a broadband cable node .
So forcing wireless companies to come up with a guestimate " would be a highly unreliable way of providing consumers information about the service . "
" The likely result of the imposition of a ' Schumer Box ' would be a reduction in innovative service offerings and bundles , " CTIA warns .
Still , it 's probable that Schumer Box fans will respond that wireline and wireless differences can be taken into account when designing a Schumer format for these services .
Our guess is that there will be more thinking inside the box about this proposal .
WASHINGTON
Successful economic ideas usually end up being taken too far .
Democrats dominated the middle part of the 20th century , thanks in part to their vigorous response to the Great Depression .
They used the government to soften the effects of the Depression and to build the modern safety net .
But they failed to see the limits of the government ’s ability to manage the economy and helped usher in the stagflation of the 1970s .
Ronald Reagan then came to power promising to cut taxes and unleash the forces of the market .
And the Democrats spent the next dozen years struggling to absorb the lessons of their failures .
More than a few people believe the Republican Party is in a similar place today .
When I asked Dale Jorgenson , the eminent expert on productivity ( and a Republican ) , what had been the positive aspects of President George W. Bush ’s economic policy , Mr. Jorgenson said , “ I do n’t see any redeeming features , unfortunately . ”
After Republicans opposed the stimulus package this year , The Financial Times , not exactly a liberal organ , called the party ’s ideology harebrained .
When Olympia Snowe was recently explaining why she might be the only Republican senator to vote for health reform , she suggested it was because her party had moved so far to the right .
But perhaps the most persistent  and thought - provoking  conservative critic of the party has been Bruce Bartlett .
Mr. Bartlett has worked for Jack Kemp and Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush .
He has been a fellow at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation .
He wants the estate tax to be reduced , and he thinks that President Obama should not have taken on health reform or climate change this year .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EnF-CWLQtcThat the ability to count may be inborn struck me as a boon for people who struggle with math .
" Let 's say you 're God-awful at math , " I asked Brian Butterworth , a University College , London researcher who found that Australian aboriginal kids – their languages free of words for numbers , or even a concept of precise counting – count as well as their English - speaking counterparts .
" Does this mean it 's not your fault , that you 're born that way ? "
Not quite .
Numbers , explained Butterworth , are n't the same thing as math .
" There are other aspects of math which do n't depend on this capacity , " he said .
In fact , he 's conducted research on people who are biologically incapable of counting – a phenomena known as dyscalculism .
" I 've met mathematicians who I suspect are dyscalculic , " said Butterworth .
There you have it : I 'm worse at math than people who can't count .

Ben Stein's TV ads for a scuzzy " free " credit product have finally caught up to him :
The New York Times has fired Stein as a Sunday business columnist for violating ethics guidelines .
Stein was pilloried online for his endorsement of the bait - and - switch operation , which offers a free credit score but charges an outrageous $ 30 per month to see the credit report behind the score .
As Reuters blogger Felix Salmon pointed out , consumers can get a free online report under federal law .
The Times ' issue , though , is that Stein has violated its ethics policy , which states " it is an inherent conflict for a journalist to perform public relations work , paid or unpaid . "
Salmon blogged about that issue , too .
It 's surprising that it has n't come up until now ; Stein has been a regular contributor to the Times for four years , and is quite recognizable to TV audiences .
After playing a high - school teacher in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller 's Day Off ( R.I.P. John Hughes ) , Stein went on to host two shows on Comedy Central , including the Emmy - award - winning Win Ben Stein 's Money , and a show on VH1 .
He also frequently appeared in cameo roles on sitcoms like Seinfeld .
A tipster informed us this morning that Stein had been given the boot , and Times spokesperson Catherine Mathis has confirmed , writing :
Ben Stein 's fine work for us as a columnist for Sunday Business had to end , we told him , after we learned that he had become a commercial spokesman for FreeScore , a financial services company .
Ben did n't understand when he signed on with FreeScore that this might pose a potential conflict for him as a contributing columnist for the Times , because he had n't written about credit scores or this company .
But , we decided that being a commercial spokesman for FreeScore while writing his column would n't be appropriate .
We are sorry to lose him as a columnist , and appreciate his work for the Times over the years .
Stein retains his career as a sometime TV pundit ( Fox News , CBS Sunday Morning , CNBC ) , his column on Yahoo !
Finance and his " diary " at American Spectator , the once - fearsome conservative journal .
He also has any residuals from his reviled anti-evolution movie .
We wonder if Stein will continue calling himself an " economist , " as he did in the Times ...
... even though his only economics degree is a B.A. , from Columbia .
We never understood how he had earned the " economist " label , but , at this point , whatever .

During my lunch break I meandered my way along the canals and through the narrow alleys to the local book - store .
This book - store is pretty big , five floors filled with millions of books .
They 've got this huge eating area which always smells delicious .
My favorite section of course is the computers section ( followed by modern literature , and then science , and then psychology ) .
Several weeks ago , I was there and noticed that there were very few Perl books on the shelves .
Only two measly copies of Mastering Regular Expressions and one copy of Learning Perl whose cover had an ugly crease in it .
With a rather disappointed look on my face , I asked the guy how come there were so few Perl books .
He shook his head and told me that lately they just were n't that popular .
The previous day he had re-ordered some titles , and they 'd arrive in about a week or so .
Well there I was three weeks later , and there was not a single Perl book to be found .
Just an empty spot becoming ever so cluttered with overflowing JavaScript and ActionScript books which were taking over the section dedicated to Scripts .
What a sad day for me .
I believe it is high time to come out with some new titles .
If I had more time on my hands maybe I 'd try to write a book .
There are many talented writers out there and perhaps they are coming up with some creative variations on the subject .
Hopefully with all of the new and exciting Perl -ish happenings on the rise , there will be a new barrage of literature appearing on the shelves some day in the not so distant future .
Until then I 'll just have to be patient and scour the Internet looking for interesting tidbits in order to satiate my hunger .
( New York ) - Governments in countries with caste systems should respond to the call from a top UN official to end this form of discrimination , Human Rights Watch , the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights ( NCDHR ) , and the International Dalit Solidarity Network ( IDSN ) said today .
The organizations urged governments in South Asia and other regions to cooperate with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , who has issued a strong call to end caste discrimination .
In an opinion article , Pillay stated that " the time has come to eradicate the shameful concept of caste , " and called on the international community to come together " as it did when it helped put an end to apartheid . "
She argued that " other seemingly insurmountable walls , such as slavery and apartheid , have been dismantled in the past " and concluded that " we can and must tear down the barriers of caste too . "
" Governments in India and other caste - affected countries should support the new UN framework to eliminate caste discrimination , " said Rikke Nöhrlind , coordinator , International Dalit Solidarity Network .
" It is time for these nations to cooperate with the UN to address a human rights issue that affects 260 million people . "
The high commissioner 's strong stance has been welcomed by Dalit rights groups , particularly in South Asia .
As many as 200 million victims of caste discrimination live in India .
Nepal , Bangladesh , Pakistan and Sri Lanka also have sizeable Dalit populations , and communities in Africa , Yemen , and Japan are similarly affected .
" Dalits and similarly discriminated - against communities across the globe have been oppressed for thousands of years , " said Paul Divakar , general secretary of the NCDHR in India .
" India 's ban on caste - based discrimination will not be effective unless the government makes it a priority to enforce it .
Violence and other human rights abuses against Dalits are still committed with impunity .
The government should work with the international community to address this problem . "
A key step for caste - affected countries , the groups said , is to adopt the UN principles and guidelines on caste discrimination - the first comprehensive UN framework to prevent and address this serious human rights problem .
In her article , Pillay called on " all states to rally around and endorse these norms . "
The adoption of the guidelines could lead to the establishment of a UN monitoring mechanism on caste discrimination .
Nepal recently expressed its support for the guidelines , describing them as a " good reference " and " useful tools , " and the EU also expressed support .
" Nepal 's response is an example for other governments , " said Brad Adams , Asia director at Human Rights Watch .
" Political will to end this scourge is needed at all levels of government to alter traditional attitudes and turn well - meaning laws into reality . "
Background
Caste discrimination is any distinction , exclusion , restriction , or preference based on inherited status such as work and descent , commonly originating from a division of society into castes or social categories .
This chronic human rights problem , which is associated with the notion of impurity , pollution and practices of ‘ untouchability ' , involves massive violations of civil , political , economic , social , and cultural rights .
It is estimated that 260 million people are affected by caste discrimination , especially in South Asia - where they are known as Dalits - but also in Japan , Yemen , and several African countries .
The social exclusion and segregation suffered by Dalits is comparable to conditions during South Africa 's apartheid regime .
The draft UN principles and guidelines for the effective elimination of discrimination based on work and descent are contained in the final report on this subject , which was published by the Human Rights Council in May 2009 .
This framework is based on existing human rights principles and obligations , and proposes general and special measures to be taken by multiple stakeholders , including governments , multilateral bodies and private actors .
On September 17 , 2009 , a group of international nongovernmental organizations , the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Nepal joined forces with victims of caste discrimination at a side event in Geneva to inform governments about the guidelines .
The event triggered a considerable amount of media debate .
Several UN bodies have reaffirmed that discrimination based on work and descent - the UN terminology for caste discrimination - is prohibited by international human rights law , and that it is a global human rights phenomenonwhich should be addressed comprehensively through existing human rights mechanisms .

French police have arrested an engineer who worked at Cern , Europe 's Switzerland - based nuclear research organisation , on suspicion that he had links to al - Qaida in Algeria .
One of two French - Algerian brothers , aged 25 and 32 , arrested yesterday in Vienne , south - east France , was an engineer at the nuclear research centre on the French - Swiss border just outside Geneva , it emerged today .
The men were arrested on suspicion of being in close contact with al - Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , also known as al - Qaida 's north African wing .
Le Figaro reported that the older brother who worked at Cern , famous for its particle collider that aims to recreate the conditions of the Big Bang , had been in contact with AQIM and had suggested French targets for attacks .
A judicial source confirmed that one of the brothers had been in contact with people close to the organisation but said there was no indication of a clearly established plot at this stage .
Cern issued a statement saying the man was a physicist who had worked at the centre since 2003 , specialising in physics data analysis .
The organisation said he had " never been in contact with any element that could be used for terrorist ends " and no research at Cern was used for military applications .
The physicist was not employed by Cern but was a contractor with another institute .
The European laboratory which specialises in high - energy particle physics is famous for what has been dubbed the world 's biggest science experiment , the Large Hadron Collider which was intended to recreate the conditions of the origin of the universe but hit difficulties days after being started up .
AQIM , al - Qaida 's north African wing , has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the French embassy in Mauritania , that wounded three people in August .
Liverpool have sold out of the £ 10 " Beach Set " that diverted the team 's title prospects at Sunderland and will search Manchester United supporters for any offending items , including beach balls , before Sunday 's Premier League clash at Anfield .
The club 's online store has experienced a rush on the " Beach Set " package following Darren Bent 's winning goal at the Stadium of Light on Saturday , when his shot struck a Liverpool - crested beach ball and ricocheted beyond goalkeeper José Reina .
United supporters are suspected of being behind the increased demand for Liverpool beach products , with a " tribute " to Bent 's goal planned but risk having them confiscated at the turnstiles on Sunday .
" It will be the normal search policy , " said a Liverpool spokesperson .
Rafael Benítez , who refused to use Bent 's goal as an excuse for Liverpool 's fourth league defeat of the season , has no intention of asking for the Sunderland match to be replayed .
Precedent exists for replaying matches when a referee has erred over a goal but the Liverpool manager said : " A lot of people are saying this but we will not be asking for a replay . "
Mike Jones , the referee at the centre of the controversy , has been removed from the Premier League match list for this weekend having allowed Bent 's effort to stand when the game should have been stopped due to " outside interference " .
Jones will take charge of Peterborough versus Scunthorpe in the Championship .
The Liverpool manager remains aggrieved at the manner of Saturday 's defeat but offered his sympathy yesterday for the match official .
" I think that the rule is very clear , everybody knows and all the experts agree that the goal had to be disallowed but we cannot do anything now so we have to move forward , " said the Spaniard .
" I do n't know if the referee did n't know , maybe he could n't see .
Anyway , I think that is better to move on .
I think the referees and Keith Hackett know that a mistake has been made but I do not want to criticise .
He is a young referee and there are not too many referees around the world so if you have someone who has a passion and wants to be a good referee then the best thing to do is to just move on . "
Benítez , meanwhile , has denied Liverpool 's season has reached crisis point ahead of tonight 's Champions League group tie with Lyon and believes the visit of the French club , plus United on Sunday , can transform the club 's disappointing form .
Liverpool will welcome back Steven Gerrard tonight , after the captain missed Saturday 's defeat with an adductor strain , but Fernando Torres remains sidelined with a similar problem .
There was a reason the White House sent out Obama ’s top three advisers to the talk shows today .
As I said below , “ they ’re selling something as we approach the final push for health insurance reform . ”
Unfortunately , what they ’re selling , most of us are n’t buying .
Today , the White House message is : “ We ’re getting soft on the public option . ”
So , it ’s clear the Rahm wing ( and not Jarrett and Axelrod ) ) is controlling the message and the strategy .
That ’s not good :
Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said Obama believes the public plan is still the ” best possible choice , ” but she said he ’s not demanding it .
David Axelrod , Obama ’s top adviser , said Senate opposition in both parties means ” we have to work through these issues . ”
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , who is deeply involved with congressional Democrats in trying to merge the various committee proposals , also appeared to set aside the public option .
” It ’s not the defining piece of health care .
It ’s whether we achieve both cost control , coverage , as well as the choice , ” Emanuel said .
I just do n’t think these folks get how , hmmm , how can I put this , how nonsensical it sounds to say , Obama really thinks the public option is “ the best possible choice , ” but he wo n’t fight for it .
Maybe they think that messaging works .
It does n’t .
Sounds weak .
If he ’s not going to fight for the “ best possible choice , ” what will he fight for ?
That ’s the question I have .
Obama would be wise to listen to Jarrett and Axelrod on this one .
They ’ve been with him longer .
Cairo , Egypt ( CNN ) --
Between 15 and 20 people died when two trains collided outside of Cairo , Egypt , Saturday night , and officials expect the death toll to rise , the country 's Health Ministry said .
Another 40 to 50 people were injured when one train traveling from Cairo to Asyut crashed into a train en route from Giza to Fayyoum , Deputy to the Health Ministry Mohammed Sarhan told state - run Nile News TV .
The Fayyoum - bound train was stationary when it was struck in Al - Ayyat district , he said .
The collision occured in Kafr Girza , a village in Al - Ayyat district of October 6th province , Nile News TV reported .
Al - Ayyat is about 70 km ( 40 miles ) south of Cairo .
The wreck 's location posed a problem for emergency personnel , Sarhan said , because the site is next to a canal .
Security forces used tree trunks and branches to create a bridge to the dead and injured .
Some bodies were recovered from beneath the trains , he said .
People were still trapped beneath the wreckage late Saturday , Nile News TV reported .
Some of the dead were found buried under the trains , Sarhan said .
Eighty ambulances were sent to the scene to transport the injured to local hospitals , government spokesman Ahmed Rady said in a statement .
The Transportation Ministry has ordered an investigation , Rady said .
Government investigators are searching for the train 's recorders , reported the country 's official news agency , MENA .
Egyptian National Railways also launched an investigation into the collision of their trains , MENA said .
The governor of October 6th province ordered that families of the victims recieve compensation , MENA reported .
The Egyptian government has issued compensation to families of train crash fatalities and to those injured in crashes in the past .
Train disasters in Egypt over the past 12 years have killed hundreds .
In August 2006 at least 57 people died and 128 were injured when two passenger trains collided and burst into flames in Qalyoubiya Province , just north of Cairo .
A month later three people died and 24 were injured when a cargo train collided with a passenger train in the same area .
More than 370 people died in February 2002 when a fire broke out near the rear of a passenger train en route to Luzzur from Cairo .
At least 44 passengers died when they leapt from the burning cars while the train was still moving .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Freshman U.S. Rep .
Alan Grayson refused to back down Wednesday from remarks made on the House floor the night before , in which he said the Republican health care plan calls for sick people to " die quickly . "
Rep . Alan Grayson , D - Florida , made the " die quickly " remark on the House floor Tuesday night .
In fact , Grayson , a Democrat who represents a central Florida swing district that includes Orlando , made another floor speech in which he apologized to the dead and their families for not acting sooner on health care reform .
He then defended both speeches on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
" What I mean is they have got no plan , " Grayson told Wolf Blitzer .
" It 's been 24 hours since I said that .
Where is the Republican plan ?
We 're all waiting to see something that will take care of the pre-existing conditions , to take care of the 40 million Americans who have no coverage at all .
" That 's what I meant when I said that the Republican plan is do n't get sick .
And if you do get sick , die quickly . "
Watch Grayson defend comments »
Republicans pounced on Grayson 's late - night speech and demanded an apology .
Watch Grayson's " die quickly " remark on House floor »
" That is about the most mean - spirited partisan statement that I 've ever heard made on this floor , and I , for one , do n't appreciate it , " Rep. Jimmy Duncan , R - Tennessee , told Politico .
On Wednesday , Grayson apologized , but it was n't the apology the Republicans wanted .
Citing a Harvard University study released this month that said 44,000 Americans die each year because they have no health insurance , Grayson called on Democrats and Republicans " to do our jobs for the sake of those dying people and their families . "
Do n't Miss Public option : ' Nothing is ever dead on Capitol Hill '
Public option : ' Nothing is ever dead on Capitol Hill ' Senate panel votes down public option
Senate panel votes down public option Examining the health care debate
" I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America , " he said .
That prompted National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Ken Spain to issue a stinging rebuke , saying Grayson is " doubling down on his despicable remarks , and he is dragging his party with him . "
" This is an individual who has established a pathological pattern of unstable behavior , " Spain said .
" He is derailing the national debate on health care reform and embarrassing his constituents as a result . "
But in a spirited discussion on CNN that included Democratic strategist James Carville and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos , Grayson stood his ground .
He rejected the suggestion that his remarks were the political equivalent of South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson 's shout of , " You lie , " at the president during his nationally televised speech on health care .
" I did n't insult the president in front of 40 million people , " he said . " ...
When you do n't have a plan , what that means is your plan is do n't get sick .
So what I said is true .
What Joe Wilson said , on the other hand , is false . "
Castellanos insisted that Republicans agreed with the Democrats on pre-existing conditions and would " stand with him 100 percent " if the president added such Republican - backed proposals as tort reform and allowing citizens to shop across state lines for insurance -- a strategy Democrats say will drive insurance companies into the states with the most lax regulations .
" The congressman is at least giving the chance for the Republicans to look responsible .
It 's not fair to say that the Republicans have no plan .
They actually do , " said Castellanos , whose campaigns include those of George W. Bush in 2004 , Mitt Romney in 2008 , Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the late Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina in the 1990s .
Carville , who was Bill Clinton 's lead strategist during his successful run for the presidency in 1992 and worked on Hillary Clinton 's campaign last year , congratulated Grayson for having " the courage to go up and say what he said . "
But Carville backed away from Grayson when the congressman said that Republicans he believes are obstructing health care reform are " foot - dragging , knuckle - dragging Neanderthals . "
" I would call [ them ] regressive as opposed to Neanderthal , " Carville said .
Grayson also rejected comparisons between his comments and those of some Republicans , including former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , that the Democratic reform plan called for " death panels " to decide who would get life - saving treatments .
" I said to myself , ' I wish Sarah Palin read the bill . '
That 's not what this bill says .
That 's a scare tactic , " he said .
" What I said is the God 's honest truth . "
Grayson said he decided to deliver his after - hours speech Tuesday after the Harvard study was released and he realized " we can not go on any longer in this country where people cannot afford health care , where the coverage they got is good until they need it . "
Calling for universal health care , he slammed " whoever it is that 's causing the Republicans to fight tooth - and - nail against anything , absolutely anything , to have every vote come down to being 257 to 175 in the House , over and over and over again . "
" Those are the people who are really disserving Americans , " he said .

Cruising is not a Sex Act as KTVB Channel 7 recently reported .
Cruising is an activity aimed at capturing the attention of someone of the same sex .
It can lead to a sexual encounter , but it can also be a non-verbal way to communicate to others that they are not alone .
In the 1970s , gay men established a color - coded technique called the â€œhanky codeâ€ as a way to find a sexual encounter .
Today , it is looked at as nostalgic since it has become mainstream .
Further back in time , certain word - phrases would be meaningless to heterosexuals , but would signal a possible encounter between gay men .
Long before the Stonewall Bar riots , a simple question such as â€ œDo you have the time ? â€ would be a signal .
Another was to ask someone if they are â€œa friend of Dorothy.â€ 
The pre-AIDS era of anonymous sex with anyone , anyplace , and anytime has for the most part faded away .
However , closeted gay men or men who to self - identify as heterosexual still seek out same - sex encounters .
The toe - tapping routine of former Sen. Larry Craig is pretty much considered old school , unless of course youâ€ ™re fearful of being known as queer .
The information that KTVB Ch - 7 disclosed about cruising techniques are considered laughable by many gay people today .
But they still serve a purpose in places where being known or suspected as being gay is risky at best .
Channel 7 did its viewers and the LGBT community a disservice when it aired reporter Ysabel Bilbaoâ€™s piece that centered on a man who exposed himself to an undercover cop .
This was a misdemeanor charge that amounted to , basically , a non-news story .
But because the location of the arrest had resulted in men being busted several years ago , KTVB saw an opportunity to make it into a â€œcruising for sexâ€ story .
Cruising is the consequence and a legacy of those living in a culture of fear where men have been beaten , jailed or killed if their same - sex orientation was divulged .
The dark days of 1955 was clearly illustrated in the book the â€œThe Boys of Boiseâ€  where author John G. Gerassi describes witch hunts against suspected homosexuals being perpetrated by the police , the media , and judges .
The Idaho Daily Statesman ( forerunner to The Idaho Statesman ) ran the headline , THREE BOISE MEN ADMIT SEX CHARGES .
The rest , as they say , is history .
But when the local Boise media creates news by jumping on the arrest of a man who dropped his pants in front of a cop , then manufactures it into a â€œgayâ€ fear story , the cold chill of 1955 comes back to haunt people here .
The local Boise media needs to just grow up .
Cruising Lesson ( Part 1 ) : Exposing ones self in pubic or having sex in a public place is not cruising .
Cruising is the seeking of a clandestine liaison .
Typically this occurs under the radar of others who might not be so inclined .
Once a connection has been made , they leave the scene and go to a private location .
Cruising Lesson ( Part 2 ) : There is a cultural significance to cruising and how gay , bi , or men who self - identify as straight have historically found each other .
Throughout history , and to a great extent even today , men interested in same - sex encounters must figure out ways to communicate with each other .
KTVB would have viewers believe that this non-verbal form of communication is only about sex .

You will never be out of work if you can demonstrably offer one of the following :
Sales
Additive effort
Initiation
Sales speaks for itself .
If you can sell enough to cover what you cost and then some , there will always be someone waiting to hire you .
Additive effort is distinguished from bureaucracy or feel - good showing up .
Additive effort generates productivity far greater than the overhead you add to the organization .
If your skills make the assembly line go twice as fast , or the sales force becomes more effective , or the travel office cuts its costs , then you 've produced genuine value .
That surly receptionist at the doctor 's office–she 's just filling a chair .
The third skill is the most difficult to value , but is ultimately the most valuable .
If you 're the person who can initiate useful action , if you 're the one who makes something productive or transformative happen , then smart organizations will treasure you .
Why We 're Losing The War On Cancer [ And How To Win It ] [ Avastin , Erbitux , Gleevec ...
The new wonder drugs might make you think we 're finally beating this dreaded scourge .
We 're not .
Here 's how to turn the fight around . ]
( FORTUNE Magazine ) –
It 's strange to think that I can still remember the smell after all this time .
The year was 1978 , not long after my 15th birthday , and I 'd sneaked into my brother 's bedroom .
There , on a wall of shelves that stretched to the ceiling , were the heaviest books we had in our house -- 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica .
The maroon spines were coated in a film of dust , I remember .
The pages smelled as if a musty old pillow had been covered in mint .
I carefully pulled out the volume marked HALICARNASSUS TO IMMINGHAM and turned to the entry for Hodgkin 's disease .
It took forever to read the half - dozen paragraphs , the weighty book spread open on my lap like a Bible .
There was talk of a mysterious " lymphatic system , " of " granulomas " and " gamma rays , " as though this disease -- the one the doctor had just told me I had -- was something out of science fiction .
But the last line I understood all too well : Seventy - five percent of the people who got it would die within five years .
As it turns out , I did not die from Hodgkin's , though the cancer had already spread from my neck to my lungs and spleen .
I lost my spleen to surgery and most of my hair to chemotherapy and radiation .
But I was lucky enough to get into a clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute that was testing a new combination therapy -- four toxic chemicals , together called MOPP , plus those invisible gamma rays , which flowed from an enormous cobalt 60 machine three stories below ground .
The nurses who stuck needles in my arm were so kind I fell in love with them .
The brilliant doctor who tattooed the borders of an imaginary box on my chest , then zapped me with radiation for four weeks , had warm pudgy hands and a comic look of inspiration , as though he'd thought of something funny just before entering the exam room .
The American taxpayer even footed the bill .
Most of all , of course , I was lucky to survive .
So it makes the question I am about to ask sound particularly ungrateful :
Why have we made so little progress in the War on Cancer ?
The question may come as a shock to anyone who has witnessed a loved one survive the dread disease -- or marveled at Lance Armstrong powering to his fifth Tour de France victory after beating back testicular cancer , or received a fundraising letter saying that a cure is within our grasp .
Most recently , with media reports celebrating such revolutionary cancer medicines as Gleevec , Herceptin , Iressa , Erbitux , and the just - approved Avastin , the cure has seemed closer than ever .
But it 's not .
Hope and optimism , so essential to this fight , have masked some very real systemic problems that have made this complex , elusive , relentless foe even harder to defeat .
The result is that while there have been substantial achievements since the crusade began with the National Cancer Act in 1971 , we are far from winning the war .
So far away , in fact , that it looks like losing .
Just count the bodies on the battlefield .
In 2004 , cancer will claim some 563,700 of your family , friends , co-workers , and countrymen .
More Americans will die of cancer in the next 14 months than have perished in every war the nation has ever fought ... combined .
Even as research and treatment efforts have intensified over the past three decades and funding has soared dramatically , the annual death toll has risen 73 % -- over one and a half times as fast as the growth of the U.S. population .
Within the next decade , cancer is likely to replace heart disease as the leading cause of U.S. deaths , according to forecasts by the NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
It is already the biggest killer of those under 75 .
Among those ages 45 to 64 , cancer is responsible for more deaths than the next three causes ( heart disease , accidents , and stroke ) put together .
It is also the leading disease killer of children , thirtysomethings -- and everyone in between .
Researchers point out that people live a lot longer than they used to , and since cancer becomes more prevalent with age , it 's unfair to look just at the raw numbers when assessing progress .
So when they calculate the mortality rate , they adjust it to compare cancer fatalities by age group over time .
But even using this analysis ( in which the proportion of elderly is dialed back to what it was during the Nixon administration ) , the percentage of Americans dying from cancer is about the same as in 1970 ... and in 1950 .
The figures are all the more jarring when compared with those for heart disease and stroke - - other ailments that strike mostly older Americans .
Age - adjusted death rates for those diseases have been slashed by an extraordinary 59 % and 69 % , respectively , during the same half - century .
Researchers also say more people are surviving longer with cancer than ever .
Yet here , too , the complete picture is more disappointing .
Survival gains for the more common forms of cancer are measured in additional months of life , not years .
The few dramatic increases in cure rates and patient longevity have come in a handful of less common malignancies -- including Hodgkin's , some leukemias , carcinomas of the thyroid and testes , and most childhood cancers .
( It 's worth noting that many of these successes came in the early days of the War on Cancer . )
Thirty - three years ago , fully half of cancer patients survived five years or more after diagnosis .
The figure has crept up to about 63 % today .
Yet very little of this modest gain is the result of exciting new compounds discovered by the NCI labs or the big cancer research centers -- where nearly all the public 's money goes .
Instead , simple behavioral changes such as quitting smoking have helped lower the incidence of deadly lung cancer .
More important , with the help of breast self - exams and mammography , PSA tests for prostate cancer , and other testing , we 're catching more tumors earlier .
Ruth Etzioni , a biostatistician at Seattle 's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , points out that when you break down the Big Four cancers ( lung , colon and rectal , breast , and prostate ) by stage -- that is , how far the malignant cells have spread -- long - term survival for advanced cancer has barely budged since the 1970s ( see charts opposite ) .
And the new cases keep coming .
Even with a dip in the mid-1990s , the incidence rate has skyrocketed since the War on Cancer began .
This year an additional 1.4 million Americans will have that most frightening of conversations with their doctor .
One in two men and one in three women will get the disease during their lifetime .
As a veteran Dana - Farber researcher sums up , " It is as if one World Trade Center tower were collapsing on our society every single day . "
So why are n't we winning this decades - old war on terror -- and what can we do now to turn it around ?
That was the question I asked dozens of researchers , physicians , and epidemiologists at leading cancer hospitals around the country ; pharmacologists , biologists , and geneticists at drug companies and research centers ; officials at the FDA , NCI , and NIH ; fundraisers , activists , and patients .
During three months of interviews in Houston , Boston , New York , San Francisco , Washington , D.C. , and other cancer hubs , I met many of the smartest and most deeply committed people I 've ever known .
The great majority , it should be said , were optimistic about the progress we 're making , believing that the grim statistics belie the wealth of knowledge we 've gained -- knowledge , they say , that will someday lead to viable treatments for the 100 - plus diseases we group as cancer .
Most felt , despite their often profound misgivings about the way research is done , that we 're on the right path .
Yet virtually all these experts offered testimony that , when taken together , describes a dysfunctional " cancer culture " -- a groupthink that pushes tens of thousands of physicians and scientists toward the goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs ; that fosters isolated ( and redundant ) problem solving instead of cooperation ; and rewards academic achievement and publication over all else .
At each step along the way from basic science to patient bedside , investigators rely on models that are consistently lousy at predicting success -- to the point where hundreds of cancer drugs are thrust into the pipeline , and many are approved by the FDA , even though their proven " activity " has little to do with curing cancer .
" It 's like a Greek tragedy , " observes Andy Grove , the chairman of Intel and a prostate - cancer survivor , who for years has tried to shake this cultural mindset as a member of several cancer advisory groups .
" Everybody plays his individual part to perfection , everybody does what 's right by his own life , and the total just does n't work . "
Tragedy , unfortunately , is the perfect word for it .
Heroic figures battling forces greater than themselves .
Needless death and destruction .
But unlike Greek tragedy , where the Fates predetermine the outcome , the nation 's cancer crusade did n't have to play out this way .
And it does n't have to stay this way .

Go back as far as Watson and Crick , to the discovery of the structure of DNA , and the feat was still achieved in a mere half - century .
Cancer researchers hate such comparisons .
Good science , say many , can't be managed .
( Well , sure , maybe easy stuff like nuclear physics , rocket science , and genetics -- but not cancer . )
And to be sure , cancer is a challenge like no other .
The reason is that this killer has a truly uncanny ability to change its identity .
" The hallmark of a cancer cell is its genetic instability , " says Isaiah " Josh " Fidler , professor and chair of the department of cancer biology at Houston 's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center .
The cell 's DNA is not fixed the way a normal cell 's is .
A normal cell passes on pristine copies of its three - billion - letter code to every next - generation cell .
But when a cancer cell divides , it may pass along to its daughters an altered copy of its DNA instructions -- and even the slightest change can have giant effects on cell behavior .
The consequence , says Fidler , is that while cancer is thought to begin with a single cell that has mutated , the tumors eventually formed are made up of countless cellular cousins , with a variety of quirky traits , living side by side .
" That heterogeneity of tumors is the major , major obstacle to easy therapy , " he says .
Harold Varmus , president of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York City , agrees .
" I just think this is a very tough set of problems , " says Varmus , who has seen those problems from more angles than just about anybody .
He shared a Nobel Prize for discovering the first oncogene ( a normal gene that when mutated can cause cancer ) in 1976 .
That crucial finding , five years into the War on Cancer , helped establish that cancers are caused by mutated genes .
Later Varmus served as NIH director under Bill Clinton , presiding over a period of huge funding increases .
" Time always looks shorter in retrospect , " he says .
" I think , hey , in 30 years mankind went from being almost completely ignorant about how cancer arises to being pretty damn knowledgeable . "
Yet all that knowledge has come at a price .
And there 's a strong argument to be made that maybe that price has been too high .
President Nixon devoted exactly 100 words of his 1971 State of the Union speech to proposing " an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer . "
The word " war " was never mentioned in the text , yet one would flare up in the months that followed - - a lobbying war over how much centralized control the proposed national cancer authority would exert .
Between the speech and the signing of the National Cancer Act that December , there was a " battle line between ' creative research ' and ' structured research , ' " as a news report headlined it .
A massive alliance of virtually all the medical societies , the medical schools , the then -- Big Three cancer hospitals ( Memorial Sloan - Kettering , M.D. Anderson , and Roswell Park in Buffalo ) said yes to federal money but wanted very little direction and only loose coordination from Uncle Sam .
On the other side was Sidney Farber , the Boston physician known as the godfather of cancer research .
He wanted public backing for a massive , coordinated assault .
" We cannot wait for full understanding ; the 325,000 patients with cancer who are going to die this year cannot wait ; nor is it necessary , in order to make great progress in the cure of cancer , for us to have the full solution of all the problems of basic research , " Farber testified in congressional hearings that fall .
" The history of medicine is replete with examples of cures obtained years , decades , and even centuries before the mechanism of action was understood for these cures -- from vaccination , to digitalis , to aspirin . "
Farber lost .
Today the cancer effort is utterly fragmented -- so much so that it 's nearly impossible to track down where the money to pay for all this research is coming from .
But let 's try anyway .
We begin with the NCI budget .
Set by Congress , this year 's outlay for fighting cancer is $ 4.74 billion .
Critics have complained that is a mere 3.3 % over last year 's budget , but Uncle Sam gives prodigiously in other ways too -- a fact few seem to realize .
The NIH , technically the NCI 's parent , will provide an additional $ 909 million this year for cancer research through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and other little - noticed grant mechanisms .
The Department of Veterans Affairs will likely spend just over the $ 457 million it spent in 2003 for research and prevention programs .
The CDC will chip in around $ 314 million for outreach and education .
Even the Pentagon pays for cancer research -- offering $ 249 million this year for nearly 500 peer - reviewed grants to study breast , prostate , and ovarian cancer .
Now throw state treasuries into the mix -- governors signed 89 cancer - related appropriations from 1997 to 2003 - - plus the fundraising muscle of cancer charities , cancer centers , and research hospitals , which together will raise some $ 2 billion this year from generous donors , based on recent tax forms .
And finally , that huge spender Big Pharma .
The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates that drug companies will devote about $ 7.4 billion , or roughly a quarter of their annual R&D spending , to products for cancer and metabolic and endocrine diseases .
When you add it all up , Americans have spent , through taxes , donations , and private R&D , close to $ 200 billion , in inflation - adjusted dollars , since 1971 .
What has that national investment netted so far ?
Without question , the money has bought us an enormous amount of knowledge , just as Varmus says .
Researchers have mapped the human cell 's intricate inner circuitry in extraordinary detail , identifying dozens of molecular chains of communication , or " signaling pathways , " among various proteins , phosphates , and lipids made by the body .
In short , scientists now know ( or think they know ) nearly all the biochemical steps that a healthy cell uses to multiply , to shut down its growth , and to sense internal damage and die at the right time -- as well as many of the genes that encode for these processes .
What 's more , by extension , they know how these same gene - induced mechanisms go haywire in a cancer cell .
According to PubMed , the NCI 's online database , the cancer research community has published 1.56 million papers -- that 's right : 1.56 million !-- largely on this circuitry and its related genes in hundreds of journals over the years .
Many of the findings are shared at the 100 - plus international congresses , symposiums , and conventions held each year .
Yet somehow , along the way , something important has gotten lost .
The search for knowledge has become an end unto itself rather than the means to an end .
And the research has become increasingly narrow , so much so that physician - scientists who want to think systemically about cancer or the organism as a whole -- or who might have completely new approaches - - often can't get funding .
Take , for instance , the NCI 's chief funding mechanism , something called an RO1 grant .
The grants are generous , averaging $ 338,000 apiece in 2003 .
And they are one of the easiest sweepstakes to win :
One in three applications is accepted .
But the money goes almost entirely to researchers who focus on very specific genetic or molecular mechanisms within the cancer cell or other tissue .
The narrower the research niche , it sometimes seems , the greater the rewards the researcher is likely to attain .
" The incentives are not aligned with the goals , " says Leonard Zwelling , vice president for research administration at M.D. Anderson , voicing the feeling of many .
" If the goal is to cure cancer , you do n't incentivize people to have little publications . "
Jean - Pierre Issa , a colleague of Zwelling 's who studies leukemias , is equally frustrated by the community 's mindset .
Still , he admits , the system 's lure is powerful .
" You get a paper where you change one gene ever so slightly and you have a drastic effect of cancer in the mouse , and that paper gets published in Science or Nature , and in your best journals .
That makes your reputation .
Then you start getting grants based on that , " he says .
" Open any major journal and 80 % of it is mice or drosophila [ fruit flies ] or nematodes [ worms ] .
When do you get human studies in there ? "
Indeed , the cancer community has published an extraordinary 150,855 experimental studies on mice , according to a search of the PubMed database .
Guess how many of them have led to treatments for cancer ?
Very , very few .
In fact , if you want to understand where the War on Cancer has gone wrong , the mouse is a pretty good place to start .
THE MODELS OF CANCER STINK
Outside Eric Lander 's office is a narrow , six - foot - high poster .
It is an org chart of sorts , a taxonomy , with black lines connecting animal species .
The poster 's lessons feel almost biblical -- it shows , for example , that the zebrafish has much in common with the chicken ; that hedgehog and shrew are practically kissing cousins ; and that while a human might look more like a macaque than a platypus or a mouse , it ain't that big of a leap , really .
The connection , of course , is DNA .
Our genomes share much of the same wondrous code of life .
And therein lie both the temptation and the frustration inherent in cancer research today .
Certain mutated genes cause cells to proliferate uncontrollably , to spread to new tissues where they do n't belong , and to refuse to end their lives when they should .
That 's cancer .
So research , as we 've said , now revolves around finding first , the molecular mechanisms to which these mutated genes give rise , and second , drugs that can stop them .
The strategy sounds obvious -- and nobody makes it sound more so than Lander , the charismatic founding director of the Whitehead Institute 's Center for Genome Research in Cambridge , Mass . , and a leader of the Human Genome Project .
The " Prince of Nucleotides , " as FORTUNE once called him , sketches the biological route to cancer cures as if he were directing you to the nearest Starbucks : " There are only , pick a number , say , 30,000 genes .
They do only a finite number of things .
There are only a finite number of mechanisms that cancers have .
It 's a large number ; when I say finite , I do n't mean to trivialize it .
There may be 100 mechanisms that cancers are using , but 100 is only 100 . "
So , he continues , we need to orchestrate an attack that isolates these mechanisms by knocking out cancer - promoting genes one by one in mice , then test drugs that kill the mutant cells .
" These are doable experiments , " he says .
" Cancers by virtue of having mutations also acquire Achilles ' heels .
Rational cancer therapies are about finding the Achilles ' heel associated with each new mutation in a cancer . "
The principle is , in all likelihood , dead - on .
The process itself , on the other hand , has one heck of an Achilles ' heel .
And that takes us back to the six - foot poster showing the taxonomy of genomes .
A mouse gene may be very similar to a human gene , but the rest of the mouse is very different .
The fact that so many cancer researchers seem to forget or ignore this observation when working with " mouse models " in the lab clearly irks Robert Weinberg .
A professor of biology at MIT and winner of the National Medal of Science for his discovery of both the first human oncogene and the first tumor - suppressor gene , Weinberg is as no-nonsense as Lander is avuncular .
Small and mustachioed , with Hobbit - like fingers , he plops into a brown leather La - Z - Boy that is somehow wedged into the middle of his cramped office , and launches into a lecture :
" One of the most frequently used experimental models of human cancer is to take human cancer cells that are grown in a petri dish , put them in a mouse -- in an immunocompromised mouse -- allow them to form a tumor , and then expose the resulting xenograft to different kinds of drugs that might be useful in treating people .
These are called preclinical models , " Weinberg explains .
" And it 's been well known for more than a decade , maybe two decades , that many of these preclinical human cancer models have very little predictive power in terms of how actual human beings -- actual human tumors inside patients -- will respond . "
Despite the genetic and organ - system similarities between a nude mouse and a man in a hospital gown , he says , the two species have key differences in physiology , tissue architecture , metabolic rate , immune system function , molecular signaling , you name it .
So the tumors that arise in each , with the same flip of a genetic switch , are vastly different .
Says Weinberg : " A fundamental problem which remains to be solved in the whole cancer research effort , in terms of therapies , is that the preclinical models of human cancer , in large part , stink . "
A few miles away , Bruce Chabner also finds the models lacking .
A professor of medicine at Harvard and clinical director at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center , he explains that for a variety of biological reasons the " instant tumors " that researchers cause in mice simply can't mimic human cancer 's most critical and maddening trait , its quick - changing DNA .
That characteristic , as we 've said , leads to staggering complexity in the most deadly tumors .
" If you find a compound that cures hypertension in a mouse , it 's going to work in people .
We do n't know how toxic it will be , but it will probably work , " says Chabner , who for many years ran the cancer - treatment division at the NCI .
So researchers routinely try the same approach with cancer , " knocking out " ( neutralizing ) this gene or knocking in that one in a mouse and causing a tumor to appear .
" Then they say , ' I 've got a model for lung cancer ! '
Well , it ai n't a model for lung cancer , because lung cancer in humans has a hundred mutations , " he says .
" It looks like the most complicated thing you 've ever seen , genetically . "
Homer Pearce , who once ran cancer research and clinical investigation at Eli Lilly and is now research fellow at the drug company , agrees that mouse models are " woefully inadequate " for determining whether a drug will work in humans .
" If you look at the millions and millions and millions of mice that have been cured , and you compare that to the relative success , or lack thereof , that we 've achieved in the treatment of metastatic disease clinically , " he says , " you realize that there just has to be something wrong with those models . "
Vishva Dixit , a vice president for research in molecular oncology at Genentech in South San Francisco , is even more horrified that " 99 % of investigators in industry and in academia use xenografts . "
Why is the mouse model so heavily used ?
Simple .
" It is very convenient , easily manipulated , " Dixit explains .
" You can assess tumor size just by looking at it . "
Although drug companies clearly recognize the problem , they have n't fixed it .
And they 'd better , says Weinberg , " if for no other reason than [ that ] hundreds of millions of dollars are being wasted every year by drug companies using these models . "
Even more depressing is the very real possibility that reliance on this flawed model has caused researchers to pass over drugs that would work in humans .
After all , if so many promising drugs that clobbered mouse cancers failed in man , the reverse is also likely :
More than a few of the hundreds of thousands of compounds discarded over the past 20 years might have been truly effective agents .
Roy Herbst , who divides his time between bench and bedside at M.D. Anderson and who has run big trials on Iressa and other targeted therapies for lung cancer , is sure that happens often .
" It 's something that bothers me a lot , " he says .
" We probably lose a lot of things that either do n't have activity on their own , or we have n't tried in the right setting , or you do n't identify the right target . "
If everyone understands there 's a problem , why is n't anything being done ?
Two reasons , says Weinberg .
First , there 's no other model with which to replace that poor mouse .
Second , he says , " is that the FDA has created inertia because it continues to recognize these [ models ] as the gold standard for predicting the utility of drugs . "
" WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF GOOD IDEAS "
It is one of the many chicken - and - egg questions bedeviling the cancer culture .
Which came first : the FDA 's imperfect standards for judging drugs or the pharmaceutical companies ' imperfect models for testing them ?
The riddle is applicable not just to early drug development , in which flawed animal models fool bench scientists into thinking their new compounds will wallop tumors in humans .
It comes up , with far more important ramifications , in the last stage of human testing , when the FDA is looking for signs that a new drug is actually helping the patients who are taking it .
In this case , the faulty model is called tumor regression .
It is exciting to see a tumor shrink in mouse or man and know that a drug is doing that .
A shrinking tumor is intuitively a good thing .
So it is no surprise that it's one of the key endpoints , or goals , in most clinical trials .
That 's in no small part because it is a measurable goal :
We can see it happening .
( When you read the word " response " in a newspaper story about some exciting new cancer drug , tumor shrinkage is what it 's talking about . )
But like the mouse , tumor regression by itself is actually a lousy predictor for the progression of disease .
Oncologists can often shrink a tumor with chemo and radiotherapy .
That sometimes makes the cancer easier to remove surgically .
If not , it still may buy a little time .
However , if the doctors do n't get every rotten cell , the sad truth is that the regression is not likely to improve the person 's chances of survival .
That 's because when most malignant solid tumors are diagnosed , they are typically quite large already -- the size of a grape , perhaps , with more than a billion cells in the tumor mass .
By the time it 's discovered , there is a strong chance that some of those cells have already broken off from the initial tumor and are on their way to another part of the body .
This is called metastasis .
Most of those cells will not take root in another tissue or organ :
A metastasizing cell has a very uphill battle to survive once it enters the violent churn of the bloodstream .
But the process has begun -- and with a billion cells dividing like there 's no tomorrow , an ever - growing number of metastases will try to make the journey .
Inevitably , some will succeed .
In the end , it is not localized tumors that kill people with cancer ; it is the process of metastasis -- an incredible 90 % of the time .
Aggressive cells spread to the bones , liver , lungs , brain , or other vital areas , wreaking havoc .
So you 'd think that cancer researchers would have been bearing down on this insidious phenomenon for years , intently studying the intricate mechanisms of invasion .
Hardly .
According to a FORTUNE examination of NCI grants going back to 1972 , less than 0.5 % of study proposals focused primarily on metastasis -- trying to understand , for instance , its role in a specific cancer ( e.g. , breast , prostate ) or just the process itself .
Of nearly 8,900 NCI grant proposals awarded last year , 92 % did n't even mention the word metastasis .
One accomplished researcher sent an elegant proposal into the NCI two years ago to study the epigenetics ( changes in normal gene function ) of metastases vs. primary tumors .
It 's now in its third resubmission , he says .
" I mean , there is nothing known about that .
But somehow I can't interest people in funding this ! "
M.D. Anderson 's Josh Fidler suggests that metastasis is getting short shrift simply because " it 's tough .
Okay ?
And individuals are not rewarded for doing tough things . "
Grant reviewers , he adds , " are more comfortable with the focused .
Here 's an antibody I will use , and here 's blah - blah - blah - blah , and then I get the money . "
Metastasis , on the other hand , is a big idea -- an organism - wide phenomenon that may involve dozens of processes .
It 's hard to do replicable experiments when there are that many variables .
But that 's the kind of research we need .
Instead , says Weinberg , researchers opt for more straightforward experiments that generate plenty of reproducible results .
Unfortunately , he says , " the accumulation of data gives people the illusion they 've done something meaningful . "
That drive to accumulate data also goes to the heart of the regulatory process for drug development .
The FDA 's mandate is to make sure that a drug is safe and that it works before allowing its sale to the public .
Thus , the regulators need to see hard data showing that a drug has had some effect in testing .
However , it 's hard to see " activity " in preventing something from happening in the first place .
There are probably good biomarkers -- proteins , perhaps , circulating in the body -- that can tell us that cancer cells have begun the process of spreading to other tissues .
As of yet , though , we do n't know what they are .
So pharma companies , quite naturally , do n't concentrate on solving the problem of metastasis ( the thing that kills people ) ; they focus on devising drugs that shrink tumors ( the things that do n't ) .
Dozens of these drugs get approved anyway .
At the same time , many do n't -- and the FDA is invariably blamed for holding up the War on Cancer .
The fault , however , is less the umpire 's than the players ' .
That 's because many tumor - shrinking drugs simply do n't perform much better than the standard treatments .
Or as Rick Pazdur , director of oncology drugs for the FDA , puts it , " It 's efficacy , stupid !
One of the major problems that we have is dealing with this meager degree of efficacy . "
When it 's clear that something is working , the agency is generally quick to give it priority review and / or accelerated approval , two mechanisms that speed up the regulatory process for compounds aimed at life - threatening diseases .
" We have a shortage of good ideas that are likely to work , " agrees Bruce Johnson , a Dana - Farber oncologist who runs lung - cancer research for institutions affiliated with the Harvard Medical School , a huge partnership that includes Massachusetts General Hospital , Brigham and Women 's Cancer Center , and others .
That is also the devastating conclusion of a major study published last August in the British Medical Journal .
Two Italian pharmacologists pored over the results of trials of 12 new anticancer drugs that had been approved for the European market from 1995 to 2000 , and compared them with standard treatments for their respective diseases .
The researchers could find no substantial advantages -- no improved survival , no better quality of life , no added safety -- with any of the new agents .
All of them , though , were several times more expensive than the old drugs .
In one case , the price was 350 times higher .
WHY THE NEW DRUGS DISAPPOINT
Flawed models for drug development .
Obsession with tumor shrinkage .
Focus on individual cellular mechanisms to the near exclusion of what 's happening in the organism as a whole .
All these failures come to a head in the clinical trial - - a rigidly controlled , three - phase system for testing new drugs and other medical procedures in humans .
The process remains the only way to get from research to drug approval -- and yet it is hard to find anyone in the cancer community who is n't maddeningly frustrated by it .
In February 2003 a blue - ribbon panel of cancer - center directors concluded that clinical trials are " long , arduous , " and burdened with regulation ; without major change and better resources , the panel concluded , the " system is likely to remain inefficient , unresponsive , and unduly expensive . "
All that patients know is that the process has little to offer them .
Witness the fact that a stunning 97 % of adults with cancer do n't bother to participate .
There are two major problems with clinical trials .
The first is that their duration and cost mean that drug companies -- which sponsor the vast majority of such trials -- have an overwhelming incentive to test compounds that are likely to win FDA approval .
After all , they are public companies by and large , with shareholders demanding a return on investment .
So the companies focus not on breakthrough treatments but on incremental improvements to existing classes of drugs .
The process does not encourage risk taking or entrepreneurial approaches to drug discovery .
It does not encourage brave new thinking .
Not when a drug typically takes 12 to 14 years to develop .
And not with $ 802 million -- that 's the oft - cited cost of developing a drug - - on the line .
What 's more , the system essentially forces companies to test the most promising new compounds on the sickest patients -- where it is easier to see some activity ( like shrinking tumors ) but almost impossible to cure people .
At that point the disease has typically spread too far and the tumors have become too ridden with genetic mutations .
Thus drugs that might have worked well in earlier - stage patients often never get the chance to prove it .
( As you 'll see , that may be a huge factor in the disappointing response so far of one class of promising new drugs . )
The second problem is even bigger : Clinical trials are focused on the wrong goal -- on doing " proper " science rather than saving lives .
It is not that they provide bad care -- patients in trials are treated especially well .
But the trials ' very reason for being is to test a hypothesis :
Is treatment X better than treatment Y ?
And sometimes - - too often , sadly -- the information generated by this tortuously long process does n't much matter .
If you 've spent ten - plus years to discover that a new drug shrinks a tumor by an average of 10 % more than the existing standard of care , how many people have you really helped ?
Take two drugs approved in February for cancer of the colon and rectum : Erbitux and Avastin .
In each case it took many months just to enroll the necessary number of patients in clinical trials .
Participating doctors then had to administer the drugs according to often arduous preset protocols , collecting reams of data along the way .
( ImClone 's well - known troubles with the FDA occurred because it had not set up its trials properly . )
And here 's what clinicians learned after years of testing .
When Avastin was added to the standard chemotherapy regimen , the combination managed to extend the lives of some 400 patients with terminal colorectal cancer by a median 4.7 months .
( A previous trial of the drug on breast cancer patients failed . )
Oncologists consider the gain substantial , considering that those in advanced stages of the disease typically live less than 16 months .
And Erbitux ?
Although it did indeed shrink tumors , it has not been shown to prolong patients ' lives at all .
Some certainly have fared well on the drug , but survival on average for the groups studied did n't change .
Still , Erbitux was approved for use primarily in " third line " therapy , after every other accepted treatment has failed .
A weekly dose costs $ 2,400 .
Remember , it took several years and the participation of thousands of patients in three stages of testing , tons of data , and huge expense to find out what the clinicians and researchers already knew in the earliest stage of human testing :
Neither drug will save more than a handful of the 57,000 people who will die of colorectal cancer this year .
You could say the same for AstraZeneca 's Iressa , another in the new class of biological wonder drugs -- compounds specifically " targeted " to disrupt the molecular signals in a cancer cell .
Not a single controlled trial has shown Iressa to have a major patient benefit such as the easing of symptoms or improved survival - - a fact that the company 's upbeat press releases admit as if it were legal boilerplate .
Even so , the FDA okayed the pill last year for last - ditch use against a type of lung cancer , citing the fact that it had shrunk tumors in 10 % of patients studied .
" Very smart people , with a lot of money , have done trials of over 10,000 patients around the world -- testing these new molecular targeted drugs , " says Dana - Farber 's Bruce Johnson .
" AstraZeneca tested Iressa .
Isis Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly tested a compound called Isis 3521 .
Several different companies ended up investing tens of millions of dollars , and all came up with a big goose egg . "
The one targeted drug that clearly is n't a goose egg is Novartis 's Gleevec , which has been shown to save lives as well as stifle tumors .
The drug has a dramatic effect on an uncommon kind of leukemia called CML and an even more rare stomach cancer named GIST .
Early reports say it also seems to work , in varying degrees , in up to three other cancers .
Gleevec 's success has been held out as the " proof of principle " that the strategy we 've followed in the War on Cancer all these years has been right .
But not even Gleevec is what it seems .
CML is not a complicated cancer :
In it , a single gene mutation causes a critical signaling mechanism to go awry ; Gleevec ingeniously interrupts that deadly signal .
Most common cancers have perhaps as many as five to ten different things going wrong .
Second , even " simple " cancers get smarter :
The malignant cells long exposed to the drug ( which must be taken forever ) mutate their way around the molecular signal that Gleevec blocks , building drug resistance .
No wonder cancer is so much more vexing than heart disease .
" You do n't get multiple swings , " says Bob Cohen , senior director for commercial diagnostics at Genentech .
Use a drug that does not destroy the tumor completely and " the heterogeneity will evolve from the [ surviving ] cells and say , ' I do n't give a rat 's ass !
You can't screw me up with this stuff . '
Suddenly you 're squaring and cubing the complexity .
That 's where we are . "
And that 's why the only chance is to attack the disease earlier -- and on multiple fronts .
Three drugs , four drugs , five drugs in combination .
Cocktails of experimental compounds , of course , were what doctors used to control HIV , whose rapidly mutating virus was once thought to be a death sentence .
Virtually every clinician and scientist interviewed for this story believes a similar approach is needed with the new generation of anticancer drugs .
But once again , institutional forces within the cancer world make it nearly impossible .
Combining unapproved drugs in clinical trials brings up a slew of legal and regulatory issues that cause pharma companies to squirm .
While many drug - company oncologists are as committed to the public 's well - being as government or cancer - center researchers , they have less flexibility to take chances on an idea .
Ultimately , they need FDA approval for their investigational compounds .
If two or three unapproved drugs are tested in concert , it 's even harder to figure out what 's working and what is n't , and whether one drug is responsible for side - effects or the combination .
" It becomes much more challenging in the context of managing the databases , interpreting the results , and owning the data , " adds Lilly 's Pearce .
Over dinner at Ouisie 's Table in Houston , M.D. Anderson 's Len Zwelling , who oversees regulatory compliance for the center 's 800 - plus clinical trials , and his wife , Genie Kleinerman , who is chief of pediatrics there , have no trouble venting about the legal barriers that seem to be growing out of control .
It takes no more than ten minutes for Kleinerman to rattle off three stories about trying to bring together different drug companies in clinical trials for kids with cancer .
In the first attempt , the trial took so long that the biotech startup with the promising agent went out of business .
In the second the lawyers haggled over liability concerns until both companies pulled out .
The third , however , was the worst .
There were two drugs that together seemed to jolt the immune system into doing a better job of targeting malignant cells of osteosarcoma , a bone cancer that occurs in children .
" Working with the lawyers , it was just impossible , " she says , " because each side wanted to own the rights to the combination ! "
CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CANCER
Strange as it may seem , much of our failure in fighting cancer -- and more important , much of the potential for finally winning this fight -- has to do with a definition .
Some 2,400 years ago the Greek physician Hippocrates described cancer as a disease that spread out and grabbed on to another part of the body like " the arms of a crab , " as he elegantly put it .
Similarly , medical textbooks today say cancer begins when the cells of an expanding tumor push through the thin protein " basement " membrane that separates them from another tissue .
It 's a fancy way of saying that to be cancer , a malignant cell has to invade another part of the body .
Michael Sporn , a professor of pharmacology and medicine at Dartmouth Medical School , has two words for this : " Absolute nonsense ! "
He goes on : " We 've been stuck with this definition of what cancer is from 1890 .
It 's what I was taught in medical school : ' It 's not cancer until there 's invasion . '
That 's like saying the barn is n't on fire until there are bright red flames coming out of the roof . "
In fact , cancer begins much earlier than that .
And therein lies the best strategy to contain it , believes Sporn , who was recently named an Eminent Scholar by the NCI : Let 's aggressively find those embers that have been smoldering in many of us for years -- and douse them before they become a full - fledged blaze .
Prevent cancer from ever entering that deadly stage of malignancy in the first place .
Sporn , who spent more than three decades at the NCI , has been struggling for many years to get fellow researchers to start thinking about cancer not as a state of being ( that is , an invasive group of fast - growing cells ) but as a process , called carcinogenesis .
Cancer , as Sporn tells it , is a multistage disease that goes through various cell transformations and sometimes long periods of latency in its progression .
Thus , the trick is to intervene earlier in that process -- especially at key points when lesions occur ( known to doctors as dysplasias , hyperplasias , and other precancerous cell phases ) .
To do that , the medical community has to break away from the notion that people in an early stage of carcinogenesis are " healthy " and therefore should n't be treated .
People are not healthy if they 're on a path toward cancer .
If this seems radical and far - fetched , consider :
We 've prevented millions of heart attacks and strokes by using the very same strategy .
Sporn likes to point out that heart disease does n't start with the heart attack ; it starts way earlier with the elevated blood cholesterol and lipids that cause arterial plaque .
So we treat those .
Stroke does n't start with the blood clot in the brain .
It starts with hypertension .
So we treat it with both lifestyle changes and drugs .
" Cardiovascular disease , of course , is nowhere near as complex as cancer is , " he says , " but the principle is the same . "
Adds Sporn : " All these people who are obsessed with cures , cures , cures , and the miraculous cure which is still eluding us , they 're being -- I hate to use this word , but if you want to look at it pragmatically -- they 're being selfish by ignoring what could be done in terms of prevention . "
The amazing thing about this theory -- other than how obvious it is -- is that we can start applying it right now .
Precancerous cell changes mark the progression to many types of solid - tumor cancers ; many such changes are relatively easy to find and remove , and others are potentially reversible with current drugs and other treatments .
A perfect example is the Pap smear , which detects premalignant changes in the cells of the cervix .
That simple procedure , followed by the surgical removal of any lesions , has dropped the incidence and death rates from cervical cancer by 78 % and 79 % , respectively , since the practice began in the 1950s .
In countries where Pap smears are n't done , cervical cancer is a leading killer of women .
Same goes for colon cancer .
Not every adenomatous polyp in the colon ( a lesion in the organ 's lining ) goes on to become malignant and invasive .
But colon cancers have to go through this abnormal step on their way to becoming deadly .
The list of other dysplasia - like conditions goes on and on , from Barrett 's esophagus ( a precursor to cancer there ) to hyperkeratosis ( head and neck cancers ) .
Obviously , doctors are already doing this kind of testing with some cancers , but they need to do it much , much more .
Some complain that the telltale biomarkers of carcinogenesis , while getting more predictive , still are far from definitive , and that we should wait until we know more .
( Sound familiar ? )
Researchers in heart disease , meanwhile , have taken an opposite tack and been far more successful .
Neither high cholesterol nor hypertension guarantees future cardiovascular disease , but they 're treated anyway .
A few cancer researchers have made great strides in finding more early warning signs -- looking for protein " signatures " in blood , urine , or even skin swabs that can identify precancerous conditions and very early cancers that are likely to progress .
For instance , Lance Liotta , chief of pathology at the NCI , has demonstrated that ovarian cancer can be detected by a high - tech blood test -- one that identifies a unique " cluster pattern " of some 70 different proteins in a woman 's blood .
" We 've discovered a previously unknown ocean of markers , " he says .
And it 's potentially a mammoth lifesaver .
With current drugs , early - stage ovarian cancer is more than 90 % curable ; late stage is 75 % deadly .
Early results on a protein test for pancreatic cancer are promising as well , says Liotta .
Yes , the strategy has costs .
Some say wholesale testing of biomarkers and early lesions -- many of which wo n't go on to become invasive cancers -- would result in a huge burden for the health - care system and lead to a wave of potentially dangerous surgeries to remove things that might never become lethal anyway .
But surely the costs of not acting are much greater .
Indeed , it is an encouraging sign that Andy von Eschenbach , director of the NCI , and Elias Zerhouni , who leads the NIH , are both believers in this strategy .
" What our investment in biomedical research has led us to is understanding cancer as a disease process and the various steps and stages along that pathway - - from being very susceptible to it , to the point where you get it , and ultimately suffer and die from it , " says von Eschenbach , a former urologist who has survived prostate and a pair of skin cancers .
So , he says , he wants to lead the NCI on a " mission to prevent the process from occurring in the first place or detect the occurrence of cancer early enough to eliminate it with less morbidity . "
HOW TO WIN THE WAR
There has been talk like this before .
But the money to fund the assault never came .
And several cancer experts interviewed for this story worry that the new rhetoric from the NCI , while encouraging , has yet to move beyond lip service .
For the nation finally to turn the tide in this brutal war , the cancer community must embrace a coordinated assault on this disease .
Doctors and scientists now have enough knowledge to do what Sydney Farber hoped they might do 33 years ago : to work as an army , not as individuals fighting on their own .
The NCI can begin this transformation right away by drastically changing the way it funds research .
It can undo the culture created by the RO1s ( the grants that launched a million me - too mouse experiments ) by shifting the balance of financing to favor cooperative projects focused on the big picture .
The cancer agency already has such funding in place , for endeavors called SPOREs ( short for specialized programs of research excellence ) .
These bring together researchers from different disciplines to solve aspects of the cancer puzzle .
Even so , funding for individual study awards accounts for a full quarter of the agency 's budget and is more than 12 times the money spent on SPORE grants .
The agency needs to stop being an automatic teller machine for basic science and instead use the taxpayers ' money to marshall a broad assault on this elusive killer -- from figuring out how to stop metastasis in its tracks to coming up with testing models that better mimic human response .
At the same time , the NCI should commit itself to finding biomarkers that are predictive of cancer development and that , with a simple blood or urine test ( like PSA ) or an improved molecular imaging technique ( PET and CT scans ) , can give patients a chance to preempt or control the disease .
For that matter , as a nation we could prevent tens of thousands of cancers -- and 30 % of all cancer deaths , according to the NCI - - by getting people to stop smoking .
This all - too - obvious observation was made by every researcher I interviewed .
Alas , this is not a million - dollar commitment .
It 's a billion - dollar one .
But the nation is already investing billions in research , and that does n't even include the $ 64 billion a year we spend on treatment .
To make the resource shift easier , Congress should move the entire federal war chest for cancer into one bureaucracy , not five .
Cancer research should be managed by the NCI , not the VA and Pentagon .
Just as important , the cancer leadership , the FDA , and lawmakers need to transform drug testing and approval into a process that delivers information on what 's working and what 's not to the patients far faster .
If the best hope to treat most cancer lies in using combinations of drugs , we 're going to have to remove legal constraints and give drug companies incentives to test investigational compounds together in shorter trials .
Those should be funded by the NCI - - in a process that 's distinct from individual drug approval .
One bonus for the companies :
If joint activity showed marked improvement in survival , the FDA process could be jump - started .
" It 's going to require a community conversation to facilitate this change , " says Eli Lilly 's Homer Pearce .
" I think everyone believes that at the end of the day , cancer is going to be treated with multiple targeted agents -- maybe in combination with traditional chemotherapy drugs , maybe not .
Because that 's where the biology is leading us , it 's a future that we have to embrace -- though it will definitely require different models of cooperation . "
When clinical trials begin to offer patients more than incremental improvements over existing drug treatments , people with cancer will rush into the studies .
And when participation rates go up , it will accelerate the process so that we can test more combinations faster and cheaper .
To see which drugs truly have promise , however , we need to do one thing more : test them on people in less advanced stages of disease .
The reason , once again , comes back to cancer 's genetic instability - - a progression that not only ravages the body but also riddles tumors with mutations .
When cancer patients are in the end stage of the disease , drugs that might have a potent effect on newer cancers fail to show much progress at all .
Our current crop of rules , however , pushes drug companies into this can 't - win situation , where the only way out is incremental improvements to existing therapies .
Drugs that might well help some cancer patients are now getting tossed by the wayside because they do n't help people whom they could n't have helped in any case .
This has to stop .
Witness what has happened with the new class of drugs developed to fight the process called angiogenesis ( " angio " refers to blood vessels , and " genesis " to new growth ) -- compounds designed to block the development of capillaries that supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors .
Avastin is the best known , but there are some 40 anti-angiogenesis drugs in clinical trials .
This , by the way , is one of those big ideas that the cancer culture did n't take seriously , and would barely fund , for decades .
The concept was pioneered 43 years ago by Judah Folkman , now a surgeon at Children 's Hospital Boston .
While studying artificial blood in a Navy lab , he was struck by a simple and seemingly obvious idea :
Every cell needs oxygen to grow , including cancer cells .
Since oxygen in the body comes from blood , fast - growing tumors could n't develop without access to blood vessels .
Folkman later figured out that tumors actually recruited new blood vessels by sending out a protein signal .
If you could turn off that growth signal , he reasoned , you could starve the tumors and keep them tiny .
The surgeon submitted a paper on his experiments to various medical journals , but the article was rejected time and again .
That is , until an editor at the New England Journal of Medicine heard Folkman give a lecture and offered to publish it in the Journal 's Beth Israel Hospital Seminars in 1971 -- ironically , the year the War on Cancer began .
After decades of resistance , the cancer culture has finally come around to Folkman 's thinking -- as the reception greeting Avastin makes clear .
Still , the biggest promise of anti-angiogenesis drugs will be realized only when doctors can use them to treat earlier - stage patients .
That 's because the drugs designed to choke the tumor 's blood supply often take a far longer time to work than traditional toxic chemo -- time that people with advanced disease and fast - growing cancers may not have .
Doctors also need the freedom to administer such drugs in combination .
Tumors recruit blood vessels through several signaling mechanisms , researchers believe , so the best approach is to apply several drugs , cutting off all routes .
Who knows ?
A new paradigm in treatment may emerge from Folkman 's 40 - year - old idea .
Yet to make this simple and seemingly obvious shift , the entire cancer culture must change - - from the rules governing drug approval to tort law and intellectual property rights .
Science now has the knowledge and the tools ; we need to act .
THE GOOD DOCTOR
In the weeks since I finished my reporting and began writing this story , one image has stuck with me : a drawerful of letters .
The letters belong to Eric Winer , a 47 - year - old physician at Dana - Farber .
He and I had been talking for close to an hour when he showed me the drawer .
It was late on a Friday evening , and Winer , still in the clinic , was describing the progress we were making in this war , his reedy voice cracking higher every so often .
He was telling me of his optimism .
That 's when he mentioned the drawer : " That enthusiasm is very much tempered by the fact that we have 40,000 women dying of breast cancer every year .
Um , and you know , I 've got a file full of letters that are almost entirely from family members of my patients who died .... "
I asked to see it , and then asked again , and there it was , in the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet -- two overstuffed folders of mostly handwritten notes .
Once the letters go in , Winer confessed , he never looks at them again .
" I do n't go back , " he said sheepishly .
" My excuse initially was that if anyone wanted to say I was a bad doctor , I 'd hold on to these things that people said about me .
And I could prove that I was n't . "
If the walls of his office are any indication , there is no way Winer is a bad doctor .
They are covered with loving mementos from patients .
There is a picture of Tolstoy from a woman whose breast tumors were initially shrunk by Herceptin , but who died within five years .
( Winer had once mentioned to her to that he had majored in Russian history at Yale . )
There 's a photo of the Grand Canyon taken by a young nurse who was determined to take a trip out West with her 10 - year - old son before she died .
The daughter of another patient even cornered Lance Armstrong and begged him to sign a neon - yellow jersey for Winer , who is an avid cyclist .
It is the most prominent thing in his office .
No , it is n't just the patients in this War on Cancer who need renewed hope .
It is the foot soldiers as well .

A man goes in to see his doctor , and after some tests , the doctor says , " I 'm sorry , but you have a fatal disease . "
Man : " That 's terrible !
How long have I got ? "
Doctor : " Ten . "
Man : " Ten ?
What kind of answer is that ?
Ten months ?
Ten years ?
Ten what ? "
The doctor looks at his watch .
" Nine . "
Recently I received some bad medical news ( although not as bad as in the joke ) .
Unfortunately I have been diagnosed with a fatal disease , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS , sometimes called Lou Gehrig 's disease .
ALS causes nerve damage , progressive muscle weakness and paralysis , and ultimately death .
Patients lose the ability to talk , walk , move , eventually even to breathe , which is usually the end of life .
This process generally takes about 2 to 5 years .
There are however two bright spots in this picture .
The first is that ALS normally does not affect higher brain functions .
I will retain my abilities to think and reason as usual .
Even as my body is dying outside , I will remain alive inside .
The second relates to survival .
Although ALS is generally described as a fatal disease , this is not quite true .
It is only mostly fatal .
When breathing begins to fail , ALS patients must make a choice .
They have the option to either go onto invasive mechanical respiration , which involves a tracheotomy and breathing machine , or they can die in comfort .
I was very surprised to learn that over 90 % of ALS patients choose to die .
And even among those who choose life , for the great majority this is an emergency decision made in the hospital during a medical respiratory crisis .
In a few cases the patient will have made his wishes known in advance , but most of the time the procedure is done as part of the medical management of the situation , and then the ALS patient either lives with it or asks to have the machine disconnected so he can die .
Probably fewer than 1 % of ALS patients arrange to go onto ventilation when they are still in relatively good health , even though this provides the best odds for a successful transition .
With mechanical respiration , survival with ALS can be indefinitely extended .
And the great majority of people living on respirators say that their quality of life is good and they are happy with their decision .
( There may be a selection effect here . )
It seems , then , that calling ALS a fatal disease is an oversimplification .
ALS takes away your body , but it does not take away your mind , and if you are determined and fortunate , it does not have to take away your life .
There are a number of practical and financial obstacles to successfully surviving on a ventilator , foremost among them the great load on caregivers .
No doubt this contributes to the high rates of choosing death .
But it seems that much of the objection is philosophical .
People are not happy about being kept alive by machines .
And they assume that their quality of life would be poor , without the ability to move and participate in their usual activities .
This is despite the fact that most people on respirators describe their quality of life as acceptable to good .
As we have seen in other contexts , people are surprisingly poor predictors of how they will react to changed circumstances .
This seems to be such a case , contributing to the high death rates for ALS patients .
I hope that when the time comes , I will choose life .
ALS kills only motor neurons , which carry signals to the muscles .
The senses are intact .
And most patients retain at least some vestige of control over a few muscles , which with modern technology can offer a surprisingly effective mode of communication .
Stephen Hawking , the world 's longest surviving ALS patient at over 40 years since diagnosis , is said to be able to type at ten words per minute by twitching a cheek muscle .
I hope to be able to read , browse the net , and even participate in conversations by email and messaging .
Voice synthesizers allow local communications , and I am making use of a free service for ALS patients which will create a synthetic model of my own natural voice , for future use .
I may even still be able to write code , and my dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body .
That will be a life very much worth living .
Overlooked
Historically research has focused on men .
As one example , women are under - represented in major clinical trials for cancers that affect both sexes , a new study found .
Researchers say several factors could be responsible , from childcare issues to reluctance by researchers to expose women of childbearing age to trial drugs and treatments .
In other areas where research into women 's medical problems is lacking , the issue is not just about sexism .
Women 's hormone fluctuations are , well , complicated and can confound basic findings .
But in recent years , women have been getting increased attention .
Still , much misinformation about the female body circulates in mainstream consciousness .
Myth : A doctor can tell if a woman is a virgin .

Even when using 10 - fold magnification , doctors can not accurately sort virgins from the sexually - active , several studies have reported .
It is not as simple as looking for a hole in the hymen because , well , there is always a hole in the hymen .
" Some people think the hymen seals off the vagina [ until virginity is lost ] , but that is just not true , " said Dr. Rachel Vreeman of Indiana University and Carroll 's co-author of " Do n't Swallow Your Gum . "
In the rare cases when it is sealed , period blood builds in the uterus and causes severe medical problems , she said .
Myth : Antibiotics make birth control pills unreliable .
" Many physicians even believe this , " Carroll said .
Alone , birth control pills fail about one percent of the time .
And that failure rate is unchanged when taken with the vast majority of antibiotics , Carroll said .
A possible exception is rifampin , the antibiotic prescribed for tuberculosis .
Rifampin does lower pregnancy - protecting hormone levels induced by birth control pills , but whether the effect is large enough to increase pregnancy risk is unclear .
Carroll thinks rifampin research spurred the antibiotic / birth control rumor .
" Sometimes people say things and they just take off , " he said .
Myth : Women and men need equal sleep .
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
Tossing and turning not only causes women more psychological distress , it also raises their insulin and inflammation levels — risk factors for compromised health , found a 2008 study of 210 people led by Edward Suarez at Duke University .
A study of more than 6,000 participants , led by researchers at the University of Warwick in 2007 , found that women who slept five or less hours a night were twice as likely to suffer from hypertension than women who slept for seven or more hours .
Among men , there was no such relationship .
Sleeping Beauty may be better off waking up on her own watch .
Myth : Menopause causes sex drive to nosedive .
( Image credit : Hanna Monika Cybulko | Dreamstime )
The Change is not necessarily one that happens in the bedroom .
A comprehensive survey of sexual habits in the United States , completed by Edward Laumann and colleagues in 1994 , found that roughly half of women in their fifties have sex several times a month .
While hot flashes and other discomforts may make a women temporarily not in the mood , there is not a direct link between menopause and sexual desire , Vreeman said .
So if you are entering the Big M , there is no reason to say good - bye to the Big O .
Myth : A women can't get pregnant during her period .
While a woman is unlikely to conceive during menstruation , " nothing , when it comes to pregnancy , is impossible , " said Aaron Carroll of Indiana University and co-author of " Do n't Swallow Your Gum : Myths , Half - truths and Outright Lies About Your Body and Health " ( St. Martin 's Griffin , 2009 ) .
Once inside a woman , sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week .
Ovulation can occur soon after , or even during , the bleeding phase of a woman 's menstrual cycle , giving patient sperm the chance to get lucky .
The timing method of birth control does n't work well , Carroll said , agreeing that couples who practice it are often called : parents .
Despite a recent amendment affirming internet access as a “ basic human right ” , the European Parliament has done a complete U - turn and is intent on allowing EU countries to ban illegal file sharers from internet access .
In recent months , the French Constitutional Court overturned the controversial HADOPI legislation that introduced a " three strikes " regime in France for persistent copyright infringers , which would eventually result in the perpetrator losing their internet connection .
The HADOPI legislation , the French Constitutional Court ruled , goes directly against a decision in the European Parliament – Amendment 138 – whereby disconnecting alleged copyright infringers would violate the fundamental rights and freedoms of internet users .
Amendment 138 states : “ Measures taken regarding end - users ’ access to or use of services and applications through electronic communications networks shall respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons , including in relation to privacy , freedom of expression and access to information and the right to a judgment by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law and acting in respect of due process in accordance with Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . ”
Three strikes , and out
The U - Turn will be good news for proponents of three - strikes type rulings , especially the record labels , and will result in countries like the UK to press ahead with tough legislation aimed at protecting the earnings of rights - holders .
Earlier this year , Ireland ’s largest telecoms provider , Eircom , struck a deal with the big four record labels – Warner , EMI , Sony and Universal – to ban illegal file sharers from internet access after three warnings .
Over six years , sales of music CDs in the Irish market went from € 146 million to € 102 million in 2007 , according to IRMA , which represents the Big Four .

SAN FRANCISCO –
In a scene right out of Michael Moore ’s latest film , “ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” chanting , sign - bearing health care activists swarmed through lunch - hour crowds in this city ’s financial district Oct. 6 , and into the office tower where Anthem Blue Cross / WellPoint CEO Angela Braley has her headquarters , bent on making a citizens ’ arrest .
Before marching on Braley ’s office , some 200 backers of a strong public option in health care reform legislation , including many single - payer supporters , had gathered briefly at the foot of Market Street to hear horror stories from area Blue Cross policyholders .
One said after two recent visits to participating hospitals , Blue Cross had refused to pay the emergency room doctor .
The incident finally damaged his credit .
“ It ’s kind of a joke that people are afraid of the public option , ” he said , “ when we ’ve got enough unfairness and bureaucracy right here with Anthem Blue Cross . ”
Another told how her aunt ’s health insurance was cancelled after Blue Cross found out the aunt had cancer , adding “ That is a crime ! ”
A third recounted Blue Cross ’ denial of coverage to his 26 - year - old daughter because she had earlier suffered a sore wrist .
Two years later , he said , his daughter was offered insurance for an unaffordable $ 800 a month .
“ There ’s too much greed and not enough health care need in this system , ” he concluded .
With that , organizers declared there was enough evidence to make a citizens ’ arrest of Braley and the crowd , chorusing “ Public option now ! ” set out across the plaza , up the stairs , through a revolving door and into the lobby , which they festooned with yellow tape bearing the legend , “ It ’s a crime to deny our care ! ”
Informed that Braley was “ not in her office , ” the demonstrators lingered a while , chanting , before streaming back into the sunlit plaza , still proclaiming their message .
In the crowd was SEIU Local 24/7 organizer Emily Heath , who said her union of security officers “ has seen what most unions have seen in the last few years – health care is the Number One issue .
If we can level the playing field so that it will cost companies less , and all Americans will have access , we will be able to negotiate better contracts for our workers . ”
Heath said besides their historically low wages , security officers often lack benefits many people think working families have , like sick days and bereavement leave .
Also demonstrating was Bud Beal , president of the Alameda County Federation of Retired Union Members ( FORUM ) .
Beal said his FORUM chapter is “ solid for single payer , ” though the public option appears more achievable at the moment .
Though Beal has the same coverage now that he had while working , he said premiums and co-pays are going up , and “ if things do n’t change , at some point I wo n’t be able to afford health care .
“ If the Democrats would stick together and tell the Republicans where to go , ” he added , “ we could get somewhere ! ”
The San Francisco action was organized by the California Labor Federation , the Health Access coalition , SEIU , ACORN and MoveOn.org , as part of Health Care for America Now , the country ’s largest health care campaign .
Actions were also held in four other California cities – Los Angeles , Sacramento , Santa Ana and San Diego – as well as in nearly 50 other cities across the nation .
One of those was Charleston , W. Va , where HCAN supporters applauded Sen. Jay Rockefeller for championing the public option in Senate debate .
The actions were part of HCAN ’s recently - launched campaign , “ Big Insurance : Sick of It ! ” HCAN is demanding a strong public option , affordable health care both for workers and for those not in the workforce , and rejection of proposals to tax health care benefits .
ISLAMABAD : A US aid package has put the Pakistani Government at odds with its military and triggered an unexpected political crisis .
The Kerry - Lugar bill passed the US Congress last week , promising to triple annual spending on aid for Pakistan 's poor to $ US1.5 billion ( $ 1.7 billion ) .
But conditions apply , and the military has taken the unusual step of making public its trenchant opposition to those conditions public .
On Wednesday night it issued a statement expressing '' serious concern regarding clauses impacting on national security ' ' and said '' formal input is being provided to the Government ' ' , without further explanation .
The military chief , General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , is understood to have described the bill at a meeting of top military leaders on Wednesday as ' ' intrusive ' ' .
My twenty - something niece , who was raised in a moderately religious household ( but managed to turn out surprisingly well anyway in my opinion ) still found much to take offense with in my science fiction short story The End -- and Clifford Dunburton .
Namely , the title character is described as maybe the smartest man in the world -- and this man ridicules religion during the course of the tale .
I guess I should have anticipated her reaction , but I did n't .
Anyway , she basically demanded I explain myself , and so I did , with the email text below : I do n't share exactly the same beliefs that my story character does ( my story characters are rarely wholly accurate mirrors of my own views ) .
But I 'm also not very pleased with religions in general , due to their bloody history of hate mongering , atrocities , and mass murder and torture both past and present , with no end in sight for the future .
Sure , there might be some good here and there done by religious groups , or by individuals for religious reasons .
But it seems to be outweighed by the casualty numbers among what tends to be overwhelmingly innocent bystanders ( the bulk of them women and children ) .
So in general I do not support organized religion .
The Founding Fathers had good reasons to separate church from state in the creation of America .
For prior to that the church often controlled the state in various places around the world , and did many of the awful things listed before ( look up the Inquisition sometime for just one example ) .
The main way a church liked to perpetrate its crimes was to outlaw all competing religions in the territory it controlled , so that it'd then have a ' legal ' excuse to kill or torture or hound basically whomsoever it liked -- including some of its own followers at times ( when they did n't act slavishly enough to powerful leaders ) .
That 's why in America we Constitutionally prohibit our government from preferring one religion over another ( however , as American politicians have become more corrupt over decades , they 've increasingly tried to ignore their oaths to uphold the Constitution , as well as ignore that ban and all the history behind it , and go around it to promote Christianity ) .
Some of the very earliest European settlers in America were Christians fleeing the state dominance of and persecution from a different Christian sect in Europe .
Inquisition
8 Atrocities Committed in the Name of Religion
Christian Missionary Atrocities Spread The Faith
HOLY HORROR --ATROCITIES IN THE NAME OF GOD .
Religious Atrocities History ( Christianity Main Emphasis )
Aside from the Inquisition , a great many wars have been essentially wars between religions -- sometimes even between factions of the same religion ( !)
Religion is also responsible for massive tolls of death and suffering from a wholly different perspective : holding back scientific progress , when it felt that such progress threatened the religion 's authority in some way .
In other words , humanity would likely have far more scientific knowledge and better technology than it does today , if organized religion had never existed -- and so might have already eliminated poverty and sickness by now .
Because we'd be at minimum more technologically advanced by centuries over what we are today .
That makes for literally billions of people who 've needlessly died and suffered in past centuries , and / or the next 100 - 200 years .
You yourself will almost certainly end up being yet another person who dies or suffers unnecessarily -- where in an alternate timeline without religion , you might not even be familiar with the terms death and suffering , as they'd be so rare by this point .
If I care about you and the rest of the family , how could I possibly like organized religion in the face of all this ?
They 've robbed us all of our best destinies .
Around 1584 Italian monk Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake because he made the statement below and would not take it back : " Countless suns exist ; countless earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the planets revolve around our sun .
Living beings inhabit these worlds . "
The ( today ) much more famous and celebrated Galileo came perilously close to the same fate himself , merely for insisting that the Earth orbited the Sun rather than the other way around .
After he finally took it back under threat , he spent the rest of his life as a prisoner of the church .
Galileo Galilei
The church basically used terrorism to suppress scientific experimentation and innovation for many centuries -- except where it helped along torture and mass killings .
That 's part of the reason today 's militaries are so darn good at killing people ; military tech has always been nurtured by those in power .
Still being young though , I realize you may not know much about the history of religion , or even care .
That 's how most young people are .
I was too at your age .
But over time many people decide this stuff is more important than they originally thought .
You do realize do n't you that someone can be religious , but just be against organized religion , right ?
The question of whether God exists or not can be a separate issue from which particular religion you subscribe to ; some religions ( especially those which preceded the monotheist religions of Judaism , Christianity , and Islam in history ) held forth that there were multiple Gods rather than merely one .
You 're also equating my phrase about religion 's slowing of progress with your own personal mental state , when I 'm speaking of organized religion itself , the institution .
The one responsible for the torturing and executions and holding back of scientific progress over the centuries , mostly long before even your great grandparents were born .
How you could hold yourself responsible for that mystifies me -- but perhaps you did n't know about the church 's history , and that gap caused you to make the conceptual leap .
As for spending your time defending organized religion , you might want to more closely examine both its present and its past before committing yourself to that course .
You can be religious without being a pawn of organized religion or corrupt evangelists .
Lots of people live that way , and so are less troubled when they hear of the latest crimes by the organized religion set , since they are not themselves participants in or defenders of such groups or their leaders .

Google and [ insert any wireless carrier here ] are the last two entities in the world that we'd expect to issue a joint statement on net neutrality , seeing how Google firmly believes the FCC should enforce it regardless of medium while carriers generally want to be exempted -- but Verizon and The Goog have put their differences aside for just one day to put together a thoughtful , lengthy piece on the subject .
There are n't any surprises in the piece other than the fact that CEOs Lowell McAdam and Eric Schmidt are personally attributed to the statement , but it echoes what most ISPs have been saying since new FCC chair Julius Genachowski came into play : they generally acknowledge that a free , unhindered internet has led to a better world and that it's in everyone 's best interest to make sure that it continues to be that way .
They go on to say that " there will be disagreements along the way " -- Google and Verizon do n't see eye - to - eye on the finer points , for example -- but that they 're all looking forward to a spirited debate with the folks over in Washington .
Ultimately , the FCC 's ability to effectively police true neutrality on wireless networks ties in deeply with its ability to free up a lot more spectrum -- something the CTIA 's been pushing for lately -- and Genachowski recently mentioned that they'd be looking into it , so this could all end up working out without any broken hearts or black eyes .

Michael Palin has told how he felt " very angry " and " very let down " after his BBC1 travel show New Europe was censured by the BBC Trust .
The BBC Trust 's editorial standards committee ruled in August last year that Palin had oversimplified the issues when he talked , during the series ' opening episode , about who was to blame for the Balkan wars of the 1990s .
This rebuke from the corporation 's governing body followed one complaint from a viewer who felt the programme had given an " inaccurate " view of the conflict and had entered into the realm of " political commentary " .
In its ruling , the BBC Trust said the programme - makers should have taken " greater care to ensure accuracy " but added that the show had not had a political message .
The complaint was only partially upheld with regard to accuracy and impartiality .
The trust also said non-news shows should remember the importance of checking facts .
It is over a year since the trust handed down its verdict on the show , which aired in 2007 , but Palin is clearly still fuming .
" The complaint was upheld .
That , I believe , brings the BBC into disrepute .
I think it was a stupid decision .
I felt very , very angry and very let down , " Palin told a Royal Television Society veterans ' lunch .
" I had a complaint from someone , as far as I gather a serial complainer , who said I had n't condemned the Serbs roundly enough in the programme , " said Palin , who is quoted in the current issue of the RTS magazine , Television .
" Fair enough , everyone has opinions . "
New Europe , in which Palin travelled around eastern Europe to discover what had happened in the wake of the break - up of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union , was the former Monty Python star 's seventh travel series for the BBC .
Palin also told the RTS lunch there was not the creative freedom within the BBC to make a programme like Monty Python today .
" I think we would be looked at very carefully .
There would be much more managerial interference , which there never was , " he said .
" We were allowed to get on with our show once they had agreed it .
I just do n't think it would be the same nowadays and I think that is regrettable .
We are in danger of having to be so accountable to everybody for everything [ the BBC ] does and the wider public . "
Palin 's globe - trotting series began with Around the World in 80 Days in 1989 , which has subsequently been followed by Pole to Pole , Full Circle , Hemingway , Sahara and Himalaya .
One critic described New Europe , which aired on BBC1 in 2007 , as " a tour , as always , liberally punctuated with booze and characters you would hesitate to make up " .

Last week , I needed create a scale drawing of my basement floor plan .
My license for OmniGraffle Professional are long since out - of - date .
I did n’t want to pay $ 200 for a new license or even another $ 75 if I can dig up one of my old license keys .
So , what ’s a hacker to do ?
Roll his own ( on top of Zach ’s Vecto library ) .
My first cut worked , but was pretty ugly :
( with - floor - plan # P " basement.png " 200.0
( interior - wall : start ( cons ( - 91 31 1 / 2 ) 0 ) ; hose cover
: north 18
: east ( + 31 1 / 2 ) )
( interior - wall : start ( cons 91 ( - 103 27 30 ) ) ; storage wall

( interior - wall : start ( cons ( + 91 83 ) 103 ) ; fish - tank wall
: to ' ( 91 .
103 )
: south 27 )
... )
I ended up with large calculations like that ( - 103 27 30 ) you see there .
It worked .
I got an okay looking floor - plan out of it .
But , it was obvious that it needed some rethinking .
My next thought was turtle graphics !
Tell things where to move .
Tell it to start drawing an interior wall .
Tell it where to move .
Tell it to start drawing a window .
Tell it where to move .
Tell it to stop drawing a window .
Etc.
This has possibilities , especially for an internal representation ( which I need because I want to autoscale the drawing to fit on a sheet of paper well , so I ca n’t start drawing until I ’ve determined the extents ) .
However , it seems awkward to go with all of the start / stop commands .
I am thinking of going more in this sort of direction :
;;
The floor - plan stuff works in units .
To facility readability , I am
; ; going to make some simple functions that use feet and inches instead
; ; of units .
If you want centimeters and meters , go for it .

Has anyone tackled this problem well already ?
Or , have any suggestions of how to improve this ?
President Ahmadinejad 's re-election in June triggered mass protests
Three people detained after June 's disputed presidential election have been sentenced to death , Iran 's Isna news agency reports .
The judgements are preliminary and must be confirmed by a higher court , Isna says .
Full names have not been given .
So far the only named opposition activist reported as having been sentenced to death over post-election protests is Mohammad Reza Ali Zamani .
The unrest was triggered by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re-election .
On Saturday Isna quoted Zahed Bashiri Rad , a justice ministry official , as saying : " Three people who were accused ( for their role ) in the post- election incidents have been sentenced to death . "
Referring to the three using only initials , Mr Rad said " MZ " and " AP " had been convicted for ties with the Kingdom Assembly of Iran , a banned monarchist group , and " NA " for links with the People 's Mujahideen , another group advocating the overthrow of the Islamic republic .
On Thursday , an Iranian reformist website reported that Mr Zamani , 37 , had been sentenced to death .
It is unclear whether he is the " MZ " mentioned by Isna .
The London - based human - rights group Amnesty International has condemned the reported death sentence on Mr Zamani , and called his trial a " mockery of justice " .
Mr Ahmadinejad's 12 June re-election was followed by massive street protests over alleged vote - rigging .
At least 30 protesters were killed in clashes and thousands were arrested .
Most of those detained have been released , but about 200 remain behind bars and some 110 have been put on trial .
Not Child 's Play : ' I Feel Like I Have a Real Baby ' Women embrace " reborns , " designed to look and feel like a real newborn .
Jan. 2 , 2009  --
There is almost nothing as miraculous as a newborn baby .
And for some women , the desire for a tiny infant never goes away .
To satisfy their yearning , they 're turning to so - called " reborns , " dolls that are designed to look and feel just like a real newborn baby .
Linda , 49 , who asked that her last name be kept private , is one of the few women willing to speak about her relationship with reborns .
She says she enjoys taking them out and about with her and comforts them like actual infants .
" It feels like I have a real baby , " she said .
Married with no children of her own , Linda says she feels like a mom now that she has reborns .
" I take them out to the park , if I 'm walking the dog , and maybe put it in its stroller , or put it in its sling , or hold it in a blanket , and people do think it 's real . "
Linda even buys them real baby clothes because she says , " They do n't fit in doll clothes .
You have to buy real baby sizes . "
Linda admits that her dolls are kind of a substitute for babies and that she especially savors moments when other people think that her reborns are real .
" I guess it would be considered , like , a maternal instinct , " she said .
" You 're , like , all happy and proud , ' cause they 're , you know , googling over your baby . "
When asked whether she had considered adopting a real baby , Linda said it was n't the right choice for her .
" It 's very difficult to get , you know , " she said .
" And it 's a lot more expensive than buying the little dolls . "
On average , Linda spends about $ 500 for each reborn , which are delivered by mail to her home .
Her first , named Jodi , is from Florida - based doll artist Eve Newsom .
" I call my reborns babies , " Newsom said .
" Because to me , by the time I 'm finished , the purpose is to make it a baby . "
Creating the dolls is an elaborate process that begins with vinyl doll parts and glass eyeballs imported from Germany .
The blush of newborn skin is created by adding several layers of flesh - colored paint .
To seal it , the dolls have to be baked .
Their limbs and head are then cooled .
Then Newsom painstakingly microroots more than 20,000 strands of mohair onto the dolls head .
The result : an astonishingly lifelike doll that a woman somewhere is yearning for .
" I want to do this and it pleases me and fortunately it pleases thousands of others , " said Newsom .
" Not just hundreds , but thousands . "
For some , the fake babies fill a void .
In Newsom 's case , it is a void left by having seven miscarriages .
" Not being able to have children .
And not having the resources , actually , to adopt , " she said .
" This was my calling .
And now it 's my passion .
...
My reborns bring me a medium of joy and happiness . "
She added that while the reborns " do n't reciprocate , exactly , " she finds her experience with them to be " very nurturing , it 's very cathartic for me . "
The reborn phenomenon is a growing trend in the United States and overseas .
ABC
News went to a reborn convention this summer in Illinois to learn more about the fascination with these dolls .
Lachelle Moore and her husband , Alan , drove nearly four hours to the convention in hopes of bringing home an addition to their already large family that includes grown children and grandchildren .
Lachelle Moore said that she still feels the need for babies who'll never grow up .
" What 's so wonderful about reborns is that they 're forever babies , " she said .
" They do n't give you any trouble .
There 's no college tuition , no dirty diapers . …
Just the good part of motherhood . "
That day , she purchased a reborn called Rachel for $ 1,400 to add to her collection of 36 dolls .
More Than a Hobby ?
Psychiatrist Sue Varma , who teaches at the NYU School of Medicine , believes that for some , collecting reborns is " more than just a hobby . "
" Where it may become a problem , [ is ] if this is used as the only means of social interaction , " said Varma .
" If it 's being used as a prop . "
Studies show that when cuddling a real baby , brain chemicals are released that cause a kind of emotional rush .
No one knows if that happens with reborns , but Varma said , " I would not be surprised to learn that if a woman is holding a fake baby , that she would have the same chemical , hormonal reactions as if she was holding a real baby . "
Several woman we spoke to called holding the reborns " cuddle therapy . "
And when Linda received a new , dark - haired baby from Newsom , she seemed like a mom seeing her child for the first time .
" She 's beautiful , oh my God , she 's gorgeous ! " Linda said .
Some people may think taking a fake baby out in a stroller and buying them real baby clothes is just bizarre , but Linda says it 's better than having a " crazy habit " such as " drinking , or something that 's going to hurt you . "
" It 's like a hobby , " she said , " and it does n't really hurt anybody . "
Demonoid is one of the largest BitTorrent trackers on the planet and , unfortunately for those interested in the site , also one of the most secretive .
With the site currently out of action with little indication when it will return , there are certainly plenty of questions .
An interview with Demonoid 's Ukranian host certainly proves to be of great interest .
While the admins of some of the larger public torrent sites such as The Pirate Bay , Mininova and isoHunt are happy to give interviews , many others demonstrate a certain phobia of the media .
One major site that has showed an acute aversion to saying just about anything to outsiders is Demonoid .
This semi-private site has nevertheless made the news dozens of times , most recently due to its recent downtime , as reported here on TorrentFreak .
“ We are experiencing power outages that have caused some ram and hard drive issues .
We might have to shut down everything to fix and prevent further damage , ” said Demonoid in a statement six weeks ago , warning that downtime could run to “ … days maybe , until we can change the power circuit . ”
However , TorrentFreak has received possibly conflicting information from Demonoid ’s host , Colocall in Ukraine , who said in a statement : “ There were no problems with power supply at the location where Demonoid servers are hosted . ”
While information about Demonoid is always scarce , information coming out of Colocall is a rarity too , since the company has previously refused to speak with journalists about their most infamous customer .
That ’s why it was of great interest when Ukrainian blogger Pavel Golubovskiy contacted TorrentFreak to say he had netted an interview with Colocall .
Here is a translation of the questions related to Demonoid ;
Why did you choose to host Demonoid ?
The customer came to us and ordered a particular service .
For us it was n’t a political decision , Demonoid is an ordinary client for us .
What exactly do you host , the inferno.demonoid.com tracker ?
They brought their servers , which are now located in our data center .
We do n’t know what information is stored there – we do not have access to this information .
These servers are supported remotely by Demonoid technical staff .
Demonoid ’s servers
Is there a way to contact the Demonoid admins ?
They will not answer you .
Many people want to contact them – journalists , fans , police , local authorities from different countries .
But the Demonoid admins have a very selective approach to e-mail correspondence .
When the police wanted to contact them , I specifically warned the admins that they had to respond to this request .
So the police already inquired about Demonoid ?
Well , our local authorities are interested in Demonoid all the time .
Rightholders associations are constantly trying to put pressure on us , including pressure with the help of Ukrainian authorities .
We redirect them to the admins , but do not interfere or try to negotiate .
Are they putting any serious pressure on you ?
It sounds strange , but Ukraine is still a jural state .
Therefore IFPI ’s personal opinion is just that , their personal opinion , despite the fact that the budgets of the IFPI participants are comparable to the budget of the Ukraine .
Are n’t you afraid that there can be a similar situation with Demonoid ’s servers as there was with Infostore.org site ?
[ famous Ukrainian file - sharing site , its servers were confiscated by police about a year ago ]
As a hosting - provider we take such risks into account .
This can happen not only with Demonoid , but with any client .
We do not control what information is stored on servers , anybody can buy our hosting service .
Anti-pirates and the media - lobby are now trying to shift all the responsibility for file - sharing onto Internet providers , so that providers will have to monitor user activities .
Will this affect hosting providers too ?
We have such laws in draft in our parliament periodically .
But the Ukrainian law “ On communication ” is clear about this : providers are not responsible for what their customers do .
And the fact that rights holders want to change that is their personal opinion , they are not legislative bodies .
Let them buy a parliament member and lobby for such law , then we will observe this law .
But until then they are nobody to us , and we are nobody for them too .
About a month ago Demonoid reported technical problems .
Due to those problems all data for the last several months has vanished .
In an attempt to recover from these problems the site went offline .
Do you know what happened ?
Some time ago several of their hard - drives crashed .
But that was several months ago and we do n’t know what was the reason of recent problems .
According to their admins , the man who can restore the tracker is not available .
Are they speaking about some Colocall programmer ?
No , all the technical support of servers is performed remotely .
They are n’t speaking about one of our specialists .
Torrentfreak wrote about the president of Lithuanian antipirates , who demanded the closure of access to Demonoid .
He said that it is very hard to even make contact with you .
Have you spoken with him ?
Yes , someone called us .
We just could not speak with him : from the start of the conversation he immediately began to threaten us , he was absolutely non-constructive .
We sent him to the court and have said that if he brings the court ’s decision , we will be happy to execute it , because we observe all Ukrainian laws .
Until then we are not going to speak with him .
Access to Demonoid is blocked for several countries including Ukraine .
Is this your initiative or the tracker ’s decision ?
It is the tracker ’s policy , not our initiative .
I think this is due to DDoS - attacks .
Are there any DDoS - attacks aiming at Demonoid ?
Yes , there are many large and serious DDoS - attacks .
But they are always the problem of every hosting provider .
We have learned how to neutralize them , so such attacks have almost no effect on Demonoid ’s operations .
And , incidentally , Demonoid is n’t the only site to be attacked : during the last election we hosted the server of the central election commission committee , it was constantly under DDoS - attacks .
I was one of those , but then I graduated .
Now I am a bachelor …of arts … but also a regular bachelor , which makes me DOUBLE ELIGIBLE .
This flowchart should help any potential artists to determine their place in the creative world without any unnecessary existential pondering .
witness the failure !

Ian McEwan has revealed that his next novel will draw on his own experience of media controversy .
The protagonist is a Nobel prize - winning physicist who faces media attacks after he suggests that men outnumber women at the top of his profession because of inherent differences in their brains , rather than any gender discrimination .
McEwan found himself under a similar kind of fire last summer , besieged by the media after he told an Italian newspaper that he " despise [d ]
Islamism , because it wants to create a society that I detest " .
It prompted a wave of articles picking over his words including a piece in the Independent headlined " McEwan faces backlash over press interview " .
" I said something like I thought there was something morally abhorrent about Islamism and I opened the Independent the next day and it has me attacking Islam .
And it 's deeply dishonest , " McEwan told the Eastern Daily Press yesterday , in an interview in which he also reveals details about his new novel .
" I do n't think I was drawing on any specific thing [ in my new novel ] ...
I think my encounters have been minor compared with some of the things we 've watched in recent years .
And I 've seen it happen to friends , " he went on , referring to the outcry over Martin Amis 's comment in 2006 that " the Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order " .
( McEwan defended Amis in a letter to the Guardian at the time , saying his friend was " no racist " . )
The author revealed that he is three - quarters of the way through writing the new book , which will probably be called Solar .
It follows the story of the physicist Michael Beard , who discovers a way to fight climate change after managing to derive power from artificial photosynthesis , using light to split water into hydrogen and oxygen .
" I devised a character into whom I poured many , many faults .
He 's devious , he lies , he 's predatory in relation to women ; he steadily gets fatter through the novel .
He 's a sort of planet , I guess .
He makes endless reforming decisions about himself : Rio , Kyoto - type assertions of future virtue that lead nowhere , " McEwan told the EDP .
After Beard makes his fateful remark at a symposium , he is attacked by academics and the media , where the words " Nazi " and " eugenics " are used .
" Things can fall apart for people and they usually happen very quickly and catastrophically and unexpectedly , " said McEwan .
He admitted to increasing frustration about climate change deniers as he researched the book , which included time spent with scientists in a boat on an Arctic fjord .
" The thing with science is it does n't deal in certainties , it deals in probabilities , and there are some vigorous deniers here and in the States .
Usually they 're people , not very bright , who have n't grasped certain fundamental ideas about , say , statistics , " he said .
" It amazes me .
I was reading pieces only a couple of weeks ago not only denying that it 's anthropogenic , caused by humans , but denying that there 's any temperature rise .
I mean heavens , it 's so overwhelming … I think just talk to a salmon fisherman , if you do n't want to talk to scientists .
Go talk to a ski-lift operator in Switzerland . "
The new novel , his first since 2007's Booker - nominated On Chesil Beach , is expected to be published next year .

British soldiers might have been out for " revenge " when they detained an Iraqi civilian who died in their custody , a public inquiry has heard .
Baha Mousa 's father said he had reported members of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment after seeing them break into a safe .
Basra police officer Daoud Mousa told the London hearing he believed this was why his son had been killed in 2003 .
The inquiry is looking into the death , detainees ' treatment and army methods .
Baha Mousa and nine other civilians were arrested at the Haitham hotel in Basra on 14 September 2003 .
Soldiers from the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , which has since been amalgamated , found weapons on the premises .
AT THE SCENE Caroline McClatchey , BBC News
It was appropriate that the first witness should be Daoud Mousa , the father of Baha Mousa , whose death is at the centre of the inquiry .
Dressed in a grey suit and green tie , he looked very much like a police officer in the witness box .
He was a major in the Basra police force at one time but had to retire because he was not part of Saddam 's clique .
Speaking through a translator , he spoke about his and Baha 's hopes for a better future .
He remained composed until he was asked about the effect of Baha 's death on the family .
He simply broke down , covered his eyes with a handkerchief and could n't answer the question .
Hotel staff insisted the weapons were kept for security , but they were taken to a detention centre at the Battle Group Main camp , under suspicion of being insurgents .
Two days later , father - of - two Mr Mousa , 26 , was dead .
A post -mortem examination showed he suffered asphyxiation and had at least 93 injuries to his body , including fractured ribs and a broken nose .
Daoud Mousa told the inquiry his son had " been happy when the British troops came in " .
He said Saddam Hussein had forced him out of his job as a police major in 1991 and his son " hated " the former Iraqi leader for that .
Daoud Mousa has since rejoined the force .
He spoke to the soldiers ' commanding officer when he saw three or four members of the regiment " pocketing money " after he went to the hotel to pick up his son .
He said : " I thought that it was a violation of English dignity and honour , and the honour of English troops . "
Recalling the time when he saw Baha Mousa had been detained by soldiers , he said : " I think they knew the one I was pointing to was my son , therefore they wanted revenge against me . "
In a statement read out at the inquiry , he said : " I believe that my son may have been treated worse than other people because I had made a complaint ... that money was being stolen from the hotel safe . "
A six - month court martial saw seven soldiers facing war crimes charges relating to Mr Mousa 's death .
In April 2007 , all but Cpl Donald Payne - who admitted inhumanely treating civilians - were cleared on all counts .
He was dismissed from the Army and sentenced to one year in a civilian jail .
Once two soldiers punched me at the same time as if they were acting in a movie
Witness D3
At the inquiry , Daoud Mousa refused to accept an apology from Cpl Payne 's barrister , Michael Topolski QC .
The barrister said : " He , for whom I speak , regrets what he did and he apologises to you and to your family for the death of your son .
I hope you will accept that from me . "
In response , Daoud Mousa said : " I will not accept an apology of a criminal . "
' Unbelievably cruel '
The inquiry has heard interrogation methods used by British troops in Iraq were banned by the UK government in 1972 .
These included hooding , sleep deprivation and forcing suspects to stand in painful " stress positions " .
TIMELINE OF KEY EVENTS 14 Sep 2003 Baha Mousa and nine other Iraqis arrested at Haitham Hotel in Basra by members of the 1st Battalion The Queen 's Lancashire Regiment 16 Sep 2003 Mr Mousa dies in British army custody in Iraq with multiple injuries 30 April 2007 Cpl Donald Payne jailed for a year and dismissed from the Army for inhumanely treating civilian detainees 27 March 2008 MoD admits breaching the human rights of Mr Mousa and others 14 May 2008 Defence Secretary Des Browne announces public inquiry to be held into Mr Mousa 's death 10 July 2008 MoD agrees to pay £ 2.83 m compensation to mistreated detainees 13 July 2009 Public inquiry begins in London
Q&A : Baha Mousa inquiry
In his statement to the inquiry , Daoud Mousa said : " There are various features of the way my son was treated which I find particularly appalling , and which I want to make sure are given proper public recognition ...
" I sense that it might be convenient to blame everything on a few rogue soldiers .
I would like to see whether that is really the case , or whether some of the practices that went on with my son also went on elsewhere . "
After finishing his evidence , Mr Mousa made a statement in the street outside the building where the inquiry is being held .
" I came to London to reveal the truth and to bring justice and to find out who authorised the killing of my son , " he said .
A hotel worker detained with Baha Mousa told the inquiry the treatment by British soldiers was " unbelievably cruel " .
Hooded and handcuffed , they were forced to stand and not allowed to sleep for three days , he said .
Referred to only as D3 , he said the soldiers punched detainees in the chest and kneed them in the stomach , and one spat in his face .
" Once two soldiers punched me at the same time as if they were acting in a movie .
They were laughing , " he said .
Along with Baha Mousa , he was among a group who had posed for photographs with guns stored at the hotel .
But D3 said the weapons did not belong to insurgents and the purpose of the pictures was " just fun " .

For anyone fascinated by advertising as culture , I recommend an afternoon watching a NASCAR Sprint Cup stock car race on TV .
I also prescribe an overstuffed chair and a bowlful of M&Ms ; mixed with No -Doz .
On Sunday , during an interminable 400 - miler from Dover , Del. , I saw a commercial that made me sit bolt upright in my Barcalounger , an ad that in its innocence and whimsy and desire for eyeballs would destroy one of the most valuable illusions of advertising .
That illusion :
In celebrity product endorsements , celebrities get to lie .
During a live webcast Oct. 20 , NASCAR star Tony Stewart will be hooked up to a polygraph and asked : Does Tony really love Burger King ’s Whopper sandwich ?
The webcast will be the climax of a monthlong campaign by Crispin Porter +
Bogusky -- “ The Truth About Tony ” -- that seeks to demonstrate that Stewart actually , really , truly loves eating Whoppers .
It ’s especially telling that a NASCAR driver is being asked to make this demonstration of product fealty .
The one thing these guys have got is street cred .
Advertisement
The set - up spot , which is also in rotation , is called “ Tony Stewart ’s School of Endorsements . ”
The driver , in uniform , is in front of a classroom of C - list celebrities -- Carrot Top , Erik Estrada -- advising them on how to better their sales .
Tony ’s advice : “ Endorse things you love . ”
“ Of course he loves Whoppers , ” my wife sneered as she passed through the room .
“ I mean , just look at him . ”
( Stewart has a wee bit of a weight problem . )
Because it ’s played for laughs , the BK campaign can easily be taken too lightly , but at stake is a fundamental dynamic in celebrity - based advertising .
As Daniel J. Boorstin noted ages ago , celebrities are synthetic creatures , walking , talking , media - processed fictions that have little in common with the three - dimensional beings who share their names and bank accounts .
And because they enjoy this semi-magical , almost folkloric existence , they can effectively endorse just about any product .
We do n’t expect them actually to be invested .
The grammar of celebrity endorsement says , simply : Lie to us .
We instinctively know that , for instance , Sarah Jessica Parker is not running down to Target to pick up a bottle of Garnier hair coloring .
You probably ca n’t get within 10 blocks of her with that stuff .
And yet she happily appears in Garnier ads , and the company happily pays the seven - figure freight to have her .

I suppose it ’s possible that rail - thin glam - giraffes Paris Hilton and Padma Lakshmi devour 1,000 - calorie Carl ’s Jr. burgers , but only if they ’ve acquired salutary tapeworms along the way .
This is -- or has been -- the way of things since before Buffalo Bill endorsed Spencer carbines .
Nobody particularly cared if John Wayne smoked Camels or Bing Crosby drove Ford Thunderbirds .
No one ever enforced a notion that celebrities have to love or use the products they endorse ( although endorsement contracts stipulate that the party should avoid being photographed using a rival product ) .
It was an understanding between the medium and the mediated .
But I wonder whether the ground has moved and whether Crispin Porter +
Bogusky -- with access to some of the best culture seismographs available -- has n’t picked up on it ?
Do consumers want to truth - squad celebrities ?
Elizabeth Harrison , principal at Harrison & Shriftman public relations , told a Wall Street Journal panel this year : “ The worst is when [ an endorsement ] absolutely has zero integrity and you see a celebrity wearing something , doing something , going to something that makes zero sense for that celebrity .
. . .
It can really backfire on you , because the media picks it up , and particularly now , with all the blogs that are going on .
Everybody ’s much quicker to spot those things and to actually speak about them . ”

In other words , the magnifying glass is bigger and therefore the focus on authenticity is sharper .
Meanwhile , the “ accidental ” product endorsement -- in the form of supposedly candid paparazzi shots of , say , Brad Pitt carrying a Starbucks latte or Simon Cowell wearing a Chopard watch -- has been exposed as being almost always stage - managed .
In fact , paparazzi will now give celebs products to hold , in order for both parties to profit .
The result : the pleasant fiction between celebrity endorser and consumer has been badly eroded .
GreenLight , a talent and rights representation company , assayed the coverage of the recent 61st Primetime Emmy Awards broadcast and found a sharp decline in the percentage of celebrity endorsement ads .
GreenLight found that fewer than 6 % of ads on the broadcast involved celebrities , down from 75 % the year before .
It ’s partly a matter of cutting costs -- celebrities are expensive -- but it also seems to be an index of broken faith .
We ’re living through a crisis of confidence on all fronts , so it should n’t surprise us that consumers are growing suspicious of even our secular gods .
But , if the Tony Stewart ads are any indication , celeb endorsers are going to have to put their mouths where their money is .

This was my column , as approved by my editor , that the Courant refused to publish about one of its biggest advertisers .
It was scheduled to run on Aug. 2 but was held without an explanation .
This was the first time in my 40 years at The Courant that an investigation by the attorney general was withheld from the public .
State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal says he has launched an investigation into consumer complaints that Sleepyâ€™s sold mattresses or box springs that were used instead of new , and in one case infested with bedbugs .
Blumenthal said last month that he has up to 10 recent complaints against Sleepyâ€™s , the largest mattress chain in the United States , with 74 stores in Connecticut .
A letter from Adam S. Blank , Sleepyâ€™s general counsel and chief operating officer .
Please click here .
A letter from Stern Environmental Group to Sleepy ’s customer Jeff Maier .
Please click here .
â€ œWe have received a number of complaints , up to 10 , that mattresses maybe have been used , with groves and deep depressions , â€ Blumenthal said in an interview with me .
Prior to that interview I asked Blumenthal to check to see whether any other mattress retailers had complaints filed against them of giving customers used mattresses or of bed bug infestation .
â€ œSleepyâ€™s was the only oneâ€ the attorney general replied .
Sleepyâ€™s denies it has ever sold a used mattress and says its inspection and quality control process would make it impossible for someone to receive a product infested with bedbugs .
It says there has never been a proven case of bedbug infestations caused by their merchandise .
Sleepyâ€™s , with 700 stores nationwide , says that the number of complaints against it is tiny compared to the hundreds of thousands of mattresses the company sells each year .
And almost all of the complaints were resolved .
Blumenthalâ€™s investigation into Sleepyâ€™s operations is the second in Connecticut since 2004 when the company paid a $ 4,000 fine to consumer protection .
Two years ago Sleepyâ€™s , according to the Better Business Bureau , paid a $ 200,000 fine to New York City consumer officials as part of a settlement .
The BBB said that the company faced charges that it used â€ œdeceptive sales tactics , including exchanging defective mattresses with equally defective mattresses ; charging additional delivery fees to consumers for exchanging damaged mattresses ; failing to deliver items when scheduled and not properly informing or offering customers store credit or refund ; and refusing to honor manufacturer warranties because of alleged stains .
Jeff Maier , a Norwalk small businessman , asked Blumenthal to investigate Sleepyâ€™s last December because he and his wife had a â€˜â€ ™severeâ€ ™â€™ bedbug infestation that Maier said was the result of buying what appeared to be a used box spring from the Stamford Sleepyâ€™s store .
One week after receiving the box spring , Maier said in a telephone interview , his wife began developing red spots , which Maier said came from bedbugs .
He said they hired the Stern Environmental Group of Secaucus , N.J. to investigate and to exterminate the bugs .
The company â€ “ which specializes in ridding homes of bedbugs – dismantled the box spring and determined that it was the cause of the infestation , Maier said .
Stern Environmental Groupâ€™s report , made available to me , states that the â€œbox spring … was the culprit .
There were bedbugs inside and the box spring did not look like it was new.â€ 
Maier said it took two months before all the bedbugs could be killed .
( During that time , he told me , he and his wife had to stay in their bed because if they slept somewhere else the bedbugs would have moved with them . )
He said Sleepyâ€™s attorneys offered a replacement box spring , but they denied that the bedbugs came from their merchandise .
Maier said he was suspicious when the delivery was made because the heavy plastic used to seal the box spring appeared to have been opened .
He said one of the workers assured him that it was opened by them as they took it out of their truck .
Maier said there is no other explanation for the bedbug infestation .
The couple had not slept anywhere else in the weeks prior to their purchase , Maier said , and their personal habits had not changed .
Adam S. Blank , Sleepyâ€™s general counsel and chief operating officer , said last month Sleepyâ€™s was unaware of Blumenthalâ€™s investigation and said bedbugs do not originate in beds , but come from people .
If Sleepyâ€™s had delivered a box spring to Maier that contained bedbugs , all the other merchandise on the truck would have also had bedbugs , he wrote in a five - page response to my questions .
â€ œSleepyâ€™s does not now , has never , and will never , sell a used mattress .
Any claim to the contrary we find to be defamatory , â€ wrote Blank .
The BBB report state that in the past three years , 633 complaints were filed against Sleepyâ€™s 700 stores ( no state - by - state breakdown available ) .
BBB statistics show that complaints grew yearly in the following areas : warranty issues , product issues , refund or exchange issues , selling practices and delivery issues .
â€ œComplaints to the BBB have alleged failure to provide timely delivery ; failure to honor warranties and guarantees ; credit and billing disputes ; and poor product quality .
This firm has failed to eliminate the underlying cause of complaints brought to its attention by the Bureau , â€ the bureau reports on its web site .
Better Bedding , with nine stores in Connecticut and now in reorganization in Bankruptcy Court , has had four complaints with the BBB in the past three years and still has its top rating of A +.
In 2002 Sleepyâ€™s paid a $ 4,000 fine to Connecticut consumer officials as part of a settlement into complaints the company delivered mattresses in the middle of night and delivered defective merchandise , and a complaint that used merchandise may have been sold as new .
In all four cases , Sleepyâ€™s did not admit to any wrongdoing , which is common in out - of - court settlements .
The report from Stern , Sleepyâ€™s complete response , the 2002 Connecticut settlement details , and the BBB reports , as well as details of the four settlements will be published on this blog .

Amazon set off an online uproar when , in response to the discovery that it was vending unlicensed literary content , it summarily deleted copies of works by George Orwell from the Kindles of some users .
Now , as part of the settlement from a lawsuit that ensued , the company has publicly clarified the policy that will govern any future deletions .
Amazon 's initial decision to delete the works after purchase outraged many Kindle owners , but the company quickly admitted that the decision was a mistake and said that , under similar circumstances , it would not take the same action .
But that left some people wondering if there were situations where content might still be deleted .
Others remained bothered by the fact that some of their own work vanished along with the Orwell text .
One of the Kindle 's highly touted features is the ability to attach notes directly to sections of the text ; these did not survive the deletion .
At least one user , Justin Gawronski , was annoyed enough to take action , filing a suit against the retailer after the notes he took as part of a school assignment vanished .
More worrisome for Amazon , presumably , were his attempts to have the suit turned into a class action on behalf of all the other Orwell buyers .
Since that suit was filed , however , Amazon has offered affected users a new ( presumably legal ) copy of the lost works or a $ 30 gift certificate , good for three new books .
That apparently took the wind out of the Gawronski's sails .
The Seattle site TechFlash spotted that the suit has now been settled .
In a series of stipulations , the parties agree that the new refund offer left Gawronski feeling he no longer had a case : " Plaintiffs believe they would not likely be able to certify classes under Rule 23 ( b ) ( 3 ) because of Amazon ’s offer to fully reimburse affected consumers for all Subject Works previously removed by Amazon from Devices and to restore notes and annotations . "
But that 's not the most interesting aspect of the settlement .
In it , Amazon 's attorneys agreed to legally binding terms that describe its content deletion policy .
When it comes to blog and periodical content , as well as software , Amazon retains the right to perform a remote delete .
But when it comes to books , deletions will only occur under a limited number of circumstances : failed credit card transactions , judicial orders , malware , or the permission of the user .
Amazon is also covering Gawronski's lawyer fees , but only with the understanding that the proceeds be given to charity , preferably one focused on literacy , education , or health .
Typically , legal settlements are sealed to prevent the terms from being made public , but you can understand why both parties were happy to let this one come to light , given that the primary result is a healthy donation to charity .
And , presumably , Amazon wants the opportunity to explain its deletion policy in more detail .
Lazy Susan KIRO Colleagues Had Plenty of Nicknames for Susan Hutchison Before She Ran for King County Executive — None of Them Good
One evening in the mid-1980s , back when Susan Hutchison was still an anchor at KIRO - TV , a news producer who had n't finished writing the last two sentences of an evening news teaser decided to put in some placeholder text .
Instead of writing something like " Two Chihuahuas roasted in a house fire , film at 11 ! " the producer , Peggy Mapes , wrote : " Blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . "
According to several people who worked for KIRO at the time , Mapes later updated the text with the correct script — but someone forgot to update Hutchison 's teleprompter .
" Susan did n't proofread the tease beforehand , " said Kelly Guenther , an intern at KIRO in the ' 80s who went on to work at KING 5 Television .
The story of what happened next is famous among KIRO staff .
" She reads it cold , " Guenther said , " and actually says , on air , ' Blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . ' "
Guenther continued : " Apparently Susan does n't realize the gaffe , nor apparently was it ever recorded .
But few have ever forgotten that it occurred . "
Other anchors would have ad - libbed the rest — realizing the text was all wrong — but Hutchison was infamous at KIRO for being capable of nothing more than reciting the words on her teleprompter .
" Maybe it was an unfortunate case that her brain was turned off and she did n't catch it , " said Natalia Dotto , a former producer at KIRO television who has heard the story and started about the time that Hutchison left the station .
But , added Guenther : " In the six or seven different newsrooms I 've worked in , there really was a sense of this anchor at KIRO not being the sharpest tool in the shed . "
This sentiment was echoed by a half - dozen former KIRO employees contacted by The Stranger .
Each one of them remembers Hutchison , who is now running for King County executive , as a dim bulb who was unfamiliar with current events and was considered unqualified to report in the field or handle a serious interview .
Because of this , they said , she earned the nicknames " airhead " and " bubblehead , " and had a reputation as a " dilettante news reader . "
" There were anchors known as journalists , and Susan was n't , " said Lauri Hennessey , an editor at KIRO radio from 1983 to 1989 .
By comparison , anchors on competing stations in the same years — Kathi Goertzen at KOMO and , in particular , Jean Enersen at KING — were revered as bona fide journalists with a tight grasp on the issues .
Hutchison was KIRO 's lead evening news anchor from 1983 to 2002 .
It was plenty of time to generate the name recognition that has helped her in her race against Democrat Dow Constantine , but it was also plenty of time to generate a collection of amusing stories that now leave her former coworkers aghast at the idea that Hutchison could potentially wind up in the most powerful job in the King County government .
" My friends who worked at KIRO — none of us ever had any problems with her , but we never expected her to be running the county , " Hennessey says .
" This is a very tough job that deserves a very smart person .
I never , ever , ever , ever would guess that she would be in that position .
I never saw the intellectual depth in Susan Hutchison that I would expect in a King County executive . "
Among the incidents that have become legend in the KIRO newsroom is the tale of the vanishing telephone .
Richard Pauli , a television - news photographer for seven years at KIRO , recalled that the phone in the makeup room kept on disappearing , and " finally someone spray - painted it yellow and green , and made it really ugly " in order to discourage its theft .
" Susan looked at the telephone , " Pauli recalled , " and said , ' This is an ugly phone — let 's get rid of it . ' "
When a crew member explained to her that the phone was painted yellow and green to dissuade people from stealing it , Hutchison is said to have asked , " Who would want that number ? "
In another story told around KIRO , Hutchison saw an image on one of the monitors of an employee lying on a couch on the studio set .
But it was a freeze - frame taken earlier , and the man had since gotten up .
" She had a confused look on her face , walked up to the couch , and looked behind it , " Pauli said , recounting the tale as it was told to him by people who he said had witnessed the event .
" Her reality was so attached to what was on the monitor that she could not accept that reality was somehow different . "
Hutchison also earned the nickname " Lazy Susan . "
As this story goes , Hutchison told a producer trying to rotate a television set that he needed a lazy Susan — a platform that swivels — and then someone in the newsroom said , " We 've already got one of those . "
In addition to all the employee lore , there are also court records that show that Hutchison created some bad blood at KIRO and was thought to have a questionable work ethic .
She sued the station in 2003 for what she claimed was age and race discrimination after KIRO hired Kristy Lee — a younger , Asian woman — to take her place , according to papers filed with King County Superior Court .
Hutchison alleged she had been " replaced in part because she is older and Caucasian . "
When Hutchison discovered that Lee received time off over the Fourth of July holiday in 2002 — time Hutchison had tried to take off herself — she called in sick , according to the court records .
But she apparently was n't sick .
" I heard that another KIRO employee had seen Hutchison canoeing in the Bend , Oregon , area on those so - called sick days , " KIRO former general manager John Woodin said , according to the court record .
On July 25 , the station suspended Hutchison for five days .
Following the canoeing incident , a demotion , and a drop in ratings , Hutchison left the station .
On the campaign trail , Hutchison has repeatedly cited her tenure at KIRO as evidence of a strong résumé .
But the half - dozen former colleagues who spoke to The Stranger , while all saying they intended no ill will toward Hutchison , were adamant about her lack of intellectual depth .
They said they felt compelled to speak out now that she is running for King County executive .
" I used to mock her as crazy and stupid , and now she makes me afraid , " says Pauli .
" She has schooled herself , and she has morphed into an ideologue . "
One former KIRO broadcaster who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity was concerned that the public wo n't get the full story about Hutchison because people in television news are not used to being on the other side of the microphone .
This broadcaster said : " You have to question her ability to run a government as complex as King County when she needs a cue card to speak . "
UPDATE : Susan Hutchison 's campaign manager , Jordan McCarren , emails , saying , " I have worked closely with Susan every single day for nearly six months .
She is tremendously intelligent , capable , dedicated , impressively hard - working and possesses remarkable management skills . "

Be sure to check out the 2010 Mario AI Championship
This competition is about learning , or otherwise developing , the best controller ( agent ) for a version of Super Mario Bros .
The controller 's job is to win as many levels ( of increasing difficulty ) as possible .
Each time step ( 24 per second in simualated time ) the controller has to decide what action to take ( left , right , jump etc ) in response to the environment around Mario .
We are basing the competition on a heavily modified version of the Infinite Mario Bros game by Markus Persson .
That game is an all - Java tribute to the Nintendo 's seminal Super Mario Bros game , with the added benefit of endless random level generation .
We believe that playing this game well is a challenge worthy of the best players , the best programmers and the best learning algorithms alike .
One of the main purposes of this competition is to be able to compare different controller development methodologies against each other , both those based on learning techniques such as artificial evolution and those that are completely hand - coded .
So we hope to get submissions based on evolutionary neural networks , genetic programming , fuzzy logic , temporal difference learning , human ingenuity , hybrids of the above , etc .
The more the merrier !
( And better for science . )
There areassociated with each phase of the competition ; USD 500 for the winner of the CIG phase , and USD 200 , 100 and 50 respectively to the winners of the ICE - GIC phase .
At least one member of the winning team need to be present at the relevant conference to receive the prize money ( for CIG that participant needs to be registered as well ) , however it is possible to win the competition and receive the certificate for this without attending the conference .

A common perception about individuals who switch religions is that they are very fervent about their new faith .
A new analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Forum on Religion & Public Life provides quantitative support for this piece of conventional wisdom often referred to as the “ zeal of the convert . ”
The analysis finds that people who have switched faiths ( or joined a faith after being raised unaffiliated with a religion ) are indeed slightly more religious than those who have remained in their childhood faith , as measured by the importance of religion in their lives , frequency with which they attend religious services and other measures of religious commitment .
However , the analysis also finds that the differences in religious commitment between converts1 and nonconverts are generally very small and are more apparent among some religious groups2 than others .
One of the most striking findings of the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , conducted by the Pew Forum in 2007 , was the large number of people who have left their childhood faith .
According to the survey , roughly half of all Americans say they have left the faith in which they were raised to adopt another faith or no faith at all , or if they were not raised in a religion , they have since joined one .
The new analysis finds that , overall , people who have switched religions consistently exhibit higher levels of religious commitment than those who still belong to their childhood faith , but the differences are relatively modest .
For example , among people currently affiliated with a religion :
Slightly more than two - thirds of converts ( 69 % ) say religion is very important to them , compared with 62 % of nonconverts .
Half of converts ( 51 % ) attend worship services at least once a week , compared with 44 % of nonconverts .
More than eight - in - ten converts ( 82 % ) believe in God with absolute certainty , compared with 77 % of nonconverts .
Seven - in - ten converts ( 70 % ) pray every day , compared with 62 % of nonconverts .
About three - in - ten converts ( 29 % ) say they share their views on God with others at least once a week , compared with two - in - ten nonconverts ( 20 % ) .
And slightly more than one - quarter of converts ( 27 % ) say theirs is the one true faith , compared with 22 % of nonconverts .
Differences Between Converts and Nonconverts Within Specific Christian Faiths
Methodists stand out as a group in which converts consistently evince higher levels of religious commitment compared with nonconverts .
Converts to Methodism are more likely than those who were raised in the faith to say religion is very important in their lives ( 65 % vs. 55 % ) , to attend religious services at least once a week ( 48 % vs. 38 % ) , to believe in God with absolute certainty ( 82 % vs. 77 % ) , to pray every day ( 64 % vs. 57 % ) , to share their views on God with others at least once a week ( 20 % vs. 16 % ) and to believe theirs is the one true faith ( 14 % vs. 11 % ) .
In other Christian faiths with sample sizes large enough to be examined in the analysis , converts also exhibit higher levels of religious commitment compared with lifelong members , though this is true on fewer measures .
Converts to Congregationalist , Lutheran and Presbyterian denominations , for instance , report higher levels of religious commitment compared with lifelong members of their faiths on a majority of these measures .
Converts to Catholicism are slightly more likely than lifelong Catholics to believe in God with absolute certainty ( 75 % vs. 71 % ) and to share their views on God with others at least once a week ( 18 % vs. 13 % ) , though differences are smaller on other measures .
The analysis reveals only one striking exception to this pattern : Lifelong Mormons are significantly more religious than converts to the faith on two measures .
Nonconverts are , for instance , more likely to attend church regularly and to believe that theirs is the one true faith than are converts to the Mormon faith .
Outside of Mormonism , however , the analysis finds no instances where lifelong members of a particular faith exhibit significantly higher levels of religious commitment than converts on any of the six measures .
1 The terms “ convert ” and “ conversion ” can have various meanings in different contexts .
Throughout this analysis , the term “ convert ” includes people who are currently affiliated with a religion and who were raised in a different religion or in no religion .
The term “ nonconvert ” includes people who are affiliated with a religion and who currently belong to the same faith in which they were raised , including those who may have switched faiths and then returned to their childhood faith .
2 The analysis includes only those religious groups for which a sufficient sample size of converts could be analyzed .

Here ’s a problem that has popped up several times in one guise or another during the six years of my career :
Given a list of numbers , present it to the user in its most compact form .
So if you have 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 it should be presented as 1 , 3 – 5 , 9 , 11 – 13 .
It ’s what your brain does automatically when you fill out the “ Selected Pages ” box in the Print dialog of Microsoft Word .
I ’m sure you can imagine for yourself the kind of for - loop I crafted the last time I solved this problem .
This time I wanted to make life more interesting .
The first thing is to make sure the numbers are marshalled in ascending order , with no duplicates in the ranks :
var preparedList = numbers .
Distinct ( ) .
OrderBy( x => x ) ;
For the next step , I imagined into being a little Scanner class , with a nice fluent interface .
I wrote down the following code , which was how I wanted the Scanner to work ; then , with Resharper pointing out my omissions in glaring red text , I implemented the concepts to make it work :
public IEnumerable < Range > Compact ( IEnumerable < int > numbers ) { var preparedList = numbers .
Distinct ( ) .
OrderBy(x => x ) ; var scanner = new Scanner<int , Range > ( ) ; scanner.ConfigurePattern ( ) . StartMatchingWhenAny ( ) . ContinueMatchingWhile (( nextItem , matched Items ) => nextItem == matched Items .
Last ( ) +
1 ) . Output ( details => new Range ( details.MatchedItems .
First ( ) , details.MatchedItems.Last ( ) ) ) ; return scanner .
Scan( preparedList ) ; }
The idea is for the Scanner to walk a sequence of objects ( ints in this case ) , producing from it a sequence of tokens ( here , Range objects – simple structs with First and Last properties ) .
The Scanner produces its output by matching patterns of contiguous input elements .
The patterns are configured using a fluent interface :
the condition that must be met in order to start matching this pattern ( any integer is accepted at the start of this simple pattern )
which items are considered part of the pattern : here an integer is accepted if it is only one bigger than the previous matched integer
how to generate a token from the matched part of the sequence
The internal workings of the scanner are n’t terribly interesting .
See the download link below if you ’re desperate for a look .
Now do n’t laugh : String .
Join is my discovery of the week .
It concatenates an array of strings , putting a separator of your choice between them ; leaving you free to fry bigger fish than how to put a comma after every item except the last .
So my final answer looks like this :
var numbers = new [ ] { 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13} ; var compacter = new RangeCompacter ( ) ; var ranges = compacter .
Compact ( numbers ) ; // create a pretty string , each range or number separated by a comma var display = string .
Join ( " , " , ranges . Select ( range => range .
ToString ( ) ) . ToArray ( ) ) ; Assert .
AreEqual ( " 1 , 3 - 5 , 9 , 11 - 13 " , display ) ;
I ’ve put all the code , including my Scanner class , on Code Gallery ; there ’s even a sprinkling of unit tests !
If you find any other uses for it , do let me know .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Economist Mark Zandi , whose research heavily influenced the $ 787 billion U.S. economic stimulus plan , said on Thursday that the two - year recession has come to an end , mostly due to the federal government ’s aggressive response to the downturn .
However , the labor market could take time to recover , he warned .
“ It is a tragedy that the nation has been forced to spend so much to tame the financial crisis and end the Great Recession .
Yet it has been money well spent , ” said Zandi , the chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com
“ The fiscal stimulus is working to ensure that the recent dark economic times will soon be relegated to the history books , ” he said in testimony prepared for the congressional Joint Economic Committee about the progress of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that was passed in February .
Zandi urged a package of tax and spending measures last winter to end what became the longest recession since the Great Depression .
Two White House economists who worked on the plan -- Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein -- used his research and estimates when projecting the effects of stimulus measures .
BANG FOR THE BUCK
Zandi said criticism of the low portion of stimulus funds already spent , which he estimated at $ 175 billion , was misplaced .
“ What matters for economic growth is the pace of stimulus spending , which surged from nothing at the beginning of the year to about $ 80 billion in the third quarter .
That is a big change in a short period and is why the economy is growing after more than a year , ” he said .
On Thursday , the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter .
According to Zandi , the increase in food stamps in the plan gave the “ biggest bang for the buck . ”
He looked at how each stimulus dollar spent or dollar cut in taxes affected gross domestic product .
Financing work - share programs and extending unemployment benefit payments were next in creating the most economic activity per federal dollar spent .
On the other hand , Zandi said the $ 8,000 housing tax credit that Congress is expected to extend only generated 90 cents worth of activity for every dollar .
JOBS AND HIRING UNCERTAIN
Assistance to state governments produced $ 1.41 per dollar .
“ The decline in income , sales , property and capital gains taxes has been unprecedented and shows only marginal signs of abating , ” he said about the fiscal crisis that states are currently grappling with .
At the same time states ’ and cities ’ borrowing capacity is weakening , he said , leaving federal help as the only weapon against job and program cuts and increased taxes .
“ This will be a serious drag on the economy at just the wrong time , ” he said and suggested Congress consider providing $ 75 billion in assistance .
The Recovery Board , which tracks the stimulus , will release on Friday a report of how grants and loans have been spent .
The sweeping report will likely indicate whether the plan helped ameliorate the country ’s employment pain -- the national unemployment rate currently stands at 9.8 percent .
“ As the benefit of the stimulus fades , businesses must fill the void by hiring and investing more actively , ” Zandi said .
“ To date , there is not much evidence they are doing this . ”
While businesses have curtailed their layoffs since the stimulus passed , Zandi warned they could be “ too shell - shocked to resume hiring . ”
Is it better to treat someone with kid gloves or to treat them carefully ?
Researchers in Italy have investigated how the brain recognises that the first phrase means the same as the second .
Publishing in the open access journal BMC Neuroscience , the researchers suggest that we use both hemispheres to understand idioms .
Dr Alice Proverbio from the University of Milano - Bicocca and colleagues used electrophysiological and LORETA source reconstruction analysis to investigate the role of the two cerebral hemispheres in idiom comprehension .
By analysing the brain activity of 11 students , they found that idiomatic sentences activated the right middle temporal gyrus ( after 350 ms ) and the right medial frontal gyrus ( at 270-300 and 500 - 780ms ) .
All phrases were matched for length and familiarity , yet the students took longer to associate an idiomatic phrase with a linked word than to associate a literal phrase with its linked word .
This suggests that idioms are more difficult to understand and denote superior levels of language use and processing .
The findings also shed light on whether the brain tries to understand a familiar idiom literally before it understands it as a metaphor .
The left inferior frontal gyrus , the part of the brain thought to be used to suppress literal meaning , was not specifically activated by idiom comprehension ; however , the limbic regions , which are involved in emotional responses , were ( at 400 - 450ms ) .
Dr Proverbio concludes : " though the interpretation of language involves widespread activation bilaterally , the right hemisphere has a special role in the comprehension of idiomatic meaning . "

U.S. military presence in Latin America
The waning influence of the US in Latin America in the last decade can be attributed primarily to the influence and regional foreign policy of President Hugo Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution .
Left leaning leaders were elected in all countries , even in Central America , with the notable exceptions of Colombia , Peru , Mexico and Costa Rica .
That trend showed one sign of reversal when Panamanians elected millionaire businessman Ricardo Martinelli as President on May 3rd 2009 .
Return of the military coup d’état
Reports indicated that the US threw millions of dollars into Martinelli ’s election campaign via USAID and NED and achieved the desired result .
However , almost two months later , with the kidnapping and ouster of Manual Zelaya from the Honduran presidency , tactics would appear to have been changed .
They have been transformed into the time - proven military coup d’état to install a regime “ friendly to US interests and ideology ” .
Despite unanimous condemnation of the Honduran coup and installation of de facto president Roberto Micheletti , by the OAS , UN and EU , the new regime has held on to power in the face of a crumbling economy and massive popular protest .
Those demonstrations by Hondurans continue to demand the return of Zelaya , the constitutional president .
Could the “ success ” of this coup , sustained by gross violations of human rights , be a harbinger for the future of other democratically elected left wing Presidents in Latin America ?
This is an open question but shortly after the coup against Zelaya many commentators and even regional Presidents saw this coup as an example to be followed .
Right wing opposition parties in neighboring countries closely allied with the U.S. and traditional bourgeois interests certainly pricked up their ears .
Both , Evo Morales and Rafael Correa have been mentioned in the same counter - revolutionary breath , as well as Alvaro Colom , Guatemala ’s President .
New threat to Paraguay
Last night on Telesur news , there was a report covering unrest and military oppression against left wing popular movements in Paraguay , with the inference that these may be building up for a military coup against President Fernando Lugo .
The Paraguayan Congress also appears to be working against Lugo and this attitude is a carbon copy of the institutional problems faced by Zelaya before he was illegally kidnapped and flown out of the country on June 28th .
Mariscal Estigarribia air base in Paraguay
It is interesting to note that there is a US military base in Paraguay , the Mariscal Estigarribia air base , just as there is in Honduras .
The U.S. military has been operating at the Mariscal Estigarribia base beginning in 2005 when they were training of 65 Paraguayan air force officers .
Note that the Soto Cano air base in Honduras , which did nothing to help uphold the constitutional and democratic order , was a key installation for the contras under then president Ronald Reagan who terrorized Nicaragua in the 1980’s .

Colombia is the beach head
Coming hard on the heels of the incipient threat to other presidents in the region , Colombia ’s government announced the construction of seven new US military bases throughout the country purportedly to combat the guerrilla movements and drug trafficking .
It goes without saying that all US personnel , military contractors and advisers would have total immunity from prosecution in Colombia , as demanded by the US when its troops are sent abroad .
Such bases represent a military threat to Venezuela and its oil supplies and places the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela on guard .
Colombia has not backed down and looks unlikely to rescind its military agreement with the US .
President Chávez ’s response was to suspend trade relations with the Uribe regime in order to create internal pressure from Colombian exporters who might well lose their second biggest trading partner , Venezuela , and US $ 6 billion of exports .
Uribe ’s response was to make a snap tour to neighboring countries , including the continental powerhouse , Brazil , in order to explain his actions which clash directly with the Regional Security Council of Unasur .
In fact , the next Unasur meeting is due to take place in Quito , Ecuador next week and Uribe has said that he would not attend .
** “ Smart Power ” for arms , oil and turf
With US troops being pulled out of Iraq and redeployed mainly to Afghanistan and Pakistan , one interpretation of the decision to set up U.S. bases in Colombia is that it is a tacit admission that the Iraq adventure to plunder its oil has failed .
Now is the time to put pressure on Venezuela due to its strategic importance and huge oil reserves , now officially classified as the second largest in the world after Saudi Arabia .
Whatever Obama ’s election promises concerning the development of alternative energy sources to offset the US dependence on foreign oil imports , economically the US needs all the oil it can get , by fair means or foul to continue its agenda .
The seven proposed bases in Colombia appear destined to achieve that goal .
One consequence of the policy adopted by Uribe , will be an arms build - up in the region , and more specifically in Venezuela to defend its sovereignty against any possible aggression from its bellicose neighbor .
The Empire , using what is being called “ smart power ” to achieve its foreign policy aims , has not changed one iota except in the style and silver tongued words of its young President .
The bases , when constructed , will turn Colombia into the Israel of Latin America and be a beach head for subversion throughout the region , especially in Bolivia , Ecuador and Venezuela , all of which have common borders with Colombia
Media war
The world ’s corporate media has embarked on an accelerated offensive against the Venezuelan government and in particular President Chávez in the last two months .
Chávez is being accused of trafficking drugs , supplying armaments for the FARC , allowing Hezbollah training camps in La Guajira region near the Colombian border and endangering the freedom of speech in Venezuela .
He was also attacked along these lines by Israel ’s foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , who recently did a tour of Latin America .
Lieberman himself is currently under threat of indictment on charges of fraud , bribery , money laundering and obstruction of justice .
Israel in Latin America
Currently , Israeli arms and operatives are present in Colombia and other Latin American countries .
Many ask why Israel is interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries .
Lieberman is said to have offered Mossad training to Colombia to complement existing CIA activities .
This will probably take place at the proposed bases , with the purpose of training graduates of the School of the America ’s ( S.O.A. - School of Assassins ) who are operating in the region .
Using a surrogate such as Israel to promote terror in the region is a “ smart ” move by Clinton and Obama , both avid supporters of Israel as evidenced in their respective election campaigns and following rhetoric and policies .
Israeli FM , Avigdor Lieberman met Colombia 's Foreign Minister , Jaime Bermudez at San Carlos Palace in Bogota on July 28 .
He also met with leaders of Brazil , Argentina and Peru during his 10 day trip .
At this point in time , the obvious problem of U.S. military bases in Colombia lies in the hands of the Colombian people .
They have an opportunity to save their sovereignty , culture and lives from decimation by the imperialists .
Their revolutionary actions could also provide an example for other Latin American nations and force the region ’s threats of military coup to recede .
Military bases , Israel ’s involvement in Colombia and the U.S. demand for oil will bring armed conflict ever nearer in Latin America .
A few wealthy opposition leaders would welcome a return of the U.S. to Venezuela , thinking they or their offspring may return to their pre-1998 throne .
But the followers of the right wing opposition in Venezuela would do well to reflect on its silence about this issue .
If a conflict does occur , it will not just be the people in the barrios who will suffer as some seem to think , but the bourgeoisie and their families will simply be classified as “ collateral damage ” .

We can join Bill McKibben on Oct. 24 in nationwide protests over rising carbon emissions .
We can cut our consumption of fossil fuels .
We can use less water .
We can banish plastic bags .
We can install compact fluorescent light bulbs .
We can compost in our backyard .
But unless we dismantle the corporate state , all those actions will be just as ineffective as the Ghost Dance shirts donned by native American warriors to protect themselves from the bullets of white soldiers at Wounded Knee .
“ If we all wait for the great , glorious revolution there wo n’t be anything left , ” author and environmental activist Derrick Jensen told me when I interviewed him in a phone call to his home in California .
“ If all we do is reform work , this culture will grind away .
This work is necessary , but not sufficient .
We need to use whatever means are necessary to stop this culture from killing the planet .
We need to target and take down the industrial infrastructure that is systematically dismembering the planet .
Industrial civilization is functionally incompatible with life on the planet , and is murdering the planet .
We need to do whatever is necessary to stop this . ”
The oil and natural gas industry , the coal industry , arms and weapons manufacturers , industrial farms , deforestation industries , the automotive industry and chemical plants will not willingly accept their own extinction .
They are indifferent to the looming human catastrophe .
We will not significantly reduce carbon emissions by drying our laundry in the backyard and naively trusting the power elite .
The corporations will continue to cannibalize the planet for the sake of money .
They must be halted by organized and militant forms of resistance .
The crisis of global heating is a social problem .
It requires a social response .
The United States , after rejecting the Kyoto Protocol , went on to increase its carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels .
The European Union countries during the same period reduced their emissions by 2 percent .
But the recent climate negotiations in Bangkok , designed to lead to a deal in Copenhagen in December , have scuttled even the tepid response of Kyoto .
Kyoto is dead .
The EU , like the United States , will no longer abide by binding targets for emission reductions .
Countries will unilaterally decide how much to cut .
They will submit their plans to international monitoring .
And while Kyoto put the burden of responsibility on the industrialized nations that created the climate crisis , the new plan treats all countries the same .
It is a huge step backward .
“ All of the so - called solutions to global warming take industrial capitalism as a given , ” said Jensen , who wrote “ Endgame ” and “ The Culture of Make Believe . ”
“ The natural world is supposed to conform to industrial capitalism .
This is insane .
It is out of touch with physical reality .
What ’s real is real .
Any social system — it does not matter if we are talking about industrial capitalism or an indigenous Tolowa people — their way of life , is dependent upon a real , physical world .
Without a real , physical world you do n’t have anything .
When you separate yourself from the real world you start to hallucinate .
You believe the machines are more real than real life .
How many machines are within 10 feet of you and how many wild animals are within a hundred yards ?
How many machines do you have a daily relationship with ?
We have forgotten what is real . ”
The latest studies show polar ice caps are melting at a record rate and that within a decade the Arctic will be an open sea during summers .
This does not give us much time .
White ice and snow reflect 80 percent of sunlight back to space , while dark water reflects only 20 percent , absorbing a much larger heat load .
Scientists warn that the loss of the ice will dramatically change winds and sea currents around the world .
And the rapidly melting permafrost is unleashing methane chimneys from the ocean floor along the Russian coastline .
Methane is a greenhouse gas 25 times more toxic than carbon dioxide , and some scientists have speculated that the release of huge quantities of methane into the atmosphere could asphyxiate the human species .
The rising sea levels , which will swallow countries such as Bangladesh and the Marshall Islands and turn cities like New Orleans into a new Atlantis , will combine with severe droughts , horrific storms and flooding to eventually dislocate over a billion people .
The effects will be suffering , disease and death on a scale unseen in human history .
We can save groves of trees , protect endangered species and clean up rivers , all of which is good , but to leave the corporations unchallenged would mean our efforts would be wasted .
These personal adjustments and environmental crusades can too easily become a badge of moral purity , an excuse for inaction .
They can absolve us from the harder task of confronting the power of corporations .
The damage to the environment by human households is minuscule next to the damage done by corporations .
Municipalities and individuals use 10 percent of the nation ’s water while the other 90 percent is consumed by agriculture and industry .
Individual consumption of energy accounts for about a quarter of all energy consumption ; the other 75 percent is consumed by corporations .
Municipal waste accounts for only 3 percent of total waste production in the United States .
We can , and should , live more simply , but it will not be enough if we do not radically transform the economic structure of the industrial world .
“ If your food comes from the grocery store and your water from a tap you will defend to the death the system that brings these to you because your life depends on it , ” said Jensen , who is holding workshops around the country called Deep Green Resistance [ click here and here ] to build a militant resistance movement .
“ If your food comes from a land base and if your water comes from a river you will defend to the death these systems .
In any abusive system , whether we are talking about an abusive man against his partner or the larger abusive system , you force your victims to become dependent upon you .
We believe that industrial capitalism is more important than life . ”
Those who run our corporate state have fought environmental regulation as tenaciously as they have fought financial regulation .
They are responsible for our personal impoverishment as well as the impoverishment of our ecosystem .
We remain addicted , courtesy of the oil , gas and automobile industries and a corporate - controlled government , to fossil fuels .
Species are vanishing .
Fish stocks are depleted .
The great human migration from coastlines and deserts has begun .
And as temperatures continue to rise , huge parts of the globe will become uninhabitable .
NASA climate scientist James Hansen has demonstrated that any concentration of carbon dioxide greater than 350 parts per million in the atmosphere is not compatible with maintenance of the biosphere on the “ planet on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted . ”
He has determined that the world must stop burning coal by 2030 — and the industrialized world well before that — if we are to have any hope of ever getting the planet back down below that 350 number .
Coal supplies half of our electricity in the United States .
“ We need to separate ourselves from the corporate government that is killing the planet , ” Jensen said .
“ We need to get really serious .
We are talking about life on the planet .
We need to shut down the oil infrastructure .
I do n’t care , and the trees do n’t care , if we do this through lawsuits , mass boycotts or sabotage .
I asked Dahr Jamail how long a bridge would last in Iraq that was not defended .
He said probably six to 12 hours .
We need to make the economic system , which is the engine for so much destruction , unmanageable .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has been able to reduce Nigerian oil output by 20 percent .
We need to stop the oil economy . ”
The reason the ecosystem is dying is not because we still have a dryer in our basement .
It is because corporations look at everything , from human beings to the natural environment , as exploitable commodities .
It is because consumption is the engine of corporate profits .
We have allowed the corporate state to sell the environmental crisis as a matter of personal choice when actually there is a need for profound social and economic reform .
We are left powerless .
Alexander Herzen , speaking a century ago to a group of Russian anarchists working to topple the czar , reminded his followers that they were not there to rescue the system .
“ We think we are the doctors , ” Herzen said .
“ We are the disease . ”
Professor Poul Jessen of the UA College of Optical Sciences runs an experiment that provides long - sought evidence that two very different worlds of quantum mechanics and classical chaos are connected .
Credit : Lori Stiles , University of Arizona
Chaotic behavior is the rule , not the exception , in the world we experience through our senses , the world governed by the laws of classical physics .
Even tiny , easily overlooked events can completely change the behavior of a complex system , to the point where there is no apparent order to most natural systems we deal with in everyday life .
The weather is one familiar case , but other well - studied examples can be found in chemical reactions , population dynamics , neural networks and even the stock market .
Scientists who study " chaos " - which they define as extreme sensitivity to infinitesimally small tweaks in the initial conditions - have observed this kind of behavior only in the deterministic world described by classical physics .
Until now , no one has produced experimental evidence that chaos occurs in the quantum world , the world of photons , atoms , molecules and their building blocks .
This is a world ruled by uncertainty :
An atom is both a particle and a wave , and it 's impossible to determine its position and velocity simultaneously .
And that presents a major problem .
If the starting point for a quantum particle cannot be precisely known , then there is no way to construct a theory that is sensitive to initial conditions in the way of classical chaos .
Yet quantum mechanics is the most complete theory of the physical world , and therefore should be able to account for all naturally occurring phenomena .
" The problem is that people do n't see [ classical ] chaos in quantum systems , " said Professor Poul Jessen of the University of Arizona .
" And we believe quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory , the theory that describes everything , and that we should be able to understand how classical physics follows as a limiting case of quantum physics . "
EXPERIMENTS REVEAL CLASSICAL CHAOS IN QUANTUM WORLD
Now , however , Jessen and his group in UA 's College of Optical Sciences have performed a series of experiments that show just how classical chaos spills over into the quantum world .
The scientists report their research in the Oct. 8 issue of the journal Nature in an article titled , " Quantum signatures of chaos in a kicked top . "
Their experiments show clear fingerprints of classical - world chaos in a quantum system designed to mimic a textbook example of chaos known as the " kicked top . "
The quantum version of the top is the " spin " of individual laser - cooled cesium atoms that Jessen 's team manipulate with magnetic fields and laser light , using tools and techniques developed over a decade of painstaking laboratory work .
" Think of an atom as a microscopic top that spins on its axis at a constant rate of speed , " Jessen said .
He and his students repeatedly changed the direction of the axis of spin , in a series of cycles that each consisted of a " kick " and a " twist " .
Because spinning atoms are tiny magnets , the " kicks " were delivered by a pulsed magnetic field .
The " twists " were more challenging , and were achieved by subjecting the atom to an optical - frequency electric field in a precisely tuned laser beam .
They imaged the quantum mechanical state of the atomic spin at the end of each kick - and - twist cycle with a tomographic technique that is conceptually similar to the methods used in medical ultrasound and CAT scans .
The end results were pictures and stop- motion movies of the evolving quantum state , showing that it behaves like the equivalent classical system in some significant ways .
One of the most dramatic quantum signatures the team saw in their experiments was directly visible in their images :
They saw that the quantum spinning top observes the same boundaries between stability and chaos that characterize the motion of the classical spinning top .
That is , both quantum and classical systems were dynamically stable in the same areas , and dynamically erratic outside those areas .
A NEW SIGNATURE OF CHAOS CALLED 'ENTANGLEMENT '
Jessen 's experiment revealed a new signature of chaos for the first time .
It is related to the uniquely quantum mechanical property known as " entanglement . "
Entanglement is best known from a famous thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein , in which two light particles , or photons , are emitted with polarizations that are fundamentally undefined but nevertheless perfectly correlated .
Later , when the photons have traveled far apart in space , their polarizations are both measured at the same instant in time and found to be completely random but always at right angles to each other .
" It 's as though one photon instantly knows the result for the other and adjusts its own polarization accordingly , " Jessen said .
By itself , Einstein 's thought experiment is not directly related to quantum chaos , but the idea of entanglement has proven useful , Jessen added .
" Entanglement is an important phenomenon of the quantum world that has no classical counterpart .
It can occur in any quantum system that consists of at least two independent parts , " he said .
Theorists have speculated that the onset of chaos will greatly increase the degree to which different parts of a quantum system become entangled .
Jessen took advantage of atomic physics to test this hypothesis in his laboratory experiments .
The total spin of a cesium atom is the sum of the spin of its valence electron and the spin of its nucleus , and those spins can become quantum correlated exactly as the photon polarizations in Einstein 's example .
In Jessen 's experiment , the electron and nuclear spins remained unentangled as a result of stable quantum dynamics , but rapidly became entangled if the dynamics were chaotic .
Entanglement is a buzzword in the science community because it is the foundation for quantum cryptography and quantum computing .
" Our work is not directly related to quantum computing and communications , " Jessen said .
" It just shows that this concept of entanglement has tendrils in all sorts of areas of quantum physics because entanglement is actually common as soon as the system gets complicated enough . "

Have women 's magazines just been brainwashing us over the years with their hundreds of articles about women and sex ?
They 've droned on about everything from the importance of orgasms to waiting to being in love before having sex , but have they been getting it all wrong ?
It seems that they might have had done .
A book out shortly called Why Women Have Sex has caused a storm by revealing the results of a survey of 1,000 women in America .
And the reasons women have sex has turned out not to be , in the main , because they are madly in love , passionately attracted to their blokes , dying for babies or aching with lust .
No , it turns out to be what I 've always suspected – that although all those factors can play a part , women often have sex for a host of much more humdrum reasons .
Sometimes they 've felt that having sex with their partners will stop them straying .
On occasions they 've had sex to finish an argument or resolve a tense situation – it's a way of resolving things without risk of him resorting to sulks or violence .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Some women have had sex as a kind of payment for being taken out to dinner ... and certainly I can't be the only one who , having been out to a party with a bloke and worried about him eyeing up another woman , had sex to stop him dwelling on the object of his desires .
There 's also guilty sex with a boyfriend – when you 've just have sex with someone else .
The more ruthless among us can use sex as a bartering tool .
Apparently loads of women – one in 10 – give sex in return for presents .
And quite a few women give their men sex in return for simple chores , like putting the rubbish out , or doing the washing - up .
And – rather sweet this – some women have given sex to unattractive men because they feel sorry for them .
Certainly I 've often had sex with friends who 've been going through a hard time .
If I have n't been able to cheer them up by flattery and kindness , a quick spin in bed has usually made them feel a lot better .
I know I 've occasionally had sex with a man if I 've won hands down in an argument , for instance .
To make him feel less lowly - worm - like , I 'll suggest having sex to make the score equal , as it were .
And other women have sex to relax and , even , to relieve boredom – presumably when conversation runs out and there 's nothing left to do .
What strikes me as odd , however , is that these motives are attributed only to women .
I 've always seen sex as a tool , if you 'll forgive the expression , that 's used equally between the sexes , partly for fun and affection , but often as a kind of commerce .
I know I 've been placated by a man who has sex with me to avoid a row .
And men have often buttered me up ( oh , dear , it 's impossible to write a piece like this without it being littered with double - entendres ) with sex before they want to suggest some preposterous idea which they know that in any other mood I might find rather unwelcome – like going away for a stag weekend , or spending Christmas apart .
Indeed , I 'm pretty sure that , although it makes me feel rather queasy to admit it , with one younger man , I 've been offered the " compensation " of sex if he could n't afford to contribute to an expensive restaurant meal .
And why not ?
If this generous and warm gesture is sometimes used as a kind of currency between the sexes , is there really anything to complain about ?

Refreshingly clean story : at the end of the night in a busy ' Brewers Fayre ' style pub restaurant , my sister and I were carrying large towers of gateaux boxes back from the sweet counter , through the kitchen , to the fridge .
My sister , carrying a pile of empty boxes , happened to drop hers .
No harm done .
I was a few paces behind .
The pot -washer , assuming my boxes were also empty , leapt in to the air and with his best Karate Kid squeal , karate - chopped the boxes I was carrying .
Stunned silence as about £ 100 of gateaux exploded out of the sides of boxes and all over the kitchen .

The foreign staff in my local mcd were so bad I once had to climb up on to the counter and take a shit into my own burger .
Several other customers asked for a dollop and I now run my own small restaurant in Tower Hamlets .
If a customer is rude to any member of staff we put mayonnaise in their spunk sauce .
I can do made up stories too .

Binge drinking is bad .
As a former nightclub doorman i have ssen many things that could make you blush and quite a few that could mmake you hurl .
This story is one of the latter and I apologise in advance
Come closing time at a very famous Australian chain bar in Birmingham , I was clearing the toilets af the straggling customers .
In the ladies after everyone departed I realised that one of the cubicles was locked .
So I perched myself on the adjoining toilet to enable me to see over the partition .
Upon looking into the cubicel I find the following .
A young lady in her early twenties asleep on the loo .
Knickers round her ankles , she has also been sick , however the vomit is nicly perched in her underwear .
My colleague and i decided to wake her up without knocking the door down so as to avoid startling her .
So we went and got a pint of water which was mpassed to me to tip over the cubicle wall .
So I clamber back onto the toilet and proceed to tip the water over the poor girl .
At which point she comes too .
" Sorry hun were closed " says I
" Ok no probs " says lady .
Then the unthinkable without checking she yanks the vomit filled undies up takes two steps out of the cubicle , realises what is going on bursts into tears and runs out the front door .
My colleague and I are laughing so hard that I fall off the toilet that im standing on into him breaking his wrist .
hehehehehehehe
She came back the next week .

A word to the wise on food contamination and unsafe food - handling practices :
It 's not just common , it is universal .
Not only do restaurants contain a significant number of people who work there because it 's the only class of business that has n't learned better than to hire them , and who thus will take any opportunity to foul food production through ignorance or malice ... but the food itself is generally universally - contaminated .
The grand majority of food production is automated - in harvesting giant machines are used , in slaughtering there are vast assembly - lines of dead animals , and anything processed has giant swaths of crap going out over a factory floor .
At any point contamination can enter when there is either no person supervising the production or the person who is watching does n't care .
As a result , no food regularly emerges from that mess to the consumer uncontaminated .
Even the U.S. government , quite possibly the most ludicrously over - protective entity in the first world when it comes to food safety ( they wo n't even let us have good cheeses made from raw milk over here - it's illegal ) , recognizes a percentage of contamination that it deems " unavoidable . "
( Opens in new window )
Insect bits in veggies , mold and rot in fruits , rat droppings in grains .
All are common to the point of being ubiquitous .
Beyond this , every kitchen in existence fails very important bits of the health code .
In culinary school we are taught two procedures for pretty much everything - how we are supposed to do things , and how everyone in the real world actually does them .
This is because the health codes in themselves are rather over - extended , and cover things that most people would consider ludicrous because they were shown to be a vector for one incident of foodborne contamination .
As a result , for those of you saying you 'll only eat at home for the rest of your lives - your home kitchen would fail inspection for nearly every aspect of the commercial health and safety inspection .
For instance , how often do you wash your can opener ?
Health regulations say it must be washed every three hours when used , because every time you open a can you are transferring food particles to the blade of the opener ... to then rot in open air , before being transferred back into anything else opened .
Or how often do you clean out your ice machine ?
Restaurants are supposed to do so every other week in some areas to prevent contamination or the buildup of the cold - tolerant intestinal - bug listeria on old ice .
And I 'll bet there are cleaning products stored somewhere in the kitchen at your home as well - a clear violation of health codes due to a number of instances where people were served fried chicken battered with oven cleaner instead of flour due to their remarkable similarity in appearance .
The truth of the matter is , most cases of foodborne contamination occurs in private residences thanks to people who have a misguided belief that their food is safer if they or a friend cook it .
These same people often have a frightening lack of understanding regarding proper cooking times or holding temperatures , and will generally cross-contaminate like mad between bacterial harbors and foods about to be served .
Compared to what I have seen some of my own relatives do with their home cooking ( namely , cooking a mass of food for lunch on holidays and then leaving it to sit out on the table at room temperature for eight hours before then coming back and eating the rest of it for dinner ) ... some guy getting his kicks by stirring urine into a giant pot of soup is nothing .
Urine is sterile 90 % of the time anyways , and in a large enough pot the actual contamination is miniscule .
You do have recourse should you fall ill after eating at a restaurant , though .
It is commonly accepted in restaurant health and sanitation that more than two people independently coming forward with the same symptoms after eating at the same restaurant or supermarket constitutes a " foodborne illness outbreak . "
In my neck of the woods at least , that means the restaurant in question gets shut down for a week at minimum while the entire place is run over with a fine - toothed comb looking for what caused the illness to its patrons .
It makes the news , costs the place business , may very well shut it down permanently , and if intentional contamination is found it will likely result in a criminal charge against the individuals involved .
But the grand majority of the things talked about here are petty revenge .
They wo n't convey illness , they wo n't even change the taste of the food , and so they have as much an impact on your day - to - day life as the 10 beetle bits per gram in your breakfast cereal .
Take solace in the fact that you 're not the guy who feels so powerless and abused that he decides to add saliva to someone 's burger as a measure of revenge - despite the fact that 99 times out of 100 it'll do absolutely nothing to anyone and that 1 anomaly could easily cost him his job .
It 's the culinary equivalent of swearing under your breath - it is n't even a confrontation with the people causing you grief , and in the long run it has absolutely no impact on anything other than giving you a bit of " revenge " for obviously having to do something you detest - make food for people .
Myself , the only bodily fluid I 've ever added to an item of food to be served was blood .
And since it was meat anyways , it was just more flavor in the dish - " long pig " was a delicacy in some parts of the world for ages , after all .
But then , I got into culinary because I like cooking for people .
Why people would bother getting into the profession when they do n't is an eternal mystery to me - it's hot , humid , and dangerous with incredibly long hours to work and lots of chances to accidentally kill yourself or someone else in a dozen different ways .
Which goes no small way towards explaining why most people in culinary will take any chance they get to break away and have a little fun .
Apologies for length and breadth of the culinarian rant .

Cellar loving
At a pub I used to work at my manageress was caught quite literally over a barrel by her husband as she got a good seeing to from behind in the cellar .
Rather than him losing his cool and belting seven shades out of the barman providing a different kind of service ( ca n’t blame him as he was a huge squaddie ) he simply calmly went back upstairs , locked the cellar from the out side and then parked his car over the top of the delivery hatch so that the pair of them were stuck downstairs .
After emptying the till and giving the keys over to the regulars he walked out never to be seen again .
The regulars nearly drank the whole place dry and even had the balls to shout down to the lovebirds in the cellar to change barrels when they ran out .

Morality ?
I 'm shocked
I 'm a lying , two - faced cheat at the best of times , but ...
To all the dissatisfied chefs and food preparers : if a mechanic buggered up your car on purpose , of if a dentist drilled your teeth just for kicks , or if an irate builder left your house unsafe , or if a teacher taught your kids untruths , or if a traffic warden ticketed you unfairly because they were unhappy with their job ... how would YOU feel ?
Would you laugh and say , " Yeah !
They really got back at their boss ! "
Or would you feel righteously shat on ?
I 'm thinking particularly of the knife roulette story .
There 's humour , and there 's vindictive , thoughtless malice .

Hell 's Angels
I used to work the occasional weekend for a friend of mine who ran a veggie catering stall - I was the cook .
One year we paid a fortune to trade at Glastonbury and one fine summers even we setup stall and started trading .
Business was brisk ( how I 'll never know .
Veggie burgers taste like shite ) and we soon had a rather large queue .
Then there was a disturbance at the front of the stall .
A large mob of hairy - arsed Hell 's Angels had turned up and muscled their way to the front of the queue .
" Oh shit " I thought .
" They 're going to rob us , smash the stall up and demand protection money .
We 're fucked "
Seeing that I was the biggest bloke on the stall I felt duty bound to deal with these rapscallions myself .
I stepped to the front of house and looked at them , quaking inside , sure I was due a beating .
" Can I help you ? "
I asked the leader expecting the reply " Give us all your women and money and we 'll let you live "
" Err - can we have 12 cups of Earl Grey please " says the leader , a dead - ringer for the Missing Link profferring a 20 quid note .
WTF ?
Hells Angles and Earl Grey ?

Woo Clapper !
Have to agree .
This is probably the first QOTW that I have n't read every entry .
Just too sickening .
I 'm no angel but I would n't dream of doing some of the things posted up here .
Cowardly , twisted and perverted and , what ’s worse , not even vaguely funny .
OB QOTW answer to * try * and keep on topic .
As a nipper I used to work in a supermarket , bringing new stock up from the warehouse for the shelf - stackers to stock the shelves .
( OK , it 's supermarket but it * is* food related ... ) .
We had a right bitch of a shift manager , fresh out of Uni , who thought the best way to get work out of people was by screaming at them .
This one night I was amusing myself and my workmates by guessing which star - sign they were and being surprisingly accurate .
So bitch manager says :
" OK Smartarse .
What 's my star - sign ? "
" Taurus " I said .
" Bloody hell ! ! " she gasped " How did you know that ? "
Looking her straight in the eye I said .
" Hitler was a Taurus "
She burst into tears .......

Oh , I forgot about this one !
( Take - away related )
I had been telling my obstetrical nursing students the day before about how some cultures ate placenta and not to be surprised if the parents asked to take theirs home .
The next day , I came in and someone had brought in Chicken Something from the Orient Gardens carry - out covered in that violently Chinese - red slop .
I hatched a brilliant plan : I put it in a styrofoam coffee cup and took it into the student 's room .
" Hey , you guys , remember when I said some people liked to eat their placentas ?
Well , the lady in room 39 had her mom cook hers up and brought it in .
I asked her if I could have a little to share with my students . "
They see the bright crimson , gooey chunks on the end of my fork and turn white .
" Does anyone want to try it ?
I 'm going to see what it tastes like .. " and I raise the drippy thing to my lips .
Before I can laugh and say , " Just kidding ! " , Kevin turns and hurls into the wastebasket and Belinda 's eyes roll back in her head and she has to sit down fast .
I do feel remorse over Kevin 's losing his breakfast .
Sorry , guy .

Tee with that , sir ?
Many years ago I used to work as a barman in a Golf and Country Club , in Earls Colne , in Essex , and ' twas some of the best times of my bar tending career , half decent money , bit of respect from the punters , use of the gym , sauna , pool etc .
Every year they would have a summer ball where the members would have a slap - up feast in a huge marquee in the grounds , followed by a round of golf , tee -ing off at midnight .
With so many inebriated , rich , up - tight golfers and their wives , the whole thing quickly slid into a morass of drunken , bodice - ripping , sexuality , with various people ' going to the loo ' only to return disheveled and red-faced .
The food was superb and the Champagne flowed freely - the kitchen would even ' accidentally ' cook about a dozen too many steaks and let us get rid of the evidence for them ( Thanks Barry ! ) .
I remember me and a waitress , both of us plastered , sitting under a bush at about 2 am , eating steak sandwiches and swigging from bottles of Moet .
Another part of our job was to wander the grounds when it started to get light , to round up any lost guests ( and staff ) .
So , as I wandered the essex countryside finishing off a last bottle of champers , I stumbled accross a couple getting friendly in one of the bunkers .
I cleared my throat to announce my presence and advised them that the taxis would be arriving soon .
As the lady tried to find her dress , the gentleman thanked me , then asked if there was any champagne left in the bottle I was carrying ' cos he 'd accidentally got sand all over his cock , and needed to wash it off as he was n't quite finished yet .
Being a professional , I left him the rest of the bottle .
Length ?
Well , the champagne WAS pretty cold .

I 'm a chef in a chain pub restaurant
We play all sorts of tricks on people , ie new staff and waiting staff .
Send them up to the fridge for chicken lips , etc
The best one was vetween a chef and a waiter .
The waiter was a guy called Scott who only worked on sundays .
Although he 's a very clever chap he talked quite slowly .
The Chef was a guy named Daryll .
Now what we did was on Darylls first sunday shift was to tell him that Scott was mentally retarded and only worked one day a week on day release .
Everyone had to talk to Scott very slowly and clearly and under no circumstances must he shout or get angry with Scott or else he may go mental .
We then told Scott exactly the same thing about daryll .
For about 3 weeks , all us chefs were pissing ourselfs at them two , untill we could n't take it anymore and told them .
Daryll left a week later

Plump cow with special sauce ...
A few years back , I used to cover the occasional waitressing shift at the place I worked .
I did n't mind this .
I worked hard , was polite to the customers , & made a bloody fortune in tips .
Same went for most of the waiting staff .
We were relied upon to administer our own breaks , with no formal times given to us .
However , it was generally understood that no more than an hour or so in total of the course of an eight - hour shift was considered to be the norm , & that 's what we all stuck to .
Except for this one girl .
A lazy , pudgy little heifer who I shall call That Tubby Bitch , for that is her name .
Honest ...
That Tubby Bitch would spend at least fifty percent of her working day sat on her arse in the staffroom doing bugger - all , regardless of how busy the place was , or how many other waiting staff were available .
As if this was n't irritating enough , That Tubby Bitch also had a painfully obvious crush on my bloke , who also worked at the same place , & would practically fall over herself to get down to the staffroom whenever he was on break .
One day , I got asked to cover a shift as two staff members had gone off sick .
That Tubby Bitch was the only other person waitressing , & predictably , left me doing all the work on what turned out to be one of the busiest nights of the year .
Just as I 'm finally about to break for lunch with my bloke , & am on my way to the staffroom , plate in hand , That Tubby Bitch , ( who had already eaten several hours earlier ) comes rushing past ( having spotted my bloke ) after having been out of the staffroom for no more than about 15 minutes , claiming to be gasping for a ciggy .
When I eventually do get to eat my rather cold lunch half an hour later , it 's nearly the end of the shift .
That Tubby Bitch comes into the staffroom & sits down next to me , acting all buddy - buddy .
And has the nerve to ask me to share my tips with her , as she has n't made much that night .
That was it .
I somewhat loudly informed her that maybe if she 'd actually done some fucking work , she'd have some money of her own , & that the only tip I 'd consider giving her would be how best to fit her fat head into the kitchen oven .
A passing manager overhears this , asks me to explain myself .
Which I did , backed up by other members of staff .
Manager sends her out to do some work for the last couple of hours under strict instructions not to return to the staffroom until the end of the shift , & tells me to take half an hour 's break & chill out .
All well , & good , but there was no way I felt like chilling out .
I wondered around the staffroom for a bit kicking random objects , until eventually , the bloke decided to pass through the staffroom on his way to the bog .
A swift explantion of what was wrong , & the bloke disappears to the prep room ( where us waiting staff made the sandwiches for the customers ) .
He returns a few minutes later looking pleased with himself , but wo n't tell me what he 's done , as there are now other people in the staffroom .
About five minutes later , That Tubby Bitch is escorted into the staffroom by a female manager .
Said manager escorts her into the locker room to collect her coat , & the off the premises .
Eventually get home a couple of hours later , & get to ask the bloke what he did .
Turns out that just before he came in to use the loo , he heard one of our very fussy regulars ask for a sandwich & a cup of tea .
This woman , who put quite a lot of business our way , tended to be a bit on the rude side to staff , & never tipped .
As a result , she was somewhat paranoid about people tampering with her food , & would throughly inspect anything before eating it .
The bloke had managed to get to the door of the prep room unseen , & discretely watch as she finished making the sandwich .
And then sneak in unobserved , steathily bring up what he described as " the biggest blob of booger - throat - glop you 've ever seen in your life " into the sandwhich , & sneak back out again .
When said fussy customer went to inspect her sandwich , the ' special sauce ' was immediatly spotted , & the manager called .
That Tubby Bitch was formally dismissed after a displinary hearing the following week .
Result !

Honest ... That Tubby Bitch would spend at least fifty percent of her working day sat on her arse in the staffroom doing bugger - all , regardless of how busy the place was , or how many other waiting staff were available .
As if this was n't irritating enough , That Tubby Bitch also had a painfully obvious crush on my bloke , who also worked at the same place , & would practically fall over herself to get down to the staffroom whenever he was on break .
One day , I got asked to cover a shift as two staff members had gone off sick .
That Tubby Bitch was the only other person waitressing , & predictably , left me doing all the work on what turned out to be one of the busiest nights of the year .
Just as I 'm finally about to break for lunch with my bloke , & am on my way to the staffroom , plate in hand , That Tubby Bitch , ( who had already eaten several hours earlier ) comes rushing past ( having spotted my bloke ) after having been out of the staffroom for no more than about 15 minutes , claiming to be gasping for a ciggy .
When I eventually do get to eat my rather cold lunch half an hour later , it 's nearly the end of the shift .
That Tubby Bitch comes into the staffroom & sits down next to me , acting all buddy - buddy .
And has the nerve to ask me to share my tips with her , as she has n't made much that night .
That was it .
I somewhat loudly informed her that maybe if she 'd actually done some fucking work , she'd have some money of her own , & that the only tip I 'd consider giving her would be how best to fit her fat head into the kitchen oven .
A passing manager overhears this , asks me to explain myself .
Which I did , backed up by other members of staff .
Manager sends her out to do some work for the last couple of hours under strict instructions not to return to the staffroom until the end of the shift , & tells me to take half an hour 's break & chill out .
All well , & good , but there was no way I felt like chilling out .
I wondered around the staffroom for a bit kicking random objects , until eventually , the bloke decided to pass through the staffroom on his way to the bog .
A swift explantion of what was wrong , & the bloke disappears to the prep room ( where us waiting staff made the sandwiches for the customers ) .
He returns a few minutes later looking pleased with himself , but wo n't tell me what he 's done , as there are now other people in the staffroom .
About five minutes later , That Tubby Bitch is escorted into the staffroom by a female manager .
Said manager escorts her into the locker room to collect her coat , & the off the premises .
Eventually get home a couple of hours later , & get to ask the bloke what he did .
Turns out that just before he came in to use the loo , he heard one of our very fussy regulars ask for a sandwich & a cup of tea .
This woman , who put quite a lot of business our way , tended to be a bit on the rude side to staff , & never tipped .
As a result , she was somewhat paranoid about people tampering with her food , & would throughly inspect anything before eating it .
The bloke had managed to get to the door of the prep room unseen , & discretely watch as she finished making the sandwich .
And then sneak in unobserved , steathily bring up what he described as " the biggest blob of booger - throat - glop you 've ever seen in your life " into the sandwhich , & sneak back out again .
When said fussy customer went to inspect her sandwich , the ' special sauce ' was immediatly spotted , & the manager called .
That Tubby Bitch was formally dismissed after a displinary hearing the following week .

" By the end of this semester , we will have to use the extinguisher at least once .
Do n't let it be because of you . "
Thus were the words of my teaching chef when starting the " meats and main courses " section of my culinary school experience .
I attempted to heed them well , because our teaching kitchen consisted of the equivalent of a walk - in closet packed with enough open flame , scalding oil , and heated metal to easily cause anyone 's demise .
It was a " teaching kitchen , " after all , so they did n't even bother having it up to the building / health / safety codes for actual restaurant work .
Unfortunately , my class was the one that wound up having to use the fire extinguisher .
Fortunately , I was n't the one who wound up setting the ceiling on fire .
Now as you may know , seafood in lemon - butter sauce is a classic dish .
It is made by taking lemon juice , wine , and herbs and heating them in a sauce pan , before then adding in massive quantities of butter until the cholesterol is thick enough to cause the sauce itself to congeal into a thin paste of deliciousness .
It is made this way because as any deep - fat fryer demonstrates , fats do n't boil - they just keep on heating until they smoke , and then later on burst into flame .
Water and anything with water IN it , however , does .
So if you instead do the sauce - making process in reverse , like my fellow classmate decided to do ...
Large amounts of grease go in the pan .
Pan is heated on burner flame for a few minutes , before water - based liquids are added .
Water instantly flash - boils , spraying superheated grease everywhere .
Classmate screams , drops pan into burner flame .
Large amounts of grease splash upwards , while burner flame spreads to it .
Result :
One very impressive pillar of angry orange inferno reaching from the tabletop " porto - range " straight up to the corkboard drop ceiling ( did I mention the room did n't fulfill kitchen building codes ? ) , which looked for all intents and purposes like it should be asking for Charlton Heston in regards to some forgotten commandments .
Quite large .
Rather awe - inspiring .
Very holy hell the room 's on fire !
Class was surprisingly short that day .
Louder than usual , too .
I 'm still in the same classes with these walking deathtraps , though .
What can I say ?
Everyone who wants to be a chef is a latent pyromaniac .
Scorches are still there , too .
At least we 're leaving our mark on the school .

Boiled Breasts
I used to be the manageress of a restaurant , and I had a gaggle of giggling chavvy teens as my waiting staff .
Hey , they 're cheap .
We did a lot of buffets , it being a hotel , for wedding receptions and suchlike .
We used to serve the food from chafin tins , which are long steel trays full of boiling water , heated by little parrafin lamps , and with the trays of food perched on top , being kept merrily warm , with my chavtastic slaves stirring the chilli or whatever disinterestedly and flopping it on the partygoers plates .
Now , being a posh hotel and all we had some very lavish IN and OUT doors which , being the manager , I had to use accordingly .
I 'm glad I did , because when clearing up from a buffet one evening I hear a THUD , a sound like someone had dropped a dustbin lid , and a high pitched squeal .
Turns out that ' Nikki ' , a large chav with a ginger ponytail on the top of her head , had picked up a chafin tin full of boiling water and taken it in the OUT door to empty in the sink .
Trouble is an equally dumb ( but door - sign - rule - adhering ) waitress had come OUT at the same time .
Nikki had poured scalding water over her chest .
The sight of a big ginger girl pulling off her now see through white blouse and sticking her bright red glowing boobs under the pot washer 's cold tap whilst squealing like someone trod on Mickey Mouse is permanently etched into my memory ( and her mammaries ) .

When I was working in Trinidad
on a oil drilling related ship , our cook was partial to the local 'erb ( and so where we ) but the company we worked for had a draconian alcohol and drug policy , being that they would randomly raid the ship and take urine samples from the crew .
With this being the threat , the cook decided to introduce a new herb to his dishes so that all the crew would have tainted piss .
When the shore superintendant did a raid , he took samples of 10 crew , which turned positive , then they complained that it must have been a faulty reading , so he sampled more of us , including the Captain and that turned positive .
So he concluded that the testing kit was at fault and would have to order more from the US , which would take several weeks , and by that time we would be safely back in Blighty .
The cook did make some exceptional cookies for the special few of us on board .

This sucks
I 'm posting this only as it's so close to being a new QOTW , so I feel that the off - topic sin is not so bad .
Some of these stories are horrifying .
And cowardly .
Too scared to confront someone 's unreasonable behaviour face to face ?
Do n't worry kids , just do something gross and dangerous to their heath behind their back .
Customer is upset due to poor service / quality of food / foreign objects ?
See above .
I also can't understand the mentality of people who want to get revenge , when the recipient does n't even know !
Surely the whole point is that they find out they 've wronged you and that 's why this horrible thing has happened ...?
And we wonder why eating out is such a vile experience in Britain .
It 's because people will keep their traps firmly shut and put up with any old bollocks because they are terrified that something like this will undeservedly ( 9 times out of 10 ) happen to them .
Mainly I 'm just glad I do n't have to be on the recieving end of some of the truly bad behaviour that service industry people have to witness .
And I do have sympathy with you , I really do .
But surely there must be better ways of dealing with it then actually putting one of your bodily fluids into their bodies ?
There 's names for doing this kind of thing without people 's consent ...

Used to do Bar - work .
I can honestly say it was the best job I 'd ever had .
Working in a pub in the centre of Swansea was an eye - opener , and no mistake .
Our landlady was a 4 foot skinny midget of a woman , who would stand down to no -one .
She was also one of the funniest women I 've ever met , and the bestest boss I 've ever had too :)
Rachel did have one thing though ; an anger unmatched by the Greek Gods themselves .
There are a few examples of her anger ;
1st week she was there ; she goes out clubbing with the staff , just to get an idea of Swansea .
They all turn up at " Quid 's Inn " ( a fucking dive , if you 've ever been there ) and are allowed in as staff .
Rachel , as the doormen did n't her from squat , had to pay .
She gripped the largest of the doormen by the collar , dragged him all the way down to eye level and said in her most authorative voice " Do you not know who I am ? " , which did actually scare the doorman .
Someone attacked one of the bar - staff with a broken glass , because she called one of the assistant managers ( called Matt ) and this drunkard thought she said Twat .
Before the doormen got near them Rachel had Superman dived over the bar catching the attacker by the throat and throwing both of them to the ground .
The doormen had to clean the mess up .
Rachel was a bit lonely , and got roped into a date with this " Steve Martin " look - a- like who was an eco-warrior ( ie wanker ) .
She really did n't want to go , as he wanted to take her to the cinema to see some shit film ( I think it was Titanic or something ) .
Luckily I was there to rescue ; Rachel suffers from a bad reaction to vodka in the same way that Gamma radiation affects Bruce Banner which is she becomes a snarling green beast of rage .
After getting one of the regulars to get her two double - vodka - redbulls just before the date , we could see her eyebrows twitching as she was walking out with him .
Apparently she threatened to kill him in the auditorium at some point .
They did n't date again .
Two 6 foot skinheads smashed a window with a pool cue because some twat regular tried winding them up .
I throw out the regular with the words " well , I would have to clean you off the wall otherwise " and then walk upto these huge Mitchell look - a- likes .
I say rather calmly " Look guys , you 're both 7 foot 8 and could easily kick the living shit out of me , but hey , I 've gotta ask you to leave . "
They smile and apologise about the window , saying thanks then leaving quietly bless 'em .
On the way out , Rachel storms up and physically grabs them , dragging these huge thugs out of the pub while they both literally shit themselves , much to my amusement .
One dark November Wednesday night off ; my ex-fiancee at the time lived in a flat which was above the pub where I worked ( convieniant ) .
There were windows on the side of the building , which allowed us to see on the roof of the adjacent building next door .
This was also visible from the 2nd floor of the pub ( which housed about 9 pool tables and a bar at the time ) .
Me and said - ex walk into her room , and we decide to watch a film .
She asks me to stick the TV and video on , which are right by the window .
I happen to glance out the window and spot a curious sight .
I immediately shout " Kill the lights !!!!! " to which said - ex does so .
She comes over to see what I 'm looking at , which is a girl spread - eagled over an air vent while a bloke is standing there pumping away while drinking a Carling .
Said - ex says " Fucking hell , tell the regulars downstairs in the pub " , which I do and bring up half of them to which we 're all quietly laughing and voyeuring at through the pub windows .
Except now , there is n't only the guy with his carling and her .
There 's now the guy with his carling with his two mates and her , and they 're all taking turns on her .
By this time , the entire pub is looking out of the windows laughing at this , until one of the barmen opened the window and shouted " Go on luv ! " .
The four of them stand up with the three blokes smiling and bowing to us all and the girl covering her face with embarrasment .
This earned a shoutout of " Dunno why you 're covering your face , we 've seen everything else " .
Five minutes later , we 're all downstairs laughing about it and the 3 guys from the gangbang come in for a pint .
Apparently they 'd only met her half an hour earlier in a nightclub and wanted to take them " somewhere quiet " .
Got that wrong , did n't you ?
Soz for length , but it's what you do with it that counts .

I worked in the pub trade / catering
for many years .
' Tis true , the alcohol / drug induced debauchery that goes on amongst staff is amazing .
( It 's the hours gov'ner honest )
In larger pubs that have accomodation for the staff it 's even worse .
Oh how I remember the days of two different ladies on one night .
Gosh that was a while back .
One story invovled me and the haed chef ( I was the second chef at the time ) looking at the wrong date in the diary and thinking that we only had half a dozen people booked in that night for food ( it was usually dead during the week ) so off we went to smoke a couple of joints .
More than a couple later a very panicked waitress informs us that we had got the day wrong and we had over 60 people booked in .
Have you ever tried cooking many different meals for many different people when you can harldy even stand up ?
It went really rather well though , no one complained as some people got the dessert twice and were amused by the " two very jolly and friendly chefs " that kept popping from the kitchen to chat .

Stone baked bread
I spent several years working in the bakery dept .
of one of the UK 's largest supermarkets * slaps back pocket twice * and I can confirm that what the eye does n't see , the heart does n't grieve over .
Bread pudding was generally made from products that had been sitting on the waste rack for up to ten days ; if it was green , that just ensured a little extra flavour for the lucky punters .
If a lump of dough went on the flour , the bits of grit were picked out and it was chucked back on the conveyor belt .
We occasionally played pranks on each other , so after receiving a lump of dough to the back of my head from a playful colleague , I poured a handful of multigrain seeds into my grease jug , surreptitiously crept behind him , then emptied it into his arse crack as soon as he bent over to stop the machine ; the manager was not impressed to discover one of the staff sitting in the sink ( where the utensils were washed ) , pulling cumin / poppy / sunflower seeds out of his ring along with a healthy helping of tagnuts and arse hair .
However , the crowning glory occurred about ten years ago .
I was a bit of a smoker in those days , as was the guy I worked with at the time , so we used to see how stoned we could get whilst we worked .
I 'd roll a joint , smoke half of it , chip it out then give it to him , then around half hour later , he would do the same .
If it was n't possible to pass it on due to other staff being around , we 'd just stick the half - spliff in our respective pockets until it was convenient .
On one such occasion , I searched my pocket to give my mate his half of the doobie and discovered that it was missing ; evidently , the THC - induced memory loss had kicked in and I must have smoked it myself .
Well , the next day I was working away merrily ( for we 'd been smoking weed since 4 am ) , when my manager came out the back to see me .
" Bloody customers , they 'll try anything ! " he exclaimed .
" What 's up ? " says I .
" Someone 's only just walked in and said that he 's bought a french stick with a roll - up sticking out of it .
He 's obviously lying , so I told him to f*ck off , but he reckons that he 's going to EHO about it . "
Cue the next two weeks of me bricking it and expecting to be sacked which , although it was a sh*t job , would have inconvenienced me considerably ; we made our own hours up so even though I was on about £ 4 p/h , I was taking home about £ 300 p/w .
Furthermore , we were under scrutiny until the investigation was conducted , so work became extremely unpleasant .
There is a happy ending , though :
The environmental health people did n't notice that it was a spliff , just that it was a roll - up , so they tried to pin it on this mad woman who worked out the front with the packing staff , for she was the only member of staff ( that they knew of ) who used Rizla .
She kicked off and denied it , so they interviewed the cleaner , a local chav who happily admitted that he smoked spliffs on the job and it could well have been his and on top of that , could he have it back ?
He was sacked , but I think I got the bum deal , because I ended up working there for another six years .
Apologies for length , but I 'm used to saying that .
My b3 tan hymen has been well and truly snapped .

Well , the next day I was working away merrily ( for we 'd been smoking weed since 4 am ) , when my manager came out the back to see me .
" Bloody customers , they 'll try anything ! " he exclaimed .
" What 's up ? " says I . " Someone 's only just walked in and said that he 's bought a french stick with a roll - up sticking out of it .
He 's obviously lying , so I told him to f*ck off , but he reckons that he 's going to EHO about it .
" Cue the next two weeks of me bricking it and expecting to be sacked which , although it was a sh*t job , would have inconvenienced me considerably ; we made our own hours up so even though I was on about £ 4 p/h , I was taking home about £ 300 p/w .
Furthermore , we were under scrutiny until the investigation was conducted , so work became extremely unpleasant .
There is a happy ending , though :
The environmental health people did n't notice that it was a spliff , just that it was a roll - up , so they tried to pin it on this mad woman who worked out the front with the packing staff , for she was the only member of staff ( that they knew of ) who used Rizla .
She kicked off and denied it , so they interviewed the cleaner , a local chav who happily admitted that he smoked spliffs on the job and it could well have been his and on top of that , could he have it back ?
He was sacked , but I think I got the bum deal , because I ended up working there for another six years .
Apologies for length , but I 'm used to saying that .

Serving food to people you never meet ...
I was hired for three days to help cover an illness in the kitchen at Walls 's sausage machine factory in Machester 's docklands .
This was the oddest canteen I 've ever worked in .
We kitchen staff spent most of the day cooking food .
We cooked / prepared everything starting at 8 am and working until 1 pm ; from breakfast , through lunch , dinner , supper and snacks ; eggs ( scrambled , fried and poached ) , sausage , bacon , tomato , black pudding , pies , hot - pot , stew , chips , fish , chops , salad , cheesecake , cakes , fruit , the bloody lot .
What did we do with all this freshly cooked food ?
Serve it through a hatch ?
Carry it out waitress - style ?
Silver service , even ?
No .
We flash chilled it , plated it up as if it was hot , then entombed it in cling film .
These culinary masterpieces then had a coloured sticky label stuck on by the ' chef de cuisine '
Tony ( of course ) and were placed in rotating compartments ranged along one wall of the kitchen .
As we opened the door to do a ' fill ' , the light on the far side went out and only we could turn the carousel .
The carousels would turn round at the request of someone in the canteen , who would remove the meal and follow the colour coded sticker placed by Tony .
There was , apparently , a bank of microwave ovens out there with coloured labels stuck over the buttons .
We filled the drinks dispensers with cans and bottles from the rear as well , and there was another , smaller carousel for plate returns .
The factory staff worked shifts , 24 hours a day , and we never heard any more than a dozen or so people at any one time in the canteen .
We never went into the canteen , only Tony did that .
He would unlock the door and return a few minutes later with a tray of empty sauce bottles , sugar dispensers and salt pots for refilling .
He would take out a box of sealed , disinfectant soaked cloths which the workers used to clear up after themselves .
The canteen floor was mopped by the factory cleaners , we mopped the kitchen floor .
We never , ever , EVER saw any of the workers .
One night , I lurked around outside the gates waiting to see one of these mysterious workers , but all I ever saw were shadows moving behind the obscuring , translucent panels in the walls , high up on the side of the factory .
It was very freaky .

My family ran a guest house
and one day my brother mistook the cocoa for the gravy powder .
Politely no - one commented , or maybe Oxo- and - chocolate sauce works ..
Dad would write the menus in calligraphy , patiently , each day .
Took some time , but a nice touch .
Do n't disturb his concentration as the last line once read " Tea or Custard " ( not Coffee . . )
Mainly catering for young families we would be plagued with the kids coming in to see what was on the menu that night .
The expression on their little faces when we simply put
" Bread and water "

It 's long , skip if you want - no apologies
Colonel , thanks for reminding me of some of the ‘ characters ’ at the Toby Grill :
Mark was our dim pot -washer .
He actually said his ambition was to be a glass - collector at Yates ’ , not sure if he ever made it that far .
He was about 5 ’ 2 ” and 17 years old , to get a good mental picture of him , imagine morphing the face of a mongoloid child onto a wombat .
While working at the place he lost his virginity to a 22 yr old single mum who was at least 5 ’ 8 ” tall and very ugly , he thought she loved him .
The look of pure delight on Mark ’s face as the resident Friday night DJ played ‘ Like a virgin ’ for him to celebrate his popped cherry was heart - rending .
Mark used to bike to work .
‘ Dippy ’ was a chef – in the loosest possible sense of the word .
His nickname came from his not inconsiderable reputation as a pickpocket and thief .
Once , he nicked Mark ’s bike from outside the kitchen while he was working .
Next day , poor Mark had to borrow his sister ’s bike to get to work .
Dippy nicked it , Mark never twigged , we all knew .
Pat the manageress was like something out of Coronation St .
She might have been late 30s but first thing in the morning she looked a rough 65 .
She took up with the 22 yr old deputy manager who was a cnut of the highest calibre .
They both ‘ lived in ’ and had free meals / drinks , so had more money than sense , or manners , or style .
He had an MR2 and used to go ( from York ) to Manchester for a take - away curry .
After a while , he started hitting her , she ’d come down in sunglasses and tons of make - up , he ’d come down with a smirk .
My least favourite customer was Mr Bastard .
He ’d come with his wife regularly every Friday night for a slap - up meal of pre-packaged dross .
Each time , when he bought his first round from the bar in the restaurant , he ’d say “ Would you like one yourself Che ? ” , to which the standard answer would be “ Thank you very much Mr Bastard , I ’ll take for it now and have it later . ”
Fast - forward to the Bastards ’ anniversary or some such .
They arrived with about six friends and sat in the pre-food lounge area .
At which point Mr Bastard turned towards me at the bar and snapped his fingers – yes , he actually snapped his fingers , then beckoned me over .
I had to go over , take his drinks order and then carry the drinks back over for him .
He had paid for this butler - like service with a few halves of lager .
So , what was this snobby , arsehole of man in real life ?
He collected money from slot machines .
My favourite customers were a couple that lived nearby and were friends of Pat .
They came in one night with a friend of theirs whose wife had just left him .
They talked to him all night and he left around 11.15 .
There was a noise outside and the couple went out to see what it was .
Their friend had gone outside , sat down against his van , stuck his shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger .
We all got home late that night .
To end on a happier note , we had a ‘ back room ’ with no bar that could be let out to private parties .
A regular booking was for the Morris Minor Owners ’ Club .
I found out one of the favourite pastimes for this group was ‘ guess the part ’ .
They ’d pass round a black velvet bag with a part from a Morris Minor in it , each member would feel inside the bag without looking and write down what they thought it was .
There were ten rounds … wild nights .

Oh ...
... and another one , also from the Selsdon Park hotel .
I did a spell on porters for a while , and part of the job was parking guests ' cars and looking after their keys , if they were too lazy , or just plain pompous , to do it themselves .
One night there was a big storm .
It was huge and devastating , and made the whole building rock .
In fact , it turned out to be the biggest hurricane the UK had ever seen - the great storm of 1987 .
One guest ( a particularly patronising , arsey American ) came down in the morning and asked for his car .
I personally took him out to see it , and savoured every second as he beholded his brand new BMW .
A large oak tree had fallen on it lengthways , and it now resembled a very expensive length of drainpipe .
It was completely flattened .
I wish I had a pic - it was truly a sight to behold .

I have many , many catering stories ..
..apart from this one :
b3ta.com/questions/outofmydepth/post16530/
When I was working at a place called the Selsdon Park ( big 4 * hotel ) quite a few years back , I was in charge of the bar .
The rule of thumb was that at night , as long as there were at least 20 residents in there , we stayed open .
This obviously led to all sorts of late night free bar conference shenanigans , with sad twats who could n't hold their drink .
The one story which sticks out from all the rest is when we had a big fashion retailer called Pamplemousse ( do they still exist ? ) in for a conference .
They had a free bar , and were still in there at 5 am .
I finally decided enough was enough when one of the table staff caught one of the senior Pamplemousse staff giving someone a blowjob underneath a jacket in the corner .
We shut the bar , and sent everyone to bed .
Obviously not content with this , the same staff member proceeded to go upstairs to the man 's room , do whatever she had to do , and then lock herself outside in the coridor naked .
To cover herself up , she pulled down a large and very expensive curtain and wrapped it around herself .
This classy and sophisticated lady then decided that she needed a shit , so she curled one off in one of the ashtrays beside the lift .
She then went down to reception , smelling of turd and with a curtain wrapped round her , and angrily demanded in a pissed - up drawl to be let back into her room , indignant at the fact that the hotel had somehow got her into this predicament .
She was let into her room , and then presented with a ma - hhooo - sive bill by the duty manager the next morning .
Funnily enough , she apparently did n't utter a single word of complaint , and sheepishly got out her chequebook .

Restaurants , Kitchens and Bars ...
Oh my !
Up until a few weeks ago I was the Manager of The Other Place Restaurant in Liverpool .
Then I took a weeks holiday to celebrate my 30th birthday .
At the beginning of my week off my 7 months pregnant partner was rushed into hospital with complications and got the news that the baby needed to be delivered in the next few days .
Knowing this the owner of the restaurant , John Green , decided to call me in to work to sack me for no reason other than I had been asking about paternity leave .
In the heated discussion I forgot to tell him that every meal I had took out to him , I had spat in , and next time just happen to bump into his wife Debbie I will let slip about the dark haired woman he brought back and shagged in the restaurant that saturday night .
Oh yes and next time he drives home extremely pissed , as he likes to do a few times a week watch the rear mirror for the blue flashing lights that have been tipped off in your direction .

Special Sauce
I second that comment about the sealed containers of mayo , which is why , after working at McDs for a I became annoyed with the customers .
Having heard the urban legend about " special " sauce , I thought I would re-enact it .
Imagine my dismay when I found that it was very hard to do in the back of the restaurant - the best I could manage was not washing my hands after a fwap .
Not special enough .
So I jacked that job in , and got one at a company ( name understandably witheld ) that makes mayonaises and sauces , for most of McDs in the south east ( along with a number of smaller establishments and some sandwich manufacturers ) .
I worked there as an computer support monkey for a few weeks until I got the lay of the land and worked out all the proceedures and processes .
And I waited .
One week , they had shut down part of the plant for cleaning ( they did this regularly ) and I realised that this would be my opportunity for spunky revenge .
I collected about a weeks worth of spooge in a plastic bag , and the night before they were due to re-start that part of the factory , I dumped the entire bag into the egg - yolk vat that would be used in the McD sauces .
100 ml of man - fat in half a tonne of yolk would n't be noticed and was n't .
So I spunked in all the big macs in the south east , over a several week period .
And a lot of the sandwiches you buy in petrol station forecourts .
And a lot more food besides that .
Hee hee .

Save energy - just look away now
by Marc Cieslak
BBC Click
Manufacturers are developing new and ingenious ways to save energy
The 21st Century home is packed to the rafters with electrical devices , from labour - saving kit in the kitchen to widescreen TVs and computers .
Even the simple act of illuminating our homes requires power .
Some of the major manufacturers at the Japanese technology fair Ceatec suggest that alternative energy sources like wind and solar power could become commonplace as wind turbines and solar panels become cheaper .
But short of pulling the plug and switching off our creature comforts , reducing the amount of energy we use seems to be the goal of the big players .
Pretty much all of the consumer kit is making claims to be more energy efficient , but manufacturers are coming up with more ingenious solutions .
One particular TV set is fitted with a small camera and equipped with facial recognition software .
It is looking for a viewer 's full face looking at the screen .
The current crop of energy efficient bulbs has disappointed because they take an awfully long time to warm up
If the viewer looks away from the screen for a couple of seconds the image slowly fades out but the audio continues to play .
If they turn back to the screen , the image immediately returns .
TV sets require an awful lot more electricity to create pictures than they do sound , so when turned away from the screen , energy is being saved .
This TV and face recognition software are the brainchild of engineers at Hitachi and so far it remains at prototype stage but has been trumped by Sony - which already has similar technology fitted to a production TV .
You might think that features like this are no more than a gimmick , but it does help highlight the more serious green credentials of televisions .
Full brightness New LCD screens are benefiting from a more efficient back lighting which uses half of the electricity of rival LCD TVs .
LED lighting is seen as a greener alternative to incandescent bulbs
In the quest for more energy efficiency in the home , even the humble light bulb has come to the attention of eco-tinkering engineers .
The current crop of energy efficient bulbs has disappointed because they take an awfully long time to warm up and achieve full brightness .
So it seems like the light emitting diode ( LED ) could really come into its own .
Until now , LED light bulbs have remained something of a rarity as a result of the bulbs sky - high price tag .
The manufacturers of the latest generation of LED lamps , about to be launched in Japan , claim they are eight times more efficient than old - style incandescent and have up to a 19 - year lifespan - 40 times longer then a common or garden bulb .
Individual LEDs are clustered inside the bulb and the quality of light they produce is bright and the lamps are dimmable .
The only downside to these bulbs is the cost - currently at around $ 40 ( £ 25 ) each .
Kind to the planet ?
Yes , but definitely not kind to the wallet .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama ’s push for healthcare reform gathered steam on Thursday as a Senate panel scheduled a key vote for next week and Democrats in the House of Representatives moved closer to unveiling a bill .

The Senate Finance Committee will vote on Tuesday on its healthcare plan after budget analysts gave the bill a rosy report card , estimating it would meet Obama ’s goal of reducing the budget deficit over 10 years .
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office put the cost at $ 829 billion , below Obama ’s $ 900 billion goal , in a report on Wednesday that cleared the way for likely committee passage and an eventual debate in the Democratic - controlled Senate .
Republicans , concerned about the bill ’s costs and potential impact on the budget deficit , had demanded the estimate before they cast a vote on the proposal to dramatically transform the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system .
“ Today we stand closer than ever to fulfilling that fundamental promise , the one for which we have fought for more than 60 years , ” Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said of healthcare reform .
Obama ’s healthcare drive , his top domestic priority , is aimed at cutting costs , regulating insurers and expanding insurance coverage to millions of Americans without it .
Shares of large health insurers slumped on Thursday as the CBO report fueled investor fears an overhaul that would damage the industry was headed for eventual approval .
Once approved by the Finance Committee , Reid and other party leaders will merge the panel ’s bill with one passed by the Senate health committee earlier this year for Senate consideration .
Republicans said the merger would reshape the bill again , and some disputed its calculations and said the actual cost would be much higher .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell labeled the CBO report “ irrelevant . ”
“ What matters is that the final bill will cost about a trillion dollars , vastly expand the role of government in people ’s healthcare decisions , increase premiums and limit choice , ” he said .
OBAMA “ FISHING ” FOR SNOWE
Senator Olympia Snowe , the lone Republican on the committee considered a possible supporter of the measure , said she had not decided how to vote but talked with Obama on Thursday .
“ What do you think he wants ? ” she joked to reporters .
She said Obama was “ fishing ” for whether she would back the bill .
Obama has staked much of his political clout on the healthcare drive , and failure could derail the rest of his legislative agenda and weaken his fellow Democats in next year ’s congressional elections .
In the Democratic - controlled House , where party leaders have met for weeks to meld three pending bills into one for debate , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they were nearing their final decisions .
She said they would get cost estimates from CBO on a bill with three options for a government - run “ public ” insurance plan , which Obama and liberal Democrats support as a way to inject competition into the insurance marketplace .
Critics say the approach would hurt the private insurance industry .
All three pending House bills include a public option , which Pelosi said was backed by a majority of the House .
“ Now it ’s a question of which one , ” she told reporters .
One House version would be based on reimbursement rates paid to healthcare providers under Medicare , the government - run health plan for seniors , and the other two would rely on reimbursement rates negotiated with the providers .
House Democrats agreed to adjust a proposed surtax on the wealthy to ensure it would not apply to individuals making less than $ 500,000 or couples making less than $ 1 million , a Democratic aide said .
The proposal would raise about $ 460 billion over 10 years -- about $ 84 billion less than originally proposed .
Pelosi said Democrats also were looking at the possibility of a windfall profits tax on insurance companies ’ income , and she had asked House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel to examine the issue and report back to her .
Pelosi said insurance companies would get millions of new consumers , many subsidized by taxpayers , under the reforms and “ We think they can put more on the table . ”
Shares of health insurer WellPoint Inc fell more than 6 percent , while UnitedHealth Group Inc , Aetna Inc and Humana dropped more than 3.5 percent as investor grew nervous about the reform drive .
“ The successful CBO score increases the likelihood that a reform bill will pass , ” Wells Fargo analyst Matt Perry said .
Parents banned from watching their children in playgrounds ... in case they are paedophiles
Parents are being banned from playing with their children in council recreation areas because they have not been vetted by police .
Mothers and fathers are being forced to watch their children from outside perimeter fences because of fears they could be paedophiles .
Watford Council was branded a ' disgrace ' yesterday after excluding parents from two fenced - off adventure playgrounds unless they first undergo criminal record checks .
' A disgrace ' : Jenny Abbasi , with her children Aliyah ( left ) , Tameena and Kareem , outside Harwoods Adventure Playground in Watford .
The local council has told parents that they are no longer welcome at two play areas because they have not been vetted by police
Children as young as five will instead be supervised by council ' play rangers ' who have been cleared by the Criminal Records Bureau .
Councillors insist they are merely following Government regulations and cannot allow adults to walk around playgrounds ' unchecked ' .
But furious parents attacked the move and threatened to boycott the playgrounds .
Concerns were raised last night that other councils around the country are adopting similar policies amid confusion over Government rules and increasing hysteria over child protection .
It comes amid an escalating row over the Government 's new anti-paedophile database , which will contain the names of more than 11 million adults cleared to work with children and vulnerable adults .
Mother - of - five Marcella Bergin , 35 , from Watford , who has been visiting the play areas for many years , said : ' It 's like they are branding all parents potential paedophiles , which is disgraceful .
' Ninety - nine per cent of people are great parents and certainly not child abusers . '
Mother - of - eight Jenny Abbasi , 41 , whose children also use the playgrounds , said the new rules were ' a disgrace ' .
Miss Abbasi , from Garston , Hertfordshire , said : ' I have been using the playgrounds for 18 years and it's a sad day when parents cannot be involved with the enjoyment of their children . '
The rules were imposed at Harwoods and Harebreaks adventure recreation grounds from this week .
Activities on the half - acre sites include a skateboard half - pipe , a zip line and rope swings .
Play rangers patrol both parks - which are for children aged five to 15 - and are fully qualified with CRB checks .
Parents already have to ' register ' their child on arrival so staff have their contact details in the event of an accident .
But now only those who have been selected for CRB vetting by the council can enter the sites .
Mayor Dorothy Thornhill argued the council was merely enforcing government policy at the play areas .
' Sadly , in today 's climate , you can't have adults walking around unchecked in a children 's playground and the adventure playground is not a meeting place for adults , ' she said .
But the Tories claimed the row showed the Government 's ' heavy - handed ' approach to safeguarding was ' completely out of control ' .
Meet Dan Nowell , the Real Balloon Boy
Long before the Heene family 's hoax , one little boy really did get stuck dangling from a flying hot air balloon — and lived to tell about it .
Last week , you probably sat in front of your television for hours transfixed by a flying silver balloon , worried sick about the six - year - old boy stuck inside of it — only to discover that the “ Balloon Boy ” incident was a hoax masterminded by the child ’s parents , who were intent on getting their own reality TV show .
While we ’re relieved that young Falcon Heene is safe and sound , we ’re getting tired of hearing about the Balloon Boy who never left the ground .
Instead , why not travel back in time to learn about the original Balloon Boy , Dan Nowell ?
In 1964 , Nowell was an 11 - year - old boy who had gone to watch a hot air balloon lift off in Marin , California .
The balloon ’s pilot told Nowell and the other children to grab on to the balloon ’s tether lines in advance of take - off — but when the pilot told the children to release the lines so that the balloon could lift off , Nowell could n’t hear him over the noise of the hot air burners .
While the others released the cords , Nowell kept holding on — and lifted up along with the balloon .
The hot air balloon rose to the height of a five - story building , with Nowell dangling from the side .
His hand was wrapped up in the cord , cutting off his circulation .
Though Nowell was calling for help to alert the pilot , the pilot was n’t able to hear him over the noise of the burners .
“ We all feared the boy was only holding on and would soon have to let go , ” Jim Kean , a photographer covering the balloon launch , told the Independent Journal in the days after the incident .
“ It looked as if he would drop to his death at any moment .
Men were crying and women fell down praying .
It was the worst thing I had ever seen . ”
Finally , after ten minutes of flying , the pilot turned off the burners , and was able to hear the boy ’s screams .
He sent the balloon into a rapid descent , and it landed in a family ’s yard , two miles away from where it had taken off .
Luckily , Nowell had a soft impact on the grass , but he needed to be rushed to the hospital immediately : he was in shock , and his hand had turned blue from lack of oxygen .
Fortunately , Nowell ’s recovery was quick , and he soon found himself a media darling , appearing on talk shows and game shows alike .
He received countless letters and gifts from strangers who had heard his survival story — many of them simply addressed to “ Balloon Boy , USA . ”
“ It ’s all a blur , ” Nowell told the San Jose Mercury News .
“ Notoriety is something that ’s an interesting thing in life to deal with .
It probably left me a little more humble after that .
I realize it ’s part of our culture , the media frenzy . ”
These days , 56 - year - old Nowell stays out of the spotlight , but he ’s lived a rich and happy life since that terrifying day : he owns a business focused on custom home remodeling , and is a board member for Bread and Roses , a nonprofit focused on bringing music to the seriously ill .
And despite the stress of his ride in the sky , Nowell is still a fan of hot air balloons .
“ I did n’t have any psychological scarring from the event , ” he told the San Francisco Chronicle .
“ I even went up in a balloon again with the same pilot . ”
But we ’re guessing he made sure to travel in the basket .

Even for a speculator like Calvert , it was an unusually good deal .
During the time he owned the land , Calvert used the legislative process known as earmarking to secure $ 8 million for a planned freeway interchange 16 miles from the property , and an additional $ 1.5 million to support commercial development of the area around the airfield .
A map of Calvert 's recent real estate holdings and those of his partner shows many of them near the transportation projects he has supported with federal appropriations .
And improvements to the transportation infrastructure have contributed to the area 's explosive growth , according to development experts .
... What sets Calvert 's actions apart from the traditional efforts of lawmakers to bring federal dollars home to their districts is that some of the spending has gone for improvements near his private real estate ventures , and he has used earmarking to secure the tax dollars ...
He also has secured funds for a number of projects pushed by campaign contributors , including employees of the Washington lobbying firm of Copeland Lowery & Jacquez , his top political donor in the last election cycle .
But the most serious questions , ethics specialists say , involve Calvert 's participation in real estate ventures in which his earmarks for highway and other improvements may have contributed to rising land values and created at least the appearance that he personally benefited .
Ken Calvert , who represents a suburban Inland Empire district in southern Orange County and western Riverside County ( CA - 44 ) , has been on radar for a very long time -- and yesterday 's announcement of an FBI investigation of one of California 's most incorrigible political crooks registered as more overdue than unexpected .
A former real estate speculator , Calvert first came to the attention of non-political junkies when he was arrested -- a Republican " Family Values " hypocrite -- with a young woman he did n't know in a parked car , his pants down around his knees .
( She turned out to be Lore Lorena Lindberg , a heroin addict with several prostitution convictions . )
But even before that , Congressman Calvert was involved with a series shady real estate deals , the same pay for play scam that led to the conviction of his buddy and political ally Randy " Duke " Cunningham , and an international espionage and bribery caper in Saudi Arabia with convicted felons Cunningham and Thomas Kontogiannis .
In Calvert 's case , it 's hard to know where to start sorting through all the garbage .
Probably the best place to start is by looking at his real estate dealings and how they have been impacted by his earmarks on the House Transportation Committee .
To put it really simply , Calvert would make sure millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on building roads to worthless parcels of land that he and his shady business partner , a character named Woody Harpole , bought for pennies and sold , because of the government - financed improvements , for dollars .
If you look at Calvert 's and Harpole , Jr's real estate investments , it 's impossible to not notice that they cluster around transportation projects that Calvert supported with taxpayer dollars -- like in a Corona area which has experienced a good deal of bubble - like growth because of a bus depot Calvert got funded .
Calvert 's firm , which his brother heads , bought a 4.3 acre parcel near the March Air Reserve Base and Calvert immediately got to work getting an $ 8 million freeway exchange built so he could sell the land for double what he paid for it .
Same thing happened with a site they bought at Temescal Canyon Road near a proposed interchange at Cajalco and the I - 15 .
Calvert , according to the profited handsomely for his blatant conflict of interest .
Calvert snickers when reporters ask him about this stuff : " They have n't passed a law against investing yet .
" The latest bit of malfeasance involves 4 acres Calvert and Harpole bought from the Jurupa Community Services District in 2006 for $ 1.2 million .
The land was purchased as part of a sweetheart deal and was clearly done illegally , the district neither looking for competitive bids nor offering it to other state agencies .
( The Riverside County Grand Jury has already ruled that Calvert 's acquisition violated state law . )
A predominantly Hispanic neighborhood , Mira Loma , wants to use the land as a community park and baseball field ; Calvert is determined to turn it into mini-self - storage units .
When Calvert came under scrutiny for the deal , he lied about it and claimed he was a silent partner .
But , in the 2006story linked above , about another fortuitous land sale of Calvert ’s , Harpole was quoted that he had to consult with Calvert when investing Calvert ’s money : " [ O ] f course I have to consult with him if we are looking at investing his money . ”
Harpole also said at the time , “ I told him about one [ deal ] and he said , ‘ No , I do n’t think so . ' "
Calvert ’s partnership negotiated an extended escrow period of up to 15 months which worked to Calvert ’s benefit since at the time real estate experts argues that prices were rising 15 to 25 percent a year .
Additionally , while the property was still in escrow , a higher offer came in -- and was rejected -- bolstering claims that the deal was done to help curry political favor with Calvert ’s office .
All this led to the Riverside County Grand Jury , in 2007 , finding that the Jurupa Community Services District violated state law when it sold the land to Calvert and his partners without offering it to other local agencies first , including the Park District , which had shown interest in the land .
The Jurupa Park District announced this summer that it would be forced to spend $ 1.7 million in 2009 - 2010 in expected legal costs tied to the Calvert land deal -- more tax dollars Calvert is costing the hard - pressed residents of Riverside County .
Calvert has always denied every single crime he 's been involved in .
Even with his penis clearly in plain view ( according to the official police report ) he told the arresting officer he and the prostitute were " just chatting . "
He claims all his perfectly routine real estate shenanigans are made to look nefarious because of political vendettas against him .
Last year , the voters in CA - 44 seemed to be having second thoughts about Calvert , who eked out a razor thin victory against a little - known -- and massively outspent -- Bill Hedrick , 51 - 49 % .
Hedrick spent $ 191,461 or $ 1.48 per vote he received .
Calvert spent $ 1,150,432 -- $ 8.85 per vote !
Calvert fought against this past March 's Helping Families Save Their Homes
Act , even though over 16,000 families have been foreclosed on in his district and even though the 4 year projection rate for CA - 44 is for over 53,400 families to lose their homes .
Now , with Calvert adamantly opposing meaningful health care reform against the wishes of his constituents ( 146,000 of whom have no health insurance coverage ) , it is likely that the latest round of scandals will be the final nail in the coffin of his political career .
Bill Hedrick , in fact , is running against him again .
Unfortunately , the big lobbyists and corporate special interests who are so well served by Calvert 's ethics - free operations have opened the funding gates wide for him again and he 's already up $ 773,633 to Hedrick 's $ 122,672 .

Renault director of engineering Pat Symonds has been offered immunity from punishment by the FIA if he offers full disclosure of the facts surrounding last year 's Singapore Grand Prix race - fix allegations .
With less than one week to go before Renault faces the FIA World Motor Sport Council to answer charges that it asked Nelson Piquet to crash deliberately to help Fernando Alonso win , sources have confirmed to AUTOSPORT that Symonds has been given the chance of an amnesty .
The development comes on the back of interviews between Symonds , FIA representatives and members from the Quest agency at the Belgian Grand Prix where it was deemed his evidence was ' central ' to finding answers to what happened in Singapore .
In the stewards ' report about that interview , a copy of which has been seen by AUTOSPORT , Symonds confirms that the race - day meeting between himself , Briatore and Piquet did take place .
The stewards reports added : " Mr. Symonds accepted that he had discussed with NPJ ( Piquet ) the possibility of a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix , although he said the suggestion was raised by NPJ . "
However , Symonds then refused to answer questions about specific allegations about the events that took place that day ( see separate story ) .
It is understood , however , that the reason to offer Symonds immunity has come from the fact that he indicated at the time that he may have further useful information .
The stewards report stated : " Mr. Symonds suggested at his interview on 27 August that he might wish to revert to the Stewards with further information , including information responsive to the various questions he had declined to answer .
" However , no such further information was provided on 27 August .
On 28 August , Mr Symonds was summoned back before the Stewards to be asked if he wanted to give further information on the questions he had declined to answer .
Mr Symonds again declined to answer the questions . "
It is not clear if Symonds has accepted the immunity from punishment offer , but should he do so it means only Renault boss Flavio Briatore will face the FIA 's WMSC without any such deal in place .
FIA president Max Mosley confirmed at the Italian Grand Prix that Piquet would be exempt too .
Drugs tsar sacked for claiming Ecstasy , cannabis and LSD are less harmful than alcohols says more advisors will quit
Controversy : Professor David Nutt criticised the decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug
The UK 's chief drugs tsar sacked over his controversial views today launched an extraordinary attack on Gordon Brown and warned the Government 's whole advisory board could quit .
Professor David Nutt , fired last night for claiming cannabis , Ecstasy and LSD are less dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes , turned both barrels on the Prime Minister .
He declared that the Government had gone too far by defying his and other experts ' advise on cannabis and Ecstasy and claimed ministers were acting before they had even consulted their own advisors .
' He [ Gordon Brown ] is the first Prime Minister , this is the first Government , that has ever in the history of the Misuse of Drugs Act gone against the advice of its scientific panel , ' he said .
' And then it did it again with ecstasy and I have to say it 's not about ( me ) over - stepping the line , it 's about the Government over - stepping the line .
' They are making scientific decisions before they 've even consulted with their experts . '
He added : ' I know that my committee was very very upset by the attitude the Prime Minister took over cannabis .
We actually formally wrote to him to complain about it .
I would n't be surprised if some of them stepped down .
Maybe all of them will .'
Home Secretary Alan Johnson sensationally fired Professor Nutt last night after deciding he had ' no confidence ' in him .
The move followed a series of controversial remarks about the effect of drugs , which included a claim that Ecstasy was no more dangerous than ' riding a horse ' .
It is the first time a chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been fired in its 38 - year history .
Home Office officials said Mr Johnson had been ' surprised and disappointed ' by Professor Nutt 's comments .
Mr Johnson said they ' damaged efforts to give the public clear messages about the dangers of drugs ' .
Prof Nutt was sacked for claiming cannabis , Ecstasy and LSD were less dangerous than alcohol
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz , chief executive of the Medical Research Council , said today : ' We wholeheartedly defend academic freedom and the need for scientists to present findings based on sound research .
' It is crucial that UK policy is based on evidence and that scientists are able to offer unfettered advice without the fear of reprisal .
This principle should be the backbone of scientific engagement with government . '
Neuroscientist Professor Colin Blakemore added that Professor Nutt 's sacking appeared to suggest a ' worrying retreat ' by Labour and said he had only been trying to ' inform debate ' with his remarks .
' If ministers decide to go against the recommendations of their own experts , I really think the public is entitled to know why , ' he said .
He compared the Government 's stance now to when it first came into power , saying : ' I think all scientists who have given their time to advise the government were very encouraged by the attitude of Labour when it came into power in 1997 and its stated commitment to evidence - based policy . '
Labour 's victory came after ministers used ' their own interpretation ' of scientific evidence in the BSE crisis , he said , and it had vowed never to let that happen again .
' There seems to be a worrying retreat from that important commitment , ' Professor Blakemore said .
Professor Nutt has long courted controversy .
Under his stewardship , the ACMD resisted the reclassification of cannabis and also called for Ecstasy to be downgraded to a Class B substance .
On both occasions he was overruled by ministers .
But it was a paper he authored for the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King 's College , London , that proved the final straw .
He accused former home secretary Jacqui Smith , who reclassified cannabis , of ' distorting and devaluing ' scientific research , and said smoking the drug created a ' relatively small risk ' of psychotic illness .
He also claimed those who wanted to move Ecstasy into Class B from Class A - including himself - had ' won the intellectual argument ' .
Most controversially , Professor Nutt said all drugs , including alcohol and tobacco , should be ranked by a ' harm ' index - with drinking coming fifth behind cocaine , heroin , barbiturates , and methadone .
Tobacco should rank ninth , ahead of cannabis , LSD and Ecstasy , he added .
Last night , Professor Nutt appeared to blame his sacking on ' political ' considerations .
' It 's unusual political times , I suppose , elections and all that , ' he said .
' It 's disappointing .
' But politics is politics and science is science and there 's a bit of a tension between them sometimes . '
He also attacked politicians for ' misleading ' the public , accusing Gordon Brown of making ' completely irrational statements about cannabis being " lethal " , which it is not .
THE SERIAL OFFENDER
This is not the first time Professor Nutt has made headlines .
Earlier this year , he was reprimanded by ex-home secretary Jacqui Smith for suggesting taking ecstasy was ' no worse than riding a horse ' .
She accused the scientist of ' trivialising ' the dangers and health concerns of drugs and showing ' insensitivity to the families of victims ' of ecstasy .
Professor Nutt was forced to apologise but within days his recommendation that ecstasy be downgraded to Class B was rejected outright .
A second proposal to give out purity testing kits was also thrown out .
Professor Nutt maintained scientists ' won the intellectual argument ' and described the media 's reaction to his remarks as ' extreme ' .
' If you want to reduce the harm to society from drugs , alcohol is the drug to target and all parents should be very aware of that , ' he said .
Shadow Home Secretary , Chris Grayling said : ' This was an inevitable decision after his latest ill - judged contribution to the debate . '
However , CCJS boss Richard Garside , who published this week 's paper , said : ' I 'm shocked and dismayed the Home Secretary appears to believe political calculation trumps scientific opinion .
His action is a bad day for science . '
A Home Office spokesman said : ' The role of the chair of the ACMD is to provide independent scientific advice , not to lobby for changes in policy . '
One out of every eight strokes is preceded by a " warning stroke , " which is a transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or mild stroke , according to research published in the September 29 , 2009 , print issue of Neurology® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
" These results illustrate the need for better risk assessment tools for preventing strokes before they occur , " said study author Daniel G. Hackam , MD , PhD , of the University of Western Ontario in London , ON .
" Other studies have shown that up to 80 percent of strokes after TIA can be prevented when risk factors are managed intensively . "
For the study , researchers identified all people at Ontario hospitals with a diagnosis of stroke over four years .
Of the 16,400 patients , 2,032 , or 12.4 percent , had a TIA prior to the stroke .
During a TIA , stroke symptoms last for less than 24 hours and then resolve .
Those who did not have a warning stroke were more likely to have a more serious stroke than those who did have the warning stroke .
Those with no warning were more likely to die while at the hospital ( 15.2 percent compared to 12.7 percent ) , more likely to have a heart arrest while in the hospital ( 4.8 percent compared to 3.1 percent ) and less likely to be able to go home after the hospital stay , rather than to a nursing home or rehabilitation center ( 40.1 percent compared to 43.1 percent ) .
Those with the warning stroke were typically older than those without warning strokes .
They were also more likely to have diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems .
" It 's possible that the blood vessels of those with warning strokes were preconditioned to the lack of blood flow , which protected them from the full result of the larger stroke .
Any person who experiences even a minor stroke should get to the emergency room immediately . "
The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Ontario Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care .
THE OVAL ON TWITTER THE OVAL ON TWITTER WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Obama notified Congress on Monday he is reducing pay increases for federal workers from 2.4 % to 2 % .
Using powers employed by his two most recent predecessors , the president cited the national unemployment rate and the budget busting federal payroll .
Obama also said that he would decide by Nov. 30 on the need to take action on " locality pay , " wages over and above the base federal rates that are determined according to geographic living costs and comparable private - sector pay .
The locality pay set to take effect on Jan. 1 , 2010 , would have added an average of 16.5 % to the wages of federal workers , meaning that the pay increase as outlined by statute would have totaled 18.9 % throughout the federal system .
In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Joe Biden , who serves as president of the Senate , Obama said he was taking action because the 2.4 % increase mandated by statute would cost $ 22.6 billion in 2010 .
He said he had budgeted only for a 2 % across - the - board increase at a cost of $ 19.9 billion .
Obama said he was invoking powers to put in place his own pay plan in times of a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the nation .
Former President George W. Bush used the authority previously , as did President Bill Clinton before him .
" With unemployment at 9.5 % in June to cite just one economic indicator , few would disagree that our country is facing serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare , " Obama 's letter said .
Obama said he did not believe his order would affect the government 's ability to attract or keep employees .
" To the contrary , " his letter said , " since any pay raise above the amount proposed in this alternative plan would likely be unfunded , agencies would have to absorb the additional cost and could have to reduce hiring to pay the higher rates . "
Bush used similar language and arguments when he intervened in federal salaries in November 2007 .

Claim :
The “ hanging man ” in a funhouse turns out to be the corpse of an outlaw .
Status : True .
Origins : In December 1976 a Universal Studios camera crew arrived at the Nu-Pike Amusement Park in Long Beach , California , to film an episode of the television action show , the
Six Million Dollar Man .
In preparing the set in a corner of the funhouse , a worker moved the “ hanging man , ” causing one of this prop ’s arms to come off .
Inside it was human bone .
This was no mere prop ; this was a dead guy !
The body was that of Elmer McCurdy , a young man who in 1911 robbed a train of $ 46 and two jugs of whiskey in Oklahoma .
He announced to the posse in pursuit of him that he would not be taken alive .
He was proved right — they killed him in the ensuing shoot - out .
McCurdy began his career as a sideshow attraction right after his embalming .
He looked so darned good dressed up in his fancy clothes that the undertaker propped him up in a corner of the funeral home ’s back room and charged locals a nickel to see “ The Bandit Who Would n’t Give Up . ”
The nickels were dropped into the corpse ’s open mouth ( from where they were later retrieved by the entreprenurial
undertaker ) .
No next of kin showed up to claim McCurdy , so the corpse kept mouthing nickels for a few years .
Carnival promoters wanted to buy the stiff , but the undertaker turned them down .
McCurdy was producing a steady income for the funeral parlor — why tamper with success ?
In 1915 , two men showed up and claimed that McCurdy was their brother .
They hauled the body away , supposedly to give him a decent burial in the family plot .
In reality , McCurdy ’s “ brothers ” were carnival promoters and this was a ruse to get the deceased away from that proprietary undertaker .
The promotors exhibited McCurdy throughout Texas under the same billing as the undertaker had given him —
“ The Bandit Who Would n’t Give Up . ”
After that tour , McCurdy popped up everywhere , including an amusement park near Mount Rushmore , lying in an open casket in a Los Angeles wax museum , and in a few low - budget films .
Before the Six Million Dollar Man crew discovered this prop to be a corpse , McCurdy had been hanging in that Long Beach funhouse for four years .
In April 1977 , the much - traveled Elmer McCurdy was laid to final rest in Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie , Oklahoma .
To make sure the corpse would not make its way back to the entertainment world , the state medical examiner ordered two cubic yards of cement poured over the coffin before the grave was closed .
McCurdy has n’t been seen hanging around amusement parks since .

Sightings : Brian Dewan ’s “ Cowboy Outlaw ” ( from his 1993 Tells The Story album ) is about McCurdy ’s post - mortem career .

Judge Goldstone visited Gaza but was barred by Israel from its territory UN human rights investigator Richard Goldstone has rejected Israel 's claim that the peace process would be harmed by his report on the offensive in Gaza .
Judge Goldstone said there was no peace process at present and Israel 's foreign minister did not want there to be one .
The Goldstone report , which has been endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council , accuses both Israel and Hamas militants of committing war crimes .
Mr Goldstone 's remarks came in a conference call with American rabbis .
" It 's a shallow , utterly false allegation , " Mr Goldstone said of Israel 's attempt to brand his report as an obstacle to peace .
" What peace process are they talking about ?
There is n't one .
The Israeli foreign minister does n't want one , " Mr Goldstone said .
" If the Israeli government set up an appropriate , open investigation , it will really be the end of the matter .
That 's where the report would end as far as Israel is concerned , " he added .
The report accuses Israel of using " disproportionate force " in Gaza
UN seeks close Gaza scrutiny Key extracts from UN statement Full UN report on Gaza war He was speaking days after Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman spoke of his belief that the Arab - Israeli conflict would not be resolved in the coming years , and people should " learn to live with it " .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 Gazans were killed in the 22 - day conflict that ended in January , but Israel puts the figure at 1,166 .
Thirteen Israelis , including three civilians , were killed .
In the report , Mr Goldstone calls for the war crimes allegations to be referred to the International Criminal Court at The Hague unless the parties to the Gaza war investigate them .
If the report comes before the UN Security Council , the US is expected to veto any call for ICC action against Israel .
Favourable On Tuesday , Israel 's Security Cabinet hardened the country 's rejection of an independent inquiry .
Earlier reports said discussion about setting up an inquiry had been on the agenda of the meeting , which brings together seven ministers with security responsibilities .
However , an official said it was blocked by Defence Minister Ehud Barak , an architect of Israel 's winter onslaught , supported by Benjamin Netanyahu , who was elected prime minister in March .
Both men have called the UN report one - sided and said it undermined Israel 's right to defend itself .
They argue internal investigations by the Israeli military are already dealing with a small number of violations .
UN adoption of Goldstone was a boost to the beleaguered Mr Abbas ( left ) " Our struggle is to delegitimize the continuing attempt to delegitimize the state of Israel .
The most important sphere we need to work in is the sphere of public opinion in the democratic world , " Mr Netanyahu was quoted telling the cabinet .
Foreign and justice ministry officials are reported to favour setting up an investigation in the hope of defusing an international row which is widely seen to have done damage to Israel 's reputation .
Instead , ministers agreed on the establishment a legal - diplomatic panel to handle any possible war crimes prosecutions against Israel or its citizens .
Separately , Palestinian Authority President and Fatah party leader Mahmoud Abbas has been holding talks in Cairo with Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak .
It is the latest in a long - running process attempting to reach a reconciliation deal between Fatah and the other main Palestinian faction , Hamas .
Aides of Mr Abbas have accused Hamas , which runs Gaza , of shirking a commitment to sign the Egyptian - mediated agreement after Fatah signed it .
Hamas says it will sign the document as long as there are no clauses added that have not been agreed .
It said its previous request for a postponement was to give it time to study new Egyptian proposals , and to comment on the Goldstone report .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Faced with the imminent expiration of a government subsidy for new buyers , U.S. home builders ' mood turned more pessimistic again in October , a trade group reported Monday .
The National Association of Home Builders / Wells Fargo sentiment index fell to 18 in October from 19 in September .
It was the first decline since June .
The index bottomed at a record - low 8 in January ; the index peaked at 72 more than four years ago .
The decline " will further boost worries about the sustainability of both the recent rise in housing investment and the rebound in prices we have witnessed , " according to Drew Matus , an economist for Bank of America 's Merrill Lynch .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected the index to rise to 20 .
See Economic Calendar .
All three components of the index fell for the first time in nearly a year .
Read the full report .
At 18 , the home - builders ' index shows that only about one in six builders has a positive view of the housing market .
Over time , the index is highly correlated with the government 's data on starts on single - family homes .
The Commerce Department will report on September housing starts on Tuesday , with economists surveyed by MarketWatch looking for a small gain to about 607,000 seasonally adjusted annual units from 598,000 in August .
Starts of single - family homes have risen 34 % since January after builders cut production far below the sales rate .
Inventories of unsold homes have now fallen to a 16 - year low .
But builders still have trouble on the supply side .
It 's taking a record amount of time -- nearly 13 months -- to sell a home after it 's completed .
Foreclosures and short - sales have boosted the supply of existing home on the market as well .
Plea for subsidy
The builders put all their hopes on Congress passing an extension or expansion of the program that gives first - time buyers up to $ 8,000 toward the purchase of a home .
Buyers need to close the sale on a home before Dec. 1 to qualify .
The expiration of the refundable tax credit " could derail the fragile recovery in housing just as it is starting to take shape , " said Joe Robson , a builder from Tulsa , Okla. , who is chairman of the contractors ' trade group .
Not only are builders facing tough times getting financing to build or complete homes , he added , but also they 're burdened by new , tougher rules for appraisals that require an independent view of home prices before mortgages can be underwritten .
Congress is considering legislation that would extend the tax credit .
The Senate Banking Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee will hold hearings on the topic this week .
There are several approaches being considered ; the most likely is a bill in the Senate that would simply extend the current program through June 30 .
Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate favor extending the subsidy , while the White House has neither pushed the idea nor is fighting it .
Critics of the tax credit say it is poorly targeted and wasteful , because many buyers who get the subsidy would have bought a home without it .
Ted Gayer , co-director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution , figures extending the credit until June 30 would boost sales by 69,000 , at a cost of $ 258,000 for each additional home sold .
Details
In September , the home - builder index rose in the tiny Northeast region , and fell in the other three regions .
The index dropped four points in the West to 14 .
Builders were more pessimistic about prospective buyers , and about current and future sales .
The current sales index fell from 18 to 17 .
The future sales index fell from 29 to 27 , the second straight decline .
The buyers ' traffic index fell three points from 17 to 14 .
" Clearly , builders are experiencing the effects of the expiring tax credit on their sales activity , since it would be virtually impossible at this point to complete a new - home sale in time to take advantage of that buyer incentive before Nov. 30 , " NAHB chief economist David Crowe said in a statement .

Many Americans have a hard time wrapping their mind around a declining currency or the hidden tax that is inflation .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve understands this and for decades has exploited this issue to slowly siphon off the buying power of the U.S. dollar .
Openly they tell the public that they are for a strong dollar policy but every action they take is guided to slowly debasing the currency .
Take for example the current stock market rally .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 56 percent from the March lows .
A stunning rally only seen one other time in history and we would need to go back to the 1930s for that .
Yet at the same time , we have seen a collapse in the U.S. dollar .
That is why oil , even though demand is relatively the same , is now back near $ 80 a barrel .
The Federal Reserve can easily strengthen the U.S. dollar .
All they would need to do is increase interest rates to reign in liquidity .
Yet this would crush the debt consumption in housing and autos .
To show you the insidious way how the value of the currency is being washed away , take a look at the recent Dow rally in terms of Euros , a more stable currency :
In U.S. dollar terms , the Dow is up 56 percent but when measured in Euros the rally only comes out to be 31 percent .
A strong rally no doubt but nothing close to the 56 percent .
We can also measure the Dow in relation to gold that can be used as another vehicle for storing wealth :
When we place the Dow in gold terms , there is no rally .
Just a slow decline .
Take this for example .
In 2000 gold hit a low of roughly $ 260 per ounce .
The Dow in January stood slightly higher than it does today at 10,900 .
So if we take this as a measure :
10,900 ( Dow January 2000 ) / $ 260 per ounce 2000 = 41.9 ounces needed to buy index value
Today the number is very different even though the Dow is virtually the same :
10,092 ( Dow October 2009 ) / $ 1,063 per ounce 2009 = 9.4 ounces needed to buy index value
That is why there is a danger in believing the current stock rally is actually as positive as the raw number may indicate .
It is not .
The U.S. dollar since 2000 has fallen by approximately 38 percent .
The Fed and U.S. Treasury have been slowly robbing the buying power of each American dollar for nearly 3 decades .
That is why even though the median income has not moved for nearly a decade , buying power has collapsed .
These are methods of making Americans poorer in more hidden ways that politically work in favor of the banking elite .
Source : Market Oracle
The median household income for the average American is approximately $ 50,000 .
Just imagine if the U.S. Treasury and Fed did n’t have these mechanism in place .
Do you think Americans would be furious that their median income would now be $ 31,250 after a decade ?
Of course .
Yet most look at their income and see it moving sideways yet they are really earning less because they are being paid in a weaker currency .
Just think of everything that has gone up in value over the past decade :
- Housing
- Autos
- Clothing
- Healthcare
- Food
- Energy
- Education
The list goes on and on .
Yet pay has stayed in place .
Some of these sectors are correcting like housing .
Yet even after the housing crash , in many areas homes are still too expensive given local area incomes .
The Dow has rallied but what has really fueled the rally is the boom in the financial sector from the March lows :
Source : Sudden Debt
While the S&P 500 is now up a stunning 62 percent from the bottom , the KBW bank share index ( black line ) is up over 160 percent .
The reason for this is the government has largely subsidized the banking sector on the backs of the American public .
Nearly 27 million are unemployed or underemployed yet we have spent trillions for what ?
The above rallies will tell you for what .
The bailouts come at a cost .
A low Fed rate hurts the dollar .
Which in turn hurts the American consumer since we are not designed as an export economy .
This can change but it will take years .
Our economy is designed to consume and we have done too much of this .
Oil is now back up reflecting our weaker dollar :
Oil is now up 128 % from the lows reached in March .
Is this because there is a surge in demand ?
Not really :
Source : Calculated Risk
This has more to do with the decline in the U.S. dollar .
This in turn means Americans are going to spend more money on energy with their weaker dollars .
Do n’t be fooled that a declining dollar is somehow good for the economy .
It helps in certain areas but is n’t a panacea like some policy makers would like to believe .
Currently we are facing dis-inflation from a decade long glut .
But once things stabilize , we can expect that our U.S. dollars are going to buy a lot less than we once thought .
The above charts point to a slowly declining standard of living if we do n’t change our policies and our way of life .
Spending beyond our means does have long - term repercussions .

As we went to press with Modern Principles : Macro we kept having to add zeroes to Zimbabwe 's peak hyperinflation rate and move it up the table of world leaders .
In our final revision , Zimbabwe 's inflation rate had hit 79,600,000,000 % per month putting Zimbabwe in second place .
We wondered whether in our second edition Zimbabwe would overtake the all time hyperinflater , Hungary ( 1945 - 1946 ) at 41,900,000,000,000,000 % per month , but it was not to be .
As it turned out , we went to press just as the hyperinflation peaked and Zimbabwe 's currency ceased to exist as a medium of exchange .
Steve Hanke at Cato has the end of the story :
Ashes are all that is left of the Zimbabwe dollar – a remnant of
paper money .
During Zimbabwe ’s hyperinflation , foreign currencies
replaced the Zimbabwe dollar in a rapid and spontaneous manner .
This
“ dollarization ” process was legalized in late January 2009 .
Even though
the Zimbabwe paper money remnant circulates alongside foreign
currencies , its real value is tiny , its use is limited , and its value
against the U.S. dollar is cut in half every two days .
Zimbabwe failed to break Hungary ’s 1946 world record for
hyperinflation .
That said , Zimbabwe did race past Yugoslavia in October
2008 .
In consequence , Zimbabwe can now lay claim to second place in the
world hyperinflation record books .
Final Postscript :
In 2009 , Zimbabwe 's central banker , Gideon Gono , was awarded the Ig Nobel prize , not , as expected , in economics but in mathematics for , in the prize committee 's words , " giving people a simple , everyday way to cope with a wide range of numbers – from very small to very big – by having his bank print bank notes with denominations ranging from one cent ( $.01 ) to one hundred trillion dollars ( $ 100,000,000,000,000 ) . "
US chemists have characterised the first stable sigma - methane complex - in which methane binds to a metal without breaking its C? - H bonds .
The complex provides insight into the activation of unreactive alkanes and the possibility of expanding the use of methane to eventually replace oil as a feedstock for the chemical industry .
Maurice Brookhart , Cynthia Schauer and colleagues at the University of North Carolina and University of Washington , US , devised new ways of preparing rhodium - methane complexes that overcame many of the difficulties encountered by previous studies , and found exactly the right combination of metal and ligands to stabilise the normally fleeting compounds .
" We ’ve been waiting for this since 1975 " - Robin Perutz
’ We cheated a little bit , ’ says Schauer , explaining that the team used a strong acid to protonate a rhodium methyl ( Rh - CH 3 ) complex and form the methane ligand within the coordination sphere of the metal centre , rather than trying to introduce methane from the solution .
’ Methane is a very weak ligand , ’ says Schauer , ’ and it would need to displace something else to coordinate to the metal , but [ our complex ] spits out the methane [ when it is protonated ] , so we do n’t need to displace anything . ’
’ We ’ve been waiting for this since 1975 , ’ says Robin Perutz from the University of York in the UK , and one of the researchers who first found evidence for such sigma - methane complexes .
’ There has been a lot of indirect evidence since , but observing the real thing has eluded people . ’
’ Perhaps with hindsight people were looking in the wrong place , ’ Perutz adds , ’ this is a positively charged complex , whereas most people were looking for neutral complexes . ’
He describes that the group ’s protonation strategy as ’ a real breakthrough ’ as it gets over the problem that methane is not very soluble in conventional solvents , even at very high pressure , so it is difficult to get a useful concentration in solution .
Such sigma - methane complexes , says Schauer , have long been proposed as intermediates in the coordination and activation of methane in catalytic processes that convert it into more industrially useful chemicals such as methanol or synthesis gas ( a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide ) .
Understanding how methane interacts with metals - and how that leads to reactivity of the C - H bonds - could lead to new catalysts that work under much less extreme conditions than the current Fischer - Tropsch or Mobil - type processes for converting methane to more complex chemicals .
Key to that understanding is the ability to study the structure of the complexes , and this is the first time a complex has been made that lasted long enough in solution to do that , explains Bill Jones from the University of Rochester , US .
’ They have been detected transiently in laser flash studies , but those lasted for less than a microsecond , ’ says Jones .
The lifetime of several hours achieved by Brookhart ’s group is a key advance that allowed detailed nuclear magnetic resonance and isotope labelling studies , and thus fresh insights into the structure and chemistry of the sigma - methane complex .

Looks like Verizon was a bit stung by some of the commentary it has gotten in response to a filing it sent the Federal Communications Commission this week .
The wireless giant is " OK with low bar when defining broadband , " ran a headline on Wednesday in Broadband / DSL Reports .
" ISPs , who do n't want their network shortcomings highlighted , want the bar rather low , " noted the story .
" While yesterday we mentioned that the cable industry thinks 768 k bps / 200 kbps is just peachy as a definition , AT&T and Verizon are also just fine with a very low bar . "
This observation drew the ire of David Young , Verizon Vice President for Regulatory Affairs .
" There seems to be some confusion , " around this issue he wrote on Verizon 's policy blog this morning , linking to the DSL Reports piece .
" The implication here is that we want to keep the speed set low so we wo n't have to upgrade our networks . "
" From where we stand , " Young added , " this is clearly absurd . "
Aggressive goals
Actually , DSL Reports did n't spell that out in the post , but obviously the implication is what 's on Verizon 's mind .
The company was answering the FCC 's call for comments on a definition of broadband .
The agency suggests just understanding it based on advertised speeds obscures the fact that ISP performance often falls short of that , due to a variety of factors : logistics , traffic loading , jitter , and other problems .
And the FCC wants to know if it should take an " application based approach " to the definition question — in other words , should we associate a tag for broadband with the ability to use certain devices and features ?
As Young 's defense points out , Verizon started out the filing by urging the FCC to establish " aggressive , long - term targets " that could be revised from time to time to take technological and consumer use change into account .
" For example , setting a broad objective of moving toward a downstream target of 50 M bps for fixed services and 5 M bps for mobile services would be an aggressive longer term goal , recognizing that as the marketplace continues to develop there will continue to be variability in the levels of service available in particular areas for the foreseeable future based on a range of technological , geographic , economic and other factors . "
And the blog post notes that Verizon is offering some very high - speed services these days : fiber to the home at 50 M bps down and 20 M bps up in some areas .
But , as for a definition of broadband now , the filing says it wants the FCC to maintain a " straightforward baseline definition of broadband based on advertised speed " — specifically , " advertised speeds of at least 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream . "
Why ?
First : " There is substantial value in maintaining a threshold that will enable the Commission to identify a baseline of areas where first - generation broadband services are available , " the company suggests .
Second : these numbers would offer the Commission and policymakers a " full and meaningful view of the broadband marketplace generally . "
They are , after all , what the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce are using in considering applications for broadband stimulus money .
And finally , " one of the significant benefits of this approach is its simplicity , making it relatively easy for policymakers and the public to understand and work with . "
You could , of course , argue that the problem with 768/200 is that the pace of consumer demand for video and audio on the Internet may soon make it irrelevant as a real metric for understanding broadband adoption .
But like AT&T and Comcast , Verizon also told the FCC that it does n't like this " application based approach " business .
" Given the variation , and continued evolution , in applications , the Commission should not define broadband strictly by reference to the requirements of applications , " Verizon writes .
In fact , the Commission should urge app developers to " fully and clearly to disclose to consumers the foreseeable effects of their applications on a subscriber ’s broadband service , on the consumers ’ devices or other applications , on the broadband network , and on other broadband subscribers .
Such information would facilitate informed consumer choice . "
Evolving over time
The big telcos are obviously feeling just a bit tender about all this definitional stuff .
AT&T sent
Ars a comment on our last story on this proceeding .
In it , we noted that the company suggested that the FCC define the " minimal set of applications " that Americans need to be integrated into the Internet economy .
" For residential customers , that minimal set of applications should include the ability to exchange e-mails , participate in instant messaging , and engage in basic Web - browsing , " AT&T recommended .
" It also should include the ability to engage in Internet - based education programs , interact with Internet - based government services , and participate in online energy , healthcare , and public - safety programs . "
An AT&T spokesperson explained to us that the company understands that " essential applications will , of course , evolve and expand over time to include things such as real - time video . "
And the telco 's filing did acknowledge that , to a point .
" Higher speeds may , in fact , become a basic necessity ; the way we conduct business and run our economy may become more dependent on real - time video or VoIP , " it noted .
" That future evolution should not stand in the way of unserved or underserved Americans getting what they need today , however .
Here , the Commission should define broadband in a way that facilitates achievement and evaluation of immediate progress towards universal connectivity . "
( Those italics are AT& T's . )
The question , of course , is who gets to define what kind of " immediate " broadband services Americans need " today " ?
Verizon ?
AT&T ? The FCC ?
You ?
This definitional proceeding closes after Tuesday , September 8 .
You can upload comments to the FCC here ( the docket number for field 1 , " proceeding , " is 09 - 51 ) .
Multiple missions have been sent to Mars with the hopes of testing the surface of the planet for life – or the conditions that could create life – on the Red Planet .
The question of whether life in the form of bacteria ( or something even more exotic ! ) exists on Mars is hotly debated , and still requires a resolute yes or no .
Experiments done right here on Earth that simulate the conditions on Mars and their effects on terrestrial bacteria show that it is entirely possible for certain strains of bacteria to weather the harsh environment of Mars .
A team led by Giuseppe Galletta of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Padova simulated the conditions present on Mars , and then introduced several strains of bacteria into the simulator to record their survival rate .
The simulator – named LISA ( Laboratorio Italiano Simulazione Ambienti ) – reproduced surface conditions on Mars , with temperatures ranging from +23 to - 80 degrees Celsius ( 73 to - 112 Fahrenheit ) , a 95 % CO2 atmosphere at low pressures of 6 to 9 millibars , and very strong ultraviolet radiation .
The results – some of the strains of bacteria were shown to survive up to 28 hours under these conditions , an amazing feat given that there is nowhere on the surface of the Earth where the temperatures get this low or the ultraviolet radiation is as strong as on Mars .
Two of the strains of bacteria tested – Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus Nealsonii – are both commonly used in laboratory tests of extreme environmental factors and their effects on bacteria because of their ability to produce endospores when stressed .
Endospores are internal structures of the bacteria that encapsulate the DNA and part of the cytoplasm in a thick wall , to prevent the DNA from being damaged .
Galletta ’s team found that the vegetative cells of the bacteria died after only a few minutes , due to the low water content and high UV radiation .
The endospores , however , were able to survive between 4 and 28 hours , even when exposed directly to the UV light .
The researchers simulated the dusty surface of Mars by blowing volcanic ash or dust of red iron oxide on the samples .
When covered with the dust , the samples showed an even higher percentage of survival , meaning that it ’s possible for a hardy bacterial strain to survive underneath the surface of the soil for very long periods of time .
The deeper underneath the soil an organism is , the more hospitable the conditions become ; water content increases , and the UV radiation is absorbed from the soil above .
Given these findings , and all of the rich data that came in last year from the Phoenix lander – especially the discovery of perchlorates – continuing the search for life on Mars still seems a plausible endeavor .
Though this surely is n’t a confirmation of life on Mars , it shows that even life that is n’t adapted to the conditions of the planet could potentially hold out against the extreme nature of the environment there , and bodes well for the possibility of Martian bacterial life forms .
The LISA simulations also indicate the importance of avoiding cross-contamination of bacteria from Earth to Mars on any scientific missions that travel to the planet .
In other words , when we finally are able to definitively test for life on our neighboring planet , we do n’t want to find out that our Earth bacteria have killed off all the native lifeforms !

The thing about the bully pulpit is that Presidents can make the most fantastic claims and it takes days to sort the reality from the myths .
So as a public service , let 's try to navigate the , er , remarkable Medicare discussion that President Obama delivered on Wednesday .
It is n't easy .
Mr. Obama began by depicting a crisis in the entitlement state , noting that " our health - care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers , " especially Medicare .
Unless we find a way to cauterize this fiscal hemorrhage , " we will eventually be spending more on Medicare than every other government program combined .
Put simply , our health - care program is our deficit problem .
Nothing else even comes close . "
On this score he 's right .
Medicare 's unfunded liability — the gap between revenues and promised benefits — is currently some $ 37 trillion over the next 75 years .
Yet the President uses this insolvency as an argument to justify the creation of another health - care entitlement , this time for most everyone under age 65 .
It 's like a variation on the old Marx Brothers routine : " The soup is terrible and the portions are too small . "
As astonishing , Mr. Obama claimed he can finance universal health care without adding " one dime to the deficit , now or in the future , period , " in large part by pumping money out of Medicare .
The $ 880 billion Senate plan he all but blessed this week would cut Medicare by as much as $ 500 billion , mainly by cutting what Mr. Obama called " waste and abuse . "
Perhaps this is related to the " waste and abuse " that Congresses of both parties have targeted dozens of times without ever cutting it .
Apparently this time Mr. Obama means it , though he said this does n't mean seniors should listen to " demagoguery and distortion " about Medicare cuts .
That 's because Medicare is a " sacred trust , " and the President swore to " ensure that you — America 's seniors — get the benefits you 've been promised . "

[ This article is excerpted from Human Action chapter XVII , " Indirect Exchange . "
An MP3 audio file of this article , read by Jeff Riggenbach , is available for download . ]
In the marketability of the various commodities and services there prevail considerable differences .
There are goods for which it is not difficult to find applicants ready to disburse the highest recompense which , under the given state of affairs , can possibly be obtained , or a recompense only slightly smaller .
There are other goods for which it is very hard to find a customer quickly , even if the vendor is ready to be content with a compensation much smaller than he could reap if he could find another aspirant whose demand is more intense .
It is these differences in the marketability of the various commodities and services which created indirect exchange .
A man who at the instant cannot acquire what he wants to get for the conduct of his own household or business , or who does not yet know what kind of goods he will need in the uncertain future , comes nearer to his ultimate goal if he exchanges a less marketable good he wants to trade against a more marketable one .
It may also happen that the physical properties of the merchandise he wants to give away ( as , for instance , its perishability or the costs incurred by its storage or similar circumstances ) impel him not to wait longer .
Sometimes he may be prompted to hurry in giving away the good concerned because he is afraid of a deterioration of its market value .
In all such cases he improves his own situation in acquiring a more marketable good , even if this good is not suitable to satisfy directly any of his own needs .
A medium of exchange is a good which people acquire neither for their own consumption nor for employment in their own production activities , but with the intention of exchanging it at a later date against those goods which they want to use either for consumption or for production .
Money is a medium of exchange .
It is the most marketable good which people acquire because they want to offer it in later acts of interpersonal exchange .
Money is the thing which serves as the generally accepted and commonly used medium of exchange .
This is its only function .
All the other functions which people ascribe to money are merely particular aspects of its primary and sole function , that of a medium of exchange .
Media of exchange are economic goods .
They are scarce ; there is a demand for them .
There are on the market people who desire to acquire them and are ready to exchange goods and services against them .
Media of exchange have value in exchange .
People make sacrifices for their acquisition ; they pay " prices " for them .
The peculiarity of these prices lies merely in the fact that they can not be expressed in terms of money .
In reference to the vendible goods and services we speak of prices or of money prices .
In reference to money we speak of its purchasing power with regard to various vendible goods .
There exists a demand for media of exchange because people want to keep a store of them .
Every member of a market society wants to have a definite amount of money in his pocket or box , a cash holding or cash balance of a definite height .
Sometimes he wants to keep a larger cash holding , sometimes a smaller ; in exceptional cases he may even renounce any cash holding .
At any rate , the immense majority of people aim not only to own various vendible goods ; they want no less to hold money .
Their cash holding is not merely a residuum , an unspent margin of their wealth .
It is not an unintentional remainder left over after all intentional acts of buying and selling have been consummated .
Its amount is determined by a deliberate demand for cash .
And as with all other goods it is the changes in the relation between demand for and supply of money that bring about changes in the exchange ratio between money and the vendible goods .
Every piece of money is owned by one of the members of the market economy .
The transfer of money from the control of one actor into that of another is temporally immediate and continuous .
There is no fraction of time in between in which the money is not a part of an individual 's or a firm 's cash holding , but just in " circulation . "
It is unsound to distinguish between circulating and idle money .
It is no less faulty to distinguish between circulating money and hoarded money .
What is called hoarding is a height of cash holding which — according to the personal opinion of an observer — exceeds what is deemed normal and adequate .
However , hoarding is cash holding .
Hoarded money is still money and it serves in the hoards the same purposes which it serves in cash holdings called normal .
He who hoards money believes that some special conditions make it expedient to accumulate a cash holding which exceeds the amount he himself would keep under different conditions , or other people keep , or an economist censuring his action considers appropriate .
That he acts in this way influences the configuration of the demand for money in the same way in which every " normal " demand influences it .
Many economists avoid applying the terms demand and supply in the sense of demand for and supply of money for cash holding because they fear a confusion with the current terminology as used by the bankers .
It is , in fact , customary to call demand for money the demand for short - term loans and supply of money the supply of such loans .
Accordingly one calls the market for short - term loans the money market .
One says money is scarce if there prevails a tendency toward a rise in the rate of interest for short - term loans , and one says money is plentiful if the rate of interest for such loans is decreasing .
These modes of speech are so firmly entrenched that it is out of the question to venture to discard them .
But they have favored the spread of fateful errors .
They made people confound the notions of money and of capital and believe that increasing the quantity of money could lower the rate of interest lastingly .
But it is precisely the crassness of these errors which makes it unlikely that the terminology suggested could create any misunderstanding .
It is hard to assume that economists could err with regard to such fundamental issues .
Others maintained that one should not speak of the demand for and supply of money because the aims of those demanding money differ from the aims of those demanding vendible commodities .
Commodities , they say , are demanded ultimately for consumption , while money is demanded in order to be given away in further acts of exchange .
This objection is no less invalid .
The use which people make of a medium of exchange consists eventually in its being given away .
But first of all they are eager to accumulate a certain amount of it in order to be ready for the moment in which a purchase may be accomplished .
Precisely because people do not want to provide for their own needs right at the instant at which they give away the goods and services they themselves bring to the market , precisely because they want to wait or are forced to wait until propitious conditions for buying appear , they barter not directly but indirectly through the interposition of a medium of exchange .
The fact that money is not worn out by the use one makes of it and that it can render its services practically for an unlimited length of time is an important factor in the configuration of its supply .
But it does not alter the fact that the appraisement of money is to be explained in the same way as the appraisement of all other goods : by the demand on the part of those who are eager to acquire a definite quantity of it .
Economists have tried to enumerate the factors which within the whole economic system may increase or decrease the demand for money .
Such factors are : the population figure ; the extent to which the individual households provide for their own needs by autarkic production and the extent to which they produce for other people 's needs , selling their products and buying for their own consumption on the market ; the distribution of business activity and the settlement of payments over the various seasons of the year ; institutions for the settlement of claims and counterclaims by mutual cancellation , such as clearinghouses .
All these factors indeed influence the demand for money and the height of the various individuals ' and firms ' cash holding .
But they influence them only indirectly by the role they play in the considerations of people concerning the determination of the amount of cash balances they deem appropriate .
What decides the matter is always the value judgments of the men concerned .
The various actors make up their minds about what they believe the adequate height of their cash holding should be .
They carry out their resolution by renouncing the purchase of commodities , securities , and interest - bearing claims , and by selling such assets or conversely by increasing their purchases .
With money , things are not different from what they are with regard to all other goods and services .
The demand for money is determined by the conduct of people intent upon acquiring it for their cash holding .
Another objection raised against the notion of the demand for money was this :
The marginal utility of the money unit decreases much more slowly than that of the other commodities ; in fact its decrease is so slow that it can be practically ignored .
With regard to money nobody ever says that his demand is satisfied , and nobody ever forsakes an opportunity to acquire more money provided the sacrifice required is not too great .
It is therefore impermissible to consider the demand for money as limited .
The very notion of an unlimited demand is , however , contradictory .
This popular reasoning is entirely fallacious .
It confounds the demand for money for cash holding with the desire for more wealth as expressed in terms of money .
He who says that his thirst for more money can never be quenched , does not mean to say that his cash holding can never be too large .
What he really means is that he can never be rich enough .
If additional money flows into his hands , he will not use it for an increase of his cash balance or he will use only a part of it for this purpose .
He will expend the surplus either for instantaneous consumption or for investment .
Nobody ever keeps more money than he wants to have as cash holding .
The insight that the exchange ratio between money on the one hand and the vendible commodities and services on the other is determined , in the same way as the mutual exchange ratios between the various vendible goods , by demand and supply was the essence of the quantity theory of money .
This theory is essentially an application of the general theory of supply and demand to the special instance of money .
Its merit was the endeavor to explain the determination of money 's purchasing power by resorting to the same reasoning which is employed for the explanation of all other exchange ratios .
Its shortcoming was that it resorted to a holistic interpretation .
It looked at the total supply of money in the Volkswirtschaft and not at the actions of the individual men and firms .
An outgrowth of this erroneous point of view was the idea that there prevails a proportionality in the changes of the — total — quantity of money and of money prices .
But the older critics failed in their attempts to explode the errors inherent in the quantity theory and to substitute a more satisfactory theory for it .
They did not fight what was wrong in the quantity theory ; they attacked , on the contrary , its nucleus of truth .
They were intent upon denying that there is a causal relation between the movements of prices and those of the quantity of money .
This denial led them into a labyrinth of errors , contradictions , and nonsense .
Modern monetary theory takes up the thread of the traditional quantity theory as far as it starts from the cognition that changes in the purchasing power of money must be dealt with according to the principles applied to all other market phenomena and that there exists a connection between the changes in the demand for and supply of money on the one hand and those of purchasing power on the other .
In this sense one may call the modern theory of money an improved variety of the quantity theory .
Birds of a feather drink together :
The three clever pigeons who help each other sup from a water fountain
They obviously have a better class of pigeon Down Under .
Instead of pecking around on the filthy pavements among cigarette butts and chewing gum , they prefer to sip filtered water and go to great lengths for a bath .
The trio pictured here , in Brisbane , Queensland , appear to have worked out a clever system of adapting the water fountain built by humans for their own pigeon purposes .
Coo-l : drink :
As one pigeon sucks up water ( left ) , another stands on the lever ( right ) and the third keeps watch
After waiting for the fountain to be free , one bird jumped on the lever and pushed it down to fill up the bowl , while another kept watch and the third splashed in .
When it had drunk its fill and cleaned its feathers , the third pigeon hopped up to the handle and let his friends have a go .
The three birds continued their bathing ritual for ten minutes , entertaining passers - by in Post Office Square , in Brisbane 's bustling business district .
Unlike other birds , who take a sip of water and throw back their heads to swallow , pigeons suck up water using their beaks like straws .
Though they are n't very popular in this part of the world and are referred to as rats of the sky ,
Editor 's note : Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia , is the Republican whip in the U.S. House of Representatives .
( CNN ) --
Given the heated rhetoric and sharp partisan divides that have characterized this year 's debate , it 's easy to forget that there are several key reforms in health care that Democrats and Republicans can agree on .
Unfortunately , congressional leaders in control of the legislative agenda seem to be making this very mistake .
A bipartisan deal can still be salvaged , but only if Congress focuses on common - sense principles to keep health care costs in check , preserve the doctor patient relationship and give Americans more options for affordable , high quality health care .
Earlier this month I held a meeting with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer to discuss the prospects for securing a bipartisan agreement .
The meeting was constructive and the leader made clear his preference to work with Republicans wherever possible .
Yet despite his good will , House Democrats remain intent on bringing forward a bill -- H.R. 3200 -- riddled with toxic and controversial provisions that alienate Republicans and moderate Democrats .
The most prominent poison pill is the government - run plan , which the majority has disingenuously sold to the public as a way to boost competition among insurers and give Americans more choices .
In reality , it will do the opposite .
Private insurance companies simply cannot compete against a government with the leverage to set the prices it pays to health care providers ( the downside , of course , is that care the government is willing to pay for will be rationed and of lower quality ) .
But the public option is not the only reason the public has soured on Congress ' health care efforts .
This nearly $ 1 trillion legislation , much like the Finance Committee bill in the Senate , dishonestly resorts to a host of budget gimmicks to give the veneer of deficit neutrality over the next decade .
For example , while the new regime 's taxes and benefit cuts kick in immediately , the government spending does n't begin in earnest until 2015 .
Meanwhile , the House bill also contains crippling penalties on small businesses that do not offer their employees a health care plan that government officials in Washington deem acceptable .
It 's as if it were n't already difficult enough for our job creators , entrepreneurs and small businesses to retain and hire workers .
The inclusion of such radioactive measures risks squandering a needed opportunity to come together in bipartisan fashion on three critical reforms that would strengthen the health care system :
More affordable health care options :
There is bipartisan consensus that when individuals lose or change jobs , their families should still have access to affordable health coverage .
Both political parties have put forward solutions to help Americans access health insurance at lower prices , the same way that large businesses and labor unions do .
Pre-existing conditions :
In his speech to a joint session of Congress , President Obama highlighted state high risk pools as a real solution for patients with pre-existing conditions .
Republicans support reforms , such as Universal Access Programs , to expand and strengthen these critical coverage mechanisms for those with pre-existing conditions .
Reforming and expanding these programs would not only open up the insurance market for consumers with pre-existing conditions , but also change how insurance products are priced , resulting in lower health care costs for Americans .
Medical liability reform : Implementing meaningful liability reform is a no- brainer that will eliminate billions of dollars of waste in defensive medicine .
The fear of frivolous lawsuits is pervasive in the medical community , and the status quo is untenable .
Congress should also calm public angst by making three simple guarantees .
First , the government will not assume decision - making authority on choices that should be left to doctors and patients .
Second , there will be no forced government rationing of care and no discrimination of any type .
Third , the cost of health care reform must not break the bank .
Congress can accomplish the dual goals of improving the quality of care in America and trimming the ranks of the uninsured if we focus on what Democrats and Republicans can agree on , rather than on our differences .
It 's not too late for the majority to change course .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Cantor .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Recent bankruptcy filings by small U.S. businesses show a trend that could complicate lenders ’ efforts to identify at - risk borrowers , a new study reveals .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
PayNet Inc , which provides analytic tools to the commercial credit industry , looked at 750 small business bankruptcy filers and found 50 percent were current with one or more of their lenders when they threw in the towel and sought protection from their creditors .
“ Approximately half the lenders never saw it coming , ” PayNet President Bill Phelan said .
“ They were blindsided . ”
PayNet will officially release the study on Monday at the annual convention of the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association in San Diego .
The 750 companies PayNet studied collectively owed $ 58 million in loans , leases and lines of credit -- a tiny fraction of the 100,000 small businesses that PayNet said have filed for bankruptcy over the past year with an estimated $ 10 billion in obligations outstanding .
But the speed and silence with which so many of them went under marks a phenomenon that is deeply worrying to lenders , who historically have managed default risk by closely monitoring delinquencies .
In this downturn , however , some borrowers are refusing to telegraph their distress before they throw in the towel .
“ They pay and pay and pay , ” Phelan said , “ and then they file for bankruptcy . ”
PayNet ’s study found , however , that most of the companies -- even those that continued to pay most of their creditors on time right until they filed -- had at least one account that fell into delinquency before they sought court protection .
So lenders who could see how borrowers were performing on other obligations enjoy a better chance of identifying at - risk borrowers , PayNet .
“ Just because you ’re getting paid does n’t mean everything ’s OK , ” Phelan said .
“ It ’s not the full picture . ”
PayNet collects real - time loan information , such as originations and delinquencies , from more than 225 leading U.S. capital equipment lenders .
PayNet ’s proprietary database of small business loan performance encompasses more than 16 million current and historic contracts worth over $ 700 billion .
As North Korea tests its expanding arsenal of deadly weapons , millions of its most vulnerable people face grave food shortages .
SEOUL — North Korean families are feeling the pinch following Pyongyang 's refusal of U.S. food aid earlier this year , with the United Nations saying it already sees a humanitarian crisis in the isolated Stalinist state .
" We do believe there ’s a humanitarian crisis right now , especially for some of the more remote rural regions of the northernmost part of North Korea , " World Food Program ( WFP ) senior spokesman Paul Risely said .
The WFP says it is currently able to operate at around only 15 percent of its capacity , feeding fewer than 1.5 million of the 6.2 million people already identified as in need of food aid this year .
" These are very vulnerable people , " Risely said .
" These are children in schools , children in orphanages , children in remote villages . "
" And they are women and elderly people , especially pregnant women and women with large households and women who are nursing children , " he said , adding , " We do not have enough funding from donors . "
" The United States food , when it was being provided , was the backbone of the food that the World Food Program provided over the more than 100 different counties [ in North Korea ] in which we are permitted to operate , " Risely said .
North Korea has suffered severe food shortages for more than a decade , and frequently faces accusations that international food aid has been taken away from the hungriest North Koreans and diverted to the military and ruling party elite .
Rising tensions
Pyongyang also barred the WFP from carrying out a planned nutritional survey in October 2008 , which the agency said was crucial if the level of need in the population were to be identified .
Risely cited a clear need for rice , corn , biscuits , noodles , and powdered milk formula for children in the worst - hit areas .
" Without that food , the problem of malnutrition , and the problem of wasting and stunting and other food - insecurity problems that are caused , will only increase and will only continue , especially for children in these areas , " he added .
North Korea cut off a planned U.S. - funded food aid program of 500,000 metric tonnes in March amid growing bilateral tensions with the United States .
The move followed disputes involving the use of Korean - speaking aid workers , who would be used to ensure the food reached the people for whom it was intended , which the WFP says is a pre-condition for its involvement .
WFP spokeswoman Lena Savelli said the agency is already seeing signs of stress from food shortages in North Korea .
No talks with U.S .
" Households [ are ] cutting down the number of meals they ’re eating , eating more vegetables and wild foods as opposed to cereals , " Savelli said , adding that more families with vegetable plots in the countryside are now beginning to take food to urban relatives , who are unable to grow their own .
But a U.S. official said Washington would still be prepared to continue to distribute U.S. food aid under certain conditions , regardless of political mood swings between Pyongyang and Washington .
" We would be open to consideration of resumption of the program , ” the official said , if the resources were available and if Washington were sure the aid was reaching its intended recipients .
“ Then we would be open to that discussion , " the official said .
But he said no dialogue had been forthcoming on any resumption of U.S. food aid .
" They ’ve told us that for the time being they ’re not interested in talking about it , " the U.S. official said .
" But they ’ve got our phone number . "

To address the in vivo impact of cigarette smoke ( CS ) exclusively on host innate defense mechanisms , we took advantage of Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) , which has an innate immune system but lacks adaptive immune function .
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) clearance from intestines of C. elegans was dampened by CS .
Microarray analysis identified 6 candidate genes with a 2 - fold or greater reduction after CS exposure , that have a human orthologue , and that may participate in innate immunity .
To confirm a role of CS - down - regulated genes in the innate immune response to PA , RNA interference ( RNAi ) by feeding was carried out in C. elegans to inhibit the gene of interest , followed by PA infection to determine if the gene affected innate immunity .
Inhibition of lbp - 7 , which encodes a lipid binding protein , resulted in increased levels of intestinal PA .
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were shown to express mRNA of human Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 ( FABP - 5 ) , the human orthologue of lpb - 7 .
Interestingly , FABP - 5 mRNA levels from human smokers with COPD were significantly lower ( p = 0.036 ) than those from smokers without COPD .
Furthermore , FABP - 5 mRNA levels were up - regulated ( 7 - fold ) after bacterial ( i.e. , Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) infection in primary human bronchial epithelial cell culture ( air - liquid interface culture ) .
Funding : The C. elegans part of this study was funded by a University of Colorado Innovative Study Award .
Human bronchial brushing work was funded by Sepracor Inc www.sepracor.com and the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute ( FAMRI ) www.famri.org .
The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
To discover novel innate immune genes regulated by cigarette smoke in humans , we used microarray and RNAi approaches to study cigarette smoke - exposed C. elegans with or without PA infection .
We infected C. elegans with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 , a clinical isolate strain originally obtained from a human burn patient [ 5 ] .
Non-infected animals were fed E. coli OP50 , a non-pathogenic bacterial strain that is the standard laboratory food source used for C. elegans [ 6 ] .
Using the above techniques , we successfully identified lbp - 7 , a lipid binding protein , which was down - regulated after CS exposure and played a role in innate immunity .
Interestingly the human orthologue of this protein , FABP - 5 , was also present in human bronchial epithelial cells , was up - regulated in response to bacterial infection , and was down - regulated in COPD patients as compared to healthy smokers .
Human COPD patients show an impaired host innate immune response against airway bacterial infections [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
Innate immunity is the oldest host defense mechanism and is highly conserved across many species .
In an attempt to look for an in vivo model , without the interference of the adaptive immune system , we decided to use the nematode Caenorhabditits elegans ( C. elegans ) .
This organism lacks an adaptive immune system , but possesses a similar innate immune response to humans , including a toll - like receptor , several defensin - like proteins and other highly conserved innate immune mechanisms .
C. elegans mounts an innate immune response against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) – one of the known pathogens in COPD [ 3 ] .
Additionally , C. elegans responds to nicotine , a major component of cigarette smoke , in a manner similar to that of mammals .
Further , it converts nicotine to cotinine [ 4 ] , showing that it breaks down nicotine in a similar manner to mammals and giving us a way to demonstrate that the animals are absorbing the smoke .
Thus , C. elegans may be a good model to mimic human innate immune response to cigarette smoke exposure and bacterial infection .
Finally , C. elegans has a short life span of approximately 14 days , allowing short duration smoke studies to cover a larger percentage of the life span .
C. elegans is very well studied with all cells being fate - mapped .
Its genome has been fully sequenced , and clones for RNA interference ( RNAi ) are available for most of the genes .
lbp - 7 expression was up - regulated by PA infection in C. elegans ( see above ) .
We therefore monitored FABP - 5 expression in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells to see if the human orthologue was similarly regulated by pathogen .
Since PA in cultured cells would lead to cell death within several hours of infection [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , we infected cultured human bronchial epithelial cells under the air - liquid interface culture ( ALI ) with Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( Mp ) .
Mp has been shown to be involved in COPD and can infect cells for long periods of time ( up to 14 days ) without causing cell death , reflecting the chronic nature of the infection in humans [ 17 ] .
Cell culture data from cells of various patient types ( COPD , smoker and non-smoker controls ) were merged following independent analysis showing similar trends .
Previously , we have shown that after weeks in culture cells tend to lose their phenotypic distinctions [ 13 ] .
Using real - time quantitative PCR we found that FABP - 5 expression was up - regulated 7 fold in response to Mp infection ( Figure 5B ) .
FABP5 , therefore , does appear to be involved in the human airway innate immune response .
To examine the relevance of genes discovered using the C. elegans model to human airway cell biology , we examined expression of FABP - 5 ( UniProtKB / Swiss - Prot : FABP5 _HUMAN , Ensembl transcript ID : ENST00000297258 , Ensembl protein id : ENSP00000297258 ) , a human orthologue of lbp - 7 , in primary human bronchial epithelial cells obtained through bronchial brushings from smokers with ( n = 5 ) or without ( n = 4 ) COPD .
The purity of epithelial cells was greater than 95 % based on cell morphology and staining with cytokeratin peptide 18 on cell cytospin preparations ( data not shown ) .
First , FABP - 5 mRNA was detected in epithelial cells from both groups of human subjects .
Second , the mRNA levels of FABP - 5 were significantly lower ( about 70 % ) in smokers with COPD than smokers without COPD ( Figure 5A ) .
lbp -7's role in host defense and CS response is further supported by our microarray data , which shows a 2.5 fold reduction of expression of lbp - 7 in CS +
PA treated animals compared to PA alone .
This microarray result was confirmed by qRT - PCR , which showed approximately a 50 % reduction in lbp - 7 mRNA levels by CS when comparing CS +
PA treatment to PA treatment alone ( lbp - 7 mRNA levels : 1.321±0.205 [ ( − ) + PA ] vs. 0.679±0.193 [ CS +PA ] , n = 5 , p = 0.028 ) .
RNAi-treated animals were then infected with PA for 24 hrs .
Inhibition of lbp - 7 significantly increased intestinal PA14 load , when compared to a control RNAi treatment ( Figure 4B ) .
RNAi - induced reduction of lpb - 7 gene expression was confirmed by real - time quantitative PCR ( qRT - PCR ) ( Figure 4A ) .
Specificity of the lbp - 7 RNAi was further confirmed by qRT - PCR for lbp - 8 , a closely related family member of lbp - 7 .
No significant differences of lbp - 8 mRNA levels were seen between the lbp - 7 knockdown and the control ( lbp - 8 mRNA levels : 0.073±0.012 vs. 0.052±0.012 , n = 3 , p = 0.257 ) .
RNAi of the other 4 genes did not result in a significant change in intestinal PA load as compared to the control RNAi treatment ( data not shown ) .
By feeding the nematodes a strain of E. coli expressing dsRNA of a single gene ( RNAi by feeding [ 13 ] ) , we were able to inhibit each of these five candidate genes to test them for a role in host defense .
The five available clones listed above the double line in Table 1 are : lipid binding protein 7 [ lbp - 7 , ( worm base ID : T22G5.2 ) ] , M60.2 , D2405.8 ( which is homologous to a human TNF -α induced protein ) , F44E5.4 ( an hsp70 like protein ) , and tir - 1 ( a homolog of mammalian SARM and regulator of C. elegans innate immunity [ 14 ] ) .
To select genes for further study , we selected only genes with human orthologues .
Of these , we then selected genes that showed a change in response to infection and either exhibited a change in response to CS , or that had been previously hypothesized to be involved in human COPD or innate immunity .
We pared these genes to 20 final candidate genes ( Table 1 ) .
From this list of 20 genes , we selected 5 genes to investigate further in RNAi- mediated gene inhibition studies ( five genes listed above the double line in Table 1 ) .
These final five candidate genes were selected based on availability of the RNAi clones for the genes that showed at least a 3 - fold change from both PA and CS as well as hsp -70 and the TNFα induced protein based on previous publication [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
We exposed C. elegans to either CS or PA and monitored changes in gene expression using microarrays as described in the Materials and Methods .
Significant changes in genes expression were identified using the MAS5 algorithm [ 9 ] .
We identified 117 genes whose expression was down - regulated ≥ 2 - fold by CS exposure ( Table S1 ) , while only 19 genes were up - regulated by CS ≥ 2 - fold ( Table S2 ) .
In contrast to CS exposure , exposure to PA led to the up - regulation of 156 genes ≥ 2 - fold ( Table S3 ) and the down - regulation of only 65 genes ( Table S4 ) .
Of the 156 genes up - regulated by PA , 5 have been reported previously to be involved in the C. elegans response to PA during a shorter ( 4 or 8 hrs ) infection [ 10 ] .
Table 1 shows these five genes in bold .
To confirm that the increase in intestinal PA load following CS exposure was due to infection and not simply due to the animals eating more , we analyzed pharyngeal pumping rates 24 and 48 hrs post CS exposure , the period when C. elegans would have been infected with PA .
As the nematode eats , it is easy to observe the pumping pharynx , and the rate of pumping has been shown to correlate to the amount of food consumed [ 8 ] .
No differences in pumping rates were found at 48 hr post - CS exposure between CS - exposed and control animals on either OP50 or PA14 plates ( CS+OP50 , 210±6 pumps / min vs. air + OP50 , 216±6 pumps / min , p = 0.58 and CS + PA , 184±4 pumps / min vs. Air + PA , 186±4 pumps / min , p = 0.87 ) ( 15 animals scored on each of three plates per condition ) .
However , at 24 hr post - CS exposure , immediately before the nematodes would be exposed to PA , there was a slight ( about 10 % ) , but statistically significant decrease in pharyngeal pumping rates ( CS , 204±4.8 pumps / min vs. control , 228±2.4 pumps / min , p = 0.002 , 15 animals scored on each of three plates per condition ) .
Thus , pharyngeal pumping rates following CS exposure are unchanged or slightly decreased .
A decrease in pumping would be expected to cause a decrease in intestinal bacteria , as less bacteria are likely entering the nematode .
This decrease , therefore , would not account for the approximately 100 % increase of intestinal PA levels in CS - exposed over non-CS - exposed C. elegans , suggesting that CS is affecting PA infection and not merely nematode feeding .
L1 nematodes were plated on NGM agar and allowed to mature to the L4 stage .
At this point animals were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 hrs and allowed to mature on the same plates , day 0 .
After 24 hrs , the animals were transferred to infection or control plates , day 1 .
Animals were harvested at 4 , 18 , or 24 hrs post infection for intestinal PA quantification and RNA extraction .
A timeline of the experimental design for CS exposure and infection of C. elegans is shown in Figure 2 .
C. elegans were exposed to CS for 3 hrs ( the longest time that did not cause desiccation of the agar plates ) , and were subsequently allowed to grow for an additional 24 hrs on the same plates that had been CS - exposed .
We monitored Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) load in the intestines at 4 and 18 hrs post - infection and did not observe a significant change in PA load ( data not shown ) .
However , by 24 hrs after the start of the infection , C. elegans showed increased levels of PA in the intestines ( Figure 3 ) .
The 24 hr time point was therefore used for microarray analysis to identify genes that could be involved in impaired bacterial clearance ( see below ) .
Cotinine levels in C. elegans show dose dependent increases based on the amount of time exposed to CS .
2 replicates are shown .
An * represents a data point with a statistically significant difference from either of its neighbors .
Any data below 3 ng cotinine per 10 µg of total protein fell below the detectable level .
Animals were harvested immediately following ( 0 hr ) or 24 hrs following CS exposure .
In order to prove that C. elegans were able to absorb chemicals from the CS exposure , levels of cotinine , a nicotine metabolite , were measured immediately following ( 0 hr ) , 24 hrs post , and 48 hrs post CS .
We observed a dose - dependent increase in cotinine at 0 hr .
By 24 hours , the animals have metabolized the cotinine , and levels have fallen back below detectable levels ( Figure 1 ) .
Cotinine was also undetectable 48 hrs after CS exposure ( data not shown ) .
We exposed L4 , late juvenile , C. elegans on agar plates with lids open to CS in a smoking chamber or , as a control , to filtered air for 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 hrs .
We chose the L4 developmental stage so that nematodes were as close to fully developed as possible but were not yet fertile and egg - laden , as nicotine has been shown to affect egg laying behavior [ 7 ] .
After 24 or 48 hrs , when C. elegans had developed into adults , nematode survival was assessed .
CS exposure of up to 4 hrs did not affect the survival of C. elegans after 24 hrs of CS withdrawal ( n = 300 worms per each of 1 , 2 and 3 hrs of CS exposure ) .
At 48 hr post - CS , a few of the nematodes exposed to CS for 4 hrs died , but there was no statistically significant difference ( 98%±0.5 % survival for CS vs. 100 % survival for air , n = 300 , p = 0.28 ) .
Exposure to CS for more than 3 hrs also caused some desiccation of the plates .
Discussion
Our goal for this study was to determine if the nematode Caenorhabditits elegans could be used as a model of the innate immune response found in humans exposed to cigarette smoke .
First , we show that C. elegans can absorb nicotine from cigarette smoke and break it down similarly to humans .
Second , we demonstrated that exposure to CS modulated gene expression and impaired bacterial clearance in the C. elegans ' intestine .
Third , we found that CS - induced down - regulation of lbp - 7 and lbp - 7 was up - regulated in response to bacterial infection in wild - type C. elegans .
Further , inhibiting lbp - 7 expression via RNAi increases intestinal bacteria .
Together , these data suggest that lbp - 7 is in part responsible for the impaired intestinal bacterial clearance seen in the CS - exposed nematodes .
Lastly , we showed that expression of FABP - 5 , the human orthologue of lbp - 7 , was also up - regulated by bacterial infection .
Moreover , FABP - 5 expression was down - regulated in bronchial epithelial brushings from human COPD patients relative to healthy smokers , suggesting that FABP - 5 could play a role in human disease .
While many previous studies have used C. elegans to study the innate immune response [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we are the first group to expose C. elegans to CS .
Human epithelial cell culture has limitations , primarily those of any in vitro model [ 20 ] .
C. elegans , as an in vivo system , can be subjected to whole cigarette smoke exposure , and may help overcome some of the weaknesses in human epithelial cultures .
C. elegans down - regulated many genes in response to CS including several host defense genes .
This down - regulation may be responsible for CS - induced impaired intestinal clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 , a bacterium involved in both human and nematode disease .
Our microarray studies examining the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 on C. elegans at 24 hrs post - infection revealed changes in expression of many genes including genes reported to be regulated by PA at earlier time points .
We chose several genes regulated by PA exposure for further analysis .
To confirm that the changes in bacterial load caused by CS were not simply caused by the animals eating more , we compared pharyngeal pumping rates between C. elegans with or without CS exposure .
We found either a slight decrease or no statistical difference , depending on time point .
A decrease in pumping rates would suggest that the nematodes are eating less , so it is even more striking to see the increase in intestinal PA .
In order to better understand the mechanism behind the impaired bacterial clearance seen in CS - exposed animals , we used RNAi by feeding to knock down expression of five candidate genes reported in the results .
Of these candidate genes , lbp - 7 knockdown resulted in an increased bacterial load .
lbp - 7 encodes a predicted intracellular fatty acid binding protein that is anticipated to function as an intracellular transporter for small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and steroid hormones [ 21 ] .
Large - scale C. elegans RNAi screens have not shown obvious phenotypic abnormalities when lbp - 7 is inhibited .
However , the precise role of lbp - 7 in C. elegans development and / or behavior is not yet known .
lbp - 7 is expressed in the C. elegans intestine .
We are the first to demonstrate that this gene is important in the immune response to bacterial infection .
Since the expression of lbp - 7 is induced less strongly in the presence of CS and infection compared to infection alone , it is likely involved in the impaired bacterial clearance seen in smoke - exposed animals .
In future studies we would like to further dissect the interplay between lbp - 7 and CS .
For example , overexpressing lbp - 7 would be useful to define the contribution of this gene in PA infection in the presence or absence of smoke exposure .
The fatty acid binding protein FABP - 5 , or E - FABP ( epidermal fatty acid binding protein ) , a human orthologue of lbp - 7 , has been shown to be present in human lung endothelium and airway secretory cells such as Clara cells and goblet cells [ 22 ] .
It is a 15 kD cytoplasmic protein that specifically binds fatty acids [ 23 ] .
We show that FABP - 5 is up - regulated in airway epithelial culture upon bacterial infection , demonstrating its potential role in the innate immune response .
More importantly , FABP - 5 is down - regulated in COPD patients compared with smoker controls , implying its involvement in COPD pathogenesis .
Further studies such as knockdown or overexpression experiments in human airway epithelial cells should be completed to help us further understand FABP - 5's roles in the human innate immune response in COPD and other chronic lung diseases presenting persistent airway bacterial infections .
In summary , our current study offers a novel model to exclusively investigate the role of innate immunity in host defense in the context of cigarette smoke exposure .
This model should improve our understanding about the contribution of innate immunity to the nature of bacterial infections in patients with debilitating chronic lung diseases including COPD .
Introduction
During my solo world sail , I visited Sri Lanka , a very pretty but troubled country near India .
Despite a seemingly perpetual civil war and widespread poverty , I found most Sri Lankans to be resilient and accepting of their lives .
But I remember one man who , in a roundabout way , became the stimulus for this article .
One day while visiting the marketplace in Galle , I saw a man wrapped in apparently bloody bandages , staggering about , whining to himself .
Upon the approach of a European tourist , this man would arrange a collision , then fall screaming to the ground .
Then , depending on the naïveté of the tourist , some money might change hands — on - the - spot compensation for the victim of the tourist 's clumsiness .

The next day , I saw the same drama played out , and the victim would try to avoid colliding with the same people on successive days .
This was n't terribly difficult — after one encounter with the faux victim , people would cross the street to avoid him .

This was n't terribly difficult — after one encounter with the faux victim , people would cross the street to avoid him .
After I sailed away from Sri Lanka , at times I would think about the victim .
I realized he represented a pathetic but plausible way to make a living , preying on the generosity ( and ignorance ) of normal people .
And , like so many of my experiences in the Third World , I found his predatory behavior to be a transparent archetype for the more refined versions of that same behavior in the First World .

Nothing in this article should suggest that all victims are phonies — there are genuine victims , and civilized societies must address their needs .
But this article analyzes a developing trend toward phony victimization , in which people are taught and encouraged to exploit weaknesses in our social services and gaps in validation and logic , factors that have created a new , tragic social class : professional victims .

Psychology 's Fashion Pendulum
Modern - day psychology plays a central role in cultivating professional victims .
Because psychology is not a science ( for reasons explained here ) , it has instead become a sort of opinion pendulum , swinging in step with popular fashions and beliefs .
During psychology 's relatively short history , the majority of beliefs and practices that have held sway over clinicians ' thinking have been abandoned for cause , replaced by new , equally dubious notions .
For example , in the 1960s , psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim declared that autistic children were produced by " refrigerator moms " , mothers who , according to Bettelheim , were not competent to bond emotionally with their children , eventually resulting in a complete incapacity for emotional attachment in the children .
It need hardly be added that Bettelheim 's position had no supporting evidence whatsoever , a fact which did n't hinder its acceptance at all , more the rule than the exception in psychology .

Apart from a lack of evidence , the " refrigerator moms " idea had some serious , practical defects .
By seeming to demonizing motherhood , this idea had the effect of driving a lot of perfectly good clients away from the services offered by psychologists .
In the final analysis , psychology is a business , and businesses do n't thrive by driving customers away ( more on this below ) .
Also , no amount of talk therapy , behavioral modification or drugs , applied to either the mothers or the children , seemed to improve the condition of autism sufferers .
Obviously if autism were the result of specific parental behavior , changing parental behavior should have changed the condition , but this is n't what was observed .
For these and other reasons , in recent times psychology 's fashion pendulum has swung away from Bettelheim 's harsh indictment of motherhood and apple pie .

But of all the factors working to change psychology 's outlook , none is more important than some widespread changes in society outside the clinic doors .
From a baseline attitude that individuals must accept individual responsibility for their actions , an idea that has been gradually eroding away in modern times , we are on the cusp of declaring everyone a victim of something — parents , society , genes , acts of God — and any throwbacks presuming to hold individuals responsible for their own fates and actions are accused of " blaming the victim , " an inspired phrase and one perfectly in tune with modern times .

An Age of Victimhood
Continuing the pendulum metaphor and its present swing away from holding people accountable for their personal circumstances , the notion that everyone is a victim seems to have reached its extreme in the 1990s , a time during which a number of dubious practices were accepted , even temporarily in courts of law .
One example was " recovered memory therapy , " the idea that people might have memories , entirely suppressed , of terrible crimes that had been committed against them , typically when they were children .
In phase one of this practice , a therapist would encourage recall of these memories , the client would recall horrible crimes , and the accused parties would go to jail .
In phase two , the client would realize she ( these individuals are almost always women ) had been taken in , the jailed parties would be released , and the therapist would be sued by the falsely accused , sometimes also by the client .
The advantages to this arrangement should be obvious — the client would be able to claim victim status twice : first by the childhood evildoers , then by the therapist .

Here 's an example case history .
A woman named Holly Ramona entered recovered memory therapy and quickly " remembered " that she had been raped by her father many years before .
The father promptly lost his job and was divorced by his wife , the latter having decided the accusations were valid based on maternal intuition ( no one seems to have wondered where her intuition was at the time of the supposed crime ) .
The father then vehemently denied the accusation and successfully sued the therapist , a marriage counselor and a hospital for their roles in this affair , winning $ 500,000 .

At this point a thinking reader might look on this story as a case of " He said , she said " — after all , neither side appears to have any concrete evidence .
But as it turns out , the daughter was shown to be a virgin at the time she made her accusation , something the psychologists ( and the law ) had managed to overlook .

But as it turns out , the daughter was shown to be a virgin at the time she made her accusation , something the psychologists ( and the law ) had managed to overlook .
In another similar case , during therapy in a formal clinical setting , psychologists used " recovered " memories to persuade Patricia Burgus that she had been part of a satanic cult and had engaged in cannibalism .
This fraud was so compelling that , when Burgus ' husband arrived with a hamburger one day , the therapists took the hamburger into custody and analyzed it for the presence of human flesh .
Finally Ms. Burgus realized she was being had , and in this story 's second phase , she was awarded $ 10.6 million in civil damages .

Finally Ms. Burgus realized she was being had , and in this story 's second phase , she was awarded $ 10.6 million in civil damages .
These two stories are typical of a large class of similar cases , cases that appear to have in common a desperate desire to be a victim of something , anything , even if it 's imaginary , and to persecute some imagined evildoers for good measure .
As it turns out , in the fallout from the " recovered memory " fad , hundreds of accusers have retracted their " recovered memory " claims , and many have switched from suing their parents to suing their therapists ( as usual , no one is suing the lawyers ) .
Another effect of this fad is that , based on dreadful precedents , many courts will no longer hear cases in which " recovered memories " are the primary evidence .

Where 's the Science ?
At this point , I ask that my readers think about the swings of psychology 's fashion pendulum as described above .
We have heard Bruno Bettelheim 's famous claim that autism resulted from " refrigerator moms , " defective mothers unable to bond emotionally with their children .
The problems with this belief should have been obvious at the time , and Bettelheim 's notions could easily have been tested against reality , but they were not .
As a result many dedicated , competent mothers were unfairly demonized .
We have heard that " recovered memory therapy " then became fashionable , and many people were falsely accused , some even jailed for nonexistent crimes on the basis of bogus " expert " psychological testimony in courts of law .
Once again , simple tests could have revealed that many of these claims were simple fantasy , for example by the discovery that a woman who accused her father of rape was a virgin at the time of the accusation .
But , just as with the " refrigerator moms " belief of the 1960s , even the simplest reality tests were not carried out .
As a result many families were torn apart , careers ruined .

How can this happen ?
Is n't psychology a science ?
Does n't mainstream psychological research govern what happens in psychological clinics ?

As it happens , contemporary psychology can be compared to the practice of medicine in the late 19th century — a handful of serious , responsible practitioners , a lot of quacks , very poor controls , little accountability , almost no science .
It was only by a slow accumulation of painful experience that medicine was dragged , kicking and screaming , into a world of scientific validation , of accountability .
In psychology , this process has not even begun .

Many psychologists have responded to my series of articles on the present state of their field .
Some argue that serious research is being carried out in the field of psychology , and at first glance this appears to be true .
On closer examination the quality of the science seems very poor , and most importantly , the research that is being done is having little impact on clinical practice .

When a present - day medical doctor applies a treatment in a clinical setting , she can simply examine the published literature for proven remedies , remedies that are typically validated in exhaustive scientific studies .
If one of these proven remedies turns out to have unanticipated side effects in a clinical setting , alarm bells sound and the entire practice is reëvaluated from top to bottom .

Further , before a particular medical remedy is applied , the client is ( or should be ) made aware of the purpose and quality of the remedy — its degree of effectiveness and any side effects .
The client then gives something called " informed consent " to be treated .

In mainstream medicine , researchers conduct experiments according to strict protocols , those studies are repeated by other laboratories , and only after a complex vetting process are clinics allowed to apply the treatment .
The clinics report any unexpected results to the researchers , and researchers keep the clinicians up to date on new results .
And clinicians never presume to apply treatments that have no demonstrated effectiveness , at least , not if they expect to practice medicine for more than a few weeks .

The above summarizes the current practice of medicine , but , contrary to popular perception , this model does not remotely apply to psychology .
In psychology as it is now practiced , clinicians can do pretty much anything they please , and there is little communication between the worlds of psychological research and practice .

This is why present - day psychology is ruled by a fashion pendulum that swings according to popular taste and prejudice .
This is why courts of law , impressed by the apparent professional standing of psychological " experts , " sometimes give their testimony a weight that it does n't deserve , to the degree that people are sometimes deprived of their freedom on the basis of fantasies .

To repeat , psychology is a business .
It sinks or swims based on its ability to attract customers , and the customer is always right .
If customers believe they are victims , if they believe they can " remember " horrible crimes and by " remembering " put themselves in the position of victims deserving of sympathy , vengeance and monetary reward , some psychologist , somewhere , is poised to reinforce and encourage that belief , for a reasonable fee of course .
And science wo n't throw any obstacles in the way of the process .

I anticipate responses from psychologists who will disagree that psychology is so craven as to adjust its standards to conform to any beliefs a potential group of clients might happen to have .
But it is really true .
Apart from the unaccountable popularity of " repressed memory therapy " and " facilitated communication " , both ideas now discredited for cause , consider the career of the late Professor John Mack , of Harvard Medical School , who decided to accept alien abductee accounts at face value .
He articulated his belief that UFOs were real , that alien abductions were real , and he thereby attracted a large constituency of disturbed people who might otherwise have sought competent help .
His disregard for normal evidentiary standards did n't seem terribly out of place in the field of psychology .

Successful Failures
successful people are n't victims .
But those are not the times we live in , and to some people , perpetual victimhood of one kind or another actually seems an attractive option .
If we lived in a time when personal accountability and responsibility were held in high regard , a time during which choosing victimhood from a list of social options would seem utterly stupid , it would suffice to say that But those are not the times we live in , and to some people , perpetual victimhood of one kind or another actually seems an attractive option .

But there is one trait that all successful people have in common — they are not victims .
Victims do not inspire confidence , they inspire pity .
Seasoned investors do n't buy into victimhood , because it is a losing proposition .

In a story told more completely In a story told more completely here , several years ago I was asked by parents to mentor a bright young man in a family situation that , in due time , turned out to be a prototypical victim training ground .
At first glance , the task the parents asked me to perform seemed trivial — all I had to do was encourage a young man to respect and develop his substantial intellectual gifts .
I thought that would be easy — unlike the parents I understood and shared his interests , I felt he deserved to hold his abilities and his future in higher regard than he did , and he was at an age when boys begin to apply their intellectual gifts to the world in a new way .

As I befriended this young man , and as his outlook improved , I noticed the mom interacting with one of her other children in a way I found disturbing — mom would recite current events in a way seemingly calculated to produce terror , and terror was the result .
Current events were presented as though the child was a direct victim of those events , and there was ample use of the term " victim , " as in " we 're all victims . "
I watched as this child 's natural resilience and optimism was stripped away , and what should have been a sunny outlook grew progressively darker and more fearful .

I then ( very foolishly ) tried to talk the mom out of her terrorizing behavior , a decision that can only show my naïveté and lack of parental insight .
I should have realized the behavior I witnessed could only mean mom was severely dysfunctional and was n't likely to respond to a common - sense appeal to take it easy on her kids , let them fall in love with life before exposing them to someone 's highly filtered idea of reality .

Mom 's reply was that parents have always terrorized their kids .
She added that the child she had terrorized was being put in therapy , so " everything will be all right . "
I stopped breathing for a second .
I realized I was witnessing the birth of a victim , trained at the knee of a professional .

But at that point mom had not made any similar " progress " with my young friend , partly because I was able to lift his spirits through my positive outlook and through my accurately describing him and the world in which he lived .
Mom soon realized I had given her son a more positive outlook in a few hours per week than she could hope to produce full - time .
And no , dear reader , even though I should have , I did n't see what fruit that tree would bear .

A walk in the park ?
Then the father proposed a hike .
Great , I thought , these kids do n't get out of the house nearly enough , having been made fearful of the outside world through their mother 's vigilant efforts .
But I made an advance visit to the hike site and discovered it was actually a technical , nearly vertical rock climb , so steep that a rope was needed to ascend and descend .
I took some pictures , one of which appears on this page , and confronted the parents — this was not a family outing , it was only appropriate for skilled adult climbers , not these sheltered kids , it could only increase their fear of the outside world .
It was dangerous .
The parents seemed not to understand what I was saying , an experience I was becoming familiar with , and the outing went ahead as planned .

I had considered not going on the hike , but I had already aired my concerns to no effect , and by going along I realized I might be able to position myself to catch falling children , a danger the parents had clearly not taken into account .
And that 's exactly what happened .

And that 's exactly what happened .
The ascent was uneventful , but I knew most climbing accidents happen on the descent , so I passed up the other climbers , descended and braced myself .
A short time later my young friend lost his grip on the rope and fell , sliding down a very steep precipice , moving quickly toward a vertical drop that might have killed him .
I grabbed the rope , swung out over the precipice and stopped him with my free hand as he sailed past .
This boy had little outdoor experience so he could n't aid in his own rescue — he did n't know to grab my hand , so I grabbed his coat instead .
Luckily the coat did n't rip as I stopped his fall .

I have n't been in many circumstances where a life was at stake ( apart from my own life during my I have n't been in many circumstances where a life was at stake ( apart from my own life during my solo world sail ) , and I consider it a privilege to be able to save someone .
I was glad I decided to attend the outing , I knew what kinds of risks were present , the parents clearly did not , someone had to deal with reality in such a way that the outcome was positive .
To understand the next part , readers should recall that I had warned the parents in advance that the climb was dangerous , I had gone along expecting to catch falling children , and I then caught my friend as he fell .
Those readers who think a simple " thank you " would be an appropriate response must remember that mom was a professional victim who saw herself as the blameless protector of children fated to be victims of nameless , evil forces .

After the rescue , oblivious to the fact that my having rescued her son had cast a shadow over mom 's private drama , I tried to teach my young friend how to grab someone 's hand in an emergency , using what is commonly called a " Boy Scout grip " , in case the parents planned any more " family outings . "
In the meantime , mom tried to think of a way to spin this rescue so she and her children could appear to be victims .
I think some readers will now see where this is going , but I must confess I did n't at the time , naïvely assuming the parents would see my friendship for what it was , plain and simple .

Before reading on , I ask that my readers try thinking like a professional victim .
A family friend has grabbed your son almost literally out of the air , halting a dangerous fall that could have killed him .
How does that make you or your son a victim ?
Surely there is some way to spin this .

I think only the most cynical readers will guess that mom , after dismissing the idea of thanking me for saving her son and getting on with her life , instead spent months trying to think of a suitably vile interpretation that would preserve her victim status .
Eventually mom brightened up and began claiming I had touched her child " inappropriately " , using terms I will leave to readers ' imaginations .
In spite of my age , I learned something new that day — there are people so completely in the grip of fixed beliefs , so utterly dysfunctional , that they will do or say absolutely anything to avoid having to test reality using common sense .

On hearing mom's fantasy recital , on realizing she had dreamt up a way to simultaneously read the rescue as an evil act and terrify her inexperienced son , I reluctantly but quickly ended my friendship .
I realized I had been too optimistic about what was a very dysfunctional family situation .

But there are a few more twists in this twisted story .
On discovering that I had decided to end my friendship , mom did a quick about face and insisted that I remain involved in her son 's life .
But , at that point understanding her better than she understood herself , I refused .
I saw what she was capable of , even if she did n't .

Two months later , bitter about the outcome and apparently oblivious to what she had said and written before , mom tried to recite her " inappropriate touching " fantasy in a courtroom , with predictable results ( she was quickly undone by self - contradictions and irrationality ) .
A background check then revealed she had made similar claims against others who came into contact with her children , so perhaps it was n't out of character for her to interpret the rescue in that twisted way , or to expect the authorities to listen to her .

My optimism is undiminished .
My young friend will sort this all out , he will figure out how not to think like a victim in spite of some expert training , and he will secure a place in the world commensurate with his substantial gifts .
Most important of all , he will learn that he is not a victim , but a recipient of nature 's bounty .

As for me , I received a valuable lesson in the reality distortion field of the professional victim .
In truth , I was there for her son's benefit , not hers , I made choices guided by common sense , and her son is alive and not in a wheelchair because I could test reality using resources not available to either of his parents .
I was more than happy to be a real - life Holden Caulfield1 for five very important minutes .
Notwithstanding this , it is likely my friend 's mother , congenitally unable to accept personal responsibility for anything , will live in denial forever , railing against a judge — a judge who saw through her in seconds .

Avoiding the Victim Trap
Obviously there are some people for whom a lifelong posture of victimhood is not a choice , but I think there are many for whom it is a conscious choice .
For those people I suggest they consider the possibility that the practice of psychology may make their condition worse , as it did in the examples listed earlier .
This prospect can be made worse yet by the passivity and suggestibility that is typical of those disposed to fall into the victim trap .
The victim posture is the ultimate self - fulfilling prophecy .
By wallowing in the passivity and supposed powerlessness of the victim , one becomes blind to all opportunities and outlooks that do not conform to the supine posture of the victim .
One might call it " self - victimization , " but the point is that it is voluntary .

What is a moral agent ?
A moral agent is someone who influences the world according to his or her own standards , and that is why mom , the professional victim , rejected the description .
One of the keys to the victim posture is the idea that the victim is innocent , ineffectual , has no influence on the world , and therefore cannot possibly victimize anyone else .
A victim is powerless , therefore blameless .

Also , as many thoughtful people have said about religion , acting in a moral way out of fear of punishment is n't a particularly noble pursuit .
The truth is we choose our own moral standards , then act on them , and the idea that all moral standards are shared and universal is an illusion supported by mass culture ( it 's only approximately true ) .

In the final analysis , professional victims like to think of themselves as pure and blameless , but when they teach victimization to others , the students really are being victimized — by their teacher .
That is an optional victimization , and the most creative thing the students can do is refuse to accept the description .

An Updated Introduction : Seven Years Later ( February 9 , 2004 )
I wrote this document a long time ago to capture the conclusions I had reached from working on application performance for a few years .
At the time that I wrote it , the way in which Microsoft dealt with performance in its products was starting to undergo a large - scale transformation .
Performance analysis up to that time had largely been an ad - hoc effort and was hampered by a lack of well - known “ best practices ” and , in some cases , the tools necessary to get the job done .
As the transition started from the 16 - bit world to the 32 - bit world , this kind of approach was clearly insufficient to deal with the increasing popularity of our products and the increasing demands that were being placed on them .
The past seven years have seen major changes in the way that performance is integrated into the development process at Microsoft , and many of the “ rules ” that I outline below have become internalized into the daily processes of most major groups in the company .
Even though a lot of what follows is no longer fresh thinking , I still get requests for the document internally which leads me to believe that there ’s still value in saying things that many people already know .
So I ’ve decided to provide in publicly here , for your edification and in the hope that someone might find it useful .
( Historical note : The “ major Microsoft application “ that I refer to below was not VB . )
A Short Introduction ( May 28 , 1997 )
In the fall of 1995 , I was part of a team working on an upgrade to a major Microsoft application when we noticed that we had a little problem — we were slower than the previous version .
Not just a little slower , but shockingly slower .
This fact had largely been ignored by the development team ( including myself ) , since we assumed it would improve once we were finished coding up our new features .
However , after a while the management team started to get a little worried .
E-mails were sent around asking whether the developers could spend some time focusing on performance .
Thinking “ How hard could this be ? ” I replied , saying that I ’d be happy to own performance .
This should be easy , I thought naively , just tweak a few loops , rewrite some brain - dead code , eliminate some unnecessary work and we ’ll be back in the black .
A full two years ( and a lot of man - years worth of work on many people ’s part ) later , we finally achieved the performance improvements that I was sure would only take me alone a few months to achieve .
Unsurprisingly , I had approached the problem of performance with a lot of assumptions about what I would find and what I would need to do .
Most of those assumptions turned out to be dead wrong or , at best , wildly inaccurate .
It took many painful months of work to learn how to “ really ” approach the problem of performance , and that was just the beginning — once I figured out what to do , I discovered that there was a huge amount of work ahead !
From that painful experience , I have come up with a set of “ Ten Rules of Performance , ” intended to help others avoid the errors that I made .
So , without further ado …
The Rules :
Rule # 1 : Do n’t assume you know anything .
In the immortal words of Pogo , “ We have met the enemy , and he is us . ”
Your biggest enemy in dealing with performance is by far all the little assumptions about your application you carry around inside your head .
Because you designed the code , because you ’ve worked on the operating system for years , because you did well in your college CS classes , you ’re tempted to believe that you understand how your application works .
Well , you do n’t .
You understand how it ’s supposed to work .
Unfortunately , performance work deals with how things actually work , which in many cases is completely different .
Bugs , design shortcuts and unforeseen cases can all cause computer systems to behave ( and execute code ) in unexpected , surprising ways .
If you want to get anywhere with performance , you must continuously test and re-test all assumptions you have : about the system , about your components , about your code .
If you ’re content to assume you know what ’s going on and never bother to prove you know what ’s going on , start getting used to saying the following phrase : “ I do n’t know what ’s wrong …
It ’s supposed to be fast ! ”
Rule # 2 : Never take your eyes off the ball
For most developers , performance exists as an abstract problem at the very beginning of the development cycle and a concrete problem at the very end of the cycle .
In between , they ’ve got better things to be doing .
As a result , typically developers write code in a way that they assume will be fast ( breaking rule # 1 ) and then end up scrambling like crazy when the beta feedback comes back that the product is too slow .
Of course , by the time the product is in beta there ’s no real time to go back and redesign things without slipping , so the best that can be done is usually some simple band - aiding of the problem and praying that everyone is buying faster machines this Christmas .
If you ’re serious about performance , you must start thinking about it when you begin designing your code and can only stop thinking about it when the final golden bits have been sent to manufacturing .
In between , you must never , ever stop testing , analyzing and working on the performance of your code .
Slowness is insidious — it will sneak into your product while you ’re not looking .
The price of speed is eternal vigilance .
Rule # 3 : Be afraid of the dark
Part of the reason why development teams find it so easy to ignore performance problems in favor of working on new features ( or on bugs ) is that rarely , if ever , is there anything to make them sit up and pay attention .
Developers notice when the schedule shows them falling behind , and they start to panic when their bug list begins to grow too long .
But most teams never have any kind of performance benchmark that can show developers how slow ( or fast ) things actually are .
Instead , most teams thrash around in the dark , randomly addressing performance in an extremely ad hoc way and failing to motivate their developers to do anything about the problems that exist .
One of the most critical elements of a successful performance strategy is a set of reproducible real - world benchmarks run over a long period of time .
If the benchmarks are not reproducible or real - world , they are liable to be dismissed by everyone as insignificant .
And they must be run over a long period of time ( and against previous versions ) to give a real level of comparison .
Most importantly , they must be run on a typical user ’s machine .
Usually , coming up with such numbers will be an eye opening experience for you and others on your team .
“ What do you mean that my feature has slowed down 146 % since the previous version ?!? ”
It ’s a great motivator and will tell you what you really need to be working on .
Rule # 4 : Assume things will always get worse
The typical state of affairs in a development team is that the developers are always behind the eight ball .
There ’s another milestone coming up that you have to get those twenty features done for , and then once that milestone is done there ’s another one right around the corner .
What gets lost in this rush is the incentive for you to take some time as you go along to make sure that non-critical performance problems are fixed .
At the end of milestone 1 , your benchmarks may say that your feature is 15 % slower but you ’ve got a lot of work to do and , hey , it ’s only milestone 1 !
At the end of milestone 2 , the benchmarks now tell you your feature is 30 % slower , but you ’re pushing for an alpha release and you just do n’t have time to worry about it .
At the end of milestone 3 , you ’re code complete , pushing for beta and the benchmarks say that your feature is now 90 % slower and program management is beginning to freak out .
Under pressure , you finally profile the feature and discover the design problems that you started out with back in milestone 1 .
Only now with beta just weeks away and then a push to RTM , there ’s no way you can go back and redesign things from the ground up !
Avoid this mistake — always assume that however bad things are now , they ’re only going to get worse in the future , so you ’d better deal with them now .
The longer you wait , the worse it ’s going to be for you .
It ’s true more often than you think .
Rule # 5 : Problems have to be seen to be believed ( or : profile , profile , profile )
Here ’s the typical project ’s approach to performance : Performance problems are identified .
Development goes off , thinks about their design and says “ We ’ve got it !
The problem must be X .
If we just do Y , everything will be fixed ! ”
Development goes off and does Y . Surprisingly , the performance problems persist .
Development goes off , thinks about their design and says “ We ’ve got it !
The problem must be A .
If we just do B , everything will be fixed ! ”
Development goes off and does B. Surprisingly , the performance problems persist .
Development goes off … well , you get the idea .
It ’s amazing how many iterations of this some development groups will go through before they actually admit that they do n’t know exactly what ’s going on and bother to profile their code to find out .
If you ca n’t point to a profile that shows what ’s going on , you ca n’t say you know what ’s wrong .
Every developer needs a good profiler .
Even if you do n’t deal with performance regularly , I say : Learn it , love it , live it .
It ’s an invaluable tool in a developer ’s toolbox , right up there with a good compiler and debugger .
Even if your code is running with acceptable speed , regularly profiling your code can reveal surprising information about it ’s actual behavior .
Rule # 6 : 90 % of performance problems are designed in , not coded in
This is a hard rule to swallow because a lot of developers assume that performance problems have more to do with code issues ( badly designed loops , etc ) than with the overall application design .
The sad fact of the matter is that in all but the luckiest groups , most of the big performance problems you ’re going to confront are not the nice and tidy kind of issues where someone is doing something really dumb .
Instead , it ’s going to be extremely difficult to pinpoint situations where several pieces of code are interacting in ways that end up being slow .
To solve the problems usually requires a redesign of the way large chunks of your code are structured ( very bad ) or a redesign of the way several components interact ( even worse ) .
And given that most pieces of an application are interrelated these days , a small change in the design of one piece of code may cascade into changes in several other pieces of code .
Either way it ’s not going to be simple or easy .
That ’s why you need to diagnose problems as soon as you can and get at them before you ’ve piled a lot of code on top of your designs .
Also , do n’t fall in love with your code .
Most programmers take a justifiable pride in the code that they write and even more pride in the overall design of the code .
However , this means that many times when you point out to them that their intellectually beautiful design causes horrendous performance problems and that several changes are going to be needed , they tend not to take it very well .
“ How can we mar the elegance and undeniable usability of this design ? ” they ask , horrified , adding that perhaps you should look elsewhere for your performance gains .
Do n’t fall into this trap .
A design that is beautiful but slow is like a Ferrari with the engine of a Yugo — sure , it looks great , but you certainly can’t take it very far .
Truly elegant designs are beautiful and fast .
Rule # 7 : Performance is an iterative process
At this point , you ’re probably starting to come to the realization that the rules outlined so far tend to contradict one another .
You ca n’t gauge the performance of a design until you ’ve coded it and can profile it .
However , if you ’ve got a problem , it ’s most likely going to be your design , not your code .
So , basically , there ’s no way to tell how good a design is going to be until it ’s too late to do anything about !
Not exactly , though .
If you take the standard linear model of development ( design , code , test , ship ) , you ’re right : it ’s impossible to heed all the rules .
However , if you look at the development process as being iterative ( design , code , test , re-design , re-code , re-test , re-design , re-code , re-test , … , ship ) , then it becomes possible .
You will probably have to go through and test several designs before you reach the “ right ” one .
Look at one of the most performance obsessed companies in the software business :
Id Software ( producers of the games Doom and Quake ) .
In the development of their 3D display engines ( which are super performance critical ) they often will go through several entirely different designs per week , rewriting their engine as often as necessary to achieve the result they want .
Fortunately , we ’re not all that performance sensitive , but if you expect to design your code once and get it right the first time , expect to be more wrong than right .
Rule # 8 : You ’re either part of the solution or part of the problem
This is a simple rule : do n’t be lazy .
Because we all tend to be very busy people , the reflexive way we deal with difficult problems is to push them off to someone else .
If your application is slow , you blame one of your external components and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
If you ’re one of the external components , you blame the application for using you in a way you did n’t expect and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
Or you blame the operating system and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
Or you blame the user for doing something stupid and say “ it ’s their problem . ”
The problem with this way of dealing with these things is that soon the performance issue ( which must be solved ) is bouncing around like a pinball until it ’s lucky enough to land on someone who ’s going to say “ I do n’t care whose problems this is , we ’ve got to solve it ” and then does .
In the end , it does n’t matter whose fault it is , just that the problem gets fixed .
You may be entirely correct that some boneheaded developer on another team caused your performance regression , but if it ’s your feature it ’s up to you to find a solution .
If you think this is unfair , get over it .
Our customers do n’t blame a particular developer for a performance problem , they blame Microsoft .
Also , do n’t live with a mystery .
At one point in working on the boot performance of my application , I had done all the right things ( profiled , re-designed , re-profiled , etc ) but I started getting strange results .
My profiles showed that I ’d sped boot up by 30 % , but the benchmarks we were running showed it had slowed down by 30 % .
My first instinct was to dismiss the benchmarks as being wrong , but they had been so reliable in the past ( see rule # 3 ) that I could n’t do that .
So I was left with a mystery .
My second instinct was to ignore this mystery , report that I ’d sped the feature up 30 % and move on .
Fortunately , program management was also reading the benchmark results , so I could n’t slime out of it that easily .
So I was forced to spend a few weeks beating my head against a wall trying to figure out what was going on .
In the process , I discovered rule # 9 below which explained the mystery .
Case closed .
I ’ve seen many , many developers ( including myself on plenty of other occasions ) fall into the trap of leaving mysteries unsolved .
If you ’ve got a mystery , some nagging detail that is n’t quite right , some performance slowdown that you can’t quite explain , do n’t be lazy and do n’t stop until you ’ve solved the mystery .
Otherwise you may miss the key to your entire performance puzzle .
Rule # 9 : It ’s the memory , stupid .
As I mentioned above , I reached a point in working on speeding up application boot where my profiles showed that I was 30 % faster , but the benchmarks indicated I was 30 % slower .
After much hair - pulling , I discovered that the profiling method that I had chosen effectively filtered out the time the system spent doing things like faulting memory pages in and flushing dirty pages out to disk .
Given that : 1 ) We faulted a lot of code in from disk to boot , and 2 ) We allocated a lot of dynamic memory on boot , I was effectively filtering out a huge percentage of the boot time out of the profiles !
A flip of a switch and suddenly my profiles were in line with the benchmarks , indicating I had a lot of work to do .
This taught me a key to understanding performance , namely that memory pages used are generally much more important than CPU cycles used .
Intellectually , this makes sense : while CPU performance has been rapidly increasing every year , the amount of time it takes to access memory chips has n’t been keeping up .
And even worse , the amount of time it takes to access the disk lags even further behind .
So if you have really tight boot code that nonetheless causes 1 megabyte of code to be faulted in from the disk , you ’re going to be almost entirely gated by the speed of the disk controller , not the CPU .
And if you end up using so much memory that the operating system is forced to start paging memory out ( and then later forced to start paging it back in ) , you ’re in real trouble .
Rule # 10 : Do n’t do anything unless you absolutely have to
This final rule addresses the most common design error that developers make : doing work that they do n’t absolutely have to .
Often , developers will initialize structures or allocate resources up front because it simplifies the overall design of the code .
And , to a certain degree , this is a good idea if it would be painful to do initialization ( or other work ) further down the line .
But often times this practice leads to doing a huge amount of initialization so that the code is ready to handle all kinds of situations that may or may not occur .
If you ’re not 100 % absolutely sure that a piece of code is going to need to be executed , then do n’t execute it !
Conversely , when delaying initialization code , be aware of where that work is going to be going .
If you move an expensive initialization routine out of one critical feature and into another one , you may not have bought yourself much .
It ’s a bit of shell game , so be aware of what you ’re doing .
Also , keep in mind that memory is as important as code speed , so do n’t accumulate state unless you absolutely have to .
One of the big reasons why memory is such a problem is the mindset of programmers that CPU cycles should be preserved at all costs .
If you calculate a result at one point in your program and you might need it later on elsewhere , programmers automatically stash that result away “ in case I need it later . ”
And in some expensive cases , this is a good idea .
However , often times the result is that ten different developers think , “ All I need is x bytes to store this value .
That ’s much cheaper than the cycles it took me to calculate it . ”
And then soon your application has slowed to a crawl as the memory swaps in and out like crazy .
Now not only are you wasting tons of cycles going out to the disk to fetch a page that now would have been ( now ) much cheaper to calculate , you ’re also spending more of your time managing all the state you ’ve accumulated .
It sounds counterintuitive , but it ’s true : recalculate everything on the fly ; save only the really expensive , important stuff .
