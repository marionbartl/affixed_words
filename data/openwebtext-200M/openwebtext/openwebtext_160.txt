Being able to lend , then get repaid , and lend over and over again gives great satisfaction .
My funds have been lent 12 times over .

Last week it was the turn of the Idaho senator Larry Craig , who in June was caught propositioning an undercover officer in the toilets of Minneapolis airport .
Two months later he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct without consulting his lawyer .
Then Craig , who finally resigned over the weekend , claimed that he framed himself .
" I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously , " he explained .
" In hindsight , I should not have pled guilty . "
If he 's telling the truth now he 's a perjurer ; if he was telling the truth then , he 's a gay man who legislates against gay people .
There are moments when things really are the way they seem and facts really do speak for themselves .
Bad as the facts may appear , attempting to rationalise them only makes matters worse .
Trying to convince people otherwise only insults their intelligence .
So it would have seemed last Tuesday when the US census bureau revealed its latest findings on income , poverty and health .
The report showed that since George Bush came to power the poverty rate had risen by 9 % , the number of people without health insurance had risen by 12 % , and real median household income had remained stagnant .
On the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina we learned the racial disparity in income and the gap between rich and poor show no sign of abating .
Bush declared himself " pleased " with the results , even if the uninsured presented " a challenge " .
He pointed out that over the past year poverty had declined ( albeit by a fraction , and from the previous high he had presided over ) and median household income had increased ( albeit by a fraction and primarily because more people were working longer hours ) .
Maybe he thought Americans would not realise that five years into a " recovery " their wages were stagnant , their homes were being repossessed at a rate not seen since the Depression , and their pension funds were on a roller coaster .
Having beckoned ordinary Americans with the lure of cheap credit and stock market gains , the invisible hand of the market has now grabbed them by the scruff of the neck and is shaking them mercilessly .
Iraq has , quite rightly , dominated the national conversation and will dominate Bush 's legacy .
But that does n't mean it will necessarily be the chief concern for voters choosing their next president .
In this week that officially kicks off the presidential primary season , sexual scandal is not the only issue to remind us of the Clinton era .
In 1991 Clinton 's chief strategist pinned a note on the wall of his campaign headquarters to remind the team of its core message : " the economy , stupid " .
A similar focus may once again be necessary , although translating that maxim into votes is not straightforward .
Paradoxically , the states with the highest levels of poverty and lowest incomes are staunchly Republican .
Poor people tend not to vote , and candidates tend neither to appeal nor refer to them .
However , economically they are a glaring and shameful fact of American life ; socially and culturally they dominate the centre of almost every moral panic - but politically they do not exist .
None the less , in recent years the conditions associated with poverty have spread far beyond the poor .
Almost two - thirds of those who lost their health insurance last year earn $ 75,000 or more .
Homeowners are also not so easy to write off , not least because those hardest hit happen to be in politically sensitive areas .
Of the 10 states that have suffered the most from foreclosures , six - Nevada , Colorado , Arizona , Florida , Ohio and Michigan - are swing states .
Among the viable Democratic contenders , John Edwards has embraced the economic agenda most forcefully .
In his stump speech he calls for reversing Bush 's tax cuts for those earning more than $ 200,000 a year , cutting poverty by a third in 10 years and eliminating it altogether in 30 .
Having announced his candidacy from New Orleans he has walked many a picket line in recent months and tells crowds :
" The organised labour movement is the greatest anti-poverty movement in American history . "
With the brooding resentment at growing insecurity now reaching a critical point , Obama and Hillary are also shifting their focus .
Sadly it is unlikely this resentment will gain much in the way of political expression beyond populist rhetoric .
The notions of personal reinvention and economic meritocracy that lie at the heart of the American dream are far more powerful and enduring than the kind of class consciousness necessary to redress the imbalance between rich and poor .
Inequality of wealth in the US has long been justified on the grounds that there is equality of opportunity .
The trouble is that while inequalities have grown dramatically over the past 20 years , equality of opportunity has been all but eroded .
According to the Economic Policy Institute , in 1989 American CEOs earned 71 times more than the average worker - today , by most calculations , it is up to around 270 times .
Meanwhile , social mobility has slowed to a level below that in most of Europe , including Britain .
Most Americans identify themselves as " middle class " - but in the middle of what is not clear .
Anything that would identify working people as a group with a collective set of interests that are different from and at times antagonistic to the interests of corporations has pretty much been erased from public discourse .
People will refer to " blue collar workers " , " working families " , " the poor " , the " working poor " .
But the working class simply does not exist .
None the less , class does play a role .
It is most often used by the right to cast liberals as cultural " elites " .
The price of Edwards 's haircut , John Kerry 's windsurfing , Al Gore 's earth tones - all are exploited as illustrations of the effete mannerisms of those who claim to speak for the common man and woman .
Class is not elevated to politics but reduced to performance : that is how the fact that Bush has made so little of his elite upbringing has become an asset .
The conservative columnist Cal Thomas said of Edwards : " His populist jargon is nothing but class warfare . "
If only .
Long ago the wealthy declared war on the poor in this country .
The poor have yet to fight back .
In October 2000 , Bush quipped to a group of wealthy diners : " What an impressive crowd : the haves , and the have - mores .
Some people call you the elite ; I call you my base . "
If only the have - nots had such a determined and confident advocate .

さて、プログラミングの話題もたまには書いてみます。今回はPHPのround関数の挙動が変だ！という話題です。
round ( ) は浮動小数点数を四捨五入する関数で、大抵の言語に同じ名前で実装されているかと思います。ではPHPのround関数の何が問題なのか、ちょっと試してみましょう。
$ uname - sro Linux 2.6.9-42.0.10.plus.c4smp GNU / Linux $ php --version PHP 5.1.6 ( cli ) ( built : Feb 23 2007 06:56:38 ) Copyright ( c ) 1997 -2006 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.1.0 , Copyright ( c ) 1998 -2006 Zend Technologies $ php -r '$ x1=0.49999999999;$x2=0.5 ; var_dump ( $ x1 , $ x2 , ( $ x1===$ x2 ) , round ( $ x1 ) , round ( $ x2 ) ) ; ' float ( 0.49999999999 ) float ( 0.5 ) bool ( false ) float ( 1 ) float ( 1 ) $
上記の通り、0.49999999999を四捨五入したら1になってしまいました。ここでクイズです。上記のような結果になった理由は何でしょうか。
上の結果を見た瞬間に 「 ああ、よくある浮動小数点数の精度とか誤差とかの話題か」と思った方は一定以上経験のあるプログラマなのだろうと思いますが、残念ながらハズレです。0.5は2進で正確に表せる数ですから、丸め誤差が発生するわけでもありません。また、PHPの浮動小数点数はCでいうdoubleそのものですから、10進11桁程度であればそれなりの精度で格納できます。
さて、答え合わせの前に、他の言語でも試してみることにしましょう。Rubyだとどうなるでしょうか。
$ ruby -e '$ x1=0.49999999999 ;$ x2=0.5 ; p( $ x1,$x2 , ( $x1==$x2 ) , $x1.round ( ) , $x2.round ( ) ) ; ' 0.49999999999 0.5 false 0 1 $
なるほど。これは直感通りの結果です。念のためCでも試してみましょうか。
$ cat /tmp/round-test.c # include < stdio.h > # include < math.h> int main ( ) { double x1=0.49999999999 , x2=0.5 ; printf ( " %.11f
%.11f
%d
%f
%f
" , x1 , x2 , x1==x2 , round ( x1 ) , round ( x2 ) ) ; return 0 ; } $ gcc -lm /tmp/round-test.c $ ./a.out 0.49999999999 0.50000000000 0 0.000000 1.000000 $
やはり普通はそうなるはずですよね。
PHP のソースコードを少し眺めていると、すぐに不穏な個所にぶつかりました。
# define PHP_ROUND_WITH_FUZZ( val , places ) { \ double tmp_val=val , f = pow ( 10.0 , ( double ) places ) ; \ tmp_val *= f ; \ if ( tmp_val >= 0.0 ) { \ tmp_val = floor ( tmp_val + PHP_ROUND_FUZZ ) ; \ } else { \ tmp_val = ceil ( tmp_val - PHP_ROUND_FUZZ ) ; \ } \ tmp_val /= f ; \ val = ! zend_isnan ( tmp_val ) ?
tmp_val : val ; \ } \
どうやらこのマクロがPHPのround関数の実体のようです。不思議なことに、ライブラリ関数のround(3)を呼ばずに謎の定数PHP_ROUND_FUZZとfloor(3)とceil(3)を使ってround関数らしきものを実装しているようです。round(3)を避ける意味がわかりません。更に不安なことに、少なくとも僕の手元の環境では定数PHP_ROUND_FUZZは0.50000000001なんていう不思議な数に定義されているみたいですよ！こんな見事なマジックナンバーは久々に見ました！ステキすぎてクラクラしちゃいますね！
皮肉はさておき下記のURLを読んでみると、こんな実装になっている理由がわかったような気がします。
この一連のバグ報告を斜め読みで要約すると、「
紙とペンで計算すると5.045になるはずの値（実際にはコンピュータ上では約5.04499999999999992894573）を小数点以下第二位までで四捨五入してるのになぜか5.04になった！バグだ！」って騒いでいるプログラマがバグ報告をしてきて、これに対処するために四捨五入の境界値付近（0.00000000001くらいの差）だったら全部0から遠い方に切り上げるようなコード修正をした、ということかと思います。他の言語なら無知なバグ報告者を罵倒して終わるはずのところを、バグ修正として対応してしまうところがPHPらしいのかもしれません。もっとも、これは想像なので実際どうだか知りませんけどね。もし詳しい人がいらしたら教えてください。
というわけで、このエントリの解答としては「どうやらPHPの仕様」ということになります。実は僕が調べ始めた時点での予想は「PHPのバグ」でしたので、これは僕自身にとっても意外な結果です。
蛇足になりますが、http://jp.php.net/manual/ja/function.round.php
の先頭には英語版には付いていない注意書き
( 訳注：内部的な 2 進数表現 と 10 進数表現の差により生じる丸め誤差の影響により
必ずしも小数点以下を四捨五入した結果を返さないことに注意してください。)
が書いてあります。これは訳者の優しさが表れている文章だと思います。一方で、今回のroundの妙な挙動が本当にPHPの仕様だとしたら、PHPの中の人は優しさが無いと思うんですよね。それとも、これはこれで優しさなんでしょうかね？
Pentagon starts spin unit to target talk radio , bloggers Will Menaker
Published : Tuesday July 17 , 2007 Print This Email This With public opinion on both the President and Iraq war cratering , it 's hard to imagine any amount of PR could turn back the tide .
But do n't tell that to the Pentagon 's public affairs division .
Ken Silverstein reports on the latest efforts to spread the good word on Iraq in Monday 's Harper's .
The new “ Communications Outreach ” program is the latest effort to bypass the traditional media and work directly with talk radio and bloggers .
The project was originally called " Surrogates Operation " and is the brain child of former ABC executive and assistant secretary of defense for public affairs Dorrance Smith .
Less kindly , Silverstein remarks that " the Pentagon ’s public affairs division has become a dumping ground for administration cronies . "
Silverstein reports that the " Communications Outreach " program " reportedly provides talking points and briefings to retired military officials who now support the administration in appearances as media pundits . "
The genesis of the idea came in 2006 , " when the press and retired senior military officials were pummeling Donald Rumsfeld . "
Also on board are Erin Healey , a former junior assistant press secretary at the White House , Julie George , who formerly worked as deputy coalitions director for Rick Santorum , and perhaps most telling is another person reportedly involved with the operation is the presence of Jocelyn Webster , " who formerly worked in the White House ’s political operation for Sara Taylor , the Karl Rove aide who now finds herself in a bit of hot water . "
The relative inexperience of these true - believers is an old theme for the Bush administration , Silverstein writes .
" Healey may have some knowledge of defense matters , but she ’s certainly no expert , " he says .
" Webster and George were described to me by one well - informed source as 'very young with no background in national security or foreign affairs . '
This person said that some defense officials have been ' put off to say the least by these neophyte political appointees telling retired and active personnel in uniform what to say and what to think . ' "
Webster is also among those whose name has surfaced in Democratic investigations .
She 's on the list of current and former White House staffers who used Republican National Committee email addresses and was among those dealt with a controversial Powerpoint slideshow that involved briefing the General Services Administration about Republican prospects for the 2006 election cycle .
“ Please do not e-mail this out or let people see it , " one of the emails said , according to Harper's .
" It is a close hold , and we ’re not supposed to be e-mailing it around . ”

Among the growing collections of free audio book podcasts , you 'll find a large number of " thrillers "
that grew out of the American and British literary traditions .
It 's perhaps safe to say that the volunteers who record these books like a good , fear - inducing read .
But who does n't ?
The list of suspenseful novels available as free podcasts starts with the " monster novels " of 19th century Britain .
These novels , which frequently offered a roundabout commentary on the anxieties produced by a society in the midst of rapid industrialization and widespread colonial involvement , include Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein ( 1818 ) , Robert Louis Stevenson 's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde ( 1886 ) , and Bram Stoker 's Dracula ( 1897 ) .
Meanwhile , across the pond , America was producing its own distinctive thrillers .
In the trove of free audio books , you get Washington Irving 's classic 1820 short story , The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ( listen here or here ) as well as Edgar Allan Poe 's great short tales : The Tell Tale Heart ( 1843 ) , The Raven from 1845 ( listen here or here ) , and The Cask of Amontillado ( 1846 ) .
( Amazing that he wrote all of these before he died at 40 . )
Lastly , we 'd also point you to the famous ghost story , The Turn of the Screw ( listen here and here ) , written by one of America 's greats , Henry James .
You 'll note that some of these podcasts come from Librivox , and that 's because Librivox , with the help of volunteers , has quickly put together a strong collection of audio texts from the public domain .
If you like audio versions of the classics , then you 'll want to spend some time reviewing their catalogue , and , in the meantime , enjoy these suspenseful tales .

Brazil Outlaws Billboards , Calling Them " Visual Pollution " Posted by Pile ( 10354 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Good News ]
In 2007 , the world 's fourth - largest metropolis and Brazil 's most important city , São Paulo , became the first city outside of the communist world to put into effect a radical , near - complete ban on outdoor advertising .
Known on one hand for being the country 's slick commercial capital and on the other for its extreme gang violence and crushing poverty , São Paulo 's " Lei Cidade Limpa " or Clean City Law was an unexpected success , owing largely to the singular determination of the city 's conservative mayor , Gilberto Kassab .
As the driving force behind the measure , mayor Kassab quelled the rebellion from the advertising industry with the help of key allies amongst the city 's elite .
On many occasions , Kassab made the point that he has nothing against advertising in and of itself , but rather with its excess .
He explained , " The Clean City Law came from a necessity to combat pollution ... pollution of water , sound , air , and the visual .
We decided that we should start combating pollution with the most conspicuous sector -- visual pollution . "
Since then , billboards , outdoor video screens and ads on buses have been eliminated at breakneck speed .
Even pamphleteering in public spaces has been made illegal , and strict new regulations have drastically reduced the allowable size of storefront signage .
Nearly $ 8 million in fines were issued to cleanse São Paulo of the blight on its landscape .
One sore loser in the battle was Clear Channel Communications .
Having recently entered the Brazilian market , the corporation was purchasing a Brazilian subsidiary as well as the rights to a large share of the city 's billboard market .
Weeks before the ban took effect , Clear Channel launched a counter - campaign in support of outdoor ads , with desperate slogans that failed to resonate with the masses : " There 's a new movie on all the billboards -- what billboards ?
Outdoor media is culture . "

Psychology Today :
" All people are born alike - except Republicans and Democrats , " quipped Groucho Marx , and in fact it turns out that personality differences between liberals and conservatives are evident in early childhood .
In 1969 , Berkeley professors Jack and Jeanne Block embarked on a study of childhood personality , asking nursery school teachers to rate children 's temperaments .
They were n't even thinking about political orientation .
Twenty years later , they decided to compare the subjects ' childhood personalities with their political preferences as adults .
They found arresting patterns .
As kids , liberals had developed close relationships with peers and were rated by their teachers as self - reliant , energetic , impulsive , and resilient .
People who were conservative at age 23 had been described by their teachers as easily victimized , easily offended , indecisive , fearful , rigid , inhibited , and vulnerable at age 3 .
The reason for the difference , the Blocks hypothesized , was that insecure kids most needed the reassurance of tradition and authority , and they found it in conservative politics .
I know our right wing commenters are going to think this is a cheap shot against conservatives , and that is sincerely not my intent .
I just find this report fascinating in how different inclinations manifest themselves from childhood into adulthood .
Certainly , everything I was exposed to in my childhood have informed my politics and worldview .
And now part of what I do for my off line job is teach children .
I know which children need structure and respond more to authoritarian commands from me and which kids like me being more casual and jokey with them .
I 'd love to catch up with my students again in 20 years to see if these hypotheses bear out on their political leanings .
It ’s Wednesday , that means its time once again for my weekly article from GreenOptions .
I write for them each Wednesday .
That means The Sietch gets last weeks article :)
Enjoy .
If I told you that I was going to give you a magic device that would save you money , save the planet , and , oh yeah , firm up that flab you have been carrying around with you for the last couple of year ( all for three easy payments of $ 19.95 ! ) , what would you say ?
Most people would be pretty stoked , but when I tell people that this magic device is a bicycle , the thrill dies down a little .
I have been in love with bike riding for years now , from the flat open roads of Ohio , to the bustling SUV traffic of Austin , the winding roads of Cape Cod , and now the horn - honking traffic of Boston .
When I tell people that I ride my bike to work they say " that ’s great " as they look at me like I might be a couple cards short of a deck .
For most people , the conversation stops there , but for those of us who get more engaged , I usually end up hearing something like " I would love to ride my bike to work , butâ€ ¦ "
It ’s the " buts " I am going to address today .
" Butâ € ¦it ’s too dangerous . "
I will not lie to you : riding your bike can be dangerous .
You are on a little sliver of metal and rubber , and the cars and trucks are huge armored tanks in comparison .
A few people do get hurt riding their bikes , but the vast majority of bike riders do not .
There are several very easy and smart things you can do to minimize the danger of bike riding .
The first would be to wear your helmet .
Your helmet will not save you from everything , but it is better than nothing .
The second would be to follow the rules of the road .
When you are a bike rider .
you are considered a wheeled vehicle and that means you ride on the road , or margin ( riding on the sidewalk is dangerous to pedestrians ) , you ride on the right side of the road , you stop at stop signs and red lights , and you use signals .
You need to be aware of what is going on around you : just because someone looks at you does n’t mean they are going to stop .
You should ride defensively .
In short , do n’t ride like a crazy person , and chances are you will be fine .
It is important that you develop bike survival skills .
These include things like riding in a straight line .
Swerving all over the place makes cars nervous .
Use your mirrors or learn to look behind you , in the same way you would look at your blind spot before you switch lanes .
Following the rules of the road , and having the proper safety gear is going to go a long way towards keeping you safe ; defensive driving will take you the rest .
" But … it ’s too far to ride . "
At each point in my life , the concept of " too far " has changed .
When I first started riding , too far was 5 miles : the idea of riding my bike that long was just too hard to comprehend .
I remember running laps in soccer practice as a child , and 5 miles was forever .
The bicycle is one of the most efficient ways of using human power for travel .
Using the gear and chain system of a bike , you can transfer relatively little effort into a lot of motion .
Of course as you ride more , " too far " gets longer and longer .
I now regularly go out for 20 - 40 mile rides , and do n’t consider them far at all .
The more you ride , the better you feel , so the more you want to ride .
Like anything in life , start small , and slowly push your range out .
I find it is helpful to ride for a reason .
I am going to ride to the store and get some chips and salsa .
I am going to ride to the bank to deposit this check .
I am going to ride to the video store to drop off this DVD .
Having a goal takes your mind off of " how far . "
So many of the reasons we get into our cars nowadays are for short 3 - 10 mile jaunts that could easily be accomplished on a bike .
The six mile bike ride from my home to my office takes me about 30 minutes if I take my time .
If I take the train , it takes about an hour .
I have never tried to actually push my poor car through morning rush hour traffic to see how long that takes , but it would take a long time .
" Butâ € ¦it ’s too cold / hot . "
This is actually one of the few valid reasons for some people .
If you have to show up to the board meeting in a suit and tie , and your office does n’t offer showers , perhaps riding your bike to work on the day when it ’s 100 degrees outside will not be the best idea .
Similarly , if it is negative 30 out , you might want to take the bus .
All that being said , there are many days during the year when it is cool enough in the morning to keep you from being a sweat ball when you get to work .
Riding your bike is an enjoyable pastime .
You connect with your surroundings because you are not whizzing past them at 50 mph .
If you ride at a measured pace , you will not work up too much of a sweat .
One technique I often use is to bring my work clothes with me in a backpack , and change when I get to work .
I like to push things a bit , and will try and ride throughout the year .
Some states will even give your company money to install locker rooms and a shower .
Contacting your local government will help you figure out if this is the case .
I would suggest you ride your bike when you can , and do n’t when you cant , even if that means you only ride your bike for a couple of months a year .
" Butâ€¦ there are no bike lanes / trails . "
Having the leisure of having a bike lane or trail is great .
You get the " road " to yourself , donâ€™t have to deal with cars driving past , and , in general , have a nice relaxing ride .
That being said , very few places in America have these trails that will bring you from where you live to where you work .
You will need to ride in the street .
Most roads were meant to be used by more than just cars .
You have a right to use a small portion of that road , and you should .
It does take a little acclimation to get used to cars driving past you .
Once you do , however , it is no different than cars driving past you in your own car , or when you are walking on the sidewalk .
I think the biggest problem dealing with this issue is that , in many modern cities , cars have become so dominant that highways and busy streets have taken over .
But even here in Boston , I am able to find ample " back roads " to get the six miles to and from work without dealing with highways or busy roads .
When I lived in Ohio , it was so simple to find quiet streets as to not even be an issue .
There is no reason that you have to just accept the status quo : call up your local government and tell them you would like to see more bike lanes in your town .
" Butâ€¦ where will I put my briefcase ? "
It is a fairly trivial bit of bike modification to install some bike bags ( also called panniers ) onto your bicycle .
These will allow you carry your laptop , your briefcase , and a whole lot more if you go for the full front and back wheel system .
You can also go old school and get one of the little â€œbook shelfâ€ racks for the back .
While you are customizing your bike , I would also install some fenders to keep the occasional puddle from splashing up on you , and maybe a blinking light or two for dusk and dawn riding .
The good stuff .
Riding your bike will bring you many benefits : you will be stronger , look better and save a lot of money on gas .
I like to fantasize that each and every one of the people I pass stuck in traffic secretly yearns to be with me swiftly riding past them on my way to and from work .
You daily commute can also turn into a very fun part of your day .
My morning ride leaves me invigorated and ready for work , in a way no cup of coffee ever could , and the stress of the day seems to melt away on the bike ride home .
I will leave you with my person bike motto in the hope that it can help you become inspired to give bike riding a try .
When it is cold outside , ride faster to warm up ; when it is hot outside , ride faster to create a breeze .
Happy pedaling !
Dear Mr. Rose ,
I am writing to follow up with you regarding correspondence with a member of your team several weeks ago .
I inquired about a domain that seems to be on your auto - bury list .
Granted , you have never admitted to an auto - bury list , but the statistics speak for themselves .
In the first link , it is obvious that the last story that was not buried was also popular and hit the front page 184 days ago .
As of this writing , it has 903 Diggs .
Not too shabby .
However , in the second link , it appears that every single story submitted since then has been buried .
That includes a total of 25 stories .
One of them is from less than 24 hours ago and was buried with 2 Diggs .
As an avid user of your service , I do n’t think it would be off the mark to say that you are burying stories internally given that it is very rare for stories with less than 5 - 10 Diggs to be buried from my observations ( and you know how often I wander the halls of Digg ) .
I ’m going to go a step further and make a claim that you are not only burying stories internally ; you have a method of burying domains after an arbitrary amount of time has elapsed since the story was submitted .
Here was a story from the domain that I submitted that got buried with 45 Diggs .
Somehow , it accrued another 60 after it was buried .
I have a hard time believing that the democratic voice of Diggers was responsible for this story ’s burial .
Similarly , these two stories are good Digg content , and I think that a good number of people would agree with my claim .
That said , I request a more transparent Digg .
However , since that is a request that has often fallen upon deaf ears , I want to start by asking that instead of auto - burying a story , ban the domain .
That way , you are not leading submitters into a false hope that their story which has Diggworthy content can make the front page .
( Ironically , these stories that I have used as examples all hit the front pages on other social news sites , so it appears that the wisdom of the crowds came to a conclusion that the content was good and deserving of greater exposure . )
I bring this up for another reason .
There is a small fraction of Digg top users who actually take pride in their ratio .
You do too , Mr. Rose , considering that according to your profile ( screenshot below ) , you have submitted 295 stories and 298 of them have been popular .
Of course , that definitely raises some eyebrows considering that this is an extreme mathematic anomaly , but let ’s put that aside for a moment .
It is obvious that despite the mistake in the statistics , there are also untruths to it .
For example , you submitted a number of stories that never hit the front page .
Here ’s a video of yours that did n’t make it .
( My guess is that the recent Digg redesign partially addressed that . )
You also submitted some dupe stories and made the right move when you buried yourself .
Even when some of your stories just did n’t get enough votes , you took it like a man… or did you ?
That ’s what I ’m wondering .
After all , your stats indicate that you ’ve never made an error in your own submissions .
You must take pride in your 100 % ( or 101 % ) ratio , and those stories that never made it are long - forgotten to the majority of Digg ’s users .
As for me , I like my 52 % ratio .
I ’ve worked hard for it without being a big gun at Digg .
Once upon a time , I emailed your staff and asked if I could help moderate Digg stories on a volunteer basis .
Now , I have to say that I do n’t want to .
I do n’t want to understand the internal workings of Digg .
I think it would be unfair to us Digg addicts to know too much about the service and know of its shortcomings .
When I started writing writing for Lifehacker , I realized that it would be unfair to submit stories from Lifehacker to Digg because I have a competitive advantage over my peers .
( And for the record , it has nothing to do with Lifehacker ’s Digg policy . )
I know what ’s going on behind the scenes and I know that it would be unfair to take advantage of that to boost myself .
I know you ’re in a slightly different boat .
After all , you ’re Kevin Rose , Digg founder and rockstar ( I still admire you ) , and you can do whatever you want .
But you also know , for the most part , about what works and what does n’t , and I ’m sure you know exactly what ’s wrong with the domain I ’ve inquired about .
I think that it would be fair to be honest to those of us who are extremely loyal users and those of us who aspire to be loyal users .
If not for being transparent about the service , at least we can be like your 10 API contest finalists .
I keep saying how I want to score lots of Digg schwag .
Our dedication should not be overlooked or ignored .
I think we deserve more than we ’re getting .
So , Mr. Rose , I end my open letter with a few requests :
Any domains that are flagged for auto - burial should not be auto - buried .
Instead , block the domain like you do for others :
Keep your ratio honest .
And if that ’s too difficult , at least let us build our ratios fairly without any internal affairs operating against our hard work and dedication .
With your vast knowledge of Digg versus that of the regular community , you undoubtedly have a competitive edge .
Do n’t abuse it .
I do n’t care if you removed the top 100 users ( thanks to Chris Finke , really , even though I became a top 100 user after that list was removed from digg.com ) , but do us a favor and make us happy that we ’re contributing to the community .
I just wore my Digg shirt at SES San Jose ( look , there ’s even a picture of me wearing it with my press badge and all ) .
Do you realize how many potential new users I brought you ?
I am not shy about being a top Digg user ; in fact , I take pride in it .
Let me flaunt it in public without having to blog or talk about it .
Give me some clothes .
😉
Those of us who are big on Digg these days put in more time than most of those API developers .
I know that for certain .
Listen to your top users .
Our investment in your dream is more than you ’d ever know .
I ’m going to leave those requests be for now , since I have a few other concerns I will be addressing in later posts .
However , if nothing else , please at least consider what I ’ve written .
Thank you ,

British Army used under - 18 - year - old soldiers in Iraq occupation
By Simon Whelan
8 March 2007
A recent written answer to a parliamentary question from the Liberal Democrats revealed that the British Army sent 15 soldiers under the age of 18 to fight in Iraq , contravening a United Nation ’s protocol on children ’s rights .
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , Article 38 , ( 1989 ) insists : “ State parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of 15 years do not take a direct part in hostilities . ”
The optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict to the Convention that came into force in 2002 stipulates that its state parties “ shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities and that they are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces . ”
Prime Minister Tony Blair ’s Labour government ratified the optional protocol against the deployment of those aged 18 and under to war on June 24 , 2003 .
At almost the same time it was sending them to participate in the occupation of Iraq .
In response to the Liberal Democrats ’ questioning , Defence Minister Adam Ingram admitted that Britain had deployed under - 18s to Iraq over a two - year period between June 2003 and July 2005 .
Claiming that it was the result of a mistake , Ingram excused the government of any culpability by saying that most of these had been despatched to the war zone only shortly before their eighteenth birthdays .
Those who saw combat , he said , were withdrawn after only weeks of combat action .
Blaming a shortage of available soldiers , Ingram was quoted by the BBC as stating , “ Unfortunately , these processes are not fallible and the pressures on units prior to deployment have meant that there have been a small number of instances where soldiers have been inadvertently deployed to Iraq before their eighteenth birthday . ”
The Ministry of Defence admitted that army commanders were put under pressure by successive deployments to Iraq and other war zones and consequently broke international rules .
Children can join the British army aged 16 if they have their parents ’ consent and approximately 40 percent of its military forces have signed up when they were just 16 or 17 years old .
Seventeen - year - old British army soldiers have also seen conflict in the Malvinas / Falklands War and in the first Gulf War .
The government ’s admission that not only were under - age soldiers sent to fight an illegal war in Iraq , but at least four of the 15 were females , caused barely a ripple in the British media .
Hardly any questioned the policy of the British army in recruiting children young enough to still attend school .
At just 16 years old , the UK armed forces have the lowest recruitment threshold in Europe and the largest number of those recruited aged below 18 years of age .
It is the only country in Europe that deploys 17 - year - olds into armed conflicts .
But widespread unpopularity over the Iraq war and the Blair government ’s policy of aggressive military intervention overseas means that the army is struggling to retain its current numbers .
The highly suspicious deaths of several young recruits at the army ’s notorious Deepcut barracks and the fate of veterans from recent conflicts like the first Gulf conflict have also had a negative effect on the appeal of joining the armed services .
In addition , recent furores concerning the wretched state of army accommodation , pay and conditions have exacerbated the recruitment crisis .
In 2006 , 14,000 left the army and only 12,000 joined up .
Teenagers make up the bulk of recent intake .
Last year , 2,760 new recruits to the three armed services were 16 years old and a further 3,415 were aged 17 .
In contrast , just 980 recruits were aged 23 and just 160 aged 28 .
The maximum recruitment age has been raised from 26 to 33 years old .
The army has also undertaken a relatively successful recruitment drive in the former Commonwealth and other countries .
This has yielded 6,000 new recruits , with a further 3,000 Gurkhas from Nepal .
As a result one in every ten British soldiers is a foreign national .
But this has worried some senior figures , who are concerned it will affect morale and create divided loyalties .
Because of this the army has begun focusing its attention on even younger British children , stepping up its recruitment drive in schools .
Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that Scottish school recruitment visits have increased more than tenfold .
In 2003 /2004 there were 14 visits to Scottish schools , but during 2005 / 2006 this rose exponentially to 153 .
Such figures are a damning indictment of Labour controlled councils , who must first give permission to the army to recruit within schools .
Writing in the New Statesman recently , Stephen Armstrong revealed how working class school pupils aged between 14 and 16 are being bussed regularly from poor urban areas to what the army calls an “ encounter day ” with the Duke of Lancaster Regiment .
There the children do rifle drill and move model SA80s from shoulder to arms length and back with Officer Nick Froehling .
According to the report , rather than use the instruction “ At ease , ” the Officer uses the informal “ Chill , ” supposedly so as not to alienate those under his charge .
The pupils also learn to use a climbing wall , negotiate an obstacle course and complete a one - mile run .
Having successfully completed these tasks , the pupils receive a certificate signed by Lieutenant Colnel L.J. Pitt , commander of recruitment in the northwest region .
All three British armed forces aggressively recruit through advertising that portrays a career in the forces as akin to a student gap year .
Future career prospects and leisure activities are emphasised , while the possibility of killing and being killed is glossed over .
The certificate awarded to the school pupils comes with a glossy teen magazine called Camouflage , a DVD and assorted recruiting paraphernalia .
A recruitment process that begins when the child is just 14 is a measure of the pressure weighing upon the British armed forces .
Juveniles offer a more vulnerable and uninformed demographic base from which to recruit .
Two of the children who attended the event reported by the New Statesmen told the reporter they wished to join up .
Warrant Officer Chris Jones told the New Statesman that the current casual employment opportunities offered by the construction industry and the increasing numbers of children stopping on at school or college to study A levels is not helping the recruitment shortfall .
Armstrong notes that while the army refuses to publish figures it remains clear that much of its intake comes from the most disadvantaged sections of the working class .
Colonel David Allfrey is the officer with responsibility for child recruitment through the Camouflage youth information scheme .
He told the New Statesman how the armed forces had to work to hold the interest of children interested in joining up , but who were too young to do so .
Since the Camouflage strategy was enacted in 2000 the army has processed 271,000 youngsters through their initial involvement with the magazine and associated marketing .
Stephen Armstrong reports that no less than 18 percent of this year ’s recruitment intake were Camouflage members , many of whom signed up when the army visited their schools .
One commuter , Pete Chiaramonte , 41 , who was on his way to work at a towing company in Brooklyn this morning , said he saw what he thought was the storm touching down at around 5.30 a.m. near the corner of 37th Street and 13th Avenue .
“ It was a funnel shape , ” he said .
“ It looked kind of black and blue , ” adding , “ it was way up high and came right down on the roof of ” a department store .
“ Pieces of the roof were all over the place .
It was a big bang . ”
Mayor Bloomberg said this afternoon that the city was being overwhelmed by a weather catastrophe that came in three parts : a blast of rain that flooded streets and railway systems , a vicious storm that tore through Brooklyn , and scorching temperatures that could be followed later today by even more rain .
“ We expect very hot temperatures and perhaps some thunderstorms , ” he said .
“ One of the concerns is that you have buildings without roofs and clearly more rain would do a lot more damage to those buildings . ”

“ Let me caution everybody , ” he added .
“ Please try to stay indoors if possible .
We ’ve opened a number of cooling centers , and 311 will tell you where they are . ”
Many of the weather - related injuries were broken legs and cuts and scrapes caused by shattered glass and fallen trees .
The woman who was killed this morning was driving through an underpass when her car got stuck .
After getting out , she was struck and killed by another car .
Mayor Bloomberg said the driver of the second car had a suspended license and was arrested by the police .
“ Clearly , if we had n’t had the rain storm , this woman would n’t have been there , ” he said .
Even as city officials surveyed the damage and tried to clear away trees and debris throughout Brooklyn , it was still unclear precisely what had struck .
John Christantello , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Upton , N.Y. , said the storm was “ definitely one of the stronger ones we ’ve seen , ” and said it was unclear whether it had reached the definition of a tornado .
The cat 's out of the bag .
We always suspected that those at the top were soaking up the rewards from this booming economy while everyone else treaded water – working longer and harder just to stay alive .
Now , it 's official .
The figures are in , the numbers have been crunched and the verdict is inescapable :
When it comes to work , all Canadians , except the rich , are putting in longer hours .
Yet when it comes to pay , all Canadians , again with the exception of the most well - to - do , are being left behind .
Or , to put it another way :
There 's a party going on but most of us are n't invited .
That 's the gist of a damning report written by Toronto economist Armine Yalnizyan and released today by the leftish Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives .
Yalnizyan , research director for the Community Social Planning Council of Toronto , is known in the trade as a careful analyst who sticks to the facts .
In The Rich and the Rest of Us , she 's done just that .
Her analysis of 28 years of Statistics Canada data on families raising children under the age of 18 found :
The poor are working harder but earning significantly less .
Median annual earnings for the 10 per cent of Canadian families at the very bottom of the income scale stood at $ 3,358 in 1976 .
By 2004 , that figure , adjusted for inflation , had dropped by almost 70 per cent to $ 1,050 .
The not - quite - so - poor are n't doing much better .
A stunning 40 per cent of income earners – those making less than $ 50,000 – are worse off now than in the 1970s , even though they , too , are working longer hours .
The middling classes , those earning between $ 50,000 and $ 85,000 , are managing to hold their own in terms of pay .
But to do so , they 've had to speed up the treadmill .
The roughly 376,000 Canadian families in the middle of the income scale , for instance , are now working 20 per cent more than in the '70s .
But their inflation - adjusted earnings have risen by a mere 2 per cent over three decades .
The rich are laughing .
The top 10 per cent of Canadian families , those with median earnings of $ 166,000 , saw their pay packets rise by 30 per cent since the late ' 70s .
But to earn that money , they do n't have to work more .
In fact , they are working less – by about 5 per cent .

Do You Really Know How Much It Costs To Own Your Car ?
A Ferrari Enzo is one of the most expensive cars around , and every time one of these gets totaled , it ends up in the news .
There was a particular one that was wrecked by comedian and actor Eddie Griffin .
There are not very many of them around , so trashing one will get you some publicity .
Such cars are priced at $ 1.5 million , so the sight of this total loss almost made me wince as hard as when I found out how much my 93,000 mile service was going to cost me last week .
Somehow , I felt the same pain that the loss of such an exotic car must ’ve cost its owner , even though I was simply $ 2,000 lighter .
The amount was such that I wondered if I were being fleeced for what I believe is a straightforward car check up .
Still , I patronize a reputable dealership and my vehicle is an 8 seater van that was bogged down with what the dealer claimed were busted brakes , cracked engine mount , and old sparkplugs .
Take a look at my charges .
Maintenance Fees for One Family Van
Description Labor Parts Total 90,000 Mile Service $ 295.40 $ 104.55 $ 399.95

N/A N/A ( $ 45.28 ) Tax N/ A N/A $ 56.21 TOTAL 1322.19 681.37 $ 2019.49
This is some serious outlay for us !
So before you purchase a vehicle , be aware of its true costs of ownership .
Depending on the kind of car you get , it may end up actually costing you more than you think it will .
Here is a chart showing what a family van can really run you , taking all its costs into consideration .
Incredibly , I ’m seeing that the total cost of owning my van appears to be actually twice the retail price I paid for it !
OUCH .
Chart is from Vincentric.com
Here ’s a review of what affects a car ’s true cost :
Factors Affecting A Car ’s Costs
Brand :
Your car will cost you a bundle if it ’s been built by a manufacturer with a sterling reputation .
Design and Assembly : A well - designed car will be able to withstand accidents and crashes for less damage and consequently , less cost .
For the same type of vehicle , the differences in repair costs can range in the thousands .
Features and Technology : With time , cars have gotten more sophisticated and advanced with the features they offer .
I ca n’t imagine how I ’d survive without the GPS systems that are today , part and parcel of many automobiles .
And I still remember how I was persuaded by a car salesman to purchase a special warranty to cover the electronics of a vehicle I had purchased .
Goes to show that special training may be necessary for dealing with the more specialized parts of cars today .
Where Your Car Was Built :
Do you have a foreign car ?
An imported car will most likely require imported parts and hard - to - find replacement parts may cost you more to track down .
Luxury Status :
By virtue of owing a luxury model , you will probably be subject to higher costs for service and materials .
You will end up paying a premium for the special status of owning such an enviable vehicle .
And to get the real picture , let ’s list all the costs and fees that come with buying the transport of your dreams .
Information was compiled from Vincentric and MSN Money .
Actual Car Ownership Costs
MSRP : This is the manufacturer ’s suggested retail price .
This information can be taken from sites such as Kelley Blue Book or Chrome Systems .
This is more commonly known as the list price or “ sticker price ” , for the large sticker on the windshield as a way to advertise to potential customers .
It does n’t include taxes , registration , transportation to the dealership and other miscellaneous fees .
While most people expect to get a discount off the MSRP , when all of the extraneous charges are added in , the final price might be approximately that of the MSRP , or actually higher .
Maintenance Costs ( scheduled and unscheduled ) :
There are three elements that comprise the maintenance cost : Frequency , Labor Rates , and Parts prices .
In addition , there are both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance .
Repairs : Repair costs are those paid by consumers to keep their vehicles in operating condition , excluding the cost for scheduled maintenance .
Depreciation Costs : Depreciation is the reduction in value a vehicle incurs during a given period of time .
Gas Mileage or Fuel cost :
How well is your car burning its fuel ?
You can estimate your fuel costs by increasing gas prices by 3 % each year to keep up with inflation .
Though gas prices fluctuate , it is still a good idea to budget conservatively .
Insurance cost :
Your actual insurance cost will depend on where you live , your driving record and your age .
It can vary by type of vehicle , driver , and coverage amounts .
Financing :
This is the amount it costs to borrow money for a vehicle purchase .
Every deal will vary depending on the amount of your down payment and your credit rating .
Check the latest auto loan rates to estimate your monthly car payment .
Fees and Taxes :
These administrative fees also add to the cost of owning a vehicle .
Taxes and registration fees vary greatly by state , especially for high priced vehicles .
Opportunity Costs :
This cost takes into account the loss of interest earnings that could be earned with the funds spent on a new vehicle .
The lost “ opportunity ” to earn interest income is an often overlooked cost of buying a vehicle , but nevertheless is critical to understanding overall costs and a key component when comparing one vehicle to another .
We have two cars : a small sedan and a van for the family .
It ’s no surprise then that we want to keep our vehicle maintenance obligations few and limited to what is necessary to run our affairs .
I still wonder why some folks we know bother with more than a couple of cars , but I guess there are just some people who ca n’t help but be attached to their automobiles .
Well then , they ’ll just have to pay up .

A loan for a pesel – does it exist ?
Loan companies meet their clients ’ expectations .
Because they offer a range of facilities , we can count on a telephone loan as well as a loan for proof .
the loan companies ’ loan assortment will also include a pesel loan ?
The pesel loan does not exist , although the pesel number is one .
It often happens that we urgently need money .
However , it is worth remembering not to use a loan on a pesel .
No reliable loan company has such in its offer .
With the help of our financial problems there will be a loan for proof without any certificates that we can get without leaving home .
However , please remember to provide the correct data in the loan application .
Only in this way will we improve the process of withdrawing money from the loan .
Pesel loan – does it exist ?
Loan companies meet the expectations of their clients .
Due to the fact that they offer a range of facilities , we can count on a loan for a phone call as well as a loan for proof .
Will there be a loan for pesel in the assortment of loan companies ?
A pesel loan does not exist .
Although the pesel number is one of the most important data that allows us to apply for a loan , we can not get it by having only this data .
A pesel loan is offered at most by fraudsters who promise to withdraw cash in exchange for one information .
Be careful of all companies that offer this type of service .
On the loan market there is also a fast loan for ID card , in the case of which we do not have to submit additional certificates and it is completely safe .
Loan for evidence – how can I apply for a loan for my data ?
Applying for a proof loan is not difficult .
Let us remind you that the offer of lenders is addressed both to young people and those of old age who can take advantage of a loan for pensioners .
All we need to do to apply for cash is to fill in the application on the lender ’s website .
The document should contain data from our ID card .
Pesel is one of them , but it is not enough information for the loan company to review our application .
It is worth remembering this , especially if we find an offer that will not require anything beyond us .
Such an institution may contribute to extorting loans for stolen personal data .
Before submitting the application , please check the correctness of the information stored in it .
This will improve the customer verification process , then pay out the loan .
It is also good to know the conditions for granting a loan to a given lender .
If we do not meet the requirements , such as age , we will meet with the rejection of the application .
Can the loan be extorted to our data ?
It ’s not often that we lose documents , but it can happen to anyone .
It is important , however , to inform the relevant services about such an event .
Due to the fact that there are loan offers for evidence without certificates , there may be a fear that someone will try to extort consumer credit for our data .
It is worth remembering , however , that loan companies take care of their clients ’ safety and do not allow such a situation .
Each time someone applies for extra cash , he or she is thoroughly checked by the lender .
This is done , among others using identity verification .
Ways of customer verification
The methods of verification of loan companies ’ clients include :
telephone verification – it consists in making a telephone request for the loan and requesting confirmation of the data contained in the application .
Customer service may also require additional information that will tell you if the interlocutor is the person who sent the loan application
verification via courier – an employee of the courier company provides the customer of the loan company to sign the contract .
During the visit , it checks the customer ’s details with those provided in the application .
If they are correct , the consumer may sign a contract .
This is immediately delivered to the financial institution , which then pays the money
verification fee – this is one of the most frequently used methods .
It involves transferring 1 PLN or PLN to the lender ’s account .
In this way , the customer confirms that the account he provided in the application form belongs to him .
Confirmation of this information is very important because it is for this account that the loan institution transfers the money from the loan
How do you check if you have phished our personal information ?
The phishing of personal data is an increasingly common phenomenon .
If we are not sure whether personal data has been stolen due to leakage , we can check it using the BIK report .
All data regarding our creditworthiness are included in it .
In addition , we can see how many current loans we have and whether we pay them back on time .
One of the options of the BIK report is the ability to generate information on whether someone has asked for our data .
In order to protect against phishing of personal data and then taking credit for stolen data , it is worth to run Alert BIK .
This is a service offered by the Credit Information Bureau .
It is to be used to notify you when you try to borrow or credit our data .
Information about this action will be sent via SMS or e-mail .
The service operates 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
If someone has tried to obtain credit for a pesel , you should inform the lender and the police immediately .
PESEL database – what is it and what data is collected ?
Every day , each of us uses their own data and is in contact with information about other people .
It is important , however , to maintain security in connection with the use of them .
One of the places that cumulate information about , among others Polish citizens , is the PESEL database .
It is the Universal Electronic Population Register System , which contains basic information identifying the identity and administrative and legal status of Polish citizens and foreigners living in the Republic of Poland .
The register contains information such as : age , sex , place of residence , country of birth , marital status , parents ’ first and last names , date of departure from the place of permanent residence .
Thanks to the accumulation of such extensive information , which is available only to representatives of the authorities ( including the police , prosecutor ’s office , guards , electoral bodies or state control bodies ) , we can be sure that any attempt to extort the pesel loan will be ineffective .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Cloning animals will not be useful on a large scale but the technology offers farmers an important tool to increase food production and protect animals from disease , scientists said on Tuesday .

Critics contend that not enough is known about cloning to make it safe , while advocates say it can improve the quality of meat and dairy products .
Scientists at a briefing to address the intense debate said the technology was just the next step in artificial breeding and would only ever account for a small part of food production .
“ Cloning is never going to be a large scale breeding system , ” Simon Best , chairman of the UK - based BioIndustry Association , told reporters .
“ It has niche applications . ”
Cloning involves taking cell nuclei from adults and fusing them into egg cells that are implanted into a surrogate mother .
Scientists said some uses could be to clone animals that are less resistant to certain diseases or to reproduce “ elite ” livestock that can churn out more milk or produce healthier offspring .
Keith Campbell , a researcher at the University of Nottingham , compared cloning to artificial insemination -- which the scientists noted was used to breed the cows that produce around 75 percent of milk .
Cloning can also help protect rare or dying breeds , said Campbell , who helped work on cloning the first adult mammal , Dolly the sheep .
“ Cloning is just another technique we can add , ” he said .
“ The ability to integrate cloning into the production line should be allowed to farmers . ”
Scientists said approval of the controversial technology would not lead to a flood of cloned animals because the industry would need to weigh the costs and benefits of the technique .
Europe ’s top food safety agency -- the European Food Safety Authority -- is currently mulling a decision on whether meat and milk from cloned animals are safe to eat and should be in supermarkets across the region .
Best predicted the process would take much longer than in the United States , where the Food and Drug Administration in December issued a draft ruling that said milk and meat from some cloned animals was safe to eat .
“ This is not going to hit the supermarket shelves in Europe for a long time , ” Best said .
“ It will take more time than in the United States and it will be more heavily regulated in Europe . ”

1. The “ Wanker ”
An explanation is n’t really necessary for this one , is it ?
Indeed , the meaning is quite universal — even in Japan .
2 . The “ Dog Call ”
This flirtatious finger - wag is almost always a seductive sign of beckoning , but do n’t use it in the Philippines , unless you ’re trying to seduce a dog .
3 . The “ Thumbs - Up ”
Though it ’s a familiar sign of approval in North America and Europe , be careful with this one in Latin America and West Africa !
4. The “ Moutza ”
This one looks pretty innocent , right ?
Maybe it is where you live — but if you ’re in Greece , Pakistan , or Japan , not so much .
5 . The “ A - OK ”
Scuba divers use this to mean everything ’s all right .
But some use the A - OK to mean that someone is a “ zero ” .
And in Brazil and Germany – well , do n’t use this unless you ’re looking to pick a fight !
6 . The “ Cutis ”
You may not recognize this gesture , but if someone from India or Pakistan gives you the cutis , beware : you ’ve managed to get on their bad side .

Most Americans fail to get the calcium and vitamin D they need , but this shortfall could be affecting more than their bones .
It may , at least in part , be one reason behind the epidemic of type 2 diabetes , suggests new research conducted at Tufts University .
Drinking more milk – a leading source of calcium and vitamin D in the American diet – could help decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes by nearly 15 percent , according to the new meta- analysis and review published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism .
In the thorough analysis of previously published studies , the researchers found chronically low levels of vitamin D were linked to as high as 46 percent greater risk of type 2 diabetes .
Yet boosting vitamin D alone would likely have little effect in healthy adults .
Instead , the researchers suggested that a combination of vitamin D and calcium , like that found in milk , would have the greatest potential to help prevent diabetes , especially among those at highest risk for the disease .
Examining the intake of milk and milk products specifically , the researchers found there was nearly a 15 percent lower risk for type 2 diabetes among individuals with the highest dairy intake ( 3 - 5 servings per day ) compared to those getting less than 1 ½ servings each day .
Most of the studies assessed were observational and the limited number of intervention trials makes definitive conclusions difficult , yet the Tufts researchers suggest calcium and vitamin D may affect the body ’s ability to produce or utilize insulin , the hormone the body makes to process sugar that is impaired in those with diabetes and pre-diabetes .
Beside calcium and vitamin D , milk is the primary beverage source of magnesium , which a second meta - analysis found may also reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes ( 2 ) .
The analysis concludes that for every 100 milligram increase in magnesium up to the recommended dietary intake , the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreased by 15 percent .
Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance syndrome ( or pre-diabetes ) affect a staggering 75 million Americans and death rates from diabetes have increased nearly 45 percent over the past 20 years , elevating the importance of finding new ways to treat and prevent this deadly disease .
Milk is a primary source of calcium and vitamin D in the American diet .
In fact , government reports indicate that more than 70 percent of the calcium in our nation ’s food supply comes from milk and milk products .
Additionally , milk is one of the few food sources of vitamin D , which is fast emerging as a “ super nutrient . ”
The recommended three servings of lowfat or fat - free milk provides 900 mg of calcium , 300 IU of vitamin D and 80 mg of magnesium daily .

As if TiVo honestly needed any more reasons to fear for its life , it looks like the forthcoming version of the General Public License could actually do more " harm to its business . "
It the firm 's most recent regulatory filing , it warned that the third version of the aforementioned license " would prohibit manufacturers of consumer appliances that use open source software from implementing technical measures designed to prevent user modifications , " essentially giving the TiVo hackers of the world even fewer hoops to jump through .
TiVo fears that if GPLv3 is widely adopted , it may be " unable to incorporate future enhancements to the GNU / Linux operating system into its software , " which would obviously affect the outfit in a negative fashion .
Notably , Novell has also spoken up about how this latest document could " disrupt its Linux distribution partnership with Microsoft , " but unless something major happens rather hastily , the Free Software Foundation reportedly expects GPLv3 to be published sometime this summer .
How Being a Lousy Journal Editor Nearly Ended Up Getting Me Sent to Guantanamo Bay
I am an editor at one of the top academic economic journals , the Journal of Political Economy .
I handle between 150 and 200 manuscripts a year , deciding whether or not the journal should publish each of them .
It takes a lot of time — something I ’ve been short on lately .
I ’ve turned into a lousy journal editor as a consequence .
I used to be a good editor .
And when I was good , I instituted a policy at the journal of having a report produced at the end of each month that detailed exactly how many overdue manuscripts each editor had .
It turned out to be a very powerful social incentive for getting editors to do their jobs better .
It is embarrassing when your colleagues see that you have n’t been doing your job .
A few days ago , with the end of the month approaching and my stack of JPE manuscripts threatening to reach to the ceiling , I decided I had no choice but to get up early and do some editorial work before catching an afternoon flight .
I left the house at 4:30 AM .
Much to the chagrin of my children who would wake up a few hours later , I grabbed the container that held what remained of the Entenmann ’s cheese danish that we all like so much .
Later at my office , as I polished off the last piece of danish , I noticed that someone had left a long , sharp knife in the tin that had contained the danish .
We do that at my house so we do n’t get a new knife dirty each time .
So I threw the knife into the sack that had my JPE manuscripts to bring home .
Five hours later , I had only managed to finish half of my outstanding manuscripts —
I would have to bring the remainder of them on the airplane with me if I wanted to finish them .
I threw the sack of manuscripts into my suitcase and headed to the airport .
Groggy from getting up so early , I cursed myself when I realized I had left my beloved iPod at home and would be without it for the trip .
I went through TSA screening without any problem .
( Not like once in the past when I got into some trouble . )
Standing on the tarmac , just as I was about to board my commuter plane , I remembered that I had my sack of manuscripts in my suitcase , which I had to leave on a luggage cart because the overhead bins are so small on these little planes .
So I opened up the suitcase , grabbed , the sack of JPE manuscripts , and as I pulled it out , the long , sharp knife I had forgotten completely about went skittering across the ground .
The knife had n’t seemed so ominous in my office , but in this context , with a blade about six inches long , it looked pretty scary .
I looked around .
Despite a lot of hustle and bustle , no one seemed to have noticed my knife .
What next ?
I could just leave it there on the ground and scurry onto the plane .
But when they found it , maybe they would do something crazy like stop the flight from leaving .
I thought about kicking it under the luggage cart out of view .
That did n’t seem like a great idea either .
Finally , I nonchalantly ambled over to the knife , picked it up , stuffed it back into the suitcase , and got on the plane .
What could I have done with that knife ?
I probably could have hijacked the plane armed with that knife and a team of 15 commandos with assault weapons .
Absent the commandos , I was thinking the knife might be useful for slitting my wrists over the despondency that accompanied not having my iPod .
I find it surprising that with all the resources that are poured into airport security these days , my knife went through the machines undetected .
You might argue , well , it was only one case — of course they ca n’t catch everything .
But , the thing is , this is the only time I ’ve tried to bring a knife .
They did n’t catch it .
From the perspective of a Bayesian updater , that moves my beliefs about how likely they are to catch a random knife carrier quite a bit downwards .
I wonder what , if anything , would have happened had an airport employee been standing next to me when the knife fell out of my bag ?
At one level , I would hope the answer would be nothing .
I ’m obviously not a terrorist , just a sleep - deprived , bumbling academic .
On the other hand , if you do n’t intensively interrogate or punish people who successfully sneak through security with dangerous weapons , what is the point of the security in the first place ?
I guess I ’ll just have to smuggle another knife through next time , intentionally drop it on the tarmac this time when someone is looking , and then see what happens .

An interesting feature of dependent data types is the ability to erase not only types , but also data , except where needed .
Consider vector concatentation :
cat :: ( n:: Nat ) -> Vec n a -> ( m:: Nat ) -> Vec m a -> Vec ( n+m ) a cat _ Nil _ bs = bs cat n ( Cons a as ) m bs = Cons a ( cat ( undefined : : ( n - 1 ) ) as m bs )
cat :: ( n:: Nat ) => Vec n a -> ( m:: Nat ) => Vec m a -> Vec ( n+m ) a cat Nil bs = bs cat ( Cons a as ) bs = Cons a ( cat as bs ) length :: ( n:: Nat ) => Vec n a ->
Nat length ( v:: Vec n a ) = n
data Vec = Nil :: Vec 0 a | Cons :: a -> Vec n a -> Vec ( n+1 ) a -- inferred code -- vec_n Nil = 0 vec_n ( Cons _ as ) = 1 + vec_n as
let a = [ 1,2,3 ] b = [ 4,5,6,7 ] in length ( a ++ b)
The n and m parameters are never used .
Therefore , the compiler can erase them .
If the caller needs those values , it can always hold onto them itself .
As a notational convenience , I will indicate values that should not be explicitly entered by following them with => , since that 's how Haskell indicates class constraints .
So , quickly , how does the compiler know what n is ?
The simplest solution is that the code is generated from the type signature ( theorem proving ! ) :
This can be generated automatically because of the inductive definition of Vec .
But there 's more .
I just said that a double arrow meant that a value did n't have to be typed ; I did n't say that it would n't be passed as a parameter .
Of course , the compiler does n't have to call the generated vec_n .
If it knows statically what the i parameter of the type is , it can just use that ( assuming that length can be inspected ) .
As a trivial example :
In this case , we statically know ( a:: Vec 3 x ) and ( b:: Vec 4 x ) , so ( a++b:: Vec 7 x ) , for some value of x , and length extracts 7 without doing any work .

During a week of mayhem in Iraq , in which terrorists have rightly been condemned for targeting schoolchildren , it is sobering to recall that this week is also the 62nd anniversary of a U.S. attack that deliberately took the lives of thousands of children on their way to school in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
As noted in the Strategic Bombing Survey conducted at President Harry Truman ’s request , when the bomb hit Hiroshima on Aug. 6 , 1945 , “ nearly all the school children … were at work in the open , ” to be exploded , irradiated or incinerated in the perfect firestorm that the planners back at the University of California - run Los Alamos lab had envisioned for the bomb ’s maximum psychological impact .
The terror plot worked all too well , as Hiroshima ’s Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba recalled this week : “ That fateful summer , 8:15 a.m .
The roar of a B - 29 breaks the morning calm .
A parachute opens in the blue sky .
Then suddenly , a flash , an enormous blast — silence — hell on Earth .
The eyes of young girls watching the parachute were melted .
Their faces became giant charred blisters .
The skin of people seeking help dangled from their fingernails . …
Others died when their eyeballs and internal organs burst from their bodies —
Hiroshima was a hell where those who somehow survived envied the dead . ”
Like most of the others killed by the two American bombs , neither the children nor the adults had any role in Japan ’s decision to go to war , but they were picked as the target instead of an isolated but fortified military base whose antiaircraft fire posed a higher risk .
The target preferred by U.S. atomic scientists — a patch in the ocean or unpopulated terrain — was rejected , because the effect of hundreds of thousands of civilians dying would be all the more dramatic .
The victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were available soft targets , much like the children playing in Iraq , suddenly caught in the crossfire of battles waged beyond their control .
In “ White Light / Black Rain , ” a devastating HBO documentary released this week , there is an interview with the sole survivor of a Japanese elementary school of 620 students .
The murder of the other 619 , and the 370,000 overall deaths attributed to the bombings , 85 percent of which were civilian deaths , has never compelled a widespread examination of the “ end justifies the means ” morality of our own state - sanctioned acts of terror .
Indeed , the horrifying footage taken by Japanese and American cameramen soon after the devastation , and shown in the HBO film , was long kept secret by the U.S. government for fear that an informed American public might question this nation ’s incipient nuclear arms race .
Just exactly what distinguishes the United States ’ use of the ever - so - cutely - named “ Fat Man ” and “ Little Boy ” atomic bombs on cities in Japan from the car bombs of Baghdad or the planes that smashed into the World Trade Center ?
To even raise the question , as was found in one recent university case , can be a career - ending move .
Of course , we had our justifications , as terrorists always do .
Truman defended his decision to drop the atomic bombs on civilians over the objection of leading atomic scientists on the grounds that it was a necessary military action to save lives by forcing a quick Japanese surrender .
He insisted on that imperative despite the objections of top military figures , including Gen. Dwight Eisenhower , who contended that the war would end quickly without dropping the bomb .
The subsequent release of formerly secret documents makes a hash of Truman ’s rationalization .
His White House was fully informed that the Japanese were on the verge of collapse , and their surrender was made all the more likely by the Soviets ’ imminent entry into the fight .
At most , the Japanese were asking for the face - saving gesture of retaining their emperor , and even that modest demand would likely have been abandoned with the shift of massive numbers of Allied troops and firepower from the battlefront of a defeated Germany to a confrontation with its deeply wounded Asian ally .
Instead , the U.S. played midwife to the birth of the nuclear monster , the ultimate terrorist weapon that presents a continuing and growing threat to the survival of human life on Earth .
This is a lesson to be pondered at a time when President Bush plays power games with a nuclear - equipped Russia while coddling Pakistan , the main proliferator of nuclear weapons to rogue regimes , and Congress authorizes an expansion of the U.S. nuclear program to better fight the war on terror by “ improving ” the ultimate weapon of terror , which the U.S. alone stands guilty of using .

Why is Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) so prevalent ?
If it were merely maladaptive , we would expect it to be just as tragic but far more rare , perhaps even fixed out of some populations .
Over at Mind Hacks , a hint that the explanation might be selectable antagonistic pleiotropy : a situation in which a gene with a deleterious effect late in life can be positively selected because of a beneficial effect during the reproductive or child - rearing years .
Apparently the Apolipoprotein - E epsilon - 4 allele , one of the major genetic risk factors for AD , makes you smarter , fitter , and ( for all we know ) better - looking in early life :
A fascinating study published in this month ’s Cerebral Cortex reports that a gene known to massively increase the risk of Alzheimer ’s disease in later life is associated , in young people , with better memory performance and more efficient use of the brain ’s memory structures . …
A key question is why people who carry the Epsilon 4 allele would have a more efficient brain system for memory in early life but are more likely to have these same memory systems degrade in later life , as happens in Alzheimer ’s disease .
As Alzheimer ’s typically strikes after the time most people have children , the researchers suggest that the Epsilon 4 allele could confer an evolutionary advantage without adversely affecting chances of reproduction .
Some evidence that supports this idea has been found in previous studies where the ApoE Epsilon 4 allele has been associated with higher IQ scores , reduced heart activity under stress , and reduced chance of difficulties during pregnancy and post - birth problems .
Regarding the question in paragraph 2 of the excerpt ( “ Why might something good for your memory early be bad for your memory late ? ” ) , it might be fruitful to visualize “ memory ” as an emergent property of a lot of neurons working together , rather than as the setting of a single imaginary dial ( in which case one is forced to ponder why one gene would swing the dial in opposite directions in youth and old age ) .
ApoE-epsilon - 4 might be comparatively better than other alleles at doing something good for neurons — for example , delivering the lipids that neurons need to make their membranes , which in turn are required for signaling and connectivity ; the happy neurons then make a more efficient brain , which in turn is for some combination of reasons better at making babies — but the very same feature ( or perhaps even the specific proportions of distinct types of lipid molecules delivered by this allele ) might , slowly over time , create an environment more conducive to the growth of amyloid plaques .
That ’s a total swing in the dark , of course ; I ’m merely presenting an example of the type of mechanism by which antagonistic pleiotropy might act , if that ’s really what ’s going on .
It ’s possible that the early - life IQ and memory benefits are epiphenomena of the true selectable benefit ( e.g. , the cardiovascular phenotype , which it ’s not hard to imagine resulting in improved mental function ) — or , for that matter , some as - yet - unheralded effect on sperm count .
It does seem particularly pernicious that the same trait might give some people better brains early in life and worse brains ( and terrible suffering , for themselves and their families ) later in life .
It ’s almost like evolution is n’t fair .
VIENNA ( AP ) 
Iran 's willingness to answer questions about its nuclear program will not save it from new U.N. sanctions , a U.S. envoy said Wednesday , describing Tehran 's new openness as an attempt to deflect " attention from its ... bomb - making capabilities . "
But the U.S. stance drew criticism , with some diplomats suggesting Washington was trying to derail important progress in getting to the bottom of Iran 's nuclear secrets in its drive to impose new U.N. penalties .
The 35 - nation board of the International Atomic Energy Agency , or IAEA , focuses on Iran next month , and the conflicting views suggested that meeting would see Washington and its closest allies in clashes with countries less hawkish on Iran .
Iran and the Vienna - based IAEA — the U.N. nuclear watchdog — said Tuesday they had agreed on a timetable for Tehran to respond to lingering questions over its controversial nuclear activities .
In criticizing Tehran , chief U.S. delegate to the IAEA Gregory Schulte accused it of " clearly trying to take the attention from its continued development of bomb - making capabilities . "
" I do n't think the Security Council will be distracted , " Schulte said .
" We are continuing to move forward with other members of the Security Council on a third resolution . "
" If Iran 's leaders truly want the world 's trust , they would ... start to cooperate fully and unconditionally and suspend activities of international concern , " Schulte said , alluding to council demands that Tehran freeze its uranium enrichment program and stop construction of a plutonium - producing reactor .
Schulte spoke to reporters in a conference call a day after Iranian and IAEA officials announced they had agreed on a schedule .
The quick U.S response reflected concern about possible erosion of support for new sanctions .
Full Iranian cooperation with the agency 's nuclear investigation is only one of the council 's demands , but Schulte said Tehran must meet all others to avoid new U.N. punishment .
Of most concern are activities that could lead to the making of nuclear weapons — uranium enrichment , which can produce fuel and the core of warheads , and the building of the reactor to produce plutonium — also weapons material .
" These activities are not necessary for peaceful purposes , but are necessary to build a bomb , " Schulte said .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said the United States believed the council " must move forward as soon as possible with additional sanctions . "
Iranian and IAEA officials did not say whether Tehran was ready to answer all outstanding questions .
But Schulte suggested otherwise .
" We understand there are real limitations with the plan , " he said , including Iran 's refusal to implement an agreement allowing IAEA inspectors broad powers to conduct inspections of suspicious sites on short notice .
Two diplomats and a U.N. official familiar with the timetable disagreed , however , saying substantial progress was being made in lifting the veil of Iran 's nuclear secrecy .
All spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential issues with the Associated Press .
" This appears to be a deliberate ( U.S. ) campaign to derail the process , " said one of the diplomats , who is familiar with the thinking of senior IAEA officials .
" It is dangerous to dismiss it before even having seen the details . "
Iran has refused to answer questions about secret plutonium experiments in the mid-1990s and IAEA findings that Iran has not accounted for all the plutonium it has said it possessed .
IAEA experts also want to know more about unexplained traces of plutonium and enriched uranium found last year at a nuclear waste facility , and about the so - called Green Salt Project .
Diplomats told the AP last year that the agency was trying to follow up on U.S. intelligence that described the Green Salt project as linking uranium enrichment - related experiments to nuclear - related high explosives and warhead design .
Iran dismissed that intelligence as " based on false and fabricated documents . "
Other IAEA findings of concern include traces of enriched uranium found at a military site , and Iranian diagrams the IAEA has seen that explain how to form uranium metal into the shape of a warhead .
Iran 's refusal to cooperate has led to two sets of Security Council sanctions since last year .

In the 40 minutes before a woman ’s death last month at Martin Luther King Jr. - Harbor Hospital , two separate callers pleaded with 911 dispatchers to send help because the hospital staff was ignoring her as she writhed on the floor , according to audio recordings of the calls .
“ My wife is dying and the nurses do n’t want to help her out , ” Jose Prado , the woman ’s boyfriend , told the 911 dispatcher through an interpreter .
He was calling from a pay phone outside the hospital , his tone increasingly desperate as he described how his 43 - year - old girlfriend was spitting up blood .
The Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department dispatcher struggled to make sense of his predicament , then urged him to contact a doctor or nurse .

“ Paramedics are not going to pick him up , or pick his wife up , from a hospital , because she ’s already at one , ” the dispatcher said .
Eight minutes later , an unidentified woman , apparently another patient , dialed 911 and reached a different dispatcher .
After a short debate about whether the call was an emergency , the dispatcher scolded her and insisted that it was not .
The 2 1/2 - minute call ended on a hostile note .
“ May God strike you too for acting the way you just acted , ” the frustrated caller told the dispatcher , just before 2 a.m. on May 9 .
“ No .
Negative ma’am , you ’re the one , ” the dispatcher responded before disconnecting .

The patient , Edith Isabel Rodriguez , was pronounced dead at 2:17 a.m. , the victim of “ inexcusable ” indifference by staff at King - Harbor , county health officials later acknowledged .
Rodriguez lay untreated on the ER lobby floor for 45 minutes before dying .
A video camera captured the episode , showing that staffers and patients stood by as a janitor cleaned the floor around her .
She was buried in Tehachapi on Tuesday .
The county coroner ruled that Rodriguez died of a perforated bowel , with the injury probably occurring in her last 24 hours of life .
Experts have said that the condition might have been treatable if caught earlier .
The incident is the latest high - profile lapse at King - Harbor , formerly known as King / Drew , which has been dogged by troubles almost since its inception .
The Willowbrook hospital ’s fate is uncertain as it prepares for a final review by federal officials to determine whether it should retain crucial funding .

Rodriguez ’s death was just one of the King - Harbor issues discussed Tuesday during a meeting of the county Board of Supervisors .
Also at that meeting , the county health services director disclosed that the hospital had replaced its medical director , citing his handling of an unrelated lapse in patient care .
In that case , a man with a brain tumor languished without treatment in the ER for four days before he was taken elsewhere by family and friends for emergency surgery .
In Rodriguez ’s case , the 911 recordings were released by the Sheriff ’s Department in response to California Public Records Act requests by The Times .
Both illustrate how confounding it was for the emergency response system to handle a bizarre scenario in which a patient dying in plain sight at a hospital could not get treatment there .
“ What ’s real confusing ... was that she was at a medical facility , ” said Sheriff ’s Capt .
Steven M. Roller , who is in charge of the Century Station , which handled the calls .
“ That poses some real quandaries . ”
At the same time , Roller said , the dismissive tone of the second dispatcher , who was not identified , was inappropriate .

“ As a station commander , I do n’t like any of my employees getting rude or nasty with any caller , regardless , and in that particular case , obviously , the employee ’s conduct could have been better , ” Roller said .
The employee received written “ counseling , ” Roller said .
The unidentified dispatcher to whom Roller referred kept cutting off the female bystander .
“ Ma’am , I can not do anything for you for the quality of the hospital there , ” the dispatcher said .
“ Do you understand what I ’m saying ?
This line is for emergency purposes only .... 911 is used for emergency purposes only . ”
The woman replied , “ This is an emergency , mister . ”

The dispatcher cut her off .
“ It is not an emergency .
It is not an emergency , ma’am . ”
“ It is , ” the woman said .
“ It is not an emergency , ” the dispatcher replied .
“ You ’re not here to see how they ’re treating her , ” the bystander said .

“ OK , well , that ’s not a criminal thing .
You understand what I ’m saying ? ” the dispatcher said .
“ Excuse me , if this woman fall out and die , what [ do ] you mean there ai n’t a criminal thing ? ” the woman said .
Roller said the Sheriff ’s Department does not have a policy for responding to calls for medical aid from hospitals .
He said the two 911 calls were n’t linked by dispatchers because neither was deemed to merit a response , and therefore neither was logged in the computer as a call for service .
In the days leading up to her death , Rodriguez had sought care in the King - Harbor emergency room three times .
Each time she was released after receiving prescription drugs for pain .
On May 8 , however , she did not leave the hospital but instead lay on the benches in front of its main entrance .

County police officers found her there and helped escort her to the emergency room .
There , a triage nurse told Rodriguez that nothing could be done to help her .
Meanwhile , police ran a computer check on Rodriguez and found that she had a no - bail warrant for her arrest .
As she was being taken to a squad car to be placed in custody , she became unresponsive .
She died a short time later in the ER .
On Tuesday morning , Rodriguez ’s family gathered at a Pico Rivera memorial chapel to bid farewell to the California native , one of 13 siblings .
They had delayed a funeral service for more than a month because they did n’t have money to pay for it .
One of her sisters arranged fundraisers , selling homemade tamales to pay the about $ 7,500 tab .
A wreath of red roses and white carnations with the banner “ Beloved Mother and Grandmother ” adorned Rodriguez ’s pastel pink casket .

The 30 or so family and friends in attendance listened solemnly to the priest ’s eulogy as a digital slideshow of pictures played on two flat - screen televisions framing the casket .
Her three grown children quietly sobbed in the chapel ’s front row , holding two of her four grandchildren .
“ We know we have the responsibility to make sure justice is done for our mother , ” said Edmundo Rodriguez , Edith ’s 25 - year - old son , in an interview at the service .
“ We just do n’t want this to happen again . ”

Regarding Bush ’s Vietnam speech and other manglings of history — Glenn Greenwald wrote last week :
On a different note , is the curriculum for history classes in some American states restricted to learning about Hitler and the Nazis and 1938 and Hitler and Germany ?
It must be , because there are many right - wing fanatics whose entire understanding of the world is reduced in every instance to that sole historical event — as though the world began in 1937 , ended in 1945 , and we just re-live that moment in time over and over and over : Love war ?
You are Churchill , a noble warrior .
Oppose war ?
You ’re Chamberlain , a vile appeaser .
And everyone else is Hitler .
That , more or less , composes the full scope of “ thought ” among this strain on the right .
These words gave me an epiphany :
The key to understanding right - wing rhetoric can be found in an episode of the television series Star Trek : The Next Generation .
In “ Darmok ” ( originally aired 1991 ) the crew of the Enterprise encounters the Tamarians , a people with an incomprehensible language .
“ We come in peace , ” say the Enterprise crew .
“ Darmok and Jalad at Tenagra , ” reply the Tamarians .
“ Temba , his arms wide . ”
The Next Generationers are baffled .
But then Captain Picard and Dathon the Tamarian have an adventure together battling an invisible beast , and during this adventure Picard has a “ Helen Keller at the water pump ” moment and realizes that Tamarians speak in metaphors taken from stories .
For example , “ Darmok and Jalad at Tenagra ” refers to two enemies , Darmok and Jalad , who became allies at Tenagra .
As a phrase , it means “ Let ’s put aside our differences and be friends . ”
So after much suspense and drama and the death of the unfortunate Dathon , by the end of the episode Picard knows enough Tamarian to say , “ Bye .
It ’s been real . ”
When I saw this episode I wondered how a people who speak only in metaphors could develop technology .
I imagined them trying to fix plumbing , saying “ Toona and the floods of Wippawop ” to mean “ who ’s got the basin wrench ? ”
It seems cumbersome .
But let ’s worry about that some other time .
The point I want to make here is that when righties talk about history , they are not talking about what actually happened in the past .
Instead , they are evoking historical persons and events as archetype and allegory .
Thus , when they speak of Winston Churchill , they are not speaking of the real Winston Churchill .
They are speaking of what Winston Churchill represents in their minds , which is the stubborn refusal to back down from a fight .
In fact , the real Winston Churchill wrote a letter to Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1922 advising him that British troops should abandon Iraq .
I think we should now put definitely , not only to Feisal but to the Constituent Assembly , the position that unless they beg us to stay and to stay on our own terms in regard to efficient control , we shall actually evacuate before the close of the financial year .
I would put this issue in the most brutal way , and if they are not prepared to urge us to stay and to co-operate in every manner I would actually clear out .
That at any rate would be a solution . …
At present we are paying eight millions a year for the privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano out of which we are in no circumstances to get anything worth having .
But instead of actually studying the life and words of Churchill for understanding , righties simply evoke the man as an archetype of bulldog , never - give - up tenacity .
I ’ve read that Bush keeps a bust of Churchill in the oval office , for inspiration .
And perhaps there ’s something like tantric identity yoga going on here ; Bush imagines himself to be the great Churchill , the wrathful Archangel of Stubbornness .
Very likely righties associate Churchill with his great oratory of World War II and know little else about him .
They do n’t stop to consider that in his “ blood , sweat , and tears ” speech Churchill was talking about a major military power capable of raining bombs on London ( and , in fact , preparing to do so ) .
Hitler ’s Germany and today ’s Iraq are in no way equivalent — except in the minds of righties , for whom “ Hitler ” has become the Demon Enemy whose spirit infests the bodies of all enemies , whoever they are and whatever their capabilities and intentions .
By the same token , Neville Chamberlain is the archetype of cowardly appeasement .
Righties may know little else about the man except that he “ appeased ” Hitler — not an uncommon practice among right wingers of the 1930s , who considered Hitler and Mussolini to be swell guys who hated communism as much as they did .
In fact , former White House correspondent Lynne Olson argued awhile back that Bush was a lot more like the real Chamberlain than the real Churchill :
Like Bush , and unlike Churchill , Chamberlain came to office with almost no understanding of foreign affairs or experience in dealing with international leaders .
None the less , he was convinced that he alone could bring Hitler and Mussolini to heel .
He surrounded himself with like - minded advisers , and refused to heed anyone who told him otherwise .
In the months leading up to war , Chamberlain and his men saw little need to build a strong coalition of European allies to confront Nazi Germany – ignoring appeals from Churchill and others to fashion a “ grand alliance ” .
Unlike Bush and Chamberlain , Churchill was never in favour of his country going it alone .
Throughout the 1930s , while urging Britain to rearm , he strongly supported using the League of Nations – the forerunner of the United Nations – to provide smaller countries with one - for - all and all - for - one security .
After the league failed to stop fascism ’s march , Churchill was adamant that Britain must form a true partnership with France and even reach agreement with the despised Soviet Union , neither of which Chamberlain was willing to do .
Like Bush , Chamberlain laid claim to unprecedented executive authority , evading the checks and balances supposed to constrain the office of prime minister .
He scorned dissenting views , inside and outside government .
When Chamberlain arranged his face - to - face meetings with Hitler in 1938 that ended in the catastrophic Munich conference , he did so without consulting his cabinet .
He also bypassed the House of Commons , leading Harold Macmillan , a future Tory prime minister and then an anti-appeasement MP , to complain that Chamberlain was treating parliament “ like a Reichstag , to meet only to hear the orations and to register the decrees of the government ” .
Olson goes on in this vein for a while — really , there are a number of startling parallels between Bush and Chamberlain , so do read the whole thing .
About a year ago Keith Olbermann also made some Bush - Chamberlain comparisons on Countdown .
In the rightie mind , any attempt to avoid war is “ appeasement . ”
In his new book A Tragic Legacy , Glenn Greenwald writes ( p. 177 ) that when Ronald Reagan signed the INF treaty with the Soviet Union in 1988 , rightie editorialists everywhere evoked Neville Chamberlain and accused Reagan of “ appeasement . ”
Earlier , in 1984 , Newt Gingrich scorned Reagan ’s rapprochement with Gorbachev as “ the most dangerous summit for the West since Adolph Hitler met with Chamberlain in 1938 at Munich . ”
Got that ?
All “ enemies ” are Hitler ( whatever you think of Gorbachev , he ’s hardly Hitler ) .
So much as meeting with “ enemies ” is Chamberlain and Hitler at Munich .
So how do we deal with nations whose interests do n’t harmonize with ours ?
Rightie mythos leaves us with no option but war .
Speaking of Reagan — this past January , conservative Ron Dreher spoke on NPR about why he became a Republican :
My first real political memory came in 1979 .
It was listening to Jimmy Carter tell the nation about the failed hostage rescue mission .
I hated him for that .
I hated him for the whole Iran mess , shaming America before our enemies with weakness and incompetence .
When Ronald Reagan was elected president the next year , I stayed up late to hear his victory speech .
America was saved .
I was 13 years old , and I was a Reaganite from that moment on .
My generation came of age politically under Reagan .
To me , he was strong and confident .
Democrats were weak and depressed .
Like so many other Gen - X’ers , I disliked people I thought of as hippies , those blame America first liberals so hung up on Vietnam .
They surrendered to the communists back then , just like they want to do that .
Republicans were winners , Democrats defeatists .
What more did you need to know ?
The point of Dreher ’s essay is that the Iraq War caused him to realize , suddenly and painfully , that the dirty bleeping hippies ( whose spirits infest the dark nightmares of righties , who still fear them , even though I have n’t spotted a live one since about 1974 ) had reasons to be opposed to the Vietnam War .
This , apparently , had never dawned on him before .
Dreher seems to have believed that hippies oppose war for the same reason swallows return to Capistrano — it ’s just the nature of the beast .
I call today ’s righties the “ Reagan generation ” because so many of them are Gen - X ’ers whose first memories of politics and national events involved Carter and Reagan .
They were n’t so much taught politics as imprinted with the Reagan mythos .
For them , all Democrats are Jimmy Carter , an archetype of wimpy passivity .
Reagan represents confidence , action , sunniness .
The two of them together represent opposing forces that tell the entire story of American politics .
Nothing more needs to be understood or thought through .
Democrats bad , Republicans good , end of argument .
The actual persons Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan are / were far more complicated than the Carter and Reagan archetypes , of course , and they both have / had their virtues and flaws .
Today ’s righties have forgotten the “ Reagan and Gorbachev sign the INF treaty ” story , and it has passed out of rightie mythos .
They also persistently overlook Reagan ’s raising of taxes after he lowered them and his quick skedaddle out of Lebanon after the Marine barracks tragedy .
What ’s important to them is not what Reagan actually did as President , but what he represents emotionally and mythically .
In fact , the mythical Carter / Reagan dichotomy — Carter as murky , depressed , weak , passive and Reagan as clear , sunny , strong , and active — is exactly the yin / yang dichotomy .
I could write a whole ‘ nother post on gender politics and the many associations of liberalism with femininity and conservatism with masculinity , never mind reality .
In fact , I did write that post awhile back .
But for now , I just want to point to this as another layer of the right - wing subconscious and postulate that men with gender insecurity are more likely to lean right than left .
So yesterday , after years of denying historical comparisons between Iraq and Vietnam , President Bush delivered a speech comparing Iraq to Vietnam .
To which much of America responded , WTF ?
Today America ’s newspapers are peppered with complaints from historians that Bush ’s speech distorted the facts of the Vietnam War .
But of course ; what actually happened during and after the war was not the point .
He was speaking to those still inclined to support the war , and to them , Vietnam represents national disgrace .
It also represents allowing the forces of darkness to scamper unhindered over the land .
When Bush spoke of “ killing fields , ” for example , rightie listeners could relate .
There was a movie about that , after all , never mind that the killing fields of Cambodia did n’t happen because America withdrew from Vietnam , but because we were bleeping there .
“ It is undoubtedly true that America ’s failure in Vietnam led to catastrophic consequences in the region , especially in Cambodia , ” said David C. Hendrickson , a specialist on the history of American foreign policy at Colorado College in Colorado Springs .
“ But there are a couple of further points that need weighing , ” he added .
“ One is that the Khmer Rouge would never have come to power in the absence of the war in Vietnam — this dark force arose out of the circumstances of the war , was in a deep sense created by the war .
The same thing has happened in the Middle East today .
Foreign occupation of Iraq has created far more terrorists than it has deterred . ”
Ah , but let us not bother with facts .
Facts are for wonks and women .
Real men , heroic men , listen to their hearts , or perhaps something else located along the lower part of the brain stem .
We need not fear actual consequences of our actions .
Our quest is to re-enter the heart of darkness and slay the demon therein , even though he is probably us .
And if we fail , the failure will not be ours , but will be the Democratic Party ’s .
Win /win .
We lefties sometimes persist in trying to reason with righties .
I ’ve given up , mind you , but there are those who still try .
But I say this is futile .
As with the encounter between the Enterprise and the Tamarians , we do n’t understand each others words .
“ We want what ’s best for America , ” we say .
“ Chamberlain and Hitler at Munich ! ” they cry .
“ Sam Waterson and John Malkovich in Phnom Penh ! FDR at Yalta ! ”
Perhaps they would listen to us if we convinced them we were channeling the spirit of John Wayne at Iwo Jima .

Mathematical cognition and happiness Mathematical cognition and happiness
Yeah , I never thought I 'd write something with that title either , but serendipity happens .
Today I read an article on the brain is a difference detector ; almost everything that it senses , it senses as a comparison . "
Now ,
They cite other experiments that show that the mind intuitively processes such arrays , and presumably quantities of things generally , using a ratio rather than tallying the absolute value of each -- it 's easier to discriminate sets with 6 vs 9 items than sets with 4 vs 5 items , since the ratio is more lopsided in the former case ( deviates farther from 1.0 ) , despite involving greater quantities in both sets compared to the latter case .
In reviewing another study that did n't find the link between the IPS and non-symbolic numerical processing , they note that it did n't vary the surface area covered by the items -- so , the activation of the IPS there may well be due to detecting differences in surface area .
This leads the authors to speculate that the IPS is involved in processing magnitudes in general , again using a ratio .
So , if humans have a deeply rooted cognitive bias to ignore absolute value and focus just on the ratio between two things ( or sets of things ) that differ in magnitude , that would explain why having the worst house in the swankiest nabe wo n't make you as happy as having the most luxurious house on a street otherwise lined with run-down eyesores .
Unable to appreciate the last - place mansion 's absolute value , which most people can only hope for , we can only notice the lopsided ratio of its value to the mean value for the neighborhood .
Sure , there 's someone out there living in a delapidated tenement , but occasional , fleeting imaginations are n't as vivid and reliable as persistent realities .
I commute to work at a tutoring center in a well - to - do Maryland suburb of DC , and I 'm always amazed at how spoiled some of the kids are .
But if brat A is only human , they can't fathom the absolute value of their luxuries , only how their stack compares to that of brat B .
These observations are n't terribly new ( i.e. , that happiness is based on comparisons to others , and pie charts or bar graphs convey data better than raw tables ) , but they 've been more fleshed out empirically -- we even know where in the brain one of the culprits is located -- and it's cool to see how seemingly disparate parts fit together .
Yeah , I never thought I 'd write something with that title either , but serendipity happens .
Today I read an article on mathematical cognition in adults and 4 year - olds from the new PLoS Biology , and I was trying to think of something neat to say about it , rather than just summarize what they found .
So I put that on the back burner and decided to kill some time over at Edge , where this new vignette on happiness by Daniel Gilbert caught my attention .
This quote from an interview on his website jumped out : as for the advice that you should buy the worst house in the hottest neighborhood rather than the best house in a modest area --
" It will make you feel bad because .
" Now , elsewhere he complains that psychologists suffer from physics envy , but lower - level research is necessary if we want a fully integrated picture .
And sure enough , the authors of that PLoS article have shown that the Intraparietal Sulcus ( IPS ) is likely the locus of non-symbolic numerical processing -- that is , being able to tell how many things are in a visual array or how many tones are in an auditory sequence ( " non-symbolic " because no numerals like 1 or 9 are involved ) .
In brief , in both adults and 4 - y.o. kids , this region of the brain lit up more when the number of circles in a series of slides abruptly changed from , say , 16 to 8 or 24 .
A different region lit up more when the circles abruptly changed to squares or triangles .
The authors note that this did not involve mentally counting the items " one , two , three ... sixteen ... twenty - four , " as many of the 4 - y.o.s could not count that high .
Rather , it must be the impression that " there are greater or fewer things than before . "
The circles in the slideshow varied in density , cumulative surface area , spatial arrangment , and size , so none of these could have formed the consistent " background " that the novel stimulus popped out of .
The only sudden change was in number ( or in the other experiment , shape ) .
They cite other experiments that show that the mind intuitively processes such arrays , and presumably quantities of things generally , using a ratio rather than tallying the absolute value of each -- it 's easier to discriminate sets with 6 vs 9 items than sets with 4 vs 5 items , since the ratio is more lopsided in the former case ( deviates farther from 1.0 ) , despite involving greater quantities in both sets compared to the latter case .

I ’ve had some interesting experiences over the last week sitting through some training .
The training is for a new software package that ’s going to be rolled out across a reasonably sizeable company and I was in a group with some senior people from the company .
Some of the things I saw made me think of how we tend to blame our problems on the “ stupidity ” of others ( as covered in my recent posts on stupid customers , stupid bosses and stupid employees . )
In IT , the frequently heard refrain is that most of our problems are caused by other people ’s stupidity .
If only users would read the fucking manual ( RTFM ) they ’d give us less grief .
This seems to make sense on the surface but the real issue is rarely that simple .
I , for one , hardly ever RTFM – systems that are too difficult to work out without a manual seldom come with a manual that improves the situation .
A couple of times during the training sessions , some of the users got lost trying to follow some of the most basic processes .
I ’m talking about not being able to successfully click three times from the home menu .
I ’m surprised the trainer did n’t scream at them to just listen ( JFL ) .
The things is , although it would be easy to say they were having trouble with basic things because they were stupid , in this case it was really the opposite .
A short side note : when I complain about workplaces or cow - orkers , I ’m almost always talking about previous jobs .
My current job is one of the best I ’ve had and my co-trainees are all quite intelligent .
In this case it was their intelligence that was derailing them – as they were being shown new features they were coming up with ideas on how the software could be used to improve processes .
They were so busy leaping ahead to new frontiers little things like paying attention to how to navigate the software were slipping by them .
As has been pointed out so often by commenters , people accused of being stupid often simply have expertise in a different domain .
IT workers call people stupid when they are n’t technically oriented , bosses call employees stupid when they do n’t appreciate strategic issues .
So take a breath next time you wish someone would RTFM or JFL – they might not be quite a stupid as you think .

The Chemistry__On a blackboard , __ it looks so simple : Take a plant and extract the cellulose .
Add some enzymes and convert the cellulose molecules into sugars .
Ferment the sugar into alcohol .
Then distill the alcohol into fuel .
One , two , three , four — and we 're powering our cars with lawn cuttings , wood chips , and prairie grasses instead of Middle East oil .
Unfortunately , passing chemistry class does n't mean acing economics .
Scientists have long known how to turn trees into ethanol , but doing it profitably is another matter .
We can run our cars on lawn cuttings today ; we just can't do it at a price people are willing to pay .
The problem is cellulose .
Found in plant cell walls , it 's the most abundant naturally occurring organic molecule on the planet , a potentially limitless source of energy .
But it 's a tough molecule to break down .
Bacteria and other microorganisms use specialized enzymes to do the job , scouring lawns , fields , and forest floors , hunting out cellulose and dining on it .
Evolution has given other animals elegant ways to do the same : Cows , goats , and deer maintain a special stomach full of bugs to digest the molecule ; termites harbor hundreds of unique microorganisms in their guts that help them process it .
For scientists , though , figuring out how to convert cellulose into a usable form on a budget driven by gas - pump prices has been neither elegant nor easy .
To tap that potential energy , they 're harnessing nature 's tools , tweaking them in the lab to make them work much faster than nature intended .
While researchers work to bring down the costs of alternative energy sources , in the past two years policymakers have finally reached consensus that it 's time to move past oil .
The reasoning varies — reducing our dependence on unstable oil - producing regions , cutting greenhouse gases , avoiding ever - increasing prices — but it 's clear that the US needs to replace billions of gallons of gasoline with alternative fuels , and fast .
Even oil industry veteran George W. Bush has declared that " America is addicted to oil " and set a target of replacing 20 percent of the nation 's annual gasoline consumption — 35 billion gallons — with renewable fuels by 2017 .
But how ?
Hydrogen is too far - out , and it's no easy task to power our cars with wind - or solar - generated electricity .
The answer , then , is ethanol .
Unfortunately , the ethanol we can make today — from corn kernels — is a mediocre fuel source .
Corn ethanol is easier to produce than the cellulosic kind ( convert the sugar to alcohol and you 're basically done ) , but it generates at best 30 percent more energy than is required to grow and process the corn — hardly worth the trouble .
Plus , the crop 's fertilizer - intensive cultivation pollutes waterways , and increased demand drives up food costs ( corn prices doubled last year ) .
And anyway , the corn ethanol industry is projected to produce , at most , the equivalent of only 15 billion gallons of fuel by 2017 .
" We ca n't make 35 billion gallons ' worth of gasoline out of ethanol from corn , " says Dartmouth engineering and biology professor Lee Lynd , " and we probably do n't want to . "
Cellulosic ethanol , in theory , is a much better bet .
Most of the plant species suitable for producing this kind of ethanol — like switchgrass , a fast - growing plant found throughout the Great Plains , and farmed poplar trees — are n't food crops .
And according to a joint study by the US Departments of Agriculture and Energy , we can sustainably grow more than 1 billion tons of such biomass on available farmland , using minimal fertilizer .
In fact , about two - thirds of what we throw into our landfills today contains cellulose and thus potential fuel .
Better still : Cellulosic ethanol yields roughly 80 percent more energy than is required to grow and convert it .
So a wave of public and private funding , bringing newfound optimism , is pouring into research labs .
Venture capitalists have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in cellulosic - technology startups .
BP has announced that it 's giving $ 500 million for an Energy Biosciences Institute run by the University of Illinois and UC Berkeley .
The Department of Energy pledged $ 385 million to six companies building cellulosic demonstration plants .
In June the DOE added awards for three $ 125 million bioenergy centers to pursue new research on cellulosic biofuels .
There 's just one catch :
No one has yet figured out how to generate energy from plant matter at a competitive price .
The result is that no car on the road today uses a drop of cellulosic ethanol .
Cellulose is a tough molecule by design , a fact that dates back 400 million years to when plants made the move from ocean to land and required sturdy cell walls to keep themselves upright and protected against microbes , the elements , and eventually animals .
Turning that defensive armor into fuel involves pretreating the plant material with chemicals to strip off cell - wall protections .
Then there are two complicated steps : first , introducing enzymes , called cellulases , to break the cellulose down into glucose and xylose ; and second , using yeast and other microorganisms to ferment those sugars into ethanol .
The step that has perplexed scientists is the one involving enzymes — proteins that come in an almost infinite variety of three - dimensional structures .
They are at work everywhere in living cells , usually speeding up the chemical reactions that break down complex molecules .
Because they 're hard to make from scratch , scientists generally extract them from microorganisms that produce them naturally .
But the trick is producing the enzymes cheaply enough at an industrial scale and speed .
Today 's cellulases are the enzyme equivalent of vacuum tubes : clunky , slow , and expensive .
Now , flush with cash , scientists and companies are racing to develop the cellulosic transistor .
Some researchers are trying to build the ultimate microbe in the lab , one that could combine the two key steps of the process .
Others are using " directed evolution " and genetic engineering to improve the enzyme - producing microorganisms currently in use .
Still others are combing the globe in search of new and better bugs .
It 's bio -construction versus bio - tinkering versus bio-prospecting , all with the single goal of creating the perfect enzyme cocktail .
President Bush , for one , seems to believe that the revolution is imminent .
" It 's an interesting time , is n't it , " he mused this February .
" We 're on the verge of some breakthroughs that will enable a pile of wood chips to become the raw materials for fuels that will run your car . "
Whether the car of the future will be powered by wood chips is n't clear yet .
But it may depend on the success of the hunt for tiny enzymes that could be discovered anywhere from a termite 's stomach in Central America to a lab bench to your own backyard .
Lynd 's microbe would be an all - in - one ethanol factory .
Portrait : Peter YangChapter 1
The Veteran
Trace the fortunes of cellulosic ethanol over the past three decades and you 'll find that the arc almost perfectly mirrors Lee Lynd 's career .
The 49 - year - old Dartmouth professor started in a compost heap in the 1970s , seemed on the verge of a breakthrough in the ' 80s , and nearly went bust in the '90s .
" There were times , " he says , " when my lab barely had a pulse . "
Now , as a central player in the burgeoning cellulosic industry , he works out of a rejuvenated Dartmouth lab and sparkling new offices in nearby Lebanon , New Hampshire , freshly equipped and staffed by nearly two dozen PhDs .
Many are recent hires , the beneficiaries of $ 60 million that Lynd 's company , Mascoma , has raised .
The firm is beginning construction on a pilot - scale ethanol plant in New York state this year , and it recently announced plans for a $ 100 million production plant in Michigan , projected to break ground in 2008 .
Lynd has deep - set eyes and wavy blond hair graying at the temples .
He dresses the casual businessman , his inner environmentalist betrayed only by a pair of leather sandals .
Working on a farm as a biology undergrad one summer in the 1970s , Lynd noticed that a thermometer stuck in a compost pile registered 150 degrees Fahrenheit .
He knew that microorganisms must be at work in there , digesting the plants and turning them into ... something .
Lynd became obsessed with harnessing that biology to generate usable energy from plants .
He certainly was n't the first scientist to try .
The oil crisis of the ' 70s spurred a wave of federally funded research on cellulosic ethanol .
Then , in the mid-'80s , when President Reagan declared the fuel crisis over , the DOE money vanished with few results .
Many academics fled to other fields where funding was easier to get .
But Lynd — descended from what he calls " several generations of social reformers " — remained enamored with the potential of cellulosic ethanol , and he pieced together small grants to keep his lab running .
For Lynd , the key to the future lies in combining the two main stages of the cellulosic conversion pathway into a single process inside a single microbe .
Instead of using enzymes to make sugar out of plant material and then using yeast to convert that sugar to ethanol , Lynd is trying to create a bacterium that serves as an all - in - one fuel factory , taking up cellulose and spitting out ethanol .
Called consolidated bioprocessing , or CBP , this has been his dream for two decades .
" Almost everybody believes it 's doable , " he says .
" People disagree whether it 'll take two years or 20 . "
To get there , he needs to engineer cellulase production into a sugar - fermenting microbe like yeast or modify a cellulase - producing organism to make it ferment sugar .
With plenty of research money in hand , he 's trying to do both .
To accomplish the latter , Lynd and his colleagues are working with a cellulase - producing bacterium called Clostridium thermocellum .
" You can isolate this puppy out of garden soil , hot springs , compost heaps , forest floors , " Lynd says .
In 2005 , the researchers proved that a bug very similar to C. thermocellum could be modified to make ethanol .
Their goal is now to modify C. thermocellum to do the same .
If he succeeds , Lynd 's analysis shows that CBP — by reducing the raw materials and capital required — could cut overall processing costs twofold , potentially the difference between a profitable ethanol plant and a money pit .
Meanwhile , Mascoma is pushing ahead to build factories that will use commercial cellulase enzymes until the superbug is available .
That may not happen immediately , but Lynd is patient , having sought a breakthrough for three decades .
" I 'm not sure if that makes me inspired or an idiot , " he says .
" Probably a little of both . "
Cherry is making existing enzymes cheaper and more efficient .
Portrait : Peter YangChapter 2
The Suppliers
If you want to buy enzymes off the shelf , a good place to start would be Novozymes , the world 's leading supplier of cellulases .
Headquartered in Denmark , the company runs a tidy business selling millions of pounds of enzymes , used to do everything from brewing alcohol without malt to helping laundry detergent devour stains .
Novozymes perfects its enzymes in state - of - the - art biotech labs and sends them to plants scattered around the world , where they are manufactured in bulk .
Now , in a subsidiary office tucked away just off I - 80 outside Davis , California , the company is prepping its next advance .
Back in 2000 , Joel Cherry , a molecular biologist who now runs the company 's research on biomass enzymes , began urging Novozymes to develop some that could be used to produce fuel .
" There were a lot of people who said it was n't worth doing , " he recalls .
But Cherry pressed the company to apply for a DOE grant , and the agency awarded Novozymes and Palo Alto - based Genencor about $ 15 million each to make the currently available cellulases cheaper and more efficient at chopping up plants .
Cherry now heads a team of nearly 100 researchers focused exclusively on cellulosic enzymes , the company 's largest single R&D effort .
The enzymes used today to make cellulosic ethanol come from a microbe that was discovered during World War II , eating away at the tents used by US forces in the South Pacific .
It turned out to be a tropical fungus named Trichoderma reesei , which secretes a mixture of more than 50 cellulose - processing enzymes .
Researchers have since bred strains of it that can produce the stuff much faster .
" It 's definitely the gold standard for cellulase production , " Cherry says , holding up a sample plate covered in the green dust of T. reesei spores .
Novozymes sells T. reesei derived cellulases today , primarily to fabric companies that use them to create the stone - washed look for jeans .
But profit margins are fatter on jeans than on commodities like fuel , and the enzymes have remained too expensive to make cellulosic ethanol commercially viable .
So Cherry 's team transplanted four new enzyme - producing genes into the fungus — sequences from other cellulase - generating organisms in the company 's culture collection .
For some of the samples , bioengineers used what they call directed evolution :
They mutated the genes and then used high - throughput screening to test the resulting enzymes for improvement in properties like heat resistance and ability to degrade cellulose .
The best of the mutated - enzyme combinations were then tested in tabletop reactors on corn stover , the cellulose - laden stalks of the crop .
After four years , Cherry and his team say they 've reduced the cost of the enzyme mixture from $ 5 per gallon of ethanol to well under a dollar .
Genencor claims similar improvement .
The only way to truly judge the enzymes ' cost and effectiveness , however , is to put them to work on real feedstocks under industrial conditions .
To that end , Novozymes is currently supplying its new enzymes to several companies in the US , Europe , and China that are building cellulosic demonstration plants .
Those are among over a dozen outfits — from a company using a thermochemical process to break down wood chips in Georgia to a Massachusetts - based firm that is working on a CBP bug to rival Lynd 's — scrambling for the first commercial cellulosic success .
" We 're at the place now where the enzymes could be significantly cheaper , and we are going to continue to pound on it , " Cherry says .
" If one of those efforts can show a clear path to economic viability , I think it 's just going to go crazy . "
Doyle looks to nature for better enzymes .
Portrait : Peter YangChapter 3
The Collectors
Could there be better enzymes in the wild , as yet unknown , just waiting to be discovered ?
Verenium , based in Cambridge , Massachusetts , thinks so , and it 's prospecting the globe for a bug that produces them .
The company 's scientists will go just about anywhere — they 've explored the excrement of rhinos and the stomachs of cows — but their most intriguing work so far took them to Costa Rica , home to one of the world 's most diverse insect populations .
There , working with Caltech microbiologist Jared Leadbetter and a group of Costa Rican scientists , the team gathered termites from the rain forest floor .
Termites are master cellulose processors , using a mixture of bacteria , fungi , and other microorganisms in their hindmost gut to break down leaves and dead trees .
" There are lots of organisms that naturally degrade and digest plant cell - wall material , " says biologist Kevin Gray , the company 's director of alternative fuels .
" Termites are top on the list . "
After pinching out the termite 's gut , which holds a microliter of material containing an entire ecosystem of microbes , they shipped it back to the US and isolated the DNA .
Now , together with the DOE , they 're sequencing that DNA to find the genes responsible for creating the cellulases .
A preliminary analysis shows " a large diversity of enzymes , " Gray says .
Next , they 'll determine the most effective mix of cellulases by testing what they 've extracted on plant matter .
They hope to find one that will chew up cellulose bonds faster and more efficiently than anything Novozymes ' T. reesei fungus churns out .
But Verenium is not an enzyme company like Novozymes — it 's in the fuel business .
Just outside the farm town of Jennings , it also runs a pilot - scale biorefinery amid the steaming bayous of western Louisiana .
This is one of the few places in the world where enzymes are already on the job , turning plants into usable fuel .
The process starts with a three - story - high mound of bagasse , a woody byproduct of sugarcane that farmers often discard .
The bagasse , which resembles sweet - smelling mulch , travels on a conveyer belt through stainless steel pipes where it 's treated with an acid mixture .
Then it 's dumped into 10 - foot - diameter tanks for the two biological stages of the process .
First , microbes that churn out cellulose - chomping enzymes are funneled into the batch , turning the bagasse into sugar .
Then , two micro organisms — including a special strain of Escherichia coli bacteria developed by University of Florida microbiologist Lonnie Ingram — are used to ferment the sugar into alcohol .
This facility churns out enough ethanol to test the basic technology , if not to prove its viability at commercial volumes .
But John Doyle , Verenium 's vice president for projects , is overseeing the construction of a larger demonstration plant and hopes to show that the economics can scale , even before the company finds the right termite - derived enzymes .
" The high tech part of our process is the organisms , " Doyle says , " and you can always swap new organisms into the infrastructure . "
The refinery , in other words , is just hardware , while the biology supplies the software — with the enzymes upgraded whenever a new , better one is pinched out and perfected .
Epilogue
The Forecast
Skeptics argue that rosy projections for cellulosic ethanol ignore its drawbacks — mainly , that cars need to be converted to run on it , that existing oil pipelines can't transport it , and that we do n't have the land to grow enough of it .
Advocates counter that if the fuel is cheap and plentiful enough , the infrastructure will follow .
" If we could make ethanol at a large scale in a way that is sustainable , carbon - neutral , and cost - effective , we would surely be doing so , " Lynd says , citing the fact that most cars can easily be converted to run on ethanol , something already done with most new cars in Brazil .
" Meeting these objectives is not limited by the fuel properties of ethanol but rather by the current difficulty of converting cellulosic biomass to sugars . "
Neither government funding nor venture capital , of course , guarantees research breakthroughs or commercial blockbusters .
And even ardent proponents concede that cellulosic ethanol wo n't solve our fuel problems — or do much to stop global warming — without parallel efforts to improve vehicle efficiency .
They also worry that attention could again fade if the first demonstration plants fail or oil prices plummet .
" To get this industry going , you need some short - term breakthroughs , by which I mean the next five to seven years , " says Martin Keller , a micro biologist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and director of its new BioEnergy Science Center .
" Otherwise , my fear is that people may leave this field again . "
The problem comes from the quotidian difficulties of making benchtop science work on an industrial scale .
Undoubtedly , even some well - funded efforts will fail .
But the proliferation of research — the prospect of Lee Lynd 's superbug , the evolution of current cellulases , and the addition of new enzymes harvested from nature — stacks the deck in favor of cellulosic ethanol .
Alexander Karsner , assistant secretary for the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy , says that with plants going up around the country , the industry could make cellulosic ethanol cost - competitive within six years .
" I think there wo n't be a silver - bullet process , where you say , ' That has won , and everything else is done , ' " he says .
" So you need many of these technologies . "
Having known lean times , Lynd is reluctant to predict the future .
But given the freedom of fat wallets , he says , " I truly think that in five years all the hard issues about converting cellulosic biomass to ethanol may be solved . "
The researchers ' vision , of green and gold switchgrass fields feeding a nationwide network of ethanol plants and filling stations , often has an effortless quality to it — as easy as a few steps sketched out on a blackboard .
The money and momentum is here .
Solve the science , they argue , and the market will take care of the rest .

Creeping featurism and the ratchet effect
" Creeping featurism " is a well - known phenomenon in the software world .
It refers to the tendency of software to acquire more and more features , to the ultimate detriment of its usability .
Software with more and more features is harder to learn to use ; it 's harder to document effectively .
Perhaps most important , it is harder to maintain ; the more complicated software is , the more likely it is to have bugs .
Partly this is because the different features interact with one another in unanticipated ways ; partly it is just that there is more stuff to spend the maintenance budget on .
But the concept of " creeping featurism " his wider applicability than just to program features .
We can recognize it in other contexts .
For example , someone is reading the Perl manual .
They read the section on the unpack function and they find it confusing .
So they propose a documentation patch to add a couple of sentences , explicating the confusing point in more detail .
It seems like a good idea at the time .
But if you do it over and over — and we have — you end up with a 2,000 page manual — and we did .
The real problem is that it 's easy to see the benefit of any proposed addition .
But it is much harder to see the cost of the proposed addition , that the manual is now 0.002 % larger .
The benefit has a poster child , an obvious beneficiary .
You can imagine a confused person in your head , someone who happens to be confused in exactly the right way , and who is miraculously helped out by the presence of the right two sentences in the exact right place .
The cost has no poster child .
Or rather , the poster child is much harder to imagine .
This is the person who is looking for something unrelated to the two - sentence addition .
They are going to spend a certain amount of time looking for it .
If the two - sentence addition had n't been in there , they would have found what they were looking for .
But the addition slowed them down just enough that they gave up without finding what they needed .
Although you can grant that such a person might exist , they really are n't as compelling as the confused person who is magically assisted by timely advice .
Even harder to imagine is the person who 's kinda confused , and for whom the extra two sentences , clarifying some obscure point about some feature he was n't planning to use in the first place , are just more confusion .
It 's really hard to understand the cost of that .
But the benefit , such as it is , comes in one big lump , whereas the cost is distributed in tiny increments over a very large population .
The benefit is clear , and the cost is obscure .
It 's easy to make a specific argument in favor of any particular addition ( " people might be confused by X , so I 'm going to explain it in more detail " ) and it's hard to make such an argument against the addition .
And conversely : it 's easy to make the argument that any particular bit of text should stay in , hard to argue that it should be removed .
As a result , there 's what I call a " ratchet effect " : you can make the manual bigger , one tiny notch at a time , and people do .
But having done so , you can't make it smaller again ; someone will object to almost any proposed deletion .
The manual gets bigger and bigger , worse and worse organized , more and more unusable , until finally it collapses under its own weight and all you can do is start over again .
You see the same thing happen in software , of course .
I maintain the Text :: Template Perl module , and I frequently get messages from people saying that it should have some feature or other .
And these people sometimes get quite angry when I tell them I 'm not going to put in the feature they want .
They 're angry because it 's easy to see the benefit of adding another feature , but hard to see the cost .
" If other people do n't like it , " goes the argument , " they do n't have to use it . "
True , but even if they do n't use it , they still pay the costs of slightly longer download times , slightly longer compile times , a slightly longer and more confusing manual , slightly less frequent maintenance updates , slightly less prompt bug fix deliveries , and so on .
It is so hard to make this argument , because the cost to any one person is so very small !
But we all know where the software will end up if I do n't make this argument every step of the way : on the slag heap .
This has been on my mind on and off for years .
But I just ran into it in a new context .
Lately I 've been working on a book about code style and refactoring in Perl .
One thing you see a lot in Perl programs written by beginners is superfluous parentheses .
For example : next if ( $ file =~ /^\./ ) ; next if !( $ file =~ ( / [ 0 - 9 ] / ) ) ; next if !( $ file =~ ( /txt / ) ) ;
Or : die $usage if ( $ # ARGV < 0 ) ;
There are a number of points I want to make about this .
First , I 'd like to express my sympathy for Perl programmers , because Perl has something like 95 different operators at something like 17 different levels of precedence , and so nobody knows what all the precedences are and whether parentheses are required in all circumstances .
Does the ** operator have higher or lower precedence than the < <= operator ?
I really have no idea .
So the situation is impossible , at least in principle , and yet people have to deal with it somehow .
But the advice you often hear is " if you 're not sure of the precedence , just put in the parentheses . "
I think that 's really bad advice .
I think better advice would be " if you 're not sure of the precedence , look it up . "
Because Perl 's Byzantine operator table is not responsible for all the problems .
Notice in the examples above , which are real examples , taken from real code written by other people :
Many of the parentheses there are entirely superfluous , and are not disambiguating the precedence of any operators .
In particular , notice the inner parentheses in : next if !( $ file =~ ( /txt / ) ) ;
Inside the inner parentheses , there are no operators !
So they cannot be disambiguating any precedence , and they are completely unnecessary : next if !( $ file =~ /txt / ) ;
People sometimes say " well , I like to put them in anyway , just to be sure . "
This is pure superstition , and we should not tolerate it in people who purport to be engineers .
Engineers should be capable of making informed choices , based on technical realities , not on some creepy feeling in their guts that perhaps a failure to sprinkle enough parentheses over their program will invite the wrath the Moon God .
By saying " if you 're not sure , just avoid the problem " we are encouraging this kind of fearful , superstitious approach to the issue .
That approach would be appropriate if it were the only way to deal with the issue , but fortunately it is not .
There is a more rational approach : you can look it up , or even try an experiment , and then you will know whether the parentheses are required in a particular case .
Then you can make an informed decision about whether to put them in .
But when I teach classes on this topic , people sometimes want to take the argument even further : they want to argue that even if you know the precedence , and even if you know that the parentheses are not required , you should put them in anyway , because the next person to see the code might not know that .
And there we see the creeping featurism argument again .
It 's easy to see the potential benefit of the superfluous parentheses : some hapless novice maintenance programmer might misunderstand the expression if I do n't put them in .
It 's much harder to see the cost :
The code is fractionally harder for everyone to read and understand , novice or not .
And again , the cost of the extra parentheses to any particular person is so small , so very small , that it is really hard to make the argument against it convincingly .
But I think the argument must be made , or else the code will end up on the slag heap much faster than it would have otherwise .
Programming cannot be run on the convoy system , with the program code written to address the most ignorant , uneducated programmer .
I think you have to assume that the next maintenance programmer will be competent , and that if they do not know what the expression means , they will look up the operator precedence in the manual .
That assumption may be false , of course ; the world is full of incompetent programmers .
But no amount of parentheses are really going to help this person anyway .
And even if they were , you do not have to give in , you do not have to cater to incompetence .
If an incompetent programmer has trouble understanding your code , that is not your fault ; it is their fault for being incompetent .
You do not have to take special steps to make your code understandable even by incompetents , and you certainly should not do so at the expense of making it harder for competent programmers to read and understand , no , not to the tiniest degree .
The advice that one should always put in the parentheses seems to me to be going in the wrong direction .
We should be struggling for higher standards , both for ourselves and for our associates .
The conventional advice , it seems to me , is to give up .

One of the reasons why people are so scared of science these days is that technology has become more inexplicable , and somehow more “ black box ” .
Fifty years ago , with a bit of practise and a good grounding in school science , you could fix your car and understand how your radio works .
You would n’t stand a chance these days , but it was not ever thus : Japanese War Tubas , only a few decades ago , were the very pinnacle of modern technology , and your best bet for locating an enemy in the distance , or in the dark ( that ’s Hirohito on the right ) .
At first these devices just look like hearing trumpets , with a pretty obvious mechanism of action .
But there ’s actually much more to them than that .
Like other pre-radar acoustic location devices , they cunningly exploit and hack the acoustic location hardware you already have in your own ears and brain .
We can locate objects with our ears , using the difference in volume between our left and right ear , but more important is the time delay between the sound hitting one ear and then hitting the other .
This is possible because sound travels so incredibly slowly , only 330 metres ( or 1000 feet ) per second .
Thinking out loud , that means sound travels one foot in one millisecond , so if your ears are about six inches apart , the sound coming from your right will hit your right ear about half a millisecond before it hits your left ear .
A millisecond is quite a long time : in a piece of music , for example , you can spot notes that are only a few milliseconds out as being in the wrong place .
So these devices amplify the incoming sounds , but also , because the collection horns are placed much wider apart than your ears are ( on either side of your head ) they also increase the difference in arrival time between each ear .
This , as well as the amplified volume , would help you to become more accurate in locating far off objects .
My guess is it would probably take a while for your auditory cortex to re-callibrate and get used to the wider gap , and the greater difference in arrival times , so you ’d need plenty of practise .
Consequently , the designers had to make their apparatus as stylish as possible .
Nicely spotted by the excellent Athanasius Kircher Society .
I have Grade 5 Tuba and I still put it on my CV .
Their credentials as patriots , in the sense that the right wing in this country limits that term , are impeccable .
General P.X. Kelley was appointed by GOP icon Ronald Reagan as commandant of the Marine Corps , a post in which he served from 1983 - 87 .
Robert F. Turner was an attorney in the Reagan White House who has no problem with warrantless wiretapping or presidential signing statements .
But they have a problem – a great big problem – with the executive order that President Bush signed last week interpreting Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions in relation to CIA interrogations .
While some observers have praised the order , others have said not so fast – what does this document really say ?
But most of those critics are what you might call the usual suspects .
In other words , groups with words like human rights in their names .
Easily ignored , easily mocked , easily smeared .
But Kelley and Turner ?
In an Op - Ed this morning that Washington Post editors headline War Crimes and the White House : The Dishonor in a Tortured New ' Interpretation ' of the Geneva Conventions , the two men write :
But we cannot in good conscience defend a decision that we believe has compromised our national honor and that may well promote the commission of war crimes by Americans and place at risk the welfare of captured American military forces for generations to come .
...
In other words , as long as the intent of the abuse is to gather intelligence or to prevent future attacks , and the abuse is not " done for the purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual " -- even if that is an inevitable consequence -- the president has given the CIA carte blanche to engage in " willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse . " ...
To date in the war on terrorism , including the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and all U.S. military personnel killed in action in Afghanistan and Iraq , America 's losses total about 2 percent of the forces we lost in World War II and less than 7 percent of those killed in Vietnam .
Yet we did not find it necessary to compromise our honor or abandon our commitment to the rule of law to defeat Nazi Germany or imperial Japan , or to resist communist aggression in Indochina .
On the contrary , in Vietnam -- where we both proudly served twice -- America voluntarily extended the protections of the full Geneva Convention on prisoners of war to Viet Cong guerrillas who , like al - Qaeda , did not even arguably qualify for such protections .
As has often been said since post - 9/11 torture was exposed , even those who have no moral objections should surely pause for consideration of self - interest in the matter .
As Kelley and Turner go on to point out , the Geneva Conventions protect American military forces .
Our troops deserve those protections , and we betray their interests when we gratuitously " interpret " key provisions of the conventions in a manner likely to undermine their effectiveness .
Policymakers should also keep in mind that violations of Common Article 3 are " war crimes " for which everyone involved -- potentially up to and including the president of the United States -- may be tried in any of the other 193 countries that are parties to the conventions .
The executive order came about , not because the Cheney - Bush Administration had a change of heart about the CIA interrogation program .
Rather it was a consequence of the combined pressure of outrage over the photos from Abu Ghraib and a Supreme Court ruling , plus passage of the deeply flawed Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
The MCA specifically required the Administration to draft an executive order that places future interrogations inside the parameters of international law .
Hence , last Friday ’s signing .
Progress ?
Or just another Cheney - Bush flip - off delivered with more serpentine charm and subtlety than is usually the case ?
As David Cole , law professor at Georgetown University and a board member of the Center for Constitutional Rights , wrote earlier this week at Salon.com :
Bush 's torture ban is full of loopholes
But how much of a step the administration has really taken remains a serious question .
The actual tactics the CIA is authorized to use remain classified , based on the bogus claim that agency interrogators need to keep detainees guessing about how far they can go in order to interrogate effectively .
The Army , by contrast , has set forth for the world to see the specific tactics its interrogators can employ -- in the Army Field Manual .
...
While the executive order flatly forbids torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , its failure to specify permissible and impermissible techniques seems designed to leave the CIA wiggle room .
A prohibition on " acts of violence , " for example , applies only to those violent acts " serious enough to be considered comparable to murder , torture , mutilation , and cruel or inhuman treatment , " as defined by the Military Commissions Act .
The MCA , in turn , limits " cruel and inhuman treatment " to the infliction of bodily injury that entails : " ( i ) a substantial risk of death ; ( ii ) extreme physical pain ; ( iii ) a burn or physical disfigurement of a serious nature ( other than cuts , abrasions , or bruises ) ; or ( iv ) significant loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member , organ , or mental faculty . "
In other words , the president 's order appears to permit cutting or bruising a suspect so long as the injury does not risk death , significant functional impairment or " extreme physical pain , " an entirely subjective term .
Sen . John D. Rockefeller IV , the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , told the Washington Post on Saturday that it is unclear what the executive order " really means and how it will translate into actual conduct by the CIA . "
The Senator repeated his committee ’s months - old demand that the White House turn over a copy of the Justice Department 's legal analysis of the new interrogation guidelines .
We know , of course , how the Cheney - Bush Administration deals with subpoenas by congressional committees .
Less forceful demands are simply forgotten .
So , for now , we can only guess at what is included in those secret guidelines governed by the iciest of euphemisms : " enhanced interrogation techniques . "

BBC News , Dhaka
The image has caused the army much embarrassment
A sandaled demonstrator in mid-air kick and a hatless army officer in terrified retreat .
In the background , bystanders hurry away .
Out of shot , a military vehicle burns and the security forces are in danger of losing control to the angry mob .
The photo gives a momentary glimpse of just how bad things got during three days of violent protest that rocked cities across Bangladesh last week .
But the picture is significant for another reason .
As we found out on the first night of the curfew imposed to contain the trouble it was an image that deeply upset the Bangladeshi rank and file .
Student protests quickly turned into a full - scale riot
Its publication was seen as a humiliation , every bit as great as if that flying sandaled foot had been aimed at the behind of the army chief himself .
Shortly after the curfew came into effect on Wednesday night , the BBC team was out filming .
No one was sure whether the media would be allowed to move freely .
Dhaka 's streets , normally a round - the - clock festival of noise , were deserted .
Road blocks and checkpoints were being manned by the paramilitaries and the army was on patrol .
' Wrong message '
Sure enough our presence was soon noticed .
Two army jeeps pulled up sharply and a young officer jumped out .
We were ordered to drop the camera as he radioed back to his base .
It 's a very unfortunate situation when teachers are being interrogated and actually taken away in the middle of the night
Sanjeeb Hossain , son of detained professor
High stakes in Bangladesh Q&A : Bangladesh crisis Viewpoints : Protests
After a tense stand - off the message was relayed that we could continue filming " as long as we did n't give the wrong message to the country " .
But in true Bangladeshi style the officer and I were soon the best of friends .
In the middle of a deserted city I was invited to sit on the kerb with him , while his troops waited restlessly in their trucks .
He offered me a smoke and then , with his arm round me , he told me of his time training in the UK , of his sense of duty and his love of his country .
He told me of the dark forces at work behind the rioting .
And most of all he told me how he hated that photo , and how irresponsible it had been of the newspaper to publish it .
We shook hands and parted on good terms .
But then I have a white face and an international press card .
Masud Parvez says he was badly beaten by the army
It 's impossible to know whether it was this same officer and the same troops , but on that same evening a group of Bangladeshi journalists were left in little doubt about what the army thought about the role of the media .
Masud Parvez was one of a group of reporters from a national internet news service standing outside their office .
Two army jeeps pulled up and the reporters identified themselves as local newsmen .
" So what , " came the reply .
Masud was given a prolonged beating on the steps of his office .
He has an injury to his hand where he tried to fend off a rifle butt .
Some soldiers hit him with hockey sticks that they 'd been carrying for exactly this kind of occasion .
Deepening rift
" I told them we were journalists from bdnews 24.com .
But despite giving our identity they started hitting us , " he told me .
The protests brought the country to a halt
" It was a terrible experience .
I can't make you understand how scared I was at the time . "
Masud is just one of a number of reporters and cameramen beaten by the security forces over the period of the curfew .
The Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists puts the number at 30 or more .
Of course none of this can be blamed on a single image .
But the photograph , and the reaction to it , gives a wider sense of a deepening rift between the military - backed authorities and civil society .
The army top brass has blamed what it calls evil forces and political opportunists for prolonging last week 's rioting .
Five senior university professors , all distinguished academics , have been picked up by the army and detained .
One of them , Professor Anwar Hossain , is general secretary of the Dhaka University Teachers ' Association .
His son , Sanjeeb , was at home when the army called in the early hours of the morning .
" It takes on a very sinister tone , " he tells me .
" The teachers of Dhaka University are considered the heart and soul of this nation .
" It 's a very unfortunate situation when teachers are being interrogated and actually taken away in the middle of the night . "
An unknown number of students are also in custody .
We visited one address , very close to where the photograph was taken , shortly after an army raid .
A dozen or so students had been arrested , and we saw clear evidence that a number of people had been interrogated and harshly beaten .
' Retribution and arrests '
This government came to power in January with the backing of the military on a wave of popular support vowing to reform politics and stamp out corruption .
But its reputation has been tarnished .
A slum demolition programme , an attempt to exile two former prime ministers and its inability to contain the spiralling cost of food have all added to a growing sense of frustration .
Many newspapers have taken the view that the violence last week was a genuine expression of anger and frustration , rather than the work of shadowy forces of evil .
" Instead of retribution and arrests we suggest that dialogue be opened between teachers and students on the one hand and the caretaker government on the other , " read one newspaper editorial this week .
Meanwhile , military intelligence units appear to be using media images to find and arrest those involved in the violence .
As for the photo that so upset the army , luckily for him at least , the protester doing the kicking is difficult to identify .
But they are looking for him .
Both the editor who published the image , and the photographer who took it , have been visited and questioned by the army .
Some 380 million years ago , a few pioneering vertebrates first made the leap from water to land .
And today , tens of millions of their human descendants seek summer amusement by leaping the other way .
According to the travel industry , close to 90 percent of vacationers choose as their holiday destination an ocean , lake or other scenic body of water .
We may have lungs rather than gills , and the weaker swimmers among us may be perfectly capable of drowning in anything deeper than a bathtub , yet still we feel the primal tug of the tide .
Consciously or otherwise , we know we ’re really all wet .
As fetuses , we gestate in bags of water .
As adults , we are bags of water : roughly 60 percent of our body weight comes from water , the fluidic equivalent of 45 quarts .
Our cells need water to operate , and because we lose traces of our internal stores with every sweat we break , every breath and excretion we out - take , we must constantly consume more water , or we will die in three days .
Thirstiness is a universal hallmark of life .
Sure , camels can forgo drinking water for five or six months and desert tortoises for that many years , and some bacterial and plant spores seem able to survive for centuries in a state of dehydrated , suspended animation .
Yet sooner or later , if an organism plans to move , eat or multiply , it must find a solution of the aqueous kind .
In yacht racing , a one percent difference in boat resistance leads to a gain or loss of more than 30 seconds in a match race .
Computational fluid dynamics research done by the winning Swiss Alinghi America 's Cup syndicate led to gains of 2 - 5 percent in drag reduction on appendages like the keel , bulb and winglets , absolutely essential gains when you take into consideration that opponent Emirates Team New Zealand won two of the first three races but lost when the wind was more difficult .
Advanced numerical methods have come a long way , it seems .
The 2007 America 's Cup was the first time every major contender used applied mathematics and computer simulation .
As competition gets more fierce , the optimization of every part becomes more important .
Ian Burns , design coordinator for the BMW - Oracle team , estimates their latest efforts involved 3,000,000 million hours of computer simulation time and a whopping 12 terabytes of data .
CFD simulation showing flow - lines around the keel and waves generated at the surface
Why is simulation suddenly so important ?
Organizers this year fixed more dimensions than ever , so designers were limited in sail area , length and weight of their vessels .
Optimizing hull shape and reducing drag in appendages become strategically important in that scenario .
Testing has always been the de facto solution for design issues ; wind tunnels and a towing tank .
Yet racers discovered what mechanical and electrical engineers have known for a while - simulation allows them to verify their design less often physically , which speeds up the process and allows for new ideas .
Says Burns , " Every edition of the America ’s Cup produces a yacht that is between one and two minutes faster around the 80 minute course , representing a speed increase of between 1 and 3 % .
These gains are a product of better understanding of the physics of yacht fluid dynamics - both aero and hydrodynamic - and its integration into design . "
Yachts work in much the same way as airplanes .
Each sail is basically an airfoil that generates a terrific amount of propulsion and transfers it to the yacht through the mast .
That force is balanced out by the keel bulb beneath the boat .
Keel bulk design is so secretive and shrouded in black magic no one would let me show the process for this article but we do have a finished product , courtesy of the BMW ORACLE Racing Team and CFD analysis company CD - adapco .

Racing 's keel bulb weighs the same as 11 BMWs !

When dealing with projects of that size and compexity , scale becomes an issue .
Competition rules prohibit building test models greater than 1/3rd scale so teams are limited to 30 feet in size for towing tank scenarios but no such restrictions apply to numerical testing .
Freedom from those limitations means yacht designers can analyze both a 25 - meter yacht and a 400 meter long volume of water around it .
The simulation size for that ends up being around 6 million computational cells , some as small as 1 mm in size in the finest detailed sections .
As hardware and software have improved , applied math solutions have become reachable for virtually everyone .
Steve MacDonald is CEO of CD - adapco , a tool used to such an extent in Formula One racing that 70 % of the points scored in the World Championship went to drivers of cars designed with the aid of their software .
He says , " In race conditions , a Formula 1 driver does n't have the luxury of driving his car around a clear track , so simulating a single car in clean air tells only part of the story .
The top F1 teams are now starting to simulate two , three or even four cars at a time , to answer questions such as ' how much downforce do I lose when driving in another car 's dirty air ' and ' how does the aerodynamic loading on my car change during overtaking ' .
" In competitive sailing , teams will begin to consider how the boats interact with each other on the water , and to gain a better understanding of out they can use wind - shading effects to block the wind to an opponent 's sails . "
So basically CFD analysis allowed teams to do more than optimize how to make their own entry faster - it also helped them to make the other guy slower .

The limitation for model size gets higher every year .
MacDonald says their software can now analyze one billion cells , basically a simulation of an entire NASCAR grid in race formation .
What 's next for numerical methods ?
It 's to a point where the bottleneck is the man-hours to prepare the simulations rather than the computer crunch time , so the future is bright .
Brad Butterworth , skipper of Alinghi , deservedly gets much of the credit for winning the Regatta but you can be certain he gave a nod to a group of designers at computer terminals who made sure things were optimized before his ship ever flew its spinnaker in that final sprint .
Prince 's Secret Tears Royal Family Apart , Shocks
His Nation Indian prince 's secret leads to the queen disowning him , riots in the streets .
July 2 , 2007  -- Manvendra Singh
Gohil grew up in a bubble of prestige and privilege , surrounded by hangers - on who treated him so reverentially that he was 15 years old before he crossed a street by himself .
" I was born with a golden spoon , " Singh Gohil , who is now 41 years old , said .
" A very luxurious lifestyle …at one point we had almost 22 servants for us .
Even for a sip from a glass of water , it was the servants who got it for me . "
Singh Gohil was leading a life of luxury , but he was also living a lie -- hiding a secret so taboo that it caused riots in the streets of India .
Singh Gohil is a prince , the son of the maharajah -- Indian royalty from a dynasty that is more than 600 years old .
Today , though India is a democracy , the Singh Gohils are still honored as if they ruled the land .
In fact , the day ABC News met with the king and the prince , they were attending a town ceremony honoring their family .
' Falling Apart '
Singh Gohil 's path in life was typical of the Indian elite : A good student , he was sent to boarding schools , took lavish vacations with his family , and went to college to study business and law .
He eventually entered an arranged marriage with a beautiful Indian princess , one that marked the union of two prominent royal Indian families .
When asked to describe his marriage , Singh Gohil said , " [ It was ] the worst decision of my life .
It was a total disaster , total failure .
I never had any sexual or physical attraction towards her .
Nothing worked .
The marriage never got consummated .
I realized that I had done something very wrong . "
After 15 disastrous months of matrimony , Singh Gohil divorced his wife and took her parting words to heart .
" The last time when she met me , she told me , ' I 'm giving you a piece of advice .
Please do n't spoil another girl 's life , ' " he recalled .
" That short and sweet thing hit me directly at my heart and I decided I 'm not going to get married again . "
But in keeping with Indian tradition , the king and queen of Rajpipla decided it was time to find their only son another wife .
Singh Gohil was reluctant to remarry , but had no one to share his feelings with , and said , " I was suddenly feeling as if I [ was ] falling apart . "
It was the beginning of a complete nervous breakdown .
Singh Gohil wound up in the hospital , where he began opening up to a therapist about a lifelong secret he had been harboring since childhood .
" [ When ] I was growing up , I would always get attracted towards males , " he said .
Sharing His Secret
" My grandmother had actually sponsored this young boy , who was orphaned at an early age to educate him and be as a companion to me , " Singh Gohil said .
" We started experimenting with each other .
I liked playing with him , playing [ with ] his body .
He also used to play with my body . "
Singh Gohil was eventually introduced to Ashok Row Kavi , a former reporter who made waves in 1986 by becoming the first openly gay man in India .
For many years , he was the only person in the entire country to speak openly about homosexuality .
After becoming close friends , Row Kavi convinced Singh Gohil that his sexual orientation was nothing to be ashamed of .
" I told him just live your life as honestly as possible without hurting too many people , " he said .
" You just live quietly and honestly and do what you think is right . "
Singh Gohil took his friend 's advice and last March , gave an interview to a local Gujarati newspaper , outing himself as a homosexual .
" I knew I was ready to face the worst situation , " he said .
" They cut out pictures from the newspaper where my interview was published and they put it in the bonfire .
They declared me dead . "
' Even a Prince Can Be Gay '
Homosexuality is against the law in India , and can be penalized with ten years to life in jail .
Singh Gohil has become both the voice and face of those persecuted for their sexual orientation .
Not only has the Prince publicly fallen from grace , but his mother has publicly disowned him , and his place as the next King of Rajpipla was in jeopardy .
As the only son of the current King and Queen , Singh Gohil is the only heir to the throne .
His father , King Ragubir Gohil Singh said that , " It 's not natural .
Anything which is not natural , is not something which you can't procreate , you can't have children because it is not something which one is meant for .
Otherwise there 'll be no life on this earth . "
Though his coming out was met with disappointment and outrage , Singh Gohil has adopted a noble cause , educating people about homosexuality and HIV / AIDS prevention .
" I came out in the newspapers openly that I 'm gay and basically [ because ]
I wanted to show to the world that even a prince can be gay , " he said .
" I wanted people to discuss homosexuality , which was always considered a taboo and a stigma … it 's been existing in India but no one talked about it . "
Raising Awareness
Gay activists estimate that 80 percent of gay Indian men are married to women , and argue that the widespread denial of homosexuality inhibits education of safe sex practices , resulting in a rise in HIV and AIDS in the gay population .
" This is high time we talk about HIV [ and ] homosexuality , " said Singh Gohil .
" Unless we talk , there will be no awareness and it will start spreading and it will be too late … it will [ get ] out control . "
Singh Gohil created Lakshya , a grassroots gay - outreach organization centered around counseling gay men and teaching safe sex practices .
The organization is still in the early stages of development .
" There is a lack of awareness , " Manvendra explained .
" The purpose of my coming out openly is for a cause , for a good cause , for the control of HIV / AIDS . "
The prince who would be king is now dedicating all of his time and energy into gay activism .
His future is uncertain , but Singh Gohil said that if he ever does take his place on the throne , it would be on his own terms , as the first openly gay Indian royal of the 21st century .
Bei der Kontoeröffnung eines Firmenkontos bzw .
Geschäftskontos muss man auf einige Dinge achten .
In meinem heutigen Beitrag gehe ich auf ein paar wichtige Punkte ein .
Doch was kostet so ein Konto für geschäftliche Zwecke ?
Meist zahlt man einen pauschalen Monatsbetrag , welches je nach Bank stark variieren kann .
Es gibt Geschäftskonten die monatlich um die 40 Euro kosten können .
Ein solches Konto eignet sich zum Beispiel für Unternehmen mit großen Kontobewegungen .
Doch auch für kleine Unternehmen und Betriebe haben Banken spezielle Kontoprodukte im Angebot , die wesentlich günstiger sind .
Denn ein Handwerker oder ein selbstständiger Friseur hat andere Anforderungen , wie ein mittelständisches Unternehmen .
Hier muss man einfach schauen welche Wünsche man an das Bankkonto hat und entsprechend ein solches passendes Konto eröffnen .
Geschäftskonten vergleichen schafft Klarheit
Mittlerweile bitet fast jede große Bank ein Geschäftskonto an .
Da kann man schon sehr leicht den Überblick über das ganze Angebot verlieren .
Hilfreich wäre es ein Geschäftskonto Vergleich durchzuführen , und so das beste Bankkonto für sich zu entdecken .
Wenn es Ihnen ein Konto bei einer Direktbank nicht passt , dann haben
Sie immer noch die Möglichkeit ein Konto bei Ihrer Hausbank oder Filiale in der Nähe zu eröffnen .
Hier bekommen
Sie allerdings kein kostenloses Firmenkonto mit vergleichbar guten Leistungen .
Daher ist ein Vergleich der Konto wärmsten zu empfehlen .
Schufafreies Geschäftskonto erspart Ihnen Einträge in die Datenbank
Wer bereits schon einige Girokonten eröffnet hat und viele Schufa Einträge hat , dem würde ein schufafreies Geschäftskonto gut passen .
Bei diesem Geschäftskonto wird keine Schufa Abfrage in die Datenbank gemacht .
Somit wird Ihr Schufa - Score nicht in den negativen Bereich gerutscht .
Eine übersichtliche Liste mit Geschäftskonten ohne Schufa gibt es zum Beispiel auf vielen Vergleichsseiten zu finden .
Der Zweck eines Geschäftskontos
Ein extra Konto für das Geschäft oder Unternehmen schafft nicht nur eine Ordnung in der Buchhaltung , sondern erleichtert auch den Überblick über eigene Finanzen .
So können die privat durchgeführte Vorgänge perfekt von den geschäftlichen Vorgängen getrennt werden .
Außer einer monatlichen Pauschale werden meistens auch für jede einzelne Kontobewebung Gebühren erhoben .
Diese können von nur wenigen Cents bis zu 1 Euro betragen .
Wenn Sie im Monat zum Beispiel um die 20 Kontobewebungen haben , dann entpricht das einem Betrag von zusätzlich ca. 10 Euro im Monat .
Daher empfehle ich ebenfalls streng darauf zu achten .
Zusätzliche Kosten für eine Kreditkarte
Zusätzliche Kosten können auch für verschiedene Karten entstehen .
Obwohl die Bankkarte in den meisten Fällen dem Kontoinhaber von der Bank kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt wird , muss man für eine Kreditkarte extra Gebühren zahlen .
Diese Gebühren werden dann jährlich erhoben .
Hier empfehle ich auf die Konditionen genauer zu schauen und Geschäftskonten zu vergleichen .
Denn einige Banken bieten die Erstattung der jährlichen Beiträge , wenn man einen bestimmten Umsatz mit der Kreditkarte gemacht hat .
Und , wenn man weiß , dass man diesen Beitrag schaffen kann , dann lohnt es sich diese Kreditkarte zu beantragen und von den zahlreichen Leistungen zu profitieren .
Denn eine Kreditkarte ist nicht nur für das Bezahlen im Internet oder vor Ort nützlich , es werden sogar öfters Zusatzleistungen , wie eine Reiserücktrittsversicherung , Reisegepäckversicherung , Auslandskrankenversicherung oder auch eine Mietwagen - Versicherung kostenfrei angeboten .
Unter dem Strich kann eine Kreditkarte Ihnen eine Menge Geld bei den Versicherungen ersparren .

A 29 - second video clip of a toddler dancing to Prince 's " Let 's Go Crazy " is the subject of a new court complaint against Universal Music Publishing Group , which demanded that the clip be removed from YouTube in early June .
Apparently , the company believes that a few seconds of music blasting from a background stereo infringes on its copyright , but the Electronic Frontier Foundation disagrees .
The EFF filed suit against Universal yesterday , alleging that the music in the clip was " self - evident non-infringing fair use . "
The clip in question has already been reposted and so is still available for viewing on YouTube , but the site has yet to restore access to the original clip .
The video of Stephanie Lenz 's 18 - month old son Holden was uploaded to YouTube back in February ; Universal filed a DMCA claim against the clip in early June .
Lenz responded with a counter - notification of her own at the end of the month , but the clip was never reinstated .
Now , she has joined forces with the EFF to recover damages after she " has been injured substantially and irreparably , " according to the court filing .
Lenz wants money to cover her legal expenses and wants an affirmative judgment that her clip is not infringing .
Universal has been in this situation before .
In fact , it has been in this situation quite recently .
In May , parent company Universal Music Group sent a similar takedown to YouTube over a Michelle Malkin podcast critical of the rapper Akon .
YouTube reinstated that clip after hearing from the EFF .
Viacom found itself in a similar situation earlier this year when it demanded that a Stephen Colbert parody be pulled .
The company eventually admitted that it issued the notice in error and pledged to improve its process for sending out such notices .
Before it issues a takedown notice , Viacom will manually review the video in question and that it will educate its reviewers about fair use to cut down on erroneous takedown notices .
It will also not challenge the use of its content if it is " creative , newsworthy or transformative " and is " a limited excerpt for noncommercial purposes . "
As these case show , people are n't taking these inappropriate takedown notices passively .
There has been a growing movement to hold copyright owners responsible when they overstep the limits of fair use , a movement that has had a string of successes over the last year .
One would expect that media companies would get more careful about the DMCA takedowns they shoot out , but as EFF attorney Corynne McSherry notes , this newest case " does n't even pass the laugh test . "

There are a great many aspects of today 's world that are variously horrifying , ghastly , destructive and appalling -- and among the very worst is an idea that appears to be rapidly gaining support : the noxious notion that all questions relating to abortion rights should be returned to the states .
For many reasons , only a few of which are discussed below , this idea is completely incoherent as a matter of political theory , and it undercuts any defense of individual rights on the most fundamental level .
If you give a damn at all about the liberty of a single human being , you should oppose all such attempts to your last breath .
The human being to which I refer is not the developing fetus , but the woman who carries the child .
I well understand that many people believe that the fetus is a human being long before birth , with all the rights that attend to that designation .
In the political context , I consider all such beliefs irrelevant , no matter how sincerely and deeply held .
Only one ultimate point matters here : whether you think the developing fetus is a human being or not , the fetus is contained in and supported by the woman 's body .
If the woman 's body did not exist , neither would the fetus .
Only the woman 's existence makes that of the fetus possible .
The fetus only exists because of the woman 's body -- not yours , not that of some possibly corrupt and stupid politician in Washington , and not the body of some possibly ignorant and venal politician in a state legislature .
As I have watched this debate develop , and as I have considered with astonishment the increasingly byzantine efforts to " draw lines " about the point of viability , the time at which a full set of rights attaches to the fetus , and all the rest , I have become increasingly convinced that the right of the woman to control her own body when she is pregnant must be absolute up to the point of birth .
All the attempts to craft legislation circumscribing that right prior to birth quickly become enmeshed in what are finally subjective claims that can be disputed into eternity , and impossible of proof in one direction or another .
[...]
In terms of the political theory involved , the basic question is a stark and simple one : if you cannot control your own body , what other rights can you possibly have ?
If your body is not yours , what does it matter if you can freely express your political and religious convictions ?
The principle involved is similarly simple : as long as you are not violating anyone else 's rights , your right to control your own body is absolute .
Period .
For the reason indicated above , the fetus is not a person in the same sense the mother is : the fetus would not exist but for the woman who carries it .
The woman 's right to her own body must , in fact and in logic , take precedence over whatever rights you believe the fetus possesses , up to the time of birth .
[...]
As long as we have our current form of government , there is one task that must unquestionably belong to the federal government : the protection of those rights without which no other rights are possible .
The most fundamental right is the right to one 's own body .
If you do n't have that right , it is ridiculous to speak of other , derivative rights .
Highway speed limits are optional ; the right to your own body is not .
In an essay from November 2005 , " Let 's Talk About Sex ! , " I examined pornography and prostitution in the context of the West 's cultural tradition that views women , sex and the human body in general in extraordinarily negative terms .
At the conclusion of my discussion of one of key myths underlying these views , that of Adam of Eve , I wrote :
There are other versions of the Adam and Eve story , and some of them are more " positive " in tone , both with regard to sex in general and women in particular .
But the unfathomably negative one suffuses our culture , even today .
It is almost impossible to capture just how negative and damning this myth is with regard to women , especially when you add in all the attitudes that flow out of it And this is just one myth .
It is critical to understand that the particular version of this myth that suffuses our cultural attitudes toward women did n't just fall from the sky , as much as the adherents of certain religions might wish to believe it did .
It was invented -- and it was invented by one man in particular .
In " The Politics of Lies : Suffer the Children , " I offered an excerpt from Jamake Highwater 's , Myth and Sexuality
Make no mistake : almost every single one of you reading this has internalized , at least to some extent , the indefensible notion that sex is sinful and corrupt .
And your problem is not James Dobson or Jerry Falwell , or even much less extreme religious leaders of today .
Your problem is Augustine , and his reinterpretation of Genesis . ...
In the late fourth century , Augustine , Bishop of Hippo , was living in an entirely different political world from his Church predecessors .
Christianity was no longer a dissident sect but the state religion of Rome .
Christians were now free to follow their faith and were officially encouraged to do so .
Such a drastic transformation of the social circumstance of Christians required yet another revision of the reading of Genesis .
It was Augustine who undertook this new interpretatioin of Adam and Eve , resulting in a viewpoint vastly different from the majority of his Jewish and Christian predecessors .
As [ Elaine ]
Pagels notes , what had been read as a tale of the right to quest for human freedom now became an Augustinian story of human bondage .
Hitherto , most Jews and Christians had understood from Genesis that God gave humankind the right of moral freedom , and that Adam had misused it and thereby brought death and pain into the world .
Augustine , however , was not content with the travails of such an interpretation , and he went a good deal further .
He contended that Adam 's sin not only caused our mortality but also corrupted our sexuality .
If these notions contradicted the notorious sexual conduct of Rome , they indirectly sanctioned the limitations placed on the political freedom of Romanized Christians , a forfeiture that the followers of Jesus paid to Rome for its sanction of religious freedom .
It was Augustine who reread Genesis to fit the limitations of Christian freedom within the Roman world .
He observed that Adam 's sin had not only made sex irreversibly corrupt , but it also cost us our free will , rendering us incapable of genuine political freedom .
" Augustine 's theory of original sin offered an analysis of human nature that became , for better or worse , the heritage of all subsequent generations of Western Christians and the major influence on their psychological and political thinking . "
( Pagels )
Our culture today views the body as inherently sinful ; this belief is treated as an axiom beyond challenge .
Sex is especially sinful -- and the final responsibility for the evil of sex and of the body is located in woman .
Adam would not have sinned but for Eve 's initial transgression .
Evil is located in woman , and in her body and its potentialities .
Such evil must be channeled and controlled : it must be brought under the whip of righteousness .
The campaign to limit or even eliminate abortion is not about pregnancy or the fetus at all : it is about controlling the body , and controlling pleasure , especially sexual pleasure .
For the most part , men run the world .
They are not interested in controlling themselves , and they will still pursue their own pleasure as they choose -- but evil must be resisted .
So they turn to their eternal scapegoat , and what they view as the final source of evil in this world , the barrier between themselves and redemption : woman .
If our world and men are to be saved , they must be saved from woman .
This is , finally , what the battle about abortion concerns .
To the extent people choose to limit a woman 's right to her own body , they accept and reinforce this endlessly destructive cultural tradition -- and they believe in Original Sin , even if they are atheists .
Religion holds no exclusive claim to irrationality of this kind .
They seek to control abortion because they seek salvation , whether they recognize that fact or not .
To bring salvation nearer , women must be eternally subordinate , and they cannot be allowed to do anything other than what men allow .
Arthur 's second premise ties the body ownership issue to a particular view of women and sexuality that is deeply rooted in Western culture , but -- and here 's the twist -- largely because of St. Augustine 's radical reinterpretation of the Adam and Eve myth in Genesis Here is a portion of Arthur 's excerpt from Highwater 's book ( an excerpt of the excerpt ! ) .
Bolds are mine :
So that old meme , " If men could get pregnant , abortion would be a sacrament " is true , Arthur tells us .
But the reason goes deeper than just a hypocritical male willingness to deny women a choice they would never deny themselves .
It goes back to this Augustinian notion that women are The Source of All Evil Thanks to Liberty Street and Shakesville reader , Chief , for the link .
Claim : President Bush has appointed W. David Hager , a physician and anti-abortion activist , to an FDA committee on reproductive drugs .
Status : True .
Example [ Collected on the Internet , 2003 ]
Important — Women ’s Health Issue Important — Women ’s Health Issue
Whether you ’re Right or Left on the issue of women ’s reproductive rights , please consider the following …
President Bush has announced his plan to select Dr. W. David Hager to head up the Food and Drug
Administration ’s ( FDA ) Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee .
The committee has not met for more than two years , during which time its charter has lapsed .
As a result , the Bush Administration is tasked
with filling all eleven positions with new members .
This position does not require Congressional approval .
The FDA ’s Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee makes crucial decisions on matters relating to drugs used in the practice of obstetrics , gynecology and related specialties , including hormone therapy ,
contraception , treatment for infertility , and medical alternatives to surgical procedures for sterilization
and pregnancy termination .
Dr. Hager ’s views of reproductive health care are far outside the mainstream and a setback for reproductive technology .
Dr. Hager is a practicing OB / GYN who describes himself as “ pro-life ” and refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women .
Hager is the author of “ As Jesus Cared for Women : Restoring Women Then and Now . ”
The book blends biblical accounts of Christ healing women with case studies from Hager ’s practice .
In the book Dr. Hager wrote with his wife , entitled “ Stress and the Woman ’s Body , ” he suggests that women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome should seek help from reading the bible and praying .
As an editor and contributing author of “ The Reproduction Revolution : A Christian Appraisal of Sexuality , Reproductive Technologies and the Family , ” Dr. Hager appears to have endorsed the medically inaccurate assertion that the common birth control pill is an abortifacient .
Hagar ’s mission is religiously motivated .
He has an ardent interest in revoking approval for mifepristone
( formerly known as RU - 486 ) as a safe and early form of medical abortion .
Hagar recently assisted the Christian Medical Association in a “ citizen ’s petition ” which calls upon the FDA to revoke its approval of mifepristone in the name of women ’s health .
Hager ’s desire to overturn mifepristone ’s approval on religious grounds rather than scientific merit would
halt the development of mifepristone as a treatment for numerous medical conditions disproportionately
affecting women , including breast cancer , uterine cancer , uterine fibroid tumors , psychotic depression ,
bipolar depression and Cushing ’s syndrome .
Women rely on the FDA to ensure their access to safe and
effective drugs for reproductive health care including products that prevent pregnancy .
For some women , such as those with certain types of diabetes and those undergoing treatment for cancer ,
pregnancy can be a life - threatening condition .
We are concerned that Dr. Hager ’s strong religious beliefs may color his assessment of technologies that are necessary to protect women ’s lives or to preserve and promote women ’s health .
Hager ’s track record of using religious beliefs to guide his medical decision - making makes him a dangerous and inappropriate candidate to serve as chair of this committee .
Critical drug public policy and research must not be held hostage by antiabortion politics .
Members of this important panel should be appointed on the basis of science and medicine , rather than politics and religion .
American women deserve no less .
WHAT CAN YOU DO ?
1. SEND THIS TO EVERY PERSON WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN’S RIGHTS .
2. OPPOSE THE PLACEMENT OF THIS MAN BY CONTACTING THE WHITE HOUSE AND TELL THEM HE IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE ON ANY LEVEL .
Please email President Bush at president@whitehouse.gov or call the White House at ( 202 ) 456-1111 or ( 202 ) 456-1414 and say “ I oppose the appointment of Dr. Hager to the FDA Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee .
Mixing religion and medicine is unacceptable .
Using the FDA to promote a political agenda is inappropriate and seriously threatens all women ’s health . ”
Origins :
This item began circulating in early 2003 and is now outdated , since the decision it sought to influence has long since been made .
However , the outcome of the 2004 presidential election seems to have prompted a new cycle of forwarding among people who mistakenly believe this to be a pending issue .
In December 2002 , W. David Hager was one of eleven physicians appointed to the Food and Drug Administration ’s Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs , a commitee whose job it is to evaluate data and make recommendations on the safety and effectiveness of marketed and experimental drugs for use in obstetrics , gynecology , and related specialties .
Dr. Hager is a part - time professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University Kentucky College of Medicine and a well - known specialist on gynecologic infections , and therefore at first blush his appointment to this committee would seem a good fit .
However , he is also vehemently pro-life and has vigorously played a part in the campaign to get the FDA to withdraw its approval of mifepristone ( RU - 486 ) , a drug that terminates pregnancies .
He is indeed the author of a number of books in which he ’s advocated prayer and the reading of the Scriptures as cures for medical ills .
Dr. Hager makes no bones about his beliefs but says they wo n’t compromise his judgment : “ Yes , I ’m pro-life .
But that ’s not going to keep me from
objectively evaluating medication .
I believe there are some safety concerns ( about mifepristone ) and they should be evaluated . ”
Which is an opinion it now appears the FDA at least somewhat shares .
On 15 November 2004 , the Food and Drug Administration posted a statement on its web site about labeling changes it will require for RU - 486 ( Mifepristone , Mifeprex ) .
Citing instances of serious bacterial infection , bleeding , ectopic pregnancies that have ruptured , and death that have occurred among those who have taken it , the agency will now insist the drug carry much more strongly worded cautions that spell out these risks .
According to the FDA , “ The revised labeling will provide physicians and patients with important information so that they can respond and possibly prevent rare but serious complications that may occur with any abortion .
FDA will continue to monitor the usage of Mifeprex and may take further action . ”
Contrary to the claim made in the now widely - circulated e-mail decrying his appointment , Dr. Hager says he does not deny birth - control prescriptions to unmarried women .
However , Time magazine reported that “ In his private practice , two sources familiar with it say , Hager refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women . ”
In a response to the above petition .
Dr. Hager elaborated on his safety concerns regarding RU - 486 :
May I begin by telling you that no one who has written about me or broadcast information about me has ever interviewed me .
The information being disseminated is rumor and innuendo .
I am pro-life and believe in the sanctity of human life .
May I begin by telling you that no one who has written about me or broadcast information about me has ever interviewed me .
The information being disseminated is rumor and innuendo .
I am pro-life and believe in the sanctity of human life .
I participated in the Citizens Petition to the FDA asking that RU - 486 be withdrawn temporarily from the market until further investigation could be done out of my concern for the health and well - being of women and their unborn children .
Mifeprex was approved under an Accelerated Approval Process , Subpart H , that has been reserved exclusively for anti-AIDS and anti-cancer drugs and an antihypertensive agent .
All medications that are life saving , which mifeprex is not .
The FDA always requires one or more than one randomized , controlled trials before approving a drug .
There were none for mifeprex ( RU - 486 ) .
The nonrandomized , uncontrolled trials that were done insisted on the woman having an ultrasound scan to locate the pregnancy and insure that it was not outside the uterus ( an ectopic pregnancy ) .
The guidelines for use now do not require such a scan and we have reports already of death and morbidity from ruptured ectopic pregnancies since the symptoms of a ruptured ectopic and abortion from mifeprex are the same ; abdominal pain and bleeding .
The FDA requires that medications that may be used in children and adolescents be studied in those groups before approval ( The Pediatric Rule ) and this was not done with mifeprex .
There have been two seriously infected 15 year olds .
Finally , in studies reported to date , among women who fail to abort after receiving mifeprex ( and this occurs 5 - 8 % of the time when administered up to 7 weeks gestation ) there have been limb deformities and absent limbs .
I feel that the drug needs further study .
Searle Laboratories , the manufacturer of misoprostol ( the second drug taken after mifepristone ) has issued a medical alert asking that the drug never be used in pregnant women due to risks of cardiovascular problems .
There has been a fatal heart attack in France and a non-fatal one here in a 21 year old .
Regarding contraception , I advise all of my non-married patients that abstinence is the best way to avoid non-marital pregnancy and STDs .
If she insists on being sexually active or is already active , I advise the use of birth control pills and condoms as well .
I do not believe that standard dose birth control pills are abortifacient , and have never written that .
There is a chapter in a book I co-edited , that purports this idea , but it was included in our book to offer an alternative opinion , not because we believed the idea .
Since when is it wrong to offer alternative opinions ?
Regarding my management and writing about stress - related disorders in women , I have always offered a holistic approach to therapy .
I suggest diet / exercise changes , medications as needed , counseling when required , and meditation / prayer .
This is very distasteful to NOW and Planned Parenthood .
I hope this helps you and enables you to see how “ horrible ” I am in the eyes of the organizations you mention as encouraging me not to serve this Administration .
Whatever one ’s opinion of Dr. Hager , his appointment is a done deal .
Dr. Hager is now a member of the FDA ’s Advisory Committee on Reproductive Health Drugs , so a petition aimed at preventing him from reaching that position is moot .
( Perhaps as a result of the controversy stirred up by the original position , Dr. Hager was appointed to sit on the committee , but not to chair it . )
In June 2004 , Dr. Hager was reappointed to the committee for an additional year .

An Australian woman has reportedly sparked a security scare aboard a US flight after her use of a common Australian phrase was apparently misinterpreted as an act of aggression .
Sophie Reynolds , 41 , from Queanbeyan , was flying aboard SkyWest Airlines from Atlanta to Pittsburgh this week when she asked a flight attendant if she could have a pack of pretzels instead of crackers .
" [ The flight attendant ] said they did n't have any [ pretzels ] , and I said , ' Fair dinkum , ' out of frustration , " Reynolds was quoted as saying in the The Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
I came across a quote on CNet that stuck with me yesterday :
It ’s hard to see how there ’s room for single - core processors when prices for nearly half of AMD ’s dual - core Athlon 64 X2 chips have crept well below the $ 100 mark .
I think that that this sentiment is especially true nowadays ( at least for conventional PC - style computers – not counting embedded things ) .
Multiprocessor ( at least pseudo - multiprocessor , in the form of Intel ’s HyperThreading ) has been available on end - user computers for some time now .
Furthermore , full multiprocessor , in terms of multi-core chips , is now mainstream .
What I mean by that is that by now , most of that computers you ’ll get from Dell , Best Buy , and the likes will be MP , whether via HyperThreading or multi-core .
To give you an idea , I recently got a 4 - way server ( a single quad core chip ) recently , for ~ $ 2300 or so ( though it was also reasonably equipped other than in the CPU department ) .
At work , we got an 8 - way box ( 2 x dual core chips ) for under under ~ $ 3000 or so as well , for running VMs for our quality assurance department .
Just a few years ago , getting an 8 - way box “ just like that ” would have been unheard of ( and ridiculously expensive ) , and yet here we are , with medium - level servers that Dell ships coming with that kind of multiprocessing “ out of the box ” .
Even laptops are coming with multicore chips in today ’s day and age , and laptops have historically not been exactly performance leaders due to size , weight , and battery life constraints .
All but the most entry - level laptops
Dell ships nowadays are dual core , for instance ( and this is hardly limited to Dell either ; Apple is shipping dual - core Intel Macs as well for their laptop systems , and has been for some time in fact . )
Microsoft seems to have recognized this as well ; for instance , there is no single processor kernel shipping with Windows Vista , Windows Server 2008 , or future Windows versions .
That does n’t mean that Windows does n’t support single processor systems , but just that there is no longer an optimized single processor kernel ( e.g. replacing spinlocks with a simple KeRaiseIrql ( DISPATCH_LEVEL ) call ) anymore .
The reason is that for new systems , of which are expected to be the vast majority of Vista / Server 2008 installs , multiprocessing capability is just so common that it ’s not worth maintaining a separate kernel and HAL just for the odd single processor system ’s benefit anymore .
What all this means is that if as developers , you have n’t been really paying attention to the multiprocessor scene , now ’s the time to start – it ’s a good bet that within a few years , even on very low end systems , single processor boxes are going to become very rare .
For intensive applications , the capability to take advantage of MP is going to start being a defining point now , especially as chip makers have realized that they ca n’t just indefinitely increase clock rates and have accordingly began to transition to multiprocessing as an alternative way to increase performance .
Microsoft is n’t the only company that ’s taking notice of MP becoming mainstream , either .
For instance , VMware now fully supports multiprocessor virtual machines ( even on its free VMware Server product ) , as a way to boost performance on machines with true multiprocessing capability .
( And to their credit , it ’s actually not half - bad as long as you are n’t loading the processors down completely , at which point it seems to turn into a slowdown – perhaps due to VMs competing with eachother for scheduling while waiting on spinlocks , though I did n’t dig in deeper . )
( Sorry if I sound a bit like Steve when talking about MP , but it really is here , now , and now ’s the time to start modifying your programs to take advantage of it .
That ’s not to say that we ’re about to see 100 + core computers becoming mainstream tommorow , but small - scale multiprocessing is very rapidly becoming the standard in all but the most low cost systems . )
The U.S. 's top intelligence official has greatly expanded the range of federal and local authorities who can get access to information from the nation 's vast network of spy satellites in the U.S .

Environmentalists Challenge Political Interference
With 55 Endangered Species in 28 States , Seek to Restore
8.7 Million Acres of Protected Habitat Across the Country
TUCSON , Ariz . —
The Center for Biological Diversity today filed a formal notice of intent to sue the Department of the Interior for political interference with 55 endangered species in 28 states .
The notice initiates the largest substantive legal action in the 34 - year history of the Endangered Species Act .
At stake in the suit is the illegal removal of one animal from the endangered species list , the refusal to place three animals on the list , proposals to remove or downgrade protection for seven animals , and the stripping of protection from 8.7 million acres of critical habitat for a long list of species from Washington State to Minnesota and Texas ( see below for species and states affected ) .
“ This is the biggest legal challenge against political interference in the history of the Endangered Species Act , ” said Kieran Suckling , policy director of the Center for Biological Diversity .
“ It puts the Bush administration on trial at every level for systematically squelching government scientists and installing a cadre of political hatchet men in positions of power . ”
Many of the illegal decisions were engineered by former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior Julie MacDonald , who resigned in disgrace following a scathing investigation by the inspector general of misconduct at the Department of the Interior .
Other decisions were ordered by her boss , Assistant Secretary of the Interior Craig Manson , his special assistant Randal Bowman , and Ruth Solomon in the White House Office of Management and Budget .
Some decisions were ordered by lower - level bureaucrats .
“ The Bush administration has tried to keep a lid on its growing endangered species scandal by scapegoating Julie MacDonald , ” said Suckling , “ but the corruption goes much deeper than one disgraced bureaucrat .
It reaches into the White House itself through the Office of Management and Budget .
By attacking the problem systematically through this national lawsuit , we will expose just how thoroughly the distain for science and for wildlife pervades the Bush administration ’s endangered species program . ”
In many of the cases , government and university scientists carefully documented the editing of scientific documents , overruling of scientific experts , and falsification of economic analyses .
Among the 55 species in the legal filing are the marbled murrelet ( CA , OR , WA ) , Florida manatee ( SC to TX ) , Arctic grayling ( MT ) , West Virginia northern flying squirrel ( WV ) , California least tern ( CA ) , brown pelican ( LA , TX , PR , VI ) , California red- legged frog ( CA ) , arroyo toad ( CA ) , Mexican garter snake ( AZ ) , piping plover ( NC to TX ) , snowy plover ( CA , OR , WA ) and Preble 's jumping meadow mouse ( CO , WY ) .
Number of species per state : California ( 24 ) , Texas ( 16 ) , New Mexico ( 9 ) , Arizona ( 5 ) , Louisiana ( 3 ) , Colorado ( 2 ) , Oregon ( 2 ) , Washington ( 2 ) , Kansas ( 2 ) , Georgia ( 2 ) , Florida ( 2 ) , Alabama ( 2 ) , Mississippi ( 2 ) , Puerto Rico ( 2 ) , American Virgin Islands ( 2 ) , Montana ( 1 ) , Iowa ( 1 ) , Minnesota ( 1 ) , Nebraska ( 1 ) , South Dakota ( 1 ) , Missouri ( 1 ) , South Carolina ( 1 ) , Nevada ( 1 ) , Utah ( 1 ) , Wyoming ( 1 ) , West Virginia ( 1 ) , Guam ( 1 ) , Rota ( 1 ) .
Species per state and issue :
But rising fears of terrorism have lessened public hostility to surveillance cameras in the West .
This has been particularly true in Britain , where the police already install the cameras widely on lamp poles and in subway stations and are developing face recognition software as well .
New York police announced last month that they would install more than 100 security cameras to monitor license plates in Lower Manhattan by the end of the year .
Police officials also said they hoped to obtain financing to establish links to 3,000 public and private cameras in the area by the end of next year ; no decision has been made on whether face recognition technology has become reliable enough to use without the risk of false arrests .
Shenzhen already has 180,000 indoor and outdoor closed - circuit television cameras owned by businesses and government agencies , and the police will have the right to link them on request into the same system as the 20,000 police cameras , according to China Public Security .
Some civil rights activists contend that the cameras in China and Britain are a violation of the right of privacy contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
Large - scale surveillance in China is more threatening than surveillance in Britain , they said when told of Shenzhen ’s plans .
“ I do n’t think they are remotely comparable , and even in Britain it ’s quite controversial , ” said Dinah PoKempner , the general counsel of Human Rights Watch in New York .
China has fewer limits on police power , fewer restrictions on how government agencies use the information they gather and fewer legal protections for those suspected of crime , she noted .
While most countries issue identity cards , and many gather a lot of information about citizens , China also appears poised to go much further in putting personal information on identity cards , Ms. PoKempner added .
When police enforce price controls , shoppers flock to buy bargains
The government ordered that the prices of many goods be cut in half , in order to tackle the world 's highest rate of inflation - more than 3,700 % .
But businesses say the new prices are below cost , so some firms have closed .
Zimbabwe 's neighbours are trying to work on a plan to revive the economy - once one of Africa 's most advanced .
A South African newspaper reported on Sunday that this could include pegging the Zimbabwe dollar to the South African rand but this has not been confirmed .
' Police hotlines '
Officials have been visiting shops and businesses to ensure they are respecting the new prices .
We will sustain this operation at all costs to make sure at the end of it there is sanity in the business sector
Chief Superintendent Oliver Mandipaka
Shop till you drop ' A banana costs more than my house '
But this has led to panic buying and goods running short , when the prices are reduced .
Police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Oliver Mandipaka told the state - owned Herald newspaper that some businesses were raising prices again , as soon as the officials left .
" We urge consumers to report such cases , using our police hotlines , " he said .
" We will sustain this operation at all costs to make sure at the end of it there is sanity in the business sector , " he said .
Those arrested and fined include workers from most of Zimbabwe 's top firms , across the country .
The price controls have led to empty shelves
Supt Mandipaka said 33 top executives were in custody and would be taken to court shortly .
One Harare resident told the BBC that a single banana now cost more than she had paid for her four - bedroom house in 2000 .
The government has accused businessmen of deliberately raising prices in order to cause unrest and bring down President Robert Mugabe .
Most economists say Mr Mugabe 's policies are to blame for ruining the economy .
It has been suggested that the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) could offer to help Zimbabwe 's economy in exchange for political reforms .
The MDC and western observers say previous elections have been rigged .
Paying It Forward
The Heinlein Society exists to preserve the legacy renowned writer Robert Anson Heinlein left us in novels , essays , speeches , and short stories that remain as fresh as ever .
We need your help to do it .
We intend in Heinlein ’s words to “ PAY IT FORWARD , ” since we can never pay back the benefits we got from him , by spreading the wisdom of Robert Anson Heinlein to others .
Last Monday , an English racing mogul , a car - collecting Texas tycoon and a gaggle of Kuwaitis bought Aston Martin .
While Ford ’s retained a stake in the luxury automaker , The Blue Oval Boyz no longer have a say in Aston ’s future .
The press spun the deal as a sad but inevitable move : a sign of FoMoCo ’s willingness to face financial facts .
Well , here ’s a bit of Inside Automaking : Ford did n’t put Aston Martin up for sale .
Aston Martin jumped ship .
From its inception in 1913 through 1987 , Aston Martin was a poster child for bespoke luxury automaking– and “ hobby trading . ”
Before Ford bought 75 % of Newport Pagnell ’s finest , Aston Martin had lost its numerous owners numerous millions .
Under Ford ’s management , Aston Martin achieved something akin to a miracle : profit .
Last year , Aston made an indeterminate amount of money ( Ford has always refused to separate Aston ’s finances from those of the Premium Automotive Group ) .
Aston reprised its role as James Bond ’s steed of choice ( both old and new ) in Casino Royale .
And the company unveiled the Rapide , a four - door luxury sports sedan with a built - in chess set and champagne cooler .
This year , The Times estimates that Aston Martin will earn $ 74 m on worldwide sales of some seven thousand cars .
While that ’s a cause for celebration for Aston fans , the production run represents roughly 0.1 percent of Ford ’s 6.5 million annual vehicle sales .
Even if Aston Martin beat their best estimates by 50 percent , it would n’t do squat for Ford 's finances .
In 2006 , Ford ’s Premier Automotive Group ( PAG ) – Aston Martin , Jaguar , Land Rover and Volvo– dropped $ 327 m .
PAG sales were off just one percent , but their bottom line was beaten down by unfavorable exchange rates and warranty accrual adjustments at Jaguar and Land Rover .
So Ford cancelled the Aston Martin Rapide .
This decision did not sit well with Aston ’s management .
Although John Walton , General Manager of Aston Martin North America , emphatically and repeatedly asserted that Aston was not for sale , someone forgot to tell its managers .
Led by engineer , speed demon and Aston CEO Ulrich Bez , the execs made a bold move of their own : they started looking for new owners .
Discretion being the better part of valor , Aston Martin began quietly reaching out to potential suitors ; by invitation , as it were .
They found a willing conspirator in David Richards .
The founding chairman and chief executive of ProDrive , a motorsport and automotive technology company , was already plenty cozy with Auntie Aston .
Since 2004 , ProDrive has been running Aston Martin ’s FIA GT racing team .
The UK company also prepares the GT1 DBR9 and the GT3 DBRS9 race cars for well - heeled privateers .
Richards liked the idea of owning Aston , but , sensibly enough , preferred to use OPM financing ( Other People ’s Money ) .
Enter Houston energy investment banker , car collector and race team backer , John Sinders .
Oh , and two Kuwaiti investment companies : Investment Dar and Adeem Investment Company .
Despite the backroom maneuvers , or perhaps because of them , ProDrive ’s proactive $ 848 m offer found fertile soil in Dearborn .
Apparently , not everyone was in the loop on this one .
At a recent press conference , AM ’s US GM described Aston ’s separation from Ford as “ bittersweet . ”
Looking dapper in a navy blue pinstriped suit and perfectly enunciating the Queen ’s English , Walton said that his longtime friend , Bill Ford , called him post - sale to ask , “ Are you celebrating ? ” “ Are you ? ” Walton said he replied .
“ No , ” said Ford .
“ Nor are we , ” Walton responded .
While Walton may be royally pissed that he was kept in the dark , he ’s being something of a drama queen .
The Aston sale resurrects the Rapide , a model crucial for Aston ’s expansion .
Also , as Top Gear ’s recent Aston vs. Jaguar article demonstrated , Aston Martin needs to develop its models ’ gearbox , handing , ride and engines .
As EVO magazine ’s review of a ProDrive modded Vantage demonstrates , the company has both the spirit and the technology for the job .
The deal also assures access to Ford ’s international resources .
Remember : Aston relies on Ford for everything from its V12 to its Volvo air vents to its switchgear .
With Ford ’s $ 77 m stake in the biz , the “ new ” Aston Martin can continue to dip into The Blue Oval ’s parts bin and gain access to mission critical research , manufacturing , safety and legislative expertise .
All of which means Billy Ford ’s tears were of the crocodile variety .
Although billed as an exit strategy , the Aston “ sale ” is n’t so much a matter of cutting deadwood as a tacit admission that the domestic automaker simply can’t afford to fund its former British subsidiary ’s ambitions .
Bottom line : the corporate mothership is no better or worse off for jettisoning Aston Martin .
But Aston Martin will be far better off with someone else taking the majority of the risk , and reaping the lion 's share of the rewards .

… but , poor Soundwave did n’t make the cut into the new film .
Check out this documentary of one of our most beloved Decepticons ( think VH1 : “ Where are they now ? ” ) .
Note : the f-bombs are dropped a couple times , but the video is hilarious nonetheless !
Wal - Mart jumped into the DRM - free pool with a big slash yesterday , as the retailer began selling high quality MP3s from major labels , at a price that undercuts iTunes .
The music industry is finally coming around to the realization that the only way to break Apple ’s lock on the digital music market is to offer DRM - free music through a variety of online services .
The thinking seems to be that the major labels can finally stop the iTunes juggernaut by flooding the market with affordable , high - quality , iPod compatible music .
While the plan sounds good in theory , it remains to be seen whether it will actually work .
If the Wal - Mart music store is any indication of things to come , the labels might want to prepare for the worst .
I was so intrigued by the possibility of buying unencrypted , cross- platform compatible music , from Wal - Mart that I decided to give the service a try .
What follows is the sad and painful story of how I spent most of an afternoon trying to download one 94 cent song :
When I think about DRM - free music , I immediately assume the music is “ platform independent ” .
That ’s a geeky way of saying that it will play on an iPod , or a Zen , or a Zune , or anything else for that matter .
It goes without saying that DRM - free music should also play on a Windows system , or a Mac , or a Linux box .
That ’s one of the many advantages of DRM - free music — users are n’t locked into one platform .
Unfortunately , Wal - Mart ’s vision of DRM - free music does n’t include platform independence — as I discovered when I attempted to enter their music store using my Mac .
We ’re sorry , your operating system is incompatible .
To provide the best download experience , we can no longer support Windows 98 , ME or NT .
Please visit again after you upgrade to Windows 2000 or XP .
Visit our Help section for complete system requirements information .
Hmmm .
No mention of Mac OS X — for some reason they automatically assume I ’m using Windows ME .
But then again , there ’s no mention of Windows Vista either .
Wal - Mart ’s web development team clearly needs to get out more .
While I ’m was not happy about the situation , I was prepared to deal with it .
I happen to have a Windows system that I keep plugged in for just such occasions .
Not a virtual machine , mind you .
A real live Dell .
So , I login to my Dell , fire - up Firefox and head over to the Wal - Mart music store .
Only to be greeted by this message :
We notice you ’re not using Internet Explorer .
Other browsers may be able to access our original Music Downloads store which has fewer user features than our latest version but offers the same music .
We will be making enhancements to our updated version in the future to support the Firefox browser .
If you want to take advantage of all of the features in our updated design now , please get the latest version of Internet Explorer .
At this point I begin to wonder what year it is .
Wal - Mart ’s music store does n’t support Mac and it discourages the use of Firefox .
I ’m beginning to wonder if I ’ve somehow time travelled into the past and landed in era when web developers actually believed ActiveX had a future .
Finally , I do the unthinkable .
I start Internet Explore .
I really ca n’t remember how long it ’s been since I used Internet Explorer , but apparently it ’s Wal - Mart ’s preferred tool for delivering unencrypted MP3 files to the masses .
When I arrive at the Wal - Mart music store using the latest version of Internet Explorer , I ’m promptly admitted without complaint .
Once inside I begin browsing the Wal - Mart catalog .
First thing I notice , MP3s and WMAs are all mixed together .
In fact , you ’ll frequently see the same album listed multiple times — once as WMA and once as MP3 .
Sometimes albums are listed without an indication of what format they ’re being sold in .
Searching is a challenge too .
Search on an artist name and you ’ll see exactly four albums by that artist .
Want more and you have to click ( at least ) twice to see a full list of available albums by that artist .
It ’s pretty clear that Wal - Mart does n’t want any part of that Web 2.0 nonsense you hear so much about these days .
Eventually I give up searching for music and decide to browse by genre .
I start with Rock -> Alternative .
I ’m happy to find that many alternative rock classics are available from Wal - Mart , including : Ted Nugent ’s Greatest Hits , Frampton Comes Alive ! , and Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell .
They even have Jethro Tull .
It ’s like Wal - Mart has created an online alternative rock superstore .
Since this is only an experiment , I decide to download the Emo classic Do You Feel Like We Do? from Frampton Comes Alive !.
That ’s when I find out that the song is not sold separately .
If I want the song I ’ll have to download the whole Frampton Comes Alive !
album , and I ’m not about to do that .
Not even in the name of science .
It occurs to me , as I ’m sure it would to anyone in the same situation , that an MP3 of the song can probably be found on Bittorrent pretty easily .
Fortunately for Wal - Mart I do n’t really want the song .
At this point I ’m begin to realize how much time I ’ve actually wasted on this experiment .
I quickly find an Elvis Costello song available in the MP3 format and add it to my shopping cart , then I start the check out process .
A pop-up warns me : “ To make downloading music safe and secure we need to add a component to your computer ” .
Huh ?
I ’m downloading music from Wal - Mart , how can it not be “ safe and secure ” ?
Are they trying to tell me something about Wal - Mart ’s security ?
The message goes on to indicate that I need to install the Wal - Mart download manager and a Windows Security Update – despite the fact that the machine I ’m using installs all updates automatically and is always current .
Security Update – Your computer needs a security upgrade from Microsoft so you can play protected files , including secure music files from Walmart.com .
This update takes about 15 seconds .
The update is safe for your computer and no personally - identifying information about you is transmitted during the process .
For those who might miss the subtext in this warning , it ’s saying that you need to install a Microsoft DRM component so that you can download an unencrypted MP3 file from the Wal - Mart music store .
Normally this is the point where I would bail out and cut my losses .
However , I ’m here to review the whole process so I grudgingly agree to install the download manager and security update .
While the updates are running I ’m left to read Wal - Mart ’s terms of service .
I note the restrictions on how I ’m allowed to use the MP3 file that I am ( hopefully ) about to download :
You may download music to a single computer .
You may then transfer music files and backup license files to up to two ( 2 ) additional personal computers .
You may play music an unlimited number of times on up to three ( 3 ) personal computers .
You shall be entitled to 1 ) burn Products solely for personal , non-commercial use up to ten ( 10 ) times and 2 ) export Products solely to a portable device capable of playing Windows Media â„¢
Audio ( “ WMA ” ) files such as a WMA - compliant MP3 player an unlimited number of times .
No mention of MP3 files at all .
Sort of makes you wonder how much time Wal - Mart spent on this launch .
It ’s starting to seem like they might have thrown this together late last week .
Finally the downloads are complete , I ’ve agreed to the terms of service , and it ’s finally time to . . .
REBOOT !
Seriously , in any other situation this would be the point where I dropped out of the process and moved on to doing something more constructive with my life .
But I was doing this for the ‘ Loper , so I had to press on .
I reboot , and briefly forget what I ’m doing sitting in front of a Windows machine .
Then it comes to me :
Oh yeah , I ’m downloading a 94 cent MP3 file from Wal - Mart .
Same thing I ’ve been doing for the last two hours .
I start Internet Explorer , head back to the Wal - Mart Music Store — find the Elvis Costello song AGAIN ! — add it to my cart , and start the checkout process .
That ’s when I ’m informed that I need to install another Windows Update .
I choose to ignore this message .
That turns out to be a good call on my part .
Finally , I ’m asked to create a new account .
I ’m not crazy about handing over my payment information to Wal - Mart , but then it is for the ‘ Loper ( so I use Lopy ’s credit card number ) .
During the account creation process I ’m offered the opportunity to signup for a mind boggling number of Wal - Mart mailing lists .
I make sure all of the boxes are unchecked , then I notice something strange .
They want to know my ‘ baby ’s due date ’ !
I ’m not making this up .
I could n’t possibly make this up .
Wal - Mart apparently has some sort of maternity club and they want me to join .
Nearly three hours of torture and it comes to this — Wal - Mart asking for my baby ’s due date .
Needless to say , I do n’t dignify the question with an answer .
I finish creating my account and FINALLY I ’m allowed to download my 94 cent MP3 file .
After a bit of searching I figure out what fold my trusty Wal - Mart Download Manager has put my new song in , then I drag it over to my Mac — where it plays in iTunes like any other MP3 file .
To recap , my experience downloading one unencrypted mp3 file from Wal - Mart involved two computers , three web browsers , two software updates ( including installing support for Windows WMA protected music ) , and a reboot .
Needless to say , my Wal - Mart Music experience is n’t going to lead me to cancel my eMusic subscription anytime soon .
Preschool teacher Sara Porras leans down to speak , first in English , then in Spanish , to one of the toddlers she cares for at the Parkway Child Development Center .
“ Which one do you want ? ” Porras says to 2 1/2 - year - old Alicia Molina Correa , holding up a game and a puzzle with children on it .
“ Cuál quieres , el juego o los niños ? “
State demographers predict Latinos will be a majority of Californians by mid-century , but in preschool classrooms like Porras ’ , the future is now .
For the first time in modern history , most of the babies being born in California are Latino , according to an analysis of state birth records through 2005 by the Mercury News .
Population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau also show that for the first time in 2004 more than half of the children under age 5 in California are Latino .
2004 was the first full year when the number of babies born to Latina mothers nudged past 50 percent of the children born in California ; it reached 51.5 percent in 2005 .
These newest Californians are the leading edge of a Latino demographic surge that will remake the state in unknown ways during the coming decades .
But those changes , say demographers , will be driven primarily by the birth of native - born children – not by immigration .
Every toddler in Porras ’ San Jose classroom one recent afternoon was Latino , and demographers and educators say the state ’s future quality of life will be determined – starting now – by the quality of education produced inside thousands of similar classrooms .
While more Latino babies are being born , state birth records show the transition to a Latino majority among California ’s youngest children is also caused by a 40 percent drop in the number of children born to white and African - American mothers since 1990 .
“ The implications for the future are : We are n’t talking about an ethnic immigrant community , but an ethnic citizen community , ” said Harry Pachon , president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute in Los Angeles , a think tank that studies issues relating to Latinos .
But with more than 40 percent of Latinos marrying into other ethnic groups , Pachon thinks the emerging majority will remake racial and ethnic identity in California .
“ It might be that the white category might get a little bit darker in California in the next 20 years , ” he said .
“ It ’s going to be harder to talk about `them , ’ when it ’s really `us . ’
That ’s what the figures seem to indicate . ”
Judy Bugarin , a 40 - year veteran of early childhood education and director of the Parkway Child Development Programs for Santa Clara County , feels responsible for better serving a student population that is now about 80 percent Latino .
“ Our goal is that they become fluent in English by the time they ’re ready for kindergarten , ” Bugarin said as she watched Porras introduce children to English by saying each phrase in correct English before repeating it in Spanish .
“ That ’s where we ’re trying to close the achievement gap , by supporting English so they can do well in school . ”
Changing image
Latino birthrate
shaping future
Demographer Bill Frey remembers the photo on a national magazine story about California ’s economic comeback .
The photo – a blond woman on a California beach .
That popular image of a native Californian , he says , is misleading .
“ It ’s not the Beach Boys ; it ’s not the Valley Girls , ” said Frey , of the Brookings Institution in Washington , D.C. “ It ’s the Latino youth and it ’s an important part of California ’s future . ”
Nearly 100,000 fewer babies were born to white mothers in California in 2005 than in 1990 , a decline of 39 percent .
In part , that decline is a function of the demographic waves that run through every population , demographers say .
The youngest members of the large baby boom generation , born between 1946 and 1964 , are now 43 years old – and for the most part beyond the age of childbearing .
The baby boomers were followed by a much smaller cohort – the “ baby bust ” of the late 1960s and ’70s .
For that group of whites and African - Americans now in their prime childbearing years , there are fewer potential parents .
Migration of whites and blacks from California to other states also has reduced the pool of potential parents .
That demographic trough , coupled with the fact that fertility rates for whites and African - Americans are below the rate of replacement , has combined in a dramatic decline in the number of births for those groups .
Partly because of immigration , Latinos and Asians are less subject to the generational ebbs and flows that whites and African - Americans are .
And although their fertility rates in California have been dropping since the early 1990s , Latinas still tend to have more children than women in other ethnic groups – with lifetime fertility rates in 2004 of 2.64 children for Latinas , 1.74 children for white women and 1.77 for black and Asian women , according to the state Department of Finance .
Age and education levels are part of the reason , demographers say : Women with more education tend to have fewer children , and education levels among Latinos tend to be lower .
“ Many of the new immigrants have lower education levels , and those women in general have tended to have more babies , ” said William Clark , a professor of geography at UCLA .
Demographers say that two decades from now , as Latino children born this decade begin having families and buying houses , the strength of the state ’s housing market and economy will rest increasingly on their educational and economic success .
Dowell Myers , a professor of policy and planning at the University of Southern California , has found that Latinos who have a college degree pay an average of 53 percent more for housing than Latinos with a high school diploma .
“ If the aging baby boomers want to hold onto their high home prices , ” said Myers , “ they really better hope that the future generation of Latinos is college - educated . ”
The last year when whites made up a majority of the births in California was 1984 , according to Department of Public Health data , and Latino births have outnumbered whites since 1991 .
Ethnic transition
Birthrate gain
uneven across state
That ethnic transition is happening unevenly across the state , however .
In Los Angeles County , the state ’s largest , birth records show 63 percent of the babies born in 2005 were to Latina mothers .
And in Imperial County , on the Mexican border , four out of five births were to Latina mothers .
In Santa Clara County , Latinos are the largest ethnic group among newborns , but still just 36 percent of births in 2005 , slightly ahead of Asians at about 32 percent .
About 24 percent of the county ’s births in 2005 were to whites , according to records maintained by the state Department of Public Health and tallied from birth certificates .
On California ’s northern border – Humboldt County – just 13 percent of babies in 2005 were Latino .
Already , a strong majority – about 58 percent – of California Latinos are native - born U.S. citizens , according to 2005 census data .
More than twice as many Latino babies are born in the state as enter each year from Mexico through legal immigration .
And while the number of Latinos who arrive through illegal immigration is notoriously difficult to track , demographers say that flow will drop as fertility rates continue to fall in Mexico .
“ If there are fewer people competing for jobs in Mexico , that would drive up wages and that would mean fewer people migrating to the United States , ” said Laura Hill , a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California .
Education ’s impact
Latino parents
stress learning
The surge in Latino births is being felt at places like Familiar Footsteps , a preschool on Cottle Road in the 95123 ZIP code in San Jose , a section of the city where Latino births were up by 48 percent since 1995 .
“ A cultural mix , that ’s what it is , ” said preschool teacher Veronica Ortiz , who does half her instruction in English and half in Spanish .
By late afternoon at the Parkway Center on Fruitdale Avenue , parents are pushing one by one through a metal gate , arriving from work to pick up their young sons and daughters .
The federal - and state - funded center serves children between the ages of 18 months and 5 years , providing subsidized early childhood instruction , meals and other services following the curriculum of the federal Head Start program .
The center , which still has about 200 subsidized slots available for the fall , is limited to children from families with incomes below about $ 48,300 a year for a family of four .
But although family incomes are limited , several parents who spoke one recent afternoon said their aspirations for their children are not .
Monica Marin , a native of Mexico who lives in San Jose , sighed with fatigue as she ticked off the things she is doing for her energetic and gregarious 5 - year - old son , Jordan , who was born here – swimming lessons , soccer and read - along sessions at the library .
Marin hopes they will all be steps that carry Jordan to a university degree , like the one she earned in Mexico .
“ I want , ” she said , “ the same for him . ”

The common rat is hideous thing to behold .
Two species make up what we call the true rat : the black rat Rattus rattus , and the wharf rat Rattus norvegicus .
On the whole of the Earth , the only places where rats do not find a home are the forbiddingly cold Arctic and Antarctic regions , some miscellaneous islands where they have n’t gained a foothold , a wildlife preserve in New Zealand , and Alberta Canada where a concerted effort of riled Canadians will massacre rodents upon a hint that a rat may have infested the province .
Historically the rat has been labeled a pest and more - than - a - nuisance due to their capacity to carry diseases that can infect humans , and their propensity to reproduce like … well … uh… rodents .
However , in this wonderfully modern time in which we live the rat is being put to task by their human overlords doing much more productive things .
One promising rat- platform is the Pouched Rat , a nocturnal native of Africa .
Because they forage for food at night , they are endowed inordinate acumen in their sense of smell .
Though these rats are often considered a menu item in their native sub-Saharan Africa , a fellow by the name of Bart Weetjens thought that he could find a better use for the creatures .
Africa ’s lands have been host to a collage of armed conflicts , leaving the landscape strewn with landmines .
The rats ’ propensity for speedy reproduction makes them plentiful enough to dare risk them in the hazardous job of sniffing out such hazards .
Fortunately , these foodstuffs are apt to be trained .
An African Pouched Rat
In the way Pavlov trained his dogs that food comes with the bell , the rats are trained that food follows a human - made clicking sound .
Once that lesson is ingrained , the rats are then exposed to a test scenario where they are confronted with a set of holes ; if the rat indicates the hole that is emitting “ bomb scent ” , the trainer clicks , and a treat is presented .
In the field , the leashed varmints need to guide a handler through checking 1,000 square feet for explosive .
Because a mistake could cost life and limb of both the rat and handler , the rat is given a final exam before being put in the field to perform the real work :
The rat must run a mock - up minefield and identify every mine in the gamut in order to pass and be pressed into service .
Of course , there are concerns about the mine - sweeping rats .
Some critics decry that animals cannot be as accurate as man-made alternatives such as a metal detector or mine - sweeping robots .
The retort is that the rats are not distracted by the metal flotsam as metal detectors are , and that these poverty - stricken areas have n’t the means to acquire robots .
According to a report in the Washington Post , there are some people who see a mine - sweeping robot limping over a field , burning and smoldering after successfully locating several bombs , and order the test stopped because it ’s inhumane to the robot .
Rats ’ slick , agile frames are also well suited to complex searching , but usually such tasks defy their small brains .
To remedy this shortcoming , researchers have tried sticking a bunch of electrodes directly into the rats ’ brains to enhance their skill set .
The enhanced rats were envisioned in 2001 as a means to delve into wreckage and seek out human victims or survivors .
The experiment is funded by DARPA .
Essentially , they insert a series of electrodes into the rat ’s brain , and tie them to a remote - control that is strapped to the rat ’s back .
An impulse can trigger a whisker sensation , prompting the beasties to turn , and upon turning correctly and continuing on course , they receive a zap directly to the pleasure center of the brain .
After a reported “ five or ten minutes ” of positive reinforcement , the rats are effectively trained to follow instructions from the remote control .
This method of guiding the rats works quite well , though it does n’t seem to function well for the intended purpose .
There are difficulties in guiding a remote - controlled rat through a maze that the controller cannot see .
There are some who feel that the occupation of searching disaster areas is too dangerous to ethically employ living creatures .
Though the rat - tasks currently being pursued may not prove to be practical , there may be some future benefit to knowing how to bend the prolific vermin to our will .
It might be that in the future the rat will become a contributing member of our society ; perhaps consigned to menial labor like removing litter , or following cables .
Or maybe bionically enhanced rodents will become our new overlords … until the wrath of Alberta falls upon them .
Defense Stocks Skyrocket
Since 2001 , defense stocks that make up the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index have climbed 181.7 percent ; the broader market is up 17.6 percent according to an article published last Sunday in the Washington Post .
No longer second to futuristic Defense programs , the basic everyday needs of the men and women on the ground have benefited from enourmous Pentagon spending .
'' Clearly anything that is still related to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan is the hottest market right now , '' Byron Callan , an independent industry analyst told the Post .
The newest program MRAPs , the Marine Corps ' mine - resistant vehicle , has expanded recently from $ 8 billion to $ 20 billion , improving dramatically the outlook for the manufacturer .
According to a report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , spending will reach $ 624.6 billion in fiscal 2008 , including more than $ 100 billion in war supplemental outlays .
But cooling down could occur with a shift in the political landscape .
" I am positive on defense stocks still , but there is cautionary note in background .
There could be potential cuts to the budget , particularly if we get a Democratic president and Democratic Congress , " Richard Tortoriello , equity analyst for aerospace and defense at Standard and Poor 's told the Post .
'' The defense industry has done very , very well without much oversight from Congress , '' David Strauss , U.S. aerospace and defense analyst for UBS Investment Research told the Post .
Among the stocks sprinting to the bank this year -
Force Protection up 31 %
Oshkosh gained 34 %
Lockheed Martin stock has gained 6.7 %
General Dynamics gained 9 %
Raytheon up 4 %
If you have n’t had much experience with the wonderful world of multithreading and do n’t yet believe that threads are evil , Edward A. Lee has an excellent essay named “ The Problem with Threads ” , which challenges you to solve a simple problem : write a thread - safe Observer design pattern in Java .
Good luck .
( Non -Java users who scoff at Java will often fare even worse , since Java is one of the few languages with some measure of in - built concurrency control primitives — even if those primitives still suck . )
His paper ’s one of the best introductory essays I ’ve read about the problems with shared state concurrency .
( I call it an essay since it really reads a lot more like an essay than a research paper .
If you ’re afraid of academia and its usual jargon and formal style , do n’t be : this paper ’s an easy read . )
For those who are n’t afraid of a bit of formal theory and maths , he presents a simple , convincing explanation of why multithreading is an inherently complex problem , using the good ol ’ explanation of computational interleavings of sets of states .
His essay covers far more than just the problem of inherent complexity , however :
Lee then discusses how bad threading actually is in practice , along with some software engineering improvements such as OpenMP , Tony Hoare ’s idea of Communicating Sequential Processes , Software Transactional Memory , and Actor - style languages such as Erlang .
Most interestingly , he discusses why programming languages aimed at concurrency , such as Erlang , wo n’t succeed in the main marketplace .
Of course , how can you refuse to read a paper that has quotes such as these ?
“… a folk definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and to expect the results to be different .
By this definition , we in fact require that programmers of multithreaded systems be insane .
Were they sane , they could not understand their programs . ”
“ I conjecture that most multi - threaded general - purpose applications are , in fact , so full of concurrency bugs that as multi-core architectures become commonplace , these bugs will begin to show up as system failures .
This scenario is bleak for computer vendors : their next generation of machines will become widely known as the ones on which many programs crash . ”
“ Syntactically , threads are either a minor extension to these languages ( as in Java ) or just an external library .
Semantically , of course , they rhoroughly disrupt the essential determinism of the languages .
Regrettably , programmers seem to be more guided by syntax than semantics . ”
“… non-trivial multi- threaded programs are incomprehensible to humans .
It is true that the programming model can be improved through the use of design patterns , better granularity of atomicity ( e.g. transactions ) , improved languages , and formal methods .
However , these techniques merely chip away at the unnecessarily enormous non-determinism of the threading model .
The model remains intrinsically intractable . ”
( Does that “ intractable ” word remind you of anyone else ? )
“… adherents to … [ a programming ] language are viewed as traitors if they succumb to the use of another language .
Language wars are religious wars , and few of these religions are polytheistic . ”
If you ’re a programmer and are n’t convinced yet that shared - state concurrency is evil , please , read the paper .

Senate Democrats considering an Iraq spending bill mustered enough votes late this afternoon — ( barely ) at 50 - 48 — to defeat a Republican amendment that would have stripped out language setting a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
The Senate ’s actions , with a vote on the full measure expected as early as tomorrow , follows the House vote by four days .
However the two bills are meshed , President Bush has vowed to veto whatever reaches his desk if it includes a timetable for removing troops from the war .
The Democratic - backed Senate bill calls for troop withdrawal to commence within 120 days of the enactment of such a law , with them out by March 31 , 2008 .
The amendment defeated today was proposed by Senator Thad Cochran , a Republican , and cosponsored by nearly a dozen others .
It contained this language as its mission :
To strike language that would tie the hands of the Commander - in - Chief by imposing an arbitrary timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , thereby undermining the position of American Armed Forces and jeopardizing the successful conclusion of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
As the Times ’s Jeff Zeleny mentioned in an earlier post , Republican Chuck Hagel decided to vote with the Democrats in support of a timetable for withdrawal , as did Republican Gordon Smith of Oregon .
Senator Mark Pryor , Democrat of Arkansas , joined the Republicans , as did Senator Joe Lieberman , independent - Democrat .
There ’s a procedural vote tomorrow morning , and the majority leader , Harry Reid , saying there were more than 100 amendments proposed on the bill .
He and the minority leader , Mitch McConnell , were trying to figure out how to proceed with the main spending bill .
TerraNet hope their network will become a standard feature
It is hoping to dramatically improve communications in the developing world .
Swedish company TerraNet has developed the idea using peer - to - peer technology that enables users to speak on its handsets without the need for a mobile phone base station .
The technology is designed for remote areas of the countryside or desert where base stations are unfeasible .
Projects backed by TerraNet recently launched in Tanzania and Ecuador .
TerraNet founder Anders Carlius told the BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme that the idea for TerraNet came when he was on safari in Tanzania in 2002 , and found that poor connectivity meant he could not ring friends riding in another jeep only a few metres away .
" I started thinking , ' could n't we get phone - to - phone without needing any other equipment , and actually have real voice communication , like a telephone call , between units ? ' " he said .
Digital identity
The TerraNet technology works using handsets adapted to work as peers that can route data or calls for other phones in the network .
The handsets also serve as nodes between other handsets , extending the reach of the entire system .
Each handset has an effective range of about one kilometre .
This collaborative routing of calls means there is no cost to talk between handsets .
When a TerraNet phone is switched on , it begins to look for other phones within range .
If it finds them , it starts to connect and extend the radio network .
TerraNet say their network is perfect for communities like students
When a number is dialled a handset checks to see if the person being called is within range .
If they are , the call goes through .
While individually the phones only have a maximum range of 1 km , any phone in between two others can forward calls , allowing the distance to double .
This principle applied many times creates a mini network .
However , Mr Carlius admitted that this has created big problems with having enough available frequencies .
The system can also be used to make calls to other TerraNet mesh networks via a net - connected PC fitted with an inexpensive USB dongle .
" If you look at places like Africa , South America , India , China , we 're really for the first time giving people a digital identity , " he added .
" People are able to talk to other people using a phone number .
" With our stuff , we are giving the low - end man or woman the chance to talk locally for free . "
Ericsson backed TerraNet - but other companies are sceptical
He said that were this to happen , it could potentially spell the end for the current Global System for Mobile ( GSM ) communications model .
About 70 % of all mobile phones use this technology .
Mr Carlius said large mobile firms did not like the idea of using a peer - to - peer model to make calls .
" One of the biggest things against us is that the big operators and technology providers are really pushing against us , saying this technology does n't work and it does n't have a business model , " he said .
" This is fine - just join us in Lund and see how the technology works , and ask our customers how our business model works . "
Mr Carlius said that mobile phone manufacturer Ericsson had invested around £ 3 m in TerraNet , and this indicated that the business model for the network is sound .
This is what General Petraeus calls success :
A few nights ago , for example , we witnessed the death of one American soldier and the critical wounding of two others when a lethal armor- piercing explosive was detonated between an Iraqi Army checkpoint and a police one .
Local Iraqis readily testified to American investigators that Iraqi police and Army officers escorted the triggermen and helped plant the bomb .
These civilians highlighted their own predicament : had they informed the Americans of the bomb before the incident , the Iraqi Army , the police or the local Shiite militia would have killed their families .
As many grunts will tell you , this is a near - routine event .
Reports that a majority of Iraqi Army commanders are now reliable partners can be considered only misleading rhetoric .

I ’ve been programming next - gen consoles for a while now , and I have to say : it ’s not getting any easier to write games to take advantage of multi-core systems .
The conventional wisdom at my company is : writing multithreaded code is hard , so “ ordinary programmers ” should not be doing it – let ’s leave it to the senior engineers who write the systems code to get it right .
Ordinary gameplay / AI / animation / etc engineers should n’t have to worry themselves with this stuff .
I ’m currently a lead engineer ( which puts me in the “ senior ” category – although technically at my company “ lead ” is not a job rank per se ) .
Lead engineers typically have a long history in the industry , and usually have a background in tackling the hard tasks of engineering lower - level systems in games .
Many leads have done rendering , some have physics experience , many have experience of architecting games , and a few ( myself included ) also have a networking background .
Basically , these correspond pretty well to the skills that one ca n’t hire for love nor money .
As the highest - ranking engineers who still actually write code , it falls to us to provide technical direction for the projects in our studio and our company .
I can partly see why “ leave it to the senior engineers ” is a reasonable stance – for example , dealing with the intricacies of memory barriers is a task I would n’t wish on anyone .
This stuff is hard enough to get right that the fewer people who have to touch it , the better .
But on the other hand , I do n’t think we ’re doing enough to get safe forms of concurrency into the hands of the engineers who write the game code .
We ( both internally , and I think , in the wider industry ) are making some progress on some systems code being multithreaded .
However , it ’s not great progress .
Of course , one problem is that PCs are still lagging behind next - gen consoles : the min spec target , even for games looking at shipping this time next year , is still a single - core P4 based system .
Hyperthreaded if we ’re lucky .
Multicore PCs are out there , and are getting more numerous , but do n’t yet have the market share to support dropping the lower end .
And of course both Xbox 360 and PS3 still have more cores than a current top - end PC ( 6 hardware threads and 2 PPU hardware threads + 6 SPUs respectively ) .
For the most part , we are still moving single systems to other threads – there is nothing general about our approach to multithreading yet , and it ’s not going to scale except in a very few cases .
We have managed to separate “ game ” and “ render ” threads , but both of them are still fairly monolithic .
There is some hope for physics simulation being threaded , and this is mostly being worked on by companies like Havok and Ageia .
There is also some work being done on lower - level AI tasks like pathfinding .
Some game tasks ( like culling objects against the view frustum ) can be relatively easily split onto another thread .
And some game tasks continue to be threaded , the way they have been for years ( audio and networking spring to mind ) .
But the major problem area for multithreading is where the actual gameplay happens : the intersection of animation , “ high - level ” AI , player control and to some extent physics .
When I talk about “ high - level ” AI I mean the decision - making and glue code that controls what entities in the game do .
The main game loop of object updates has multiple ordering dependencies among these systems and updating one system for a single object often causes cascading requests to other systems .
For example : animation must be posed before physics is resolved ( because posing animation may cause an arm to stick through a wall that a character is standing close to , and the physics system will then apply constraints to push the arm back outside the wall ) .
Another example is that AI will decide to change what a character is doing and therefore will drive animation blending .
A third example is that AI code will often want to know whether two characters can see each other in order to decide what to do .
This involves asking the physics system to do a line - of - sight trace between the objects , and the result is needed to make the AI decision , so the call is typically synchronous .
So , animation , AI and physics are often tightly coupled in the update of a single object , and the update of a single object will often touch the data of half a dozen other objects ( e.g. the weapon I ’m carrying , what my enemy is doing , what state my buddies are in , etc ) .
It does n’t take a genius to realise that this is a pretty bad state of affairs if we ’re trying to split parts of these tasks on to multiple threads .
And these are not lightweight tasks either : posing animation involves evaluating state machines and a bunch of matrices and quaternion calculations ; a physics trace often involves a heavyweight data structure traversal ( octtree , BSP or similar ) ; AI involves complex state machines , sometimes interpreted script , and a lot of conditions ( something , incidentally , that the PowerPC architecture of the Xbox 360 and PS3 is quite poor at ) .
So what ’s to be done ?
Well , I have a couple of ideas designed to make it easier for “ ordinary engineers ” to take advantage of multiprocessing in at least a semi- safe way .
The first idea is Software Transactional Memory or STM .
You ’ll find the literature if you care to look around the web .
I think this is the only practical solution to achieving some concurrency in updating the thousands of objects that we need to , each of which touches half a dozen others .
And I think we should apply it at the object level .
This will require a bit of extra memory , but if done right , the performance gains could be significant .
And importantly , it will scale .
For the first time , I think we have the potential to update thousands of objects across as many cores as we have .
Of course , I do n’t yet have any practical experience , and we may find that a new bottleneck ( e.g. memory access ) springs up .
The second idea I have to enable more multiprocessing of mid- and systems - level code ( and perhaps some higher - level code ) by functional programming .
I bet that more than 90 % of the loops we write can be implemented in terms of map and fold .
The challenge is finding a way to abstract this in C++ ( much as I would like to write games in Haskell , I do n’t see it being adopted any time soon – but I may well experiment with a scripting language embedded in Haskell ) .
Imagine if AI and player control engineers could , instead of writing a synchronous for - loop to find the closest enemy , write that same functionality in terms of map and fold ( which is easy ) and automatically have it be distributed across cores ?
The beauty of this idea is that the concurrency work is done once to make map and fold themselves multicore , and then ( with appropriate forethought and data constraints ) everyone can take advantage of that .
So the only thing I need to do now is actually write this code , get some preliminary use cases together , try it out , and then introduce it to my team .
Wish me luck …

This year , the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American economist Edmund S. Phelps , whose book on labor was favorably reviewed by David Gordon and who has engaged the Austrian theory of the business cycle on the pages of the Wall Street Journal .
While rejecting the Austrian view , Phelps has nonetheless written that " we must honor the Austrian theorists as the first to see capitalist ventures as voyages to the unknown , driven by visions of entrepreneurs and hunches of lenders and investors and fraught with unanticipated consequences . "
The Nobel committee credits Phelps for clarifying the relationship between inflation and unemployment .
Indeed , he did make a contribution in this respect .
What he did not do is what most economists credit him for doing : identifying the true causes behind the phenomenon of stagflation .
The phenomenon of stagflation is characterized by the simultaneous occurance of a strengthening in the growth momentum of prices and a decline in real economic activity .
A famous case of stagflation occurred during the 1974 — 75 period .
In March 1975 , industrial production fell by nearly 13 % while the yearly rate of growth of the consumer price index ( CPI ) jumped to around 12 % .
Likewise a large fall in economic activity and galloping price inflation was observed during 1979 .
By December of that year , the yearly rate of growth of industrial production stood close to nil while the rate of growth of the CPI stood at over 13 % .
The stagflation of 1970s was a big surprise to most mainstream economists who held that a fall in real economic growth and a rise in the unemployment rate should be accompanied by a fall in the rate of inflation and not an increase .
According to the then accepted view , the central bank influences the real rate of economic expansion by means of monetary policies .
This influence however , carries a price , which manifests in terms of inflation .
For instance , if the goal is to reach a faster rate of economic growth and a lower unemployment rate , citizens should be ready to pay a price for this in terms of a higher rate of inflation .
Thus was it believed that there is a trade - off between inflation and unemployment ( the Phillips curve ) .
The lower the unemployment rate the higher is the rate of inflation .
Conversely , the higher the unemployment rate the lower the rate of inflation is going to be .
The events of the 1970s therefore came as a shock for most economists .
Their theories based on the supposed existing trade - off suddenly became useless .
In the late 1960s Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman ( PF ) challenged the popular view that there can be a sustainable trade - off between inflation and unemployment .
PF had been arguing that , contrary to the popular way of thinking , there is no long - term trade - off between inflation and unemployment .
In fact , over time , according to PF , loose central bank policies set the platform for lower real economic growth and a higher rate of inflation , i.e. , stagflation . ,
PF Explanation of Stagflation
Below we provide a simplified framework of the thought of Phelps and Friedman ( PF ) regarding the inflation - unemployment trade - off and its link to stagflation .
Starting from a situation of equality between the current and the expected rate of inflation , the central bank decides to lift the rate of economic growth by lifting the rate of growth of the money supply .
As a result , a greater supply of money enters the economy and each individual now has more money at his disposal .
On account of this increase , every individual is of the view that he has become wealthier .
This increases the demand for goods and services , which in turn sets in motion an increase in the production of goods and services .
All this in turn lifts producers demand for workers and subsequently the unemployment rate falls to below the equilibrium rate , which both Phelps and Friedman labelled as the natural rate .
According to PF , the increase in people 's overall demand for goods and services and the ensuing increase in the production of goods and services is of a temporary nature .
To begin with , once the unemployment rate falls below the equilibrium rate , this puts upward pressure on the rate of price inflation .
( According to Phelps , the natural - rate theory says that when unemployment is below the natural level , the tightness in the labor market will cause prices and wages to be reset above expectations . )
Individuals then begin to realize that there has been a general loosening in the monetary policy .
In response to this realization , they start forming higher inflation expectations .
Individuals realize that their previous increase in the purchasing power is actually dwindling .
Consequently , the overall demand for goods and services weakens .
A weakening in overall demand in turn slows down the production of goods and services while the rate of unemployment goes up — an economic slowdown emerges .
In short , the realization that there was a general loosening in monetary policy weakens the demand for goods and services .
Observe that we are now back where we were prior to the central bank 's decision to loosen its monetary stance , but with a much higher rate of inflation .
Consequently , what we have here is a fall in the production of goods and services — a rise in the unemployment rate — and an increase in price inflation .
That is to say , we have stagflation .
As long as the increase in the money supply rate of growth is unexpected , this theory implies , the central bank can engineer an increase in the rate of economic growth .
However , once people learn about the increase in the money supply and assess the implications of this increase , they adjust their conduct accordingly .
Subsequently , the boost to the real economy from the increase in the money supply rate of growth disappears .
In order to overcome this hurdle and strengthen the rate of economic growth the central bank would have to surprise individuals through a much higher pace of monetary pumping .
However , after some time lag people will learn about this increase and adjust their conduct accordingly .
Consequently , the effect of the higher rate of growth of money supply on the real economy is likely to vanish again and all that will remain is a much higher rate of inflation .
From this we can conclude that by means of loose monetary policies , the central bank can only temporarily create real economic growth .
Over time however , such policies will only result in higher price inflation .
In short , according to PF there is no long - term trade - off between inflation and unemployment .
Can money grow the economy ?
We have seen that according to PF , loose monetary policy can only grow the economy in the short term but not in the long term .
In this sense , PF have accepted mainstream ideas that for a given level of prices , an increase in money supply increases the purchasing power of money , which in turn lifts the overall demand for goods and services .
( To be more precise , PF are saying that the rate of increase in the money supply must be unexpected . )
The increase in overall demand in turn triggers an increase in the production of goods and services — demand creates supply .
In this sense money is an agent of economic growth .
However , there are some serious difficulties with all this .
In PF 's story , as a result of the increase in the money supply rate of growth , a greater supply of money enters the economy and each individual now has more money at his disposal .
This is , however , not a tenable proposition .
When money is injected , there must always be somebody who gets the new money first and somebody who gets the new money last .
In short , money moves from one individual to another individual and from one market to another market .
The beneficiaries of this increase are the first recipients of money .
With more money in their possession ( assuming that demand for money stays unchanged ) and for a given amount of goods available , they can now divert to themselves a bigger portion of the pool of available goods than before the increase in money supply took place .
This means that fewer goods are now available to those individuals who have not received the new money as yet ( i.e. , the late recipients of money ) .
This of course means that the effective demand of the late recipients of money must fall since fewer goods are now available to them .
The fact that their effective demand must fall is made manifest through the increase in prices ( more money per unit of a good ) and to the consequent fall in the last recipients ' purchasing power .
People are not identical , even if their respective money holdings have risen by the same percentage .
Their response to this will not be identical .
This in turn means that those individuals who spent the new money first benefit at the expense of those who spend the new money later on .
Hence an increase in money supply cannot cause a general increase in overall effective demand for goods .
Only through an increase in the production of goods can this be achieved .
The more goods an individual produces the more of other goods he can secure for himself .
This means that an individual 's effective demand is constrained by his production of goods , all other things being equal .
Demand , therefore , cannot stand by itself and be independent .
It is limited by production , which serves as the mean of securing various goods and services .
According to James Mill ,
When goods are carried to market what is wanted is somebody to buy .
But to buy , one must have the wherewithal to pay .
It is obviously therefore the collective means of payment which exist in the whole nation constitute the entire market of the nation .
But wherein consist the collective means of payment of the whole nation ?
Do they not consist in its annual produce , in the annual revenue of the general mass of inhabitants ?
But if a nation 's power of purchasing is exactly measured by its annual produce , as it undoubtedly is ; the more you increase the annual produce , the more by that very act you extend the national market , the power of purchasing and the actual purchases of the nation … .
Thus it appears that the demand of a nation is always equal to the produce of a nation .
This indeed must be so ; for what is the demand of a nation ?
The demand of a nation is exactly its power of purchasing .
But what is its power of purchasing ?
The extent undoubtedly of its annual produce .
The extent of its demand therefore and the extent of its supply are always exactly commensurate .
We can also infer that the dependence of demand on the production of goods cannot be removed by means of loose monetary policy .
On the contrary , loose monetary policy will only undermine the rate of growth of real goods and services .
Here is why .
Increases in Money Supply Actually Weaken Economic Growth
In a market economy , money has just one role — to provide the services of a medium of exchange .
According to Rothbard ,
Consumer goods are used up by consumers ; capital goods and natural resources are used up in the process of producing consumer goods .
But money is not used up ; its function is to act as a medium of exchanges — to enable goods and services to travel more expeditiously from one person to another .
Money permits the product of one specialist to be exchanged for the product of another specialist .
Or we can say that an exchange of something for something takes place by means of money .
Things are , however , not quite the same once money is generated out of " thin air " as a result of loose central bank policies and fractional reserve banking .
Once money is created out of " thin air " and employed in the economy , it sets in motion an exchange of nothing for something .
This amounts to a diversion of real wealth from wealth generators to the holders of newly created money .
In the process genuine wealth generators are left with fewer resources at their disposal , which in turn weakens the wealth generators ' ability to grow the economy .
So contrary to PF 's theories , money cannot grow the economy even in the short run .
On the contrary , an increase in money only undermines real economic growth .
Notice that this conclusion is reached regardless of whether the money rate of growth is expected or unexpected .
To clarify this point let us assume that the central bank makes it known to everyone that the rate of growth of the money supply is going to increase from 5 % to 10 % .
According to PF this should n't have any effect on real economic growth .
If the earlier and the later receivers of money now anticipate higher inflation in the future they may lower their present demand for money .
Once they lower the demand for money and increase the amount of goods bought , only then , all other things being equal , will the prices of goods start rising in line with the expected increase in price inflation .
This however , does not alter the fact that once early receivers spend the newly printed money it results in an exchange of nothing for something and to a weakening in the process of real wealth formation .
( Again , the increase in money supply is never instantly spread across the board but always starts with earlier receivers . )
In short , contrary to PF , irrespective of the fact that the increase in money is anticipated it will undermine real economic growth .
What then causes stagflation ?
We have seen that an increase in money supply must lead to an exchange of nothing for something .
As a result , the process of real wealth formation weakens and this in turn undermines the rate of economic growth .
The increase in the money supply rate of growth coupled with the slowdown in the rate of growth of goods produced is what the increase in the rate of price inflation is all about .
( Note that a price is the amount of money paid for a unit of a good . )
What we have here is a faster increase in price inflation and a decline in the rate of growth in the production of goods .
But this is exactly what stagflation is all about , i.e. , an increase in price inflation and a fall in real economic growth .
It seems therefore that the phenomenon of stagflation is the normal outcome of loose monetary policy .
This is in agreement with PF .
Contrary to PF , however , we maintain that stagflation is not caused by the fact that in the short run people are fooled by the central bank .
Stagflation is the natural result of monetary pumping which weakens the pace of economic growth and at the same time raises the rate of increase of the prices of goods and services .
If we were to accept that increases in the rate of economic growth are inversely associated with the unemployment rate , then the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation should be positively associated — an increase in the rate of inflation is accompanied by the increase in the unemployment rate .
Yet the historical data does not always support this conclusion .
For instance , during the 1948 — 1969 period , the rate of price inflation and the unemployment rate were negatively associated .
( An increase in the rate of inflation was accompanied by a fall in the unemployment rate . )
An inverse correlation between the rate of inflation and the unemployment rate can also be observed from 2000 to present .
A statistical correlation or lack of it between two variables should n't be the only or final determining factor regarding causality .
If anything , it can be of some help in the beginning of the investigation .
The data and its correlation are simply the raw material , which must be scrutinized .
One must figure out by means of reasoning what the statistical display might mean .
We have seen that when money is created out of " thin air " and employed in an exchange it weakens real economic growth in relation to a situation wherein no monetary expansion took place .
Likewise we can confidently say that on account of the increase in money out of " thin air " in comparison with a situation where no such money was created , the rate of growth of prices must increase .
The fact that the strengthening in monetary growth may not always manifest visible stagflation does n't refute what we have concluded with respect to the consequences of a stronger rate of monetary pumping on economic growth and prices .
Consider the following situation .
On account of past increases in the rate of growth of the money supply and the subsequent softening in the rate of growth of goods produced , the rate of growth of price inflation is going up .
Now , because the underlying bottom line of the economy is still strong notwithstanding the damage inflicted by a stronger money supply rate of growth , the rate of growth of the production of goods only weakens slightly .
Within such a situation the unemployment rate could still continue falling .
( Remember that increases in the money supply undermine the wealth formation process and weaken the rate of production of goods and services . )
What we have here is a visible increase in price inflation and a fall in the unemployment rate .
Any theory which concludes from this inverse correlation that there is a trade - off between inflation and unemployment will be false since it ignores the true consequences of loose monetary policy .
We suggest that any theory that relies solely on observed statistical correlations is nothing more than an exercise in curve fitting .
For PF and most mainstream economists , the criteria for accepting a theory is a visible supporting statistical correlation .
It is because of the visible stagflation of 1970s that PF 's theory of stagflation gained wide support .
One would have thought that in order to be consistent with their way of assessing a theory given the observed inverse correlation between inflation and unemployment since 2000 , PF should acknowledge that their stagflation hypothesis is not valid .
Conclusion
This year 's Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Phelps for his work on the relationship between inflation and unemployment .
Phelps could have made great contribution to the economic profession by dismissing the entire framework of the supposed trade - off between inflation and unemployment ( the Phillips Curve ) .
Unfortunately he has chosen to stick to the bankrupt framework by making some amendments to it .
The profession 's understanding of these issues still has n't reached the heights of Mises 's own understanding , as seen in his book The Causes of the Economic Crisis .
Contrary to the accepted way of thinking , we suggest that these amendments have done nothing to further our understanding of economic conditions such as stagflation .
In this regard , both Phelps and another Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman have introduced more confusion rather than clarity regarding the explanation of the phenomenon of stagflation .
j Query 1.1.4 : Faster , More Tests , Ready for 1.2
Posted on by
We ’re pleased to announce the latest release of jQuery : jQuery 1.1.4 .
Barring any horrible mistakes , this release will be the last of the 1.1.x branch – leading us up to the release of jQuery 1.2 in September .
You can download the release from the jQuery Google Code page :
Download :
Improvements
A number of improvements have gone into this release , in addition to all of the normal bug fixes .
Any Name jQuery
j Query has taken a big step to become the first major JavaScript library completely capable of renaming itself .
Previously , functionality was provided to rename the oft - used ‘ $’ shortcut for ‘ j Query ’ – but now you can also rename both ‘ $’ and ‘ jQuery ’ .
This allows for two fantastic results :
You can now include multiple versions of jQuery , simultaneously , on the same page .
You can now embed jQuery into the namespaces of other objects and libraries , for example : // With the Dojo Toolkit dojo.jquery = jQuery.noConflict( true ) ; dojo.jquery ( " #elem div " ).slideDown ( " slow " ) ; // or with Yahoo UI YAHOO.query = jQuery.noConflict( true ) ; YAHOO.query ( " span.hidden " ) .removeClass ( " hidden " ) ;
Speed Improvements
What would a release be without some speed improvements ?
We took the opportunity to step beyond any previously - released speed test suites and improve the speed of the three most commonly used portions of jQuery : ID selectors , tag name selectors , and each ( ) loops .
It ’s absolutely critical that each of these items are made as fast as possible , as they have the possibility of being re-used endlessly , and repeatedly .
Here ’s the test suite used to analyze the speed of the three changes .

This is very big news – and should be especially so to most developers out there .
The jQuery test suite has been completely re-tooled and improved from the ground up for stability .
A brand new swath of Animation and Ajax tests have been integrated bringing jQuery ’s total test count to over 800 tests !
Additionally , the test suite completely passes with no errors in all the major browsers that we support : Firefox 2 , Safari 3 , Internet Explorer 6 , and Opera 9 ( Safari 2 and IE 7 not shown for brevity ) .
Proof :
In the future , we ’re working to improve our coverage of the Event , Attribute , and CSS portions of jQuery – undoubtedly bringing us to over 1000 tests very soon .
Additionally , it should be noted that the jQuery test suite is now embedded in the Mozilla test suite – running against every commit of the upcoming Firefox 3 release .
You can feel safe knowing that in the newest release of Firefox , everything will just keep working , as you would expect it to .
Bug Fixes
53 tickets have been closed for this release .
You can read the full details on the the bug tracker ( this includes fixes that went in to jQuery 1.1.3.1 ) .
A bunch of large issues were resolved , including issues related to HTML script evaluation , Safari CSS Computed Style access , and Ajax settings manipulation .
New Functionality
A couple pieces of new functionality have been introduced .
The first two of which , .slice ( ) and : has ( ) , are going to be a part of jQuery 1.2 , but their existence is obligated by some deprecated functionality ( see below ) .
The new changes to extend ( ) and noConflict ( ) were put in order to be able to fix some long standing bugs in jQuery .
.slice ( )
You may recognize this method name from the .slice ( ) method that exists on JavaScript arrays – you ’re in luck because it behaves identically .
This is a great method for chopping apart jQuery objects and getting to the elements inside of them .
All of the following are valid ways to use the slice ( ) method :
$ ( " div " ) .slice ( 0,1 ) ; //
First div $ ( " div " ) .slice ( -1 ) ; // Last div $ ( " div " ) .slice ( 1,-1 ) ; //
All divs but the first and last $ ( " div " ) .slice ( 1,3 ) ; //
The second and third div $ ( " div " ) .slice ( 7,8 ) ; //
The eighth div
: has ( )
This new selector is a replacement for the current way of checking for elements inside of another element ( div[ p ] ) .
You can now use this selector just as you would that particular XPath selector , like so :
//
All divs with a paragraph inside $ ( " div:has ( p ) " ) //
All anchors with an image inside $ ( " a:has ( img ) " ) //
All divs that have an anchor inside that have an image inside $ ( " div:has ( a:has ( img ) ) " )
Deep , recursive .extend ( )
This has been a frequently - requested addition to the jQuery .extend ( ) method .
This change allows you to deeply merge nested objects ( as opposed to having them overwrite each other ) .
This is best demonstrated through an example :
// Normal .extend ( ) j Query.extend ( { name : " John " , location : { city : " Boston " } } , { last : " Resig " , location : { state : " MA " } } ) ; // Result : // => { name : " John " , last : " Resig " , location : { state : " MA " } }
// New Deep .extend ( ) j Query.extend ( true , { name : " John " , location : { city : " Boston " } } , { last : " Resig " , location : { state : " MA " } } ) ; // Result : // => { name : " John " , last : " Resig " , // location : { city : " Boston " , state : " MA " } }
.noConflict ( true )
As described previously , this addition to .noConflict ( ) allows you to completely rename both the ‘ jQuery ’ namespace and the ‘ $ ’ shortcut , while also rolling back any changes those introductions may have done .
You can use this new shortcut like so :
// Give jQuery a custom name : var jq = jQuery.noConflict( true ) ; jq ( " #id div " ) .hide ( ) ; // Both Fail - $ and jQuery have been renamed : $ ( " #id div " ) . hide ( ) ; j Query ( " #id div " ) .hide ( ) ;
This trick can also be used to push jQuery into an existing namespace , like so :
// Put jQuery in a namespace : var obj = {} ; obj.jq = jQuery.noConflict( true ) ; obj.jq ( " #id div " ) .hide ( ) ;
Deprecated Functionality
We are deprecating a number of methods in jQuery 1.1.4 in preparation for the API changes in the upcoming jQuery 1.2 .
Wherever possible , we ’ve provided alternate methods for performing actions .
With jQuery 1.2 , as with the jQuery 1.1 release , a backwards compatibility plugin will be provided .
Thus , if you wish to continue using these particular techniques , you ’ll be able to use that plugin and continue doing so .
Additionally , in order to handle the XPath changes another , separate , plugin will be released that will handle XPath selector functionality in jQuery .
This plugin will be made available along with the jQuery 1.2 release .
Selectors
$ ( " div/ / p " ) XPath Descendant Selector
Please use the CSS $ ( " div p " ) selector instead .
Or , when jQuery 1.2 is released , use the new XPath Plugin .
$ ( " div / p " ) XPath Child Selector
Please use the CSS $ ( " div > p " ) selector instead .
Or , when jQuery 1.2 is released , use the new XPath Plugin .
$ ( " p/../div " ) XPath Parent Selector
Please use the $ ( " p " ) . parent ( " div " ) selector instead .
Or , when jQuery 1.2 is released , use the new XPath Plugin .
$ ( " div[p ] " ) XPath Contains Predicate Selector
Please use the new $ ( " div:has ( p ) " ) selector instead .
Or , when jQuery 1.2 is released , use the new XPath Plugin .
$ ( " a[ @href ] " ) XPath Attribute Selector
Note :
While this selector is being deprecated in this release , it will not be removed in jQuery 1.2 .
Come jQuery 1.2 , it ’ll be recommended that you use the CSS selector $ ( " a[ href ] " ) instead .
Or , when jQuery 1.2 is released , use the new XPath Plugin .
DOM Manipulation
$ ( " div " ) .clone ( false )
Calling the clone method with an argument is being deprecated ( the clone method , as a whole , is being kept ) .
Instead of calling .clone ( false ) you should now do : .clone ( ) .empty ( ) instead .
DOM Traversal
$ ( " div " ) .eq ( 0 )
This method is being deprecated for the use of the new . slice ( ) method ( which works identically to an array ’s slice method .
You can duplicate .eq ( ) like so :
$ ( " div " ) .slice ( 0,1 ) ;
Additionally , .eq ( 0 ) can be duplicated in the following ways :
$ ( " div:eq ( 0 ) " ) $ ( " div:first " )
$ ( " div " ) .lt ( 2 )
This method is being deprecated for the use of the new . slice ( ) method ( which works identically to an array ’s slice method .
You can duplicate .lt ( ) like so :
$ ( " div " ) .slice ( 0,2 ) ;
Additionally , .lt ( 2 ) can be duplicated in the following way :
$ ( " div:lt ( 2 ) " )
$ ( " div " ) . gt ( 2 )
This method is being deprecated for the use of the new . slice ( ) method ( which works identically to an array ’s slice method .
You can duplicate .gt ( ) like so :
$ ( " div " ) .slice ( 3 ) ;
Additionally , .gt ( 2 ) can be duplicated in the following way :
$ ( " div:gt ( 2 ) " )
Ajax
$ ( " #elem " ) .loadIfModified ( " some.php " )
This convenience method is being removed in favor of the long form use of $.ajax ( ) :
$.ajax ( { url : " some.php " , ifModified : true , success : function ( html ) { $ ( " #elem " ) .html ( html ) ; } } ) ;
$.getIfModified ( " some.php " )
This convenience method is being removed in favor of the long form use of $.ajax ( ) :
$.ajax ( { url : " some.php " , ifModified : true } ) ;
$.ajaxTimeout ( 3000 )
This convenience method is being removed in favor of the long form use of the more - explicit $.ajaxSetup ( ) :
$.ajaxSetup ( {timeout : 3000} ) ;
$ (...).evalScripts ()
This method is no longer necessary in jQuery – all scripts included in HTML strings are automatically evaluated when injected into the document .
No substitute method is needed .
As always , please let us know if you encounter any bugs in between jQuery 1.1.3.1 and jQuery 1.1.4 .
Thanks !
CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa  Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said Thursday that the United States should do more to capture Osama bin Laden and dismantle al - Qaeda operations in Afghanistan and northern Pakistan — even at the expense of an ally , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf .
While he was n't explicitly critical of President Bush , the Republican presidential contender outlined in an interview with USA TODAY a more aggressive stance and a different emphasis than the administration has pursued in the region that spawned the terror network .
The United States has been distracted " for a while " by military setbacks and political heat surrounding the Iraq war , Giuliani said , not focusing enough on al - Qaeda 's resurgence in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
" This can not be like a horror movie , " he said .
" You know , in the horror movie you kill the monster , and the hand re-emerges .
And if you 're not looking , the hand grows back and then the monster 's there again .
That can not be allowed to happen . "
Giuliani , who has led the GOP presidential field in the USA TODAY / Gallup Poll through the year , was interviewed near the end of a two - day campaign trip to Iowa .
He visited an ethanol plant and promised as president to appoint " strict constructionist " judges who would not reinterpret the Constitution .
His presidential campaign has been tied largely to his leadership in New York after the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center .
Giuliani was most animated when he turned in the interview to the subject of battling Islamic extremists , with a copy of the National Intelligence Estimate that was released Tuesday at his side .
They were his first substantive comments on the formal assessment of the nation 's terrorist threat .
The report warned that al - Qaeda has significantly strengthened its operations over the past two years , creating a " heightened threat environment " for the United States .
Some of Giuliani's comments echoed critics of the war in Iraq who argue that the invasion drew attention and resources away from the battle against the home base of al - Qaeda , which carried out the 9/11 attacks .
Giuliani , however , called the Iraq war " enormously important , " but he said other challenges from Islamic terrorism also demanded attention .
" I said it a long time ago … America is too consumed with Iraq , " he said .
" We 've got to be patient and committed ( in Iraq ) , but we 've got to multitask .
We 've got to have conversations beyond Iraq .
We 've got to talk about Iran — Iran is more dangerous than Iraq — and we have to get the job done in Afghanistan and in Pakistan . "
He said that might involve reorganizing United Nations forces , committing more U.S. resources , considering U.S. - led airstrikes on al - Qaeda targets in northern Pakistan or taking a tougher line with Musharraf — or pursuing all those steps .
Giuliani expressed little patience with the Pakistani president , who last fall brokered a cease - fire with tribal leaders in northern Pakistan that let them police their own territories .
The White House said this week that the deal helped open the way for al - Qaeda to rebuild its infrastructure .
" Musharraf is important to us to the extent that he helps us remove this existential threat to him and to us , " Giuliani said .
" And to the extent that he recognizes that it 's an existential threat to us and to him , he 's valuable to us .
To the extent that he does n't , he is n't , " Giuliani said .

Welder is the Best Small TIG Welders in 2020
How to choose the best small TIG welder ?
Buying a new TIG welder does n’t take as much time or research as you might think .
With the help of our helpful TIG welder purchase guide , you will see the most important features before you start shopping .
Price
Setting a budget before shopping can help you decide how much you want to spend on TIG Welder .
Do n’t ignore products that are a bit more expensive .
You may find that you can get a better welder for just 20 or $ 50 .
Affordable TIG welders cost less than $ 200 and include Amico TIG 225 .
You can easily find solid TIG welders for a price of around 300 300 or less .
Pulse Rate
For vibration , you will want to see the pulse rate of the machine .
Older machines produce about 4,000 to 4,500 pulses per second , while new welders can produce 5,000 pulses per second .
Pulling is useful when working with thin metal parts that can be broken with standard welding .
This reduces the heat that the metal touches to prevent it from breaking .
The TIG welder with higher pulses gives you more control and produces a stronger weld .
Foot Pedal
With the help of a TIG welder , you often want to find one with an included pedal because you need both hands to control the weld .
You place one hand on the torch and the other on the filler rod .
With the foot pedal , you can control it when you ca n’t touch the welder .
The best paddles have natural angles to the ground that will not cause any pain or discomfort in the legs .
You should look for one that is responsive and will respond immediately when you adjust your legs .
Air -Cooled or Water - Cooled
TIG welders bring features called water or air cooling that explain how the welder cools when it reaches high temperatures .
Cooler cooling models can use and heat the ambient air temperature .
This will prevent you from working in hard places as heat enters your work equipment .
With the help of water - cooled TIG welder , you can easily handle extreme temperatures .
These TIG machines come with a small head that can penetrate small spaces .
Some people who buy air cooled welders want to invest in water - cooled models .
Amperage Range
Another feature to consider is the intensity range of the TIG welder .
You usually want a wide range that can help you in a variety of situations and applications .
It can limit a small range where you can use the TIG welder and make it impossible for some welding work .
A good range is usually between 5 amps and more than 200 amps , which allows you to weld aluminum parts up to 1/ 4 and handle stainless steel of 20 calibers or more .
You may not need another machine to work with the best TIG welder .
Frequently Asked Questions
What is TIG Welding ?
Since TIG welding is the most sophisticated manufacturing process , you want to have a good idea of ​​choosing the right machine for your project .
There are many machines to choose from online , and most will sell well .
But how do you know what they look like ?
TIG stands for Tungsten Inert Gas ( TIG ) .
TIG welding is a type of welding .
TIG welder can weld more types of metals than any other welding process .
This is a manual welding process .
When using a tig welder , you need to use both hands to weld the metals .
It is certainly a difficult process to learn , but welding two different metals is a more versatile method .
Although the welding process is somewhat slow , the final welding process is of high quality .
Tig welders use this method when welding critical joints or welding metals other than steel is required , and when a small and precise weld is required .
Materials present in tungsten tigs that allow welding .
Tungsten is a hard , radioactive metal that is converted into a non-corrosive electrode that is used to create pressure for welding .
What are you using your TIG Welder for ?
TIG welding is most useful when the presence of gems is important , such as in bicycle frames or truck bumpers , garden furniture , and the like .
This is the most suitable way of welding very thin sheets , as the bonding and MIG processes give the metal too much heat and burn .
Aluminum and stainless steel are other major places where using TIG welders is the best way to equip the work due to its penetration and lack of contaminants in the weld .
What TIG Welder functions do you need ?
Although it is possible to weld aluminum with direct current , you will often see the rule that you must use an AC outlet for welding aluminum .
One reason for this is that AC welding allows the use of high - frequency pulses that keep the weld poodle clean .
Another reason is that one of the main advantages of TIG welding is heat control , a very important component of aluminum alloys .
Search options for available functions are AC vs. DC power , plasma cutter , possibility to select AC waveform , for example , square wave or true sine wave and a pulse frequency .

Of far greater concern to him was the headlong rush to war in Iraq .
It was apparent early on — from two or three days after 9/11 , when , with the smoke from the smoldering Pentagon still in the air , Newbold told Douglas Feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy , of plans to go into Afghanistan .
" Why are you going into Afghanistan ? " he says Feith replied .
" We ought to be going after Iraq . "
( Feith has previously denied saying this ; Newbold says he'd take a polygraph on the point .
Feith declined to talk to Vanity Fair . )
It simply is n't possible now , says Newbold , to fathom how " extraordinarily inappropriate " Feith 's comments sounded at the time .
Then , at a meeting a few months later , as the Americans chased the leadership of al - Qaeda , he says , he heard Wolfowitz say essentially the same thing .
In each instance , Newbold 's reaction was the same : " Who cares about Iraq ?
We have this three - penny dictator , this bantam rooster of no consequence .
Besides , they 're quiet now anyway — who cares ? "
( Wolfowitz says he never disputed the need to go after al - Qaeda ; the issue for him was whether a war against Saddam Hussein could proceed simultaneously . )
Then came what was , to Newbold , that fateful meeting in late 2001 when Rumsfeld requested the war plan for Iraq .
Newbold had just begun his slide show , describing the size of the force and means of deployment , when the belittlement began .
" As was his style , " Newbold says , " he had already declared the answer , and had already categorized anyone who might think differently as — these are my words — antediluvian , Cro-Magnon , backward - thinking , hopeless .
It was so pointed , so derogatory , so negative about the number [ of troops required under the existing plan ] that General Myers then said , ' If not this number , then what number do you think [ the plan ] ought to have ? ' "
It was , Newbold says , a " horrible question . "
I ask why .
" Because that question ought to be answered by those who know most about how to put together a plan that can accomplish the mission , " he tells me .
" It was no more appropriate than for me to suggest play - calling to [ Coach ] Joe Gibbs of the Washington Redskins . "
Rumsfeld 's alternative estimate of troops needed was " imbecilic , preposterous , " but Newbold failed to object .
According to Newbold , so did Myers , and so did Pace , who , when Myers retired as chairman , would be elevated to his spot .
" Funny how that works , " Newbold observes .
Afghanistan fell in late 2001 , and as it became increasingly apparent that a war with Iraq , based on what he considered to be manipulated and cherry - picked evidence , was in the offing , Newbold took the step General Harold Johnson never had : he offered his resignation , to General Jones , the commandant .
And it came with a message : Jones should feel free to tell everyone he was resigning in protest .
Jones was noncommittal , and Newbold stayed : the president , at least , was still saying war was not inevitable .
But by June 2002 , Newbold had given up .
He again offered his resignation , even though , by leaving ahead of schedule , he could have lost two stars .
This time , Jones accepted .
Before departing , Newbold says , he reiterated his objections to the impending war to the chairman , vice - chairman , and key generals and admirals in the Pentagon hierarchy .
Such a war was justified , he argued , only if Iraq threatened its neighbors , harbored terrorists , or had weapons of mass destruction .
None of those , he believed , was true .
In late September , Rumsfeld and Pace said good - bye to him before the Pentagon press corps .
Rumsfeld 's press office had put together a joke video for the occasion , built around the " evisceration " clip .
Some of Newbold 's friends were indignant anew to see a 30 - year military career boiled down to a barbed joke .
But Newbold , who 'd accepted a job at a Washington think tank , took it all good - naturedly .
He rejected the usual lavish retirement ceremony at the Marine Barracks —
" As I told the commandant , ' I do n't want my last act as a Marine to be to make Marines work for me ' " — and opted instead for a small gathering at the Army Navy Country Club , in Alexandria .
Just about the only man in uniform to come was his old friend John Abizaid .
It was poignant , says someone who was there ; everyone knew that Newbold was retiring prematurely , and that it was the country 's loss .
But Newbold himself kept it from becoming too funereal .
A property is wrong
A property is missing
Write out the properties Write out code to implement them If the tests fail , you have a counter example - go back to 2 Done
Today I experienced the perfection of coding , and I never want to go back to the old hacking method !
My FilePath library is nearly ready for release , but just before it went out I got a bug report The FilePath library is based on the idea that all functions must satisfy a list of properties , which are documented in the interface .
I use QuickCheck to automatically test that these properties hold .
This leads to the great situation where there are only two classes of bug :
The bug report I received was of the second kind - a property was missing .
The next step is to decide if this property should hold or not , and in this case the reporter was perfectly right , this property should hold .
Next step is to decide if a more general version of this property should hold - and in discussion with the reporter a more generalised version was formulated .
By working at the level of properties the code is no longer the hard part , and while collaborative coding on a single function is n't that useful , collaborative property discussion works really well .
Once the properties have been decided upon , and having left a night to see if anyone had any other thoughts on the properties , the coding can begin .
This then makes the process of coding much less hacky , and much more precise :
By the time you get to 4 , the code meets the properties .
You have already done 1000's of tests ( more than 10,000 in FilePath ) and can have a fairly strong degree of confidence in the work you have produced .
The bug reporter has already agreed with the changes you 've made , even before you 've made them .
I have never done a library before so focused on properties , but it has had amazing advantages .
The advantage of having correct and reliable code may be obvious - but in practice the amount of confidence in the code surprised me .
By far the bigger benefit has been collaboration - the very high declarative nature of properties makes them something well suited to " group thought " .
In an absurd 5 - 4 ruling the US Supreme Court reversed a 96 year old ban on price fixing .
The lawsuit arose when Leegin Creative Leather stopped shipping its Brighton tooled - leather accessories to Dallas - area shop Kay 's Kloset because the store was selling the goods more cheaply than Leegin wanted .
After Leegin cut the store off , PSKS , parent of Kay 's Kloset , filed an antitrust lawsuit .
Burlington Coat Factory , which filed a brief supporting PSKS , worries about the impact on the off - price chain .
Burlington attorney Stacy John Haigney called the decision " an open invitation to manufacturers and full - price retailers to fix retail prices at a higher level .
It will be detrimental to our business , but I really can't tell how much . "
The Consumer Electronics Association says it supports the court decision because , it says , " sales training , industry marketing and after - sales service " are what many TV and audio gear buyers look for in electronics stores .
Bill Gates , of golf equipment maker Ping , says , " Not every consumer is a bargain shopper .
Some consumers are looking for quality , innovation , personalization and customer service when they shop . "
Richard Doherty of technology market researcher The Envisioneering Group agrees , saying the price ruling could lead retailers to use more free products and better service as sales incentives .
" It 's sure to be to consumers ' benefit this summer and through Christmas . "
Manufacturers will have greater leeway to set minimum prices at the retail level without violating antitrust laws under a Thursday Supreme Court ruling that could hurt consumers and small merchants .
By allowing minimum price agreements , the court 's 5 - 4 decision could lead to higher prices , dissenting justices said , as it becomes more difficult for smaller stores and Internet retailers to offer lower - priced goods .
The court said agreements on minimum prices are legal if they promote competition , meaning accusations of antitrust violations will be evaluated case by case .
[ Mish comment :
This is the crux of the stupidity .
The court has now decided that it can decide if price fixing promotes competition or not , on a case by case basis .
I hope they get flooded with cases .
Let me state that price fixing never promotes competition by definition . ]
In a 1991 decision , the Supreme Court had declared that minimum pricing agreements always violate federal antitrust law .
But Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that the principle that past decisions should be left alone " does not compel our continued adherence " in this instance .
Minimum price agreements can benefit consumers , Kennedy wrote , by enabling retailers to invest in greater customer service without fear of being undercut by discount rivals .
The agreements also could make it easier for new products to compete , he added , because a retailer could recoup the costs of marketing a new good by charging a higher price .
[ Mish comment : What absurd logic by Kennedy .
For starters it is highly doubtful that price fixing can ever benefit consumers .
Furthermore , even if by some miracle price fixing did benefit some consumers in some cases , what gives a panel of judges the wisdom to decide in what cases consumers really benefited or not ?
Only consumers acting in conjunction with free market forces can decide that .
Price fixing is the antithesis of free market forces .
Finally , what possible interpretation gives a strict constitutionalist the authority to make such decisions in the first place ? ]
Dissenting from that view , Justice Stephen Breyer wrote : " The only safe predictions to make about today 's decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail . "
[ Mish comment : Actually the only safe prediction is that this decision will backfire in undetermined ways , perhaps a multitude of them .
We could see a flood of litigation , we could see fewer consumer goods on the shelves , we could see lower profits because of lower sales , etc .
We could see reduced innovation .
Other than that , the initial impact is likely to be higher prices and reduced competition . ]
The Consumer Federation of America said in court filings that the ban on minimum price agreements allowed " innovative retailers to continually enter the market , offering new and lower priced alternatives to consumers . "
[ Mish comment : What nonsense .
We do not need innovative price fixing rules to allow what the free market does already . ]
But Roy Englert , an antitrust attorney at Robbins Russell , said the court 's decision does have boundaries that will protect entrepreneurs .
The ruling only allows minimum price agreements between manufacturers of a single brand of a product and retailers , Englert said , while other brands of the same product can still compete on price .
Moreover , if only one brand is available , retailers and consumers can still sue manufacturers for anticompetitive conduct , Englert said .
The courts will now evaluate such suits on the merits , rather than automatically finding them illegal .
[ Mish comment : Lovely .
Consumers will have to sue to get a free market , and when they do sue they will be at the mercy of the court , a court that is likely to make as inane rulings as this one . ]
It 's sure to be to consumers ' benefit this summer and through Christmas .
Findlaw discusses the case in High Court Eases Ban on Minimum Prices I scoff at what Richard Doherty of technology market researcher The Envisioneering Group says : " " Instead I ponder how anyone can seriously propose that the short term effect of this would be to lower prices .
With every passing day , government strips away rights of citizens .
We have now gone down the path that says wiretaps , spying , and torture are condoned , as are holding people without charging them with crimes .
Even kidnapping is condoned , so is search and seizure .
Preemptive warfare is OK ( but only for the US of course ) .
The latest absurdity is government sponsored price fixing .
What right does the government have to tell anyone what they can or can not charge for goods and services ?
That is the heart of the issue but you might not know it from reading the ruling or even the dissenting opinions .
Want to stop this nonsense ?

For Floridians , the remainder of the year presents two dangers : an over - active hurricane season and the risk of contracting the coronavirus .
As crossing into the U.S. from Canada via car remains banned except for essential purposes , Canadian snowbirds are deciding how to handle their yearly seasonal trips down to Florida .
When state economists lowered fiscal year 2021 revenue estimates in August to reflect COVID - 19 ’s effect , it essentially was an acknowledgement that pre-pandemic economic metrics no longer applied , at least not temporarily .
The peculiar dynamics of reinsurance and climate have inched the state of Florida toward the precipice of an insurance disaster .
Simply put , homeowners ’ premiums are set to become very , very expensive .
Florida ’s gas prices continue to drop , with the average price across the state for a gallon of regular unleaded sliding three cents over the past week to $ 2.10 per gallon , according to the American Automobile Association .

Before I begin , I should clarify what I mean by using a database as an API integration point .
In another life in a distant galaxy far far away , I worked on a project in which we needed to integrate a partner ’s system with our system .
The method of integration required that when a particular event occurred , they would write some data to a particular table in our database , which would then fire a trigger to perform whatever actions were necessary on our side ( vague enough for ya ? ) .
In this case , the data model and the related stored procedures made up the API used by the partner to integrate into our system .
So what ’s the problem ?
I always felt this was ugly in a few ways , I ’m sure you ’ll think of more .
First , we have to make our database directly accessible to a third party , exposing ourselves to all the security risk that entails .
We ’re not really free to make schema changes as we have no abstraction layer between the database and any clients to the system .
How exactly do you define a contract in SQL ?
With Web Services , you have XSD .
With code , you have interfaces .
Personally , I ’d like to have some sort of abstraction layer for my integration points so that I am free to change the underlying implementation .
Why am I bringing this up ?
A little while ago , I was having a chat with a member of the Subtext team , telling him about the custom MembershipProvider we ’re implementing for Subtext 2.0 to fit in with our data model .
His initial reaction was that developer - users are going to grumble that we ’re not using the “ Standard ” Membership Provider .
The “ Standard ” ?
I question this notion of “ The Standard Membership Provider ” ?
Which provider is the standard ?
Is it the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider ?
It is in anticipation of developer grumblings that I write this post to plead my case and perhaps rail against the wind .
The point of the Provider Model
You see , it seems that the whole point of the Provider Model is lost if you require a specific data model .
The whole point of the provider model is to provide an abstraction to the underlying physical data store .
For example , Rob Howard , one of the authors of the Provider Pattern wrote this in the second part of his introduction to the Provider Pattern ( emphasis mine ) .
A point brought up in the previous article discussed the conundrum the ASP.
NET team faced while building the Personalization system used for ASP .
NET 2.0 .
The problem was choosing the right data model : standard SQL tables versus a schema approach .
Someone pointed out that the provider pattern does n’t solve this , which is 100 % correct .
What it does allow is the flexibility to choose which data model makes the most sense for your organization .
An important note about the pattern : it does n’t solve how you store your data , but it does abstract that decision out of your programming interface .
What Rob and Microsoft realized is that no one data model fits all .
Many applications will already have a data model for storing users and roles .
The idea is that if you write code and controls against the provider API , the underlying data model does n’t matter .
This is emphasized by the goals of the provider model according to the MSDN introduction …
The ASP .
NET 2.0 provider model was designed with the following goals in mind :
To make ASP.
NET state storage both flexible and extensible \
To insulate application - level code and code in the ASP.
NET run-time from the physical storage media where state is stored , and to isolate the changes required to use alternative media types to a single well - defined layer with minimal surface area
To make writing custom providers as simple as possible by providing a robust and well - documented set of base classes from which developers can derive provider classes of their own
It is expected that developers who wish to pair ASP .
NET 2.0 with data sources for which off - the - shelf providers are not available can , with a reasonable amount of effort , write custom providers to do the job .
Of course , Microsoft made it easy for all of us developers by shipping a full featured SqlMembershipProvider complete with database schema and stored procedures .
When building a new implementation from scratch , it makes a lot of sense to use this implementation .
If your needs fit within the implementation , then that is a lot of work that you do n’t have to do .
Unfortunately , many developers took it to be the gospel truth and standard in how the the data model should be implemented .
This is really only one possible database implementation of a Membership Provider .
An Example Gone Wrong
There is one particular open source application that I recall that already had a fantastic user and roles implementation at the time that the Membership Provder Model was released .
Their existing implementation was in all respects , a superset of the features of the Membership Provider .
Naturally there was a lot of pressure to implement the Membership Provider API , so they chose to simply implement the SqlMembershipProvider ’s tables side by side with their own user tables .
Stepping through the code in a debugger one day , I watched in disbelief when upon logging in as a user , the code started copying all users from the SqlMembershipProvider ’s stock aspnet_ * tables to the application ’s internal user tables and vice versa .
They were essentially keeping two separate user databases in synch on every login .
In my view , this was the wrong approach to take .
It would ’ve been much better to simply implement a custom Membership Provider class that read from and wrote to their existing user database tables .
For the features of their existing users and roles implementation that the Membership Provider did not support , they could have been exposed via their existing API .
Yes , I ’m armchair quarterbacking at this point as there may have been some extenuating circumstances I am not aware of .
But I ca n’t imagine doing a full multi-table synch on every login being a good choice , especially for a large database of users .
I ’m not aware of the status of this implementation detail at this point in time .
The Big But
Someone somewhere is reading this thinking I ’m being a bit overly dogmatic .
They might be thinking
But , but I have three apps in my organization which communicate with each other via the database just fine .
This is a workable solution for our scenario , thank you very much .
You ’re full of it .
I totally agree on all three counts .
For a set of internal applications within an organization , it may well make sense to integrate at the database layer , since all communications between apps occurs within the security boundary of your internal network and you have full control over the implementation details for all of the applications .
So while I still think even these apps could benefit from a well defined API or Web Service layer as the point of integration , I do n’t think you should never consider the database as a potential integration point .
But when you ’re considering integration for external applications outside of your control , especially applications that have n’t even been written yet , I think the database is a really poor choice and should be avoided .
Microsoft recognized this with the Provider Model , which is why controls written for the MembershipProvider are not supposed to assume anything about the underlying data store .
For example , they do n’t make direct queries against the “ standard ” Membership tables .
Instead , when you need to integrate with a membership database , use the API .
Hopefully future users and developers of Subtext will also recognize this when we unveil the Membership features in Subtext 2.0 and keep the grumbling to a minimum .
Either that or point out how full of it I am and convince me to change my mind .

Responding to Responses to : " Viewing American class divisions through Facebook and MySpace "
danah boyd

http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ResponseToClassDivisions.html
( This is a response to the various critiques of my June 24 essay " Viewing American class divisions through Facebook and MySpace . "
Please read the original before reading this response . )
( If you have comments , please add them to the related entry on my blog .
Thank you . )
( Leveraging ethnographic data , I have documented these dynamics in more detail in my dissertation : " Taken Out of Context : American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics . "
See Chapter Five . )
( I take up the racist language that teens use to discuss MySpace and Facebook in " White Flight in Networked Publics ?
How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook . "
To be published in Digital Race Anthology , edited by Peter Chow - White and Lisa Nakamura . )
One month ago , I put out a blog essay that took on a life of its own .
This essay addressed one of America 's most taboo topics : class .
Due to personal circumstances , I was n't online as things spun further and further out of control and I had neither the time nor the emotional energy to address all of the astounding misinterpretations that I saw as a digital game of telephone took hold .
I 've browsed the hundreds of emails , thousands of blog posts , and thousands of comments across the web .
I 'm in awe of the amount of time and energy people put into thinking through and critiquing my essay .
In the process , I 've also realized that I was not always so effective at communicating what I wanted to communicate .
To clarify some issues , I decided to put together a long response that addresses a variety of different issues .
When studying post - structuralism , I was utterly fascinated by the idea of the death of the author .
The idea is that once a text is put out there , the author matters not because the author has no control over how that text is interpreted .
The weird thing about blogging is that the author is pretty darn present .
I 'm here .
No one seems to realize that but I am .
In the last week , I read the thousands of Slashdot comments and blog entries addressing my essay .
In most cases , I refrained from commenting though .
Instead , I decided to take all of the issues and put them together in a response .
This is that response .
Of course , that does n't mean that people will listen .. the author might not be dead but she might be powerless against people 's preferred interpretations .
And in the world of blogs , verbosity is akin to author suicide .
Still , I have n't learned to be succinct .
This response is long because the issues are vast .
In some sense , that 's my fault .
I 've clearly been taken out of context in so many different ways and I did n't write my piece for the audience who ended up consuming it .
My writing clearly did not leave the impression that I meant to leave .
I can't promise that this response clears up everything .
It might not .
But I feel the need to respond .
Even if no one reads it .
Form and Format
I 'm an academic but I 'm also a blogger .
For me , these are separate identities .
I write formal papers that I spend months trying to find the language to properly express what 's going on .
In those papers , I try to balance precision and readability .
My blog is a different story .
I write in an off - the - cuff manner , trying to paint impressions rather than nuance .
In academic writing , I have to outline methodology and background , assuming that no one has heard of me or the topic before .
In my blog , I write with the assumption that people are familiar with my work and with the topic .
In academic writing , I write for posterity .
In my blog , I write to get an issue off my chest and to work things out while they are still raw .
The informal language in my blog is intentional .
The lack of citations is intentional .
They are meant to signal that this is a work - in - progress .
I want to signal that I 'm thinking out loud .
Unfortunately , many feel as though a blog must be formal and then they project this view onto my writing and then complain about the language and the lack of cites .
I am capable of situating arguments in broader theoretical arguments , but I do n't attempt to do that here while I 'm working through things .
I guess my signals are broken .
The blog structure is not built for long essays .
My blog itself is not formatted to take on a 3000 word essay ( it breaks ) .
When I started publishing conference cribs , I started making them separate webpages that I would link to from Apophenia and M2M .
Following that , whenever I 'd write a blog entry that was longer than 2000 words , I 'd shove it off to the same messy directory with my papers and my cribs and link to it from my blog .
They 're all under the / papers directory simply because I started keeping track of things at the papers URL .
You can see more than papers there .
I started sub - directorying it a few months ago because it was getting messy .
Essays are exactly that and the class piece was an essay .
I added citations to everything under that directory because I was finding that people were taking that material out of context .
They were copying / pasting the whole article without reference to where it came from because it looked like it stood on its own ( folks did n't do that with my blog entries ) .
I wanted people to know the context so all essays , cribs , op - eds , and papers got tagged with a citation .
Unfortunately , this meant that people thought that it was a proper paper .
Data
For those who are not qualitative researchers , we need to talk briefly about what qualitative and quantitative research are and what they offer ...
( There are year - long classes on this so I 'm only brushing the surface . )
Qualitative research has data .
Typically , written ethnographies and other qualitative - driven findings show that data through individual accounts , quotes by people that are contextualized , and detailed descriptions of people or situations .
I have that data but I did not include it in my blog essay .
I intentionally save data for my academic works so that I can flesh it out and situate it in the depth that needs to happen .
The decision to not reveal data has to do with separating the academic writing from the blog writing , but it also has to do with what I 'm trying to accomplish with each .
Writing a case study of someone or using data requires a lot more fleshing out than I typically do in my blog .
Thus , I did n't show data in that essay but that is not because I do n't have it .
This is another way in which this is not a formal article - leaps of faith are fine when you 're having a conversation , but not when you are trying to document something for posterity .
Qualitative and quantitative data show different things .
The greatest mistake that I made in this essay was not clarifying why this piece needed a qualitative lens .
This had to do with my failure to prepare for how far this piece would spread .
In my local world , everyone understands why qualitative has value .
I 'm realizing the hard way that this is not generally understood .
At the top of the essay , I snarkily wrote " I wish I could just put numbers in front of it all and be done with it , but instead , I 'm going to face the stickiness ... "
The issue is not just that I do n't have quantitative data ; it 's that quantitative data does not have the nuance to show what 's going on .
It gets us part way there , but there are problems with it .
Class is not simply a matter of what income bracket you 're at .
When we use income level as a marker , we get the Marxist cafe worker and the immigrant janitor in the same bucket , but they are not living the same lifestyle at all .
Another approximation that is often used for class is parental education .
Post - graduate degrees are often helpful at pointing to upper class activity , but there 's still a huge difference between a Stanford Law degree and a master 's in special ed from the local night college .
There 's also a big difference between dropping out of Harvard after 2 years and getting a 2 - year community college degree .
Surveys usually ask what the last degree one got was .
Do we really put Bill Gates in the same bucket with other just - finished - HS individuals ?
( Gates was not just an average dropout ...
His parents were powerful and he dropped out of Harvard . )
Marking teens ' class is even more sticky because we use their parents as proxies .
Many children replicate their parents class norms , but not all .
This is why parents complain that one kid is doing " OK " and the other is not ; this means that one kid is living up to parental class expectations and the other is not .
So how do we measure class ?
We need to be able to measure it before we can quantify divisions .
There are ways to measure lifestyle markers and taste divisions through different approximations .
And maybe if we collected enough data about a bunch of different things , we could bucket people into meaningful class divisions .
But we 're a long way from there and this is not what folks who are measuring users are doing .
So we make these approximations and they do n't tell the whole story .
I 'm sure that quantitative data will appear that will capture some of what I 'm talking about .
I 've already received notices from academics who have measured it in college and seen this same phenomenon .
comScore data sorta gets at it .
And more will emerge .
But my essay was meant to get beyond just the numbers and look at the lifestyle differences involved .
This has to be done qualitatively because of measurement issues .
Qualitative data lets you see the stickiness ... and then you have to find a way to describe it .
The problem is that it 's hard to show trends qualitatively .
To be frank , I 'm not sure how to do it .
I can report on what I 'm seeing and describe in detail what 's happening .
And maybe I should 've brought out some of the fantastic quotes that I have about how this plays out , but I 'm not sure that this would 've convinced those who are obsessed with quantitative data .
For whatever reason , many in this society think that things can only be proved through numbers .
Of course , what 's fascinating is that most researchers ( and the USAToday ) know that you can twist numbers to prove just about anything .
Even numbers have to be interpreted and people are terrible at interpreting them .
I think that our obsession with numbers is dangerous - I think that we give them too much credence and think that they say more than they do .
Folks also seem to believe that counterexamples destroy the value of patterns .
What I 'm trying to document is not an all - or - nothing situation .
It 's about patterns , it 's about trends , it 's about divisions that are subtle .
There are going to be tons of counter examples , but that does n't mean that patterns are n't emerging .
When I talk about data , I 'm not talking about my friends or what I hear from teenagers in Los Angeles ( or San Francisco ) .
I drive to disconnected communities and talk to teenagers from different schools about their lives .
I hang out in public places where I watch teens .
I hang out on MySpace and scan the micro-profiles that one can see on Facebook .
I talk to parents , teachers , pastors , and community leaders from all over the nation .
I talk to people from varied backgrounds , all to get at what 's going on .
The trick to ethnographic work like this is to understand the biases that are operating in the spheres you study .
This is not survey work .
This is about contextualizing what you learn , making sense of how an individual is or is not like her / his peers .
This is not about random sampling , but sampling until you start to see patterns that are predictable , until you flesh out the domain .
While individual experiences are important , when I 'm drawing patterns , I 'm talking beyond the individual - I 'm trying to paint a meta portrait .
Using extremes
In her book titled " Jocks and Burnouts , " Penny Eckert talks about the value in marking extremes that narrate discourse even though most people fall somewhere in - between .
Most teens are not jocks OR burnouts , but those terms evoke images of extreme camps that work as signposts in 1980s high schools .
Those extremes signal opposing values and activities , ideas and ideologies .
Most teens draw from both in framing their own world .
There are caricatured jocks and caricatured burnouts but the reality is somewhere in - between .
I did not do a good job of fleshing this out in my article .
You will find an astonishing number of teens who have both MySpace and Facebook these days .
At the same time , they are more drawn to one or the other ( another way in which quantitative data that asks about which they use will not get at this ) .
They have a sense that their friends in each are different or that each site represents a different side of friends who are on both .
Few teens have identical profiles on each and often even the baseline photo is different .
( Adults tend to copy / paste from one SNS to another . )
The extremes are there and they 're marked through all sorts of sticky differences but most individuals are fluidly somewhere in - between .
They know which tool to use to contact which friends .
There 's no incentive to choose one camp exclusively so they do n't .
Evocative terms
When I chose " hegemonic " and " subaltern , " I wanted to evoke an image .
I almost made silly references to the " Hegemon " in the " Ender 's Game " series but I decided that would be a bit too tangential for the non-geeks .
No words really depict the camps so well and I wanted to avoid framing it all under " good " and " bad " even though so many teens talk about those two narratives in the way that 1980s kids talked about jocks and burnouts .
In evoking hegemonic , I 'm referring to work done based on Gramsci 's ideas of hegemony .
He argued that power in society is not just maintained by force , but through indoctrination into values that will help perpetuate the status quo .
Institutes like schools and mass media help perpetuate views .
The maintenance of hegemony is always subtle and nuanced , variable and fragmented .
People play different roles in upholding hegemony , often without realizing their position in the process .
By talking about hegemonic teens , I 'm not talking about teens who necessarily have power , but those who publicly uphold the values of adult society ( even when they themselves quietly rebel through action that they try to hide ) .
In some sense , this is Eckert 's " jocks " but I felt that jocks is too confused now .
The term subaltern comes from the military ; it refers to a subordinate who has little power or authority .
Through Gramsci , postcolonial studies picked up this term to refer to people who appear to be voiceless but whose voice can be understood through the lens of those in power .
For example , the documents of British colonialists convey a lot about Indian culture because they documented the British failure to understand or suppress and in this condescension , you can see what the Indians were doing .
( Of course , as Spivak points out , efforts to give voice to subalterns reinscribe their voice inside hegemonic discourse , arguably further disempowering them . )
I chose the term subaltern to refer to subculturally - identified and non-hegemonic teens because their expressions are often interpreted by hegemonic mass media in a way that they are always seen as failure .
I wanted to choose a term that did not simply place them as second - tier citizens , but as powerful voices in discourse .
Too many people who read my article assumed that the group that I talked about as subalterns are somehow inferior or less valuable than hegemonic teens .
Perhaps that 's hegemony speaking , but I find it frustrating .
I think that they are equally powerful forces in society ( and they are certainly equally powerful in the market ) but I think that they have different views on the construction and maintenance of society as we know it .
The terms are extremely problematic but I used them with a smile on my face because I thought that they would evoke an image and make people think .
Many have been outraged that I appear biased towards one or the other ( although no one seems to know which - I 've been accused of being condescending towards subaltern teens and I 've also been accused of fetishizing them ) .
Perhaps I should 've located myself .
As a teen , I would 've been caught in between - a smart kid whose friends and world were very much in the subaltern camps ( geeks and burnouts primarily ) .
As an adult , I have more privilege than I ever thought possible and my world is extremely hegemonic and I 'm always trying to fight against that .
Thus , I probably have more sympathy with subaltern teens but my friends are all raising hegemonic ones who I adore .
Thus , I 'm definitely caught in the middle .
Misreadings ( or lack of reading )
A huge misreading of my piece concerns what age group I 'm talking about .
I study teens , American high school teens to be exact .
I am not talking about college students or the 35 + crowd .
Much of what I 'm saying might apply to them but it 's astonishing to me that so many folks have decided to " prove me wrong " by talking about themselves and their friends ( all over whom are outside of HS ) .
I should 've put teenagers in the title ; the only reason that I did n't was that I was sick of seeing the word teenager in the title of everything I write .
My guess is that most people did n't read the article or they wanted to make it personal even though they are n't teens .
Thus , when I 'm talking about geeks and queer folks , I 'm talking about teen geeks and queer teens .
Their experience is quite different in HS than it is when they have more agency .
Another misreading of my piece concerns the history of Facebook .
I 've had literally hundreds of messages from people who want to tell me that Facebook started out as a college site .
Duh .
I explicitly note that it started out as a Harvard site .
A huge part of my point is that the history of it was critical to the sense that it's for the college - bound .
It was first seen as a rite of passage and then it was seen as what you did to grow up .
The history is a large part of why this division has played out the way it has .
The same can be said for MySpace which reached the teen population through music .
Murdoch 's acquisition also played a role .
The history is crucial here and it explains a lot of why things emerged the way that they did .
I 'm not trying to negate that , but point out what else has falled out as a result .
Unfortunately , misinterpretations were made worse by the mainstream media , and namely the initial BBC article that talked about this essay as a formal report of a six month study .
( The article was corrected a few days later . )
I realized very quickly that people read the BBC article or the Slashdot coverage or their friends ' blog posts and decided to critique from there .
I have been astonished at how lazy people have been .
My article is not that inaccessible and it's not even that long .
What was even funnier was that when I wrote a response to the BBC article on my blog , people then took that to say that I saw the essay as based on no data and otherwise meaningless .
The essay is based on data ; it is rooted in a very long ethnographic study ; but it is just not a formal report of my findings .
Not only did folks misread all over the place , they perpetuated their misreadings and others ' interpretations .
The most insidious of this was the MSNBC coverage .
Not only did MSNBC not contact me directly , the author took my quotes out o context all over the place .
She set me up to be mocked through their framing of my name and scary quoting the blog essay term and implicitly supporting the ways in which people attacked me for racism .
She then went on to mock me for failing to realize the way the Internet works .
Of course , she did conclude by pointing out that journalists are lazy ( herself too ? ) , but still , it sickens me that this kind of coverage is considered appropriate .
Needless to say , the MSNBC article has prompted all sorts of mean - spirited emails and blog posts against me and it did not clarify any of what I was attempting to say .
( Instead , she shows her own class biases by talking about MySpace as ugly . )
On being a racist , homophobic whore
My article is descriptive , not prescriptive .
In other words , just because I see activities amongst gothic kids does not mean that all gothic - identified kids will do something .
I 'm marking what 's going on , not what should be or could be .
In my list of who was in what camp , I used " Latino / Hispanic teens . "
When I was in the field , I found it fascinating that Latino and Hispanic teens used MySpace even when they were college bound .
Those who were going to go college often had a Facebook , but their identity was connected to MySpace .
Part of it had to do with family - their extended families were on MySpace so that 's where they were .
Unlike other racial / ethnic groups , Latino / Hispanic teens were really visibly in the MySpace camp .
One of the reasons that I did n't bring up black teens was that they were very much split by socio-economic status instead of race .
I 've been accused by many for being racist by marking Latino / Hispanic teens as drawn to MySpace and I 'm a bit confused by this .
As a white woman , I probably perpetuate all sorts of racists views without even realizing it , but I do n't see how noting what is happening makes me a racist .
I 'm still hoping someone could clarify this for me .
The attack that really got me confused concerned my purported homophobia .
I chose the term " queer " instead of any of the LGBT markers because I wanted to mark a broader sexuality stream .
I also chose this because of its connection to politicized identity rather than just sexuality .
This term has a 20 + year history of being reappropriated ; I do not see it as a homophobic term at all .
Then again , I identify as being queer while I 've never fit nicely into an LGBT paradigm .
( How can I be " bi " when gender is amorphous and many of the people I 've dated do n't identify cleanly as male or female or have identified as both at different times ? )
Lots of folks have also called me up to say that they are on Facebook and they are queer .
Even LGBT press have attacked me for calling lumping queers in with outcasts .
I think most of them failed to realize that I 'm talking about high school teens , not all queer individuals .
While LGBT organizations are popping up on campuses , being a queer teen still sucks .
It sucked when I was growing up , it sucked when most queer folks I know were growing up , and it still sucks today .
Except at that LGBT - only school in NY , most queer teens grow up not knowing many other queer folks .
They do n't fit in , even if others accept them .
The choice for dates is much more limited , resulting in many queer teens dating all other queer folks they know even when they share nothing in common .
More than for any other group , college is freedom for queer teens .
But in HS , being queer is rarely hegemonic .
Like duh
The reaction to my article has been extremely variable .
One reaction often makes me giggle : " duh . "
To me , that is the reaction that it should 've evoked .
Duh .
It makes sense .
Of course .
What I 'm marking in this essay should 've been obvious to everyone .
What amazes me is that so many folks are shocked by it and so many others refuse to acknowledge it .
It plays out online just like it plays out offline .
Physical hangout spaces like bars are split by class , even though they theoretically welcome anyone .
Public spaces get split by class .
The " conclusion " of my article should not have been a big deal , but I had to put it out there because so many folks were n't acknowledging it and the press kept perpetuating the view that MySpace was dead because Facebook was taking over .
We used to have this utopian view that the Internet would solve all of our societal divisions .
On the Internet , no one would know you 're a dog , right ?
The reality is that all of society 's issues are simply perpetuated online .
And that 's frustrating .
I liked the utopian dream better , even if it 's not real .
But if we accept the reality - that the Internet mirrors and magnifies offline values and views - we must start to think of what the implications of this are .
Society is in a dangerous position when people who are different do not interact .
This is how intolerance breeds and we definitely have enough of that in this country .
On marketing and consumption
I find it really weird when people have said that I just devalued MySpace by saying that hegemonic kids are on Facebook .
Some marketers are even using my essay to say that all advertising should be funneled to Facebook .
Are marketers that stupid ?
There seems to be a myth that only rich kids consume .
That 's so not true , it 's painful .
For better or worse , subaltern teens consume a lot more than hegemonic teens .
Part of this has to do with spare time , part with mobility , part with who has after school jobs , part with what is valued as markers of worth .
( Rich kids tend to buy higher end goods , but they are only a small fraction of hegemonic teens . )
What people do consume is really influenced by class ( far more so than SES ) .
Offline , marketers seem to get this .
Why do n't they get this online ?
Gap , Inc. knows this .
Is there really that much of a difference between clothes from Old Navy and Gap ( and Banana Republic ) ?
The difference really is who shops there .
Some people go into all three but the audiences are still quite different .
While class and lifestyle do affect consumption choices , socio- economic status does not necessarily do so .
Consider a brand like Coach .
You 'll find that this is consumed heavily by both rich and poor , but not by middle class .
Why is this ?
Why is having " elite " brands a marker of success in poorer communities ?
I 'm always astounded by the teens who can tell that my knock - off accessories are precisely that .
And those are never the middle class teens .
There are few brands that link cleanly to the divisions that I 'm talking about .
The best example would be Hot Topic .
If I were Hot Topic , I 'd devote most of my teen advertising efforts to MySpace instead of Facebook .
But the majority of major brands hit both groups in different ways so I 'm surprised that this is that revelatory to marketers .
What I 'm saying does affect marketing and marketers should think through what communities they are targeting as they approach both .
My article also should help them think about the norms of those spaces and thus what will have greater resonance .
There are damn good reasons to market on both sites but they require different marketing strategies .
Peer review spun out of control
Finally , I need to comment on peer review .
One of the fascinating tangential conversations that has emerged because of this essay is whether or not this is what modern peer review looks like .
I find this a little funny because it makes the assumption that I put out a nearly - finished article for review .
Still , there 's no doubt that I got some form of " peer " " review . "
Of course , the most interesting reviews came in personal emails and private conversations .
Because I did n't cite anyone , most people suggested publicly that I cite the obvious .
My closer friends knew that I was quite familiar with Gramsci and Bourdieu and Eckert and Hall and Butler and Foucault and subcultural theory and all of the things that I alluded to without citing .
Instead , they focused on little - known references from visual studies and discussions of makeup and class and other such things that I have not yet tracked down .
This is not to say that the publicness was not valuable .
Because of the publicness of this article , I 've had unbelievable conversations with academics and practitioners and parents and ministers and others about issues that I 'm trying to address .
I can't help but wonder if they would 've had time for this conversation if it were n't so publicly visible .
( None of us academics ever have time . )
I 'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to have thousands of people read my writings and ponder the questions that I put out there .
My peer group extends beyond the academic walls .
It 's not without cost though and I could n't help but wonder if the academics I know could 've handled some of what I received this month .
Not all of it was what we would call a review .
I 've had to practice deep breathing as I went through detailed discussions of whether or not I was cute enough to fuck or look through bulletins that had decided to gather photos of me for analysis ( they concluded that my arm bracelets prove that I 'm a cutter ) .
I know the Slashdot / Metafilter community well enough to not take the personal threats on my life or body seriously , but that does n't mean they do n't suck .
Emails from parents accusing me of destroying their children 's lives suck .
PR campaigns to discredit me suck .
In general , being mocked is n't any fun .
Many of my dearest friends can't stand even the slightest personal attack online ; I 've learned to take it for granted while being continuously disappointed by it .
If online peer review is going to be this personal , few are going to be masochistic enough to want it .
My hope is that this article got a conversation started .
Maybe a few more people will think about class dynamics as a result .
Down the road , I 'll write it up more formally .
I 've gotten a lot of pressure to do so , but there are many things I need to do first .
This has been an unbelievable learning opportunity for me and for that I 'm grateful .
Perhaps I wo n't be so " careless " in the future , but I doubt it .
I need my blog to be an outlet for me to express things I 'm seeing long before they 're ready for publication .
I need to not have to couch every argument that I make on my blog in broader theoretical and methodological frameworks which means that I will continue to be taken out of context .
If I had to write on my blog in the way that I write papers , I 'd never blog .
I do hope that I 'll be able to continue blogging without every piece being so controversial and overwhelming .
This year marks 10 years .
Pretty crazy , huh ?

About 3 weeks ago , I was going to setup a Solaris box we acquired for a particular task in the office .
I chose this box and Solaris since I had read great things about ZFS .
In the past I would play the role of ‘ early adopter ’ and try things out when they became available .
Unless I absolutely need a particular technology , I now take the ‘ late adopter ’ role when we ’re talking about Operating Systems .
Too many companies release tech that is n’t stable .
At any rate , I remember the original ZFS release into Solaris .
It was announced , and then it was held back because it was n’t ready .
No problem , I can wait .
I thought that by now , after all the hype , things would be perfect .
We would finally have a decent raid and filesystem from Sun without worrying about the capabilities of DiskSuite or shelling out $ $ for Veritas .
It took Sun a big kick in the head to figure out that , now , 10 years later , they needed to innovate .
So I go through the hassle of downloading Solaris ( more on that later ) .
I start the install .
Things are going smoothly .
I get to the partitioning step , I ’m ready to see the magic .
I have two hot - swappable 18 gig drives in this machine .
I want to setup a mirroring system .
Fzzz .
Show stopper .
No ZFS .
Where is the ZFS ?
I downloaded the latest Solaris … what is up ?
Ah – after hitting Wikipedia ’s Article on ZFS , I notice in the limitations :
ZFS is currently not available as a root filesystem on Solaris 10 , since there is no ZFS boot support .
No boot support !
I stopped the project right there .
The whole reason I wanted to use Solaris was to be able to have a reliable , high - uptime system … and that means RAID .
No boot into UFS and then mount ZFS ..
I want a real RAID
Oh well , I ’ll try again next year .
I sure hope Apple users will be able to boot ZFS when they get it in Leopard .
Update Some people have asked ?
Why not download OpenSolaris which just added this ?
Ah , yeah – see ‘ late adopter ’ above .
Then read this “ Where do I download OpenSolaris ” ?
Looks like Krugman 's been reading the blogs again .
As usual , it 's beyond the firewall , but here are some choice excerpts .
Normally , politicians face a difficult tradeoff between taking positions that satisfy their party ’s base and appealing to the broader public ....
But a funny thing has happened on the Democratic side : the party ’s base seems to be more in touch with the mood of the country than many of the party ’s leaders .
And the result is peculiar : on key issues , reluctant Democratic politicians are being dragged by their base into taking highly popular positions .
Iraq is the most dramatic example ....
It took an angry base to push the Democrats into taking a tough line in the midterm election .
And it took further prodding from that base — which was infuriated when Barack Obama seemed to say that he would support a funding bill without a timeline — to push them into confronting Mr. Bush over war funding .
( Mr. Obama says that he did n’t mean to suggest that the president be given " carte blanche . " )
...
Health care is another example of the base being more in touch with what the country wants than the politicians .
Except for John Edwards , who has explicitly called for a universal health insurance system financed with a rollback of high - income tax cuts , most leading Democratic politicians , still intimidated by the failure of the Clinton health care plan , have been cautious and cagey about presenting plans to cover the uninsured .
But the Democratic presidential candidates — Mr. Obama in particular — have been facing a lot of pressure from the base to get specific about what they ’re proposing .
And the base is doing them a favor ....
There ’s no conflict between catering to the Democratic base and staking out positions that can win in the 2008 election , because the things the base wants — an end to the Iraq war , a guarantee of health insurance for all — are also things that the country as a whole supports .
The only risk the party now faces is excessive caution on the part of its politicians .
Or , to coin a phrase , the only thing Democrats have to fear is fear itself .
The future of Moore 's famous law — that the number of transistors squeezed onto a computer chip can be doubled about every two years — is widely seen as threatened by the damaging heat generated by the chips themselves as their transistors become more densely packed .
But a new theory of circuit design from Stanford researchers , recently confirmed by experiments in Germany , exploits the celebrated quirkiness of quantum physics to drastically reduce the heat produced by electricity coursing through the tiny veins of semiconductors .
Stanford physics Professor Shoucheng Zhang says a new generation of semiconductors , designed around the phenomenon known as the Quantum Spin Hall Effect , could keep Moore 's law in force for decades to come .
Beyond semiconductors , the theoretical aspect of the effect is intriguing on its own , Zhang said .
He and a team at the University of Würzburg published their results Friday , Sept. 21 , in Science Express , an online version of Science magazine .
Using special semiconductor material made from layers of mercury telluride and cadmium telluride , the experimenters employed quantum tricks to align the spin of electrons like a parade of tops spinning together .
Under these extraordinary conditions , the current flows only along the edges of the sheet of semiconductor .
Interestingly , electrons with identical spins travel in the same direction together , while electrons with the opposite spin move in the opposite direction .
Unlike existing semiconductors , this unusual electric current does not generate destructive heat through dissipation of power or the collision of electrons with impurities in the semiconducting material .
The electrons ' strange behavior constitutes a new state of matter , Zhang said , joining the three states familiar to high school science students — solids , liquids , gases — as well as more unworldly states such as superconductors , where electrons flow with no resistance .
He describes the quest for new states of matter as the holy grail of condensed matter physics .
Similar effects have been demonstrated before , but only at extremely cold temperatures and under the effects of powerful magnetic fields — conditions that cannot exist inside the common computer .
" What we managed to do is basically get rid of the magnetic field , " Zhang said .
There are other candidates for the next generation of computer chips , including nanotube technology .
But Zhang believes that Quantum Spin Hall Effect chips might have the advantage because they can be made from materials already familiar to chip makers .
In the long run , so - called " spintronics " could see the spin of electrons becoming more important than their electrical charge : Semiconductors would operate on the basis of spin alone , without electrons moving in their usual form of electrical current .
Zhang 's theoretical work was aided by graduate student Taylor Hughes and former graduate student Andrei Bernevig .
The U.S. Department of Energy and National Science Foundation funded their work .

When 12 bodies were found buried in the garden of a Mexican house , it seemed like a case of drug - linked killings .
But the trail led to Washington and a cover - up that went right to the top .
David Rose reports from El Paso
The article below says ' the US media have virtually ignored this story ' , yet editing had removed a reference to narconews.com reporter Bill Conroy , who has reported it extensively .
Apologies .
Janet Padilla 's first inkling that something might be wrong came when she phoned her husband at lunchtime .
His mobile phone was switched off .
On 14 January , 2004 , Luis had , as usual , left for work at 6 am , and when he did not answer the first call Janet made , after taking the children to school , she assumed he was busy .
Two weeks later she would learn the truth .
' It was love at first sight for Luis and me , and that 's how it stayed , after two years dating at school and eight years of marriage , ' says Janet .
' We always spoke a couple of times during the day and he always kept his phone on .
So I called my dad , who owns the truckyard where he worked and he told me , " he has n't been here " .
I called my in - laws and they had n't seen him either , and they were already worried because his car was outside their house with the windows open and the keys in the ignition .
He would never normally leave it like that .'
Luis Padilla , 29 , father of three , had been kidnapped , driven across the Mexican border from El Paso , Texas , to a house in Ciudad Juarez , the lawless city ruled by drug lords that lies across the Rio Grande .
As his wife tried frantically to locate him , he was being stripped , tortured and buried in a mass grave in the garden - what the people of Juarez call a narco - fossa , a narco - smugglers ' tomb .
Just another casualty of Mexico 's drug wars ?
Perhaps .
But Padilla had no connection with the drugs trade ; he seems to have been the victim of a case of mistaken identity .
Now , as a result of documents disclosed in three separate court cases , it is becoming clear that his murder , along with at least 11 further brutal killings , at the Juarez ' House of Death ' , is part of a gruesome scandal , a web of connivance and cover - up stretching from the wild Texas borderland to top Washington officials close to President Bush .
These documents , which form a dossier several inches thick , are the main source for the facts in this article .
They suggest that while the eyes of the world have been largely averted , America 's ' war on drugs ' has moved to a new phase of cynicism and amorality , in which the loss of human life has lost all importance - especially if the victims are Hispanic .
The US agencies and officials in this saga - all of which refused to comment , citing pending lawsuits - appear to have thought it more important to get information about drugs trafficking than to stop its perpetrators killing people .
The US media have virtually ignored this story .
The Observer is the first newspaper to have spoken to Janet Padilla , and this is the first narrative account to appear in print .
The story turns on one extraordinary fact : playing a central role in the House of Death was a US government informant , Guillermo Ramirez Peyro , known as Lalo , who was paid more than $ 220,000 ( £ 110,000 ) by US law enforcement bodies to work as a spy inside the Juarez cartel .
In August 2003 Lalo bought the quicklime used to dissolve the flesh of the first victim , Mexican lawyer Fernando Reyes , and then helped to kill him ; he recorded the murder secretly with a bug supplied by his handlers - agents from the Immigration and Customs Executive ( Ice ) , part of the Department of Homeland Security .
That first killing threw the Ice staff in El Paso into a panic .
Their informant had helped to commit first - degree murder , and they feared they would have to end his contract and abort the operations for which he was being used .
But the Department of Justice told them to proceed .
Lalo's cartel bosses told him whenever they were planning another killing , using a grisly codeword - carne asada , ' barbecue ' .
In the six months after Reyes 's death , they used it on many occasions .
Each time , says Lalo , he informed his handlers in Ice .
They did not intervene .
El Paso , population 700,000 , lies in Texas 's far west .
It is a V - shaped city almost bisected by the Franklin mountains , lashed by desert winds .
Houston and Dallas are more than 600 miles away .
Much closer , across a guarded fence and the river , here little wider than a stream , is Juarez .
On the western side of the Mexican city are the barrios - dirt streets of ramshackle huts without sanitation , built from discarded wood and tyres , whose inhabitants live in sight of the gleaming offices of downtown El Paso .
Eastern Juarez is very different .
There , in the campestre , the country club district , lie gated developments patrolled by security guards , armoured palaces of marble , with columns , fountains and huge golden domes .
Most of the money comes from drugs .
Los narcos control not only Juarez but the wider state of Chihuahua , ruling through corruption and fear .
One organisation is paramount - the Juarez cartel led by Vicente Carrillo Fuentes .
The US State Department claims he is responsible for shipping cocaine and marijuana worth billions of dollars a year and protects his business by killing .
America is offering a $ 5 m reward for his arrest .
His cartel has penetrated Mexican law enforcement at all levels .
Like many of its operatives , Lalo began as a policeman - in his case in the Mexican highway police .
Having resigned from the force in 1995 , he began transporting cocaine by the ton for a gang based in Guadalajara .
Professing disgust at his criminal associates , he started working for the US government in February 2000 , supplying information not only to Ice ( then known as US Customs ) but also the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , the Bureau of Alcohol , Firearms and Tobacco , and the FBI .
A few months later , with his handlers ' encouragement , he was recruited into the Juarez cartel by Il Ingeniero , the Engineer , one of Fuentes 's key lieutenants and a man notorious for acts of savage violence .
His real name was Heriberto Santillan - Tabares .
' The money I got from the Americans I invested in business , ' says Lalo , 36 .
' I had a used - car lot , a furniture store and a cellphone accessory place . '
He settled with his wife and three children on the US side of the border .
' I spoke to my handlers three or four times a day .
But when I went across the bridge to Juarez , I had no back - up .
I was on my own . '
Lalo claims to have facilitated numerous drug seizures and arrests .
But on 28 June , 2003 , his loyalty came under suspicion when he was arrested by the DEA in New Mexico , driving a truck he had brought across the border containing 102lb of marijuana .
He had not told his handlers about this shipment and , in accordance with its normal procedures , the DEA ' deactivated ' him as a source .
Ice took a different view .
Agents in its El Paso office were trying to use Lalo to build a case against Santillan , and to nail a separate cigarette - smuggling investigation .
At a meeting with federal prosecutors the week after Lalo 's arrest , Ice tried to persuade assistant US attorney Juanita Fielden that , if Lalo were closely monitored , he would continue to be effective .
Fielden agreed .
She says in an affidavit that she called the New Mexico prosecutor and got him to drop the charges .
Lalo was released .
A month later , on 5 August , Santillan asked Lalo to meet him at a cartel safe house at 3633 Calle Parsonieros , in an affluent neighbourhood of Juarez .
The Mexican lawyer Reyes would be there too , Santillan said , and with the help of some members of the Juarez judicial police - the local detective force - they were going to kill him .
When Lalo arrived , two cops were already there .
He went out to buy the quicklime and duct tape , and when he returned Santillan turned up with Reyes .
The policemen jumped on the lawyer , beating him and trying to put duct tape over his mouth .
Lalo , wearing his hidden wire supplied by Ice , recorded Reyes 's desperate pleas for mercy .
' They [ the police ] asked me to help them get him to the floor , ' reads a statement he made later .
' They tried to choke him with an extension cord , but this broke and I gave them a plastic bag and they put it on his head and suffocated him . '
Even then , they were not sure Reyes was dead .
One of the officers took a shovel ' and hit him many times on the head ' .
When Lalo returned to El Paso on the day of Reyes 's murder and told his Ice employers what had happened they were understandably worried .
They knew that , if they were to continue using Lalo as an informant , they would need high - level authorisation .
That afternoon and evening he was debriefed at length by his main handler , Special Agent Raul Bencomo , and his supervisor .
Then he was allowed to go back to Juarez - Santillan had given him $ 2,000 to pay two cartel members to dig Reyes 's grave , cover his body with quicklime and bury it .
Meanwhile the El Paso Ice office reported the matter to headquarters in Washington .
The information went up the chain of command , eventually reaching America 's Deputy Assistant Attorney General , John G. Malcolm .
It passed through the office of Johnny Sutton , the US Attorney for Western Texas - a close associate of George W. Bush .
When Bush was Texas governor , Sutton spent five years as his director of criminal justice policy .
After Bush became President , Sutton became legal policy co-ordinator in the White House transition team , working with another Bush Texas colleague , Alberto Gonzalez , the present US Attorney General .
Earlier this year Sutton was appointed chairman of the Attorney General 's advisory committee which , says the official website , ' plays a significant role in determining policies and programmes of the department and in carrying out the national goals set by the President and the Attorney General ' .
Sutton 's position as US Attorney for Western Texas is further evidence of his long friendship with the President - falling into his jurisdiction is Midland , the town where Bush grew up , and Crawford , the site of Bush 's beloved ranch .
' Sutton could and should have shut down the case , there and then , ' says Bill Weaver , a law professor at the University of Texas at El Paso who has made a detailed study of the affair .
' He could have told Ice and the lawyers " go with what you have , and let 's try to bring Santillan to justice " .
That neither he nor anyone else decided to take that action invites an obvious inference : that because the only people likely to get killed were Mexicans , they thought it did n't much matter . '
In the days after Reyes 's death , officials in Texas and Washington held a series of meetings .
Finally word came back from headquarters - despite the risk that Lalo might become involved with further murders , Ice could continue to use and pay him as an informant .
And although Santillan had already been caught on tape directing a merciless killing and might well kill again , no attempt would be made to arrest him .
Lalo 's statement , made in Dallas in February 2004 , is a record of cruelty and violence , the words of a man who thought himself untouchable because of his relationship with Ice .
In the months after Washington decided not to move on Santillan , the garden of the house at 3633 Calle Parsonieros began to fill with bodies .
One day in September 2003 , ' Santillan called to ask me to bury a guy who had apparently died of a heart attack at the moment he was kidnapped ' , Lalo 's statement says .
' Another execution I remember was on 23 November ...
Santillan ordered me to have these drug mules meet him in the little Parsonieros house ... Loya [ a corrupt police commander ] put tape around their heads , but they could still breathe and one of them began to moan loudly , so Loya shot him in the head ... but he did n't die immediately . '
They were killed because they were careless in their smuggling work .
Then , and on other occasions , Santillan told Lalo in advance he was going to hold a carne asada .
The deposition gives details of 13 murders , all but one of whose victims were later found buried at Number 3633 .
Each time Lalo crossed into Mexico his Ice handlers sought and obtained formal clearance from headquarters to allow their source to travel to a foreign country while working for a US agency .
Throughout the period , Lalo says , he continued to talk to his handler Bencomo up to four times a day - usually in person , at the Ice El Paso office .
He says his meetings with Santillan were all covertly recorded , while documents show that Ice had arranged for Lalo 's phone to be bugged .
Curtis Compton , Bencomo's
Ice supervisor , insisted in an affidavit that it did not know of any murders before they occurred : ' We only learned about the murders through interviews of Lalo after the fact .
I acted in good faith that all my actions were legal and proper . '
Lalo's last country clearance was issued on 13 January , 2004 .
Once again Santillan had called him , asking him to come to Juarez to unlock the Parsonieros house for a carne asada .
Next morning Luis Padilla disappeared .
Although the Padillas had attended Socorro high school in El Paso and lived in the US from childhood , both remained Mexican citizens , resident aliens with green - card work permits .
Their children , Luis jnr , Jacqueline and Jasmine , were born in the US .
Luis snr was two years ahead of Janet at school and they did not speak to each other until they attended a mutual friend 's quinceria , a 15th birthday party .
Janet smiles at the memory : ' I liked everything about Luis straight away .
He was silly , funny , a popular guy ; he played a lot of sports .
He was very religious and I started going to the same church , where he was president of the youth section . '
For their first date he took her to a Mexican restaurant , and then a children 's park : ' We just sat there on the swings , talking as if we 'd known each other for years . '
In 1996 , when Janet was 16 , they got married .
They spent their wedding night in Juarez .
By 4 pm on 14 January , Janet was on the point of phoning El Paso police when she received a call from a friend in Juarez .
' She told me , " I 've just seen Luis over here .
He was with some cops - they were putting him in a truck " .
I could n't figure it out .
He should n't have been in Mexico at all .
At 8 o'clock I could n't stand it any longer and I went over there myself .
I went to all the different police stations .
Nobody had him .
Nobody knew where he was .'
Since they married Janet and Luis had only ever spent a night apart - when Luis junior was born ; they had been living in Dallas , but she wanted to give birth in El Paso , in order to be near her family .
In the fortnight after his disappearance , Janet and the children stayed with relatives .
' I could n't go home .
I could n't be on my own .
When he was lost , not knowing what had happened drove me crazy .
When at last I heard something , at first I felt relief .
A lot of people disappear in Juarez and you never know what happened to them . '
On 26 January , Janet got a call .
Juarez police told her they had found some bodies .
She was to meet them at the city mortuary .
First , she was shown some photographs , but none was of Luis , ' I had to do it in person .
I went in there and they had four bodies at that time .
There were still ropes around their heads and their eyes were sticking out because they had been suffocated .
It was horrible , horrible .
One of them had a tattoo , one had silver teeth , another was too fat . '
Janet still did not believe this could have anything to do with Luis .
' He never took drugs and he never drank , beyond the odd beer .
He never got into fights .
He was still really into the church and he'd just been asked to coach middle - school sports .
How could he be narco - fossa ? '
The police phoned again .
This time they asked her to meet them at 3633 Calle Parsonieros .
The place looked familiar .
' The hotel where we spent our honeymoon night backed on to the garden .
' I saw his shoes and his jacket .
I went into the garden and they were probing the ground with a pole .
That 's when they found his body . '
The police exhumed him , ' but it was hard to ID him because he was so decomposed .
I looked at his hands and touched them .
The flesh fell off . '
Two other men had been murdered on 14 January , both of them from Juarez .
The next day Santillan told Lalo he had been asked to kill them as a favour for some associates of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes - Santillan had nothing against them personally .
In such circumstances , murderers can make mistakes .
While Santillan and Lalo went on killing , Bencomo , his Ice colleagues and Assistant US Attorney Fielden were assembling their case .
In December 2003 Fielden drew up a sealed indictment against Santillan .
But although there was already some evidence of his involvement in killings , the indictment was only for trafficking , not murder .
Before they could lure him to America and arrest him , they needed permission from the DoJ .
They got it on 15 January , a day after Luis Padilla died .
But this did not bring the House of Death killings to an end .
Under torture , one of Santillan 's victims had revealed the address of Homer Glen McBrayer - a DEA special agent resident in Juarez who operated under diplomatic cover .
At 6 pm on 14 January , two men rang his doorbell continuously for 10 minutes .
Afraid , his wife phoned him at work .
McBrayer rushed home and ushered his wife and daughters into their car .
As soon as they left the estate where they lived , they were stopped by a Mexican police car .
Two civilian vehicles hemmed McBrayer 's car in .
Their occupants got out and waited while McBrayer talked to the cops .
They were Santillan 's men .
Having showed his diplomatic passport , McBrayer phoned a DEA colleague , who arrived within minutes .
Unwilling , perhaps , to abduct two US agents , a woman and two children on a busy street , the cartel men backed off .
As the standoff unfolded , Santillan twice called Lalo .
He asked him to find out what he could about an American called Homer Glen - the corrupt police had not given McBrayer 's surname .
Santillan , claimed Lalo , said he thought he worked for the tres letras - code for the DEA - and intended to blow up his house .
The McBrayers were lucky to be alive , and the DEA , kept in the dark about the continued use of Lalo after the first murder six months earlier , reacted with fury .
Even as Ice debriefed Lalo , it refused the DEA access to him and to recordings of the events of 14 January .
Every principle governing informant handling and inter-agency co-operation appeared to have been flouted , and the Mexican government was not told of the carnage taking place on - and under - its soil .
Ice got Lalo to arrange a meeting with Santillan in El Paso and on 15 January Il Ingeniero was arrested .
Two days later , Ice finally told the Mexicans that the garden at 3633 Calle Parsonieros was a mass grave .
After bureaucratic delays , digging began on 23 January .
On 18 February , Johnny Sutton filed a new indictment against Santillan , charging him with trafficking and five murders - including those of Reyes and Padilla .
The House Of Death suddenly seemed set to become a major national scandal .
Bill Conroy , a reporter who works for an investigative website , Narconews.com , was about to publish an article about it .
On 24 February , Sandy Gonzalez , the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA office in El Paso , one of the most senior and highly decorated Hispanic law enforcement officers in America , wrote to his Ice counterpart , John Gaudioso .
' I am writing to express to you my frustration and outrage at the mishandling of investigation that has resulted in unnecessary loss of human life , ' he began , ' and endangered the lives of special agents of the DEA and their immediate families .
There is no excuse for the events that culminated during the evening of 14 January ... and I have no choice but to hold you responsible . '
Ice , Gonzalez wrote , had gone to ' extreme lengths ' to protect an informant who was , in reality , a ' homicidal maniac ... this situation is so bizarre that , even as I 'm writing to you , it is difficult for me to believe it ' .
But Ice and its allies in the DoJ were covering up their actions , helped by the US media - aside from the Dallas Morning News , not one major newspaper or TV network has covered the story .
The first signs came in the response to Gonzalez 's letter to Gaudioso - not from Ice , but from Johnny Sutton .
He reacted not to the discovery of corpses at Calle Parsonieros , but with concern Gonzalez might talk to the media .
He communicated his fears to a senior official in Washington - Catherine O'Neil , director of the DoJ's Organised Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force .
Describing Gonzalez 's letter as ' inflammatory , ' she passed on Sutton 's fears to the then Attorney General , John Ashcroft , and to Karen Tandy , the head of the DEA , another Texan lawyer .
Tandy was horrified by Gonzalez 's letter .
' I apologised to Johnny Sutton last night and he and I agreed on a " no comment " to the press , ' she replied on 5 March .
Gonzalez would have no further involvement with the House of Death case and was ordered to report to Washington for ' performance discussions to further address this officially ' .
Gonzalez was told that Sutton was ' extremely upset ' .
Gonzalez , who had enjoyed glittering appraisals throughout his 30 - year career , was told he would be downgraded .
On 4 May , DEA managers in Washington sent him a letter .
It said that , if he quietly retired before 30 June , he would be given a ' positive ' reference for future employers .
If he refused , a reference would dwell on his ' lapse ' .
Gonzalez resigned , and launched a lawsuit - part of which is due to come to court tomorrow .
' I 've been written off , ' he says .
' They dismiss my complaints , saying I 'm just a disgruntled employee .
But once they knew about the carne asadas , they were legally and morally obligated to do something .
They already had a solid case against Santillan for drugs and murder .
What the fuck else did they need ?
As for the DEA , they held my feet to the fire and joined the cover - up . '
He had been neutralised , but there remained the danger that details of Ice 's relationship with Lalo would surface at Santillan 's trial .
Janet Padilla had also been dealt with .
Ice has no legal responsibility for investigating murder , but after her husband 's funeral Lalo 's former handler , Bencomo , came calling .
' He told me that he was going to help me find my husband 's killers and bring them to justice , ' Janet says .
' He said to tell him anything I knew , because he would be in charge of the case .
I saw him three or four times , and later I also met Juanita Fielden . '
It did not occur to Janet that she ought to contact the police or other agencies .
For Janet , Santillan 's indictment for murder was a moment of hope : ' I thought I was going to get justice for Luis . '
But on 19 April Sutton announced a deal with Santillan - in return for his pleading guilty to trafficking and acceptance of a 25 - year sentence the murder charges were dropped .
' All of the murders were committed in Juarez , by Mexican citizens , and all of the victims were citizens of Mexico , ' Sutton said .
No one had any further use for Lalo .
In August 2004 someone tried to shoot him at an El Paso restaurant - instead killing an innocent bystander .
After that , he was taken into protective custody .
And then , on 9 May 2005 , Ice , the agency that had cherished him , decided that his US visa was irregular and began legal proceedings to deport him to Mexico - without doubt a death sentence .
He is now in a maximum - security jail in the Midwest , fighting his former employers through the courts .
In October The Observer won clearance to visit him with his lawyer , Jodi Goodwin .
On the eve of the interview he was abruptly moved to a different facility where officials said a visit was impossible .
Goodwin passed on a message : ' I 'm not mad , I 'm sad and disillusioned .
Every time I did a job and brought them information , I was congratulated .
Now they want to deliver me to my death . '
' If Congress and the media start to look at this properly , they will be horrified , ' Sandy Gonzalez says .
' It needs a special prosecutor , as with the case of Valerie Plame [ the CIA agent whose name was leaked to the media when her diplomat husband criticised Bush over Iraq 's missing weapons of mass destruction ] .
But Valerie is a nice - looking white person and the victims here are brown .
Nobody gives a shit .'
For the three children who lost their father , and their mother , now struggling to make ends meet , it is difficult to cope .
' It 's worst at night , when I put them to bed , ' Janet Padilla says .
' I guess that 's when it hits them .
I tell them , " come on you guys , we got to make a prayer .
Do n't worry .
Your daddy 's watching you . "
But you know , it 's very hard to make it as a dad as well as a mom . '

Giuliani says D.C. gun ruling ' appears correct '
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , whose past support for gun control has complicated his current quest for the White House , said Monday that a federal appeals court ruling striking down a District of Columbia law barring residents from keeping handguns in their homes appears " to be a correct decision . "
Gun control advocates have expressed alarm about Friday 's decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , which marked the first time a federal appeals court has struck down a gun control measure as a violation of the Second Amendment 's right to keep and bear arms .
But Giuliani , commenting on the ruling at a news conference in Washington , said that while he had not read the actual decision , " from what I 've read in the newspapers , it strikes exactly that balance that I think exists , which is that there 's a right to bear arms , that it 's a personal right , and that there can be reasonable restrictions , and they largely should be done by states and done by legislatures .

Giuliani opens up clear lead , gets conservative endorsements
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has established himself as the clear front - runner in the GOP presidential field , opening up a double - digit lead over his nearest rival , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , whose support has slumped in the past six weeks , according to a CNN poll released Monday .
The poll , conducted by Opinion Research Corp. , showed Giuliani was the choice of 34 percent of likely Republican voters , compared to 18 percent for McCain , a margin well outside the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points .
The poll released Monday found a marked shift in the GOP race from late January , when Giuliani polled at 32 percent and McCain at 26 percent , putting them statistically neck - and - neck .
In the past six weeks , McCain 's support has dropped 8 points , to its lowest point in six months .
However , McCain 's campaign insisted the senator is happy with the role of underdog because it will allow him to surprise the front - runner , as he did during his unsuccessful campaign against President Bush in 2000 , when he won the New Hampshire primary .

Bush , in Guatemala , hails free trade
GUATEMALA CITY ( CNN ) -- President Bush used the latest stop on his week - long trip through Latin America to plug a free - trade pact that barely passed the previous Republican - controlled Congress .
Wearing a colorful jacket presented to him by locals at a packing station , Bush loaded crates of lettuce onto a truck , while first lady Laura Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stood nearby holding vegetables as well
" Free trade is important for a lot of people .
It 's important for our country , " Bush told the business ' owner , Mariano Canu .
" It creates jobs in America just like it creates here . "
The photo opportunity was set up for media and designed to counter the widespread protests Bush is facing on his trip .

Many also say it contributes to environmental degradation .

House oversight chairman wants Rice to answer Niger uranium questions
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The new chairman of a House investigative committee is demanding answers to questions he put to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice nearly four years ago about President Bush 's assertion that Iraq once sought uranium from Africa .
In a letter released Monday , Rep. Henry Waxman said Rice responded to only five of 16 letters about the issue when he was the committee 's ranking Democrat -- only those that had been co-signed by congressional Republicans .
" I am now renewing my request as the chairman of the chief oversight committee in the U.S. House of Representatives , " he wrote .
The uranium claim , which Bush made in his 2003 State of the Union address , was a key element in the administration 's case for the invasion of Iraq .
Rice was President Bush 's national security adviser at the time .
" As a result of your failure to respond , the committee still does not know what you knew about the fabricated Niger claim and when you knew it , " Waxman , D - Calif . , wrote to Rice on Monday .
" We also do not know how the fabricated claim made it into the president 's State of the Union address .
We continue to learn in a piecemeal fashion about other explicit warnings received by the White House about this bogus claim . "

All mandatory evacuations were lifted Monday as firefighters contained 80 percent of the Anaheim Hill wildfire .
Voluntary evacuations remained in a small portion of the Hidden Canyon area where firefighters battled the last of a blaze that had burned 2,036 acres .
Weaker winds and higher humidity levels had given firefighters the upper hand in containing the wildfire that had raced up and through Anaheim Hills , about 35 miles south of Los Angeles , aided by record - breaking temperatures and super - dry conditions plaguing the area .

Cheney : Troop withdrawal would leave U.S. vulnerable to attack
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney offered a sharp rebuke to congressional Democrats Monday , warning that a drawdown of forces in Iraq would invite more attacks on the United States .
Cheney 's warning comes as Democrats are girding for a fight over more spending in Iraq -- a push planned even before President Bush 's weekend request to deploy an additional 8,200 troops to Iraq and Afghanistan .
House Democrats are leading a charge this week to set a deadline for withdrawal by August 2008 .
In a speech to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee , Cheney said even discussion of a withdrawal tells " the enemy to watch the clock and wait us out . "
And an actual pullout would send an even worse message , he said .
" If terrorists conclude attacks will change the behavior of a nation , they will attack the nation again and again , " he said .
" The only option for our security and survival is to go on the offensive ... until our enemy is destroyed . "

Kidnapped Texas infant reunited with mother ; suspect held in N.M .
LUBBOCK , Texas ( CNN ) --
A newborn girl was reunited with her mother on Sunday at a Lubbock hospital after police in New Mexico arrested a woman in connection with her kidnapping , authorities said .
Police in Clovis , N.M. , found 4 - day - old Mychael Dawodu early Sunday , a day after her abduction from Covenant Medical Center in Lubbock .
Authorities were extremely concerned about the baby 's health because she was born with jaundice , a common condition in newborns that can become serious without treatment .
" The baby looks to be in good condition , " Clovis Police Chief Dan Blair told CNN .
The suspect , 21 - year - old Rayshaun Parson , was under arrest in Clovis , about 100 miles away , and faces a Monday extradition hearing before a judge there , said Matt Chandler , the district attorney for Curry County , N.M .
There is no indication that she had any ties to the baby 's family , Lubbock police spokesman Lt. Scott Hudgens said .

After reading Chris McDonough ’s What Not To Do When Writing Python Software , it occurred to me that many people do n’t actually know how to properly re-raise exceptions .
So a little mini-tutorial for Python programmers , about exceptions …
First , this is bad :
try : some_code ( ) except : revert_stuff ( ) raise Exception ( " some_code failed ! " )
It is bad because all the information about how some_code ( ) failed is lost .
The traceback , the error message itself .
Maybe it was an expected error , maybe it was n’t .
Here ’s a modest improvement ( but still not very good ) :
try : some_code ( ) except : import traceback traceback.print_exc( ) revert_stuff ( ) raise Exception ( " some_code failed ! " )
traceback.print_exc( ) prints the original traceback to stderr .
Sometimes that ’s the best you can do , because you really want to recover from an unexpected error .
But if you are n’t recovering , this is what you should do :
try : some_code ( ) except : revert_stuff ( ) raise
Using raise with no arguments re-raises the last exception .
Sometimes people give a blank never use “ except : “ statement , but this particular form ( except : + raise ) is okay .
There ’s another form of raise that not many people know about , but can also be handy .
Like raise with no arguments , it can be used to keep the traceback :
try : some_code ( ) except : import sys exc_info = sys.exc_info( ) maybe_raise( exc_info ) def maybe_raise ( exc_info ) : if for some reason this seems like it should be raised : raise exc_info [ 0 ] , exc_info [ 1 ] , exc_inf o [ 2 ]
This can be handy if you need to handle the exception in some different part of the code from where the exception happened .
But usually it ’s not that handy ; it ’s an obscure feature for a reason .
Another case when people often clobber the traceback is when they want to add information to it , e.g. :
for lineno , line in enumerate ( file ) : try : process_line ( line ) except Exception , exc : raise Exception ( " Error in line %s : %s " % ( lineno , exc ) )
You keep the error message here , but lose the traceback .
There ’s a couple ways to keep that traceback .
One I sometimes use is to retain the exception , but change the message :
except Exception , exc : args = exc.args if not args : arg0 = '' else : arg0 = args [ 0 ] arg0 += ' at line %s ' % lineno exc.args = arg0 + args [ 1 :] raise
It ’s a little awkward .
Technically ( though it ’s deprecated ) you can raise anything as an exception .
If you use except Exception : you wo n’t catch things like string exceptions or other weird types .
It ’s up to you to decide if you care about these cases ; I generally ignore them .
It ’s also possible that an exception wo n’t have .args , or the string message for the exception wo n’t be derived from those arguments , or that it will be formatted in a funny way ( KeyError formats its message differently , for instance ) .
So this is n’t foolproof .
To be a bit more robust , you can get the exception like this :
except : exc_class , exc , tb = sys.exc_info ( )
exc_class will be a string , if someone does something like raise " not found " .
There ’s a reason why that style is deprecated .
Anyway , if you really want to mess around with things , you can then do :
new_exc = Exception ( " Error in line %s : %s " % ( lineno , exc or exc_class ) ) raise new_exc.__class__ , new_exc , tb
The confusing part is that you ’ve changed the exception class around , but you have at least kept the traceback intact .
It can look a little odd to see raise ValueError ( ... ) in the traceback , and Exception in the error message .
Anyway , a quick summary of proper ways to re-raise exceptions in Python .
May your tracebacks prosper !
Update : Kumar notes the problem of errors in your error handler .
Things get more long winded , but here ’s the simplest way I know of to deal with that :
try : code ( ) except : exc_info = sys.exc_info( ) try : revert_stuff ( ) except : #
If this happens , it clobbers exc_info , which is why we had # to save it above import traceback print >> sys.stderr , " Error in revert_stuff ( ) : " traceback.print_exc( ) raise exc_info [ 0 ] , exc_info [ 1 ] , exc_inf o [ 2 ]
Today Is The Fourth Anniversary Of An Enormous Opportunity
I thought it would be nice to mark today , September 11 , 2005 , with a short test .
Here 's the first question : what is this ?
What did you guess ?
Did you say " That 's the last moments of the lives of thousands of people " ?
Or " That 's a hideous act of mass murder " ?
Or " That 's the beginning of a lifetime of suffering for everyone who loved someone who died at the World Trade Center " ?
Wrong !
The right answer is : that is an OPPORTUNITY , an ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY :
Through my tears I see opportunity .
— George Bush , September 20 , 2001
If the collapse of the Soviet Union and 9/11 bookend a major shift in international politics , then this is a period not just of grave danger , but of enormous opportunity .
Before the clay is dry again , America and our friends and our allies must move decisively to take advantage of these new opportunities .
— Condoleezza Rice , April 29 , 2002
Now here 's the second question : what is this ?
This question is a little harder .
Some people might answer , " That 's the grotesque Al Qaeda bombing of a hotel in Mombasa , Kenya in November , 2002 . "
Others might say , " It 's the place where terrorists murdered 13 people , including Israeli brothers Noy and Dvir Anter , ages 12 and 13 . "
Or , " That 's the place where , CNN reported , ' screaming children covered in blood searched desperately for their parents amid the wreckage . ' "
Of course , those are dumb answers .
The right answer is : it is a GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY :
Israeli officials view last week 's terrorist attacks against Israeli targets in Kenya , apparently by Al Qaeda or an affiliated group , as reinforcing their argument that Israel and the West are battling a single enemy .
Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , meeting with ministry staff in the aftermath of the Kenya attacks , said that the incidents had presented Israel with a " golden opportunity " to strengthen its strategic ties with the United States and other Western countries .
Now , here 's the last question : what is this ?
I hope you did n't answer , " That 's a young Iraqi girl covered in the blood of her parents , who 'd just been killed by U.S. soldiers terrified of car bombers . "
Or , " Something that every American should be atoning for until the day we die . "
Because , again , those answers are stupid !
The right answer is , that 's a picture of yet another GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY :
Targeting America in Iraq in terms of economy and losses in life is a golden and unique opportunity .
Do not waste it only to regret it later .
— Osama bin Laden , December , 2004
Probably my point here is clear .
But I will go ahead and spell it out .
For normal people , it 's an unmitigated tragedy when their fellow citizens are killed in terrorist attacks or wars .
Normal people cry , become afraid , and think of children who now have no parents and parents who now have no children .
For our would - be " leaders , " however — in every country — the situation is different .
Of course , they pretend to feel the same as normal people .
They give teary - eyed speeches about sorrow and suffering .
And yet , behind their tears , there seems to be something else .
When they think no one is looking , you glimpse another expression flitting across their face .
You think it could n't be .
But — yes , incredibly enough , they 're smiling .
Because before the bodies are cold , before the mothers have stopped shrieking , our leaders are thinking :
This is really a FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY .
And for them it is .
It 's an opportunity for them to do whatever they wanted to do before , but could n't get away with .
It 's an opportunity for them to smear anyone who criticizes them as disloyal .
It 's an opportunity for them to become much more powerful than they ever could be in peacetime .
Leaders love war .
That 's why there 's so much of it .
It 's understandably hard for most people to come to terms with this .
It 's terrifying to believe your leaders may secretly be , uh , not so sad if you die .
But all you have to do is listen to them , and they 'll tell you .
Can we change this ?
Maybe .
But the first step in changing reality is facing it , no matter how ugly and frightening it is .
Happy September 11th !
Decades before President Bush decided to teach Iraq a lesson , George F. Kennan worried that what he called our “ monster country ” would , through the “ hubris of inordinate size , ” inevitably become a menace , intervening all too often in other nations ’ affairs : “ There is a real question as to whether ‘ bigness ’ in a body politic is not an evil in itself , quite aside from the policies pursued in its name . ”
Kennan proposed that devolution , “ while retaining certain of the rudiments of a federal government , ” might yield a “ dozen constituent republics , absorbing not only the powers of the existing states but a considerable part of those of the present federal establishment . ”
Regional devolution would most likely be initiated by a very large state with a distinct sense of itself and aspirations greater than Washington can handle .
The obvious candidate is California , a state that has the eighth - largest economy in the world .
If such a state decided to get serious about determining its own fate , other states would have little choice but to act , too .
One response might be for an area like New England , which already has many regional interstate arrangements , to follow California ’s initiative — as it already has on some environmental measures .
And if one or two large regions began to take action , other state groupings in the Northwest , Southwest and elsewhere would be likely to follow .
A new wave of regional devolution could also build on the more than 200 compacts that now allow groups of states to cooperate on environmental , economic , transportation and other problems .
Most likely , regional empowerment would be popular : when the Appalachian Regional Commission was established in 1965 , senators from across the country rushed to demand commissions to help the economies and constituencies of their regions , too .
Governor Schwarzenegger may not have thought through the implications of continuing to assert forcefully his “ nation - state ” ambitions .
But he appears to have an expansive sense of the possibilities : this is the governor , after all , who brought Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to the Port of Long Beach last year to sign an accord between California and Britain on global warming .
And he may be closer to the mark than he knows with his dream that “ California , the nation - state , the harmonious state , the prosperous state , the cutting - edge state , becomes a model , not just for the 21st - century American society , but for the larger world . ”
C# : Fat or Fit? July 12 , 2007
In C# 3.0 Considered Rubenesque ? , David Ing considers ( mainly ) whether C# needs the functional extensions being proposed for v3.0 and by the by touches on a discussion I ’ve been having internally about Java , Python and Erlang .
The main points for me revolve around language complexity , the timing of the need for functional programming and when not to abstract .
Elliotte Harold has been vocal against adding complexity to the Java language .
The complexity loving geek in my stamps his foot ( “ … but I want properties / closures / etc ” ) but Elliotte ’s right – programming languages do n’t have to accrete features , and in the real world most Java programmers get dazed and confused if you throw inner classes at them .
On the other hand python has managed to support a functional style of programming ( although I ’m told that this is n’t totally pythonic ) and is still considered easy to learn , so perhaps it can be done simply .
You do n’t need to reach for Mother Shipton ’s almanac to know that functional programming languages are going to be hugely important , with processors now not getting much faster , but gaining more cores .
The languages that enable normal rank and file developers to take advantage of that are going to win in the way memory managed languages did , and in the way dynamic languages are doing .
The question is not really “ if ” but “ when ” , and the answer probably depends who you are and what you need to do .
If I were writing an data analysis program to run a cluster ( say 32 machines with dual - dual processors ) , then I ’d be reaching for any language that let me use them as efficiently as possible – give the air con something to think about .
Even if I had a dual - dual server dedicated to a single service I ’d probably do so too , even though I ’d be unlikely to get a 4 x speed up due to I/O contention ( example from Pragmatic Programmer ) .
Most of our current web facing servers ( where most of my code will end up running ) are single or dual core , and are n’t due for an upgrade any time soon .
So I ’m better off sticking to what I know for now .
The final point is probably the most important , since it ’s not future gazing : –
There is a school of thought that when you ’re working with a relational database rather than a collection of in - memory objects , then you should not lose track of the various nuances and advantages of the stores – abstraction to save typing can come back to bite you ?
Replace “ working with a relational database ” with “ machine boundary ” or “ transactions ” and it ’s still true .
Remember the first law of software complexity – you ca n’t get rid of complexity , just move it around .
The more amazing an abstraction is at hiding complexity from you , the more likely it is to leak .
The ubiquitous microwave oven is an appliance used daily , both at work and at home .
And yet so few people possess the knowledge and skills necessary to reap the maximum productivity from this modern time - saving device .
Here are several tips for optimal microwave oven usage :
1. Reduce unnecessary key punching .
Are you one of those plebeians who still punches in 1 - 0 - 0 to heat an item for a minute or 1 - 3 - 0 for a minute and a half ?
Use 6 - 0 for 60 seconds and 9 - 0 for 90 seconds , and save yourself that extra digit .
Learn to type two digits for anything up to 99 seconds .
You ’ll save time and also reduce wear and tear on your keypad .
2. Duplicate the same digit whenever possible .
Tip # 1 was for newbies .
The next skill to master is digit reuse so as to minimize finger movement over the keypad .
Instead of typing 9 - 0 for 90 seconds , type 8 - 8 . Instead of 6 - 0 , use 5 - 5 .
You wo n’t miss those extra seconds , and you ’ll save even more time .
3 . If your microwave has a turntable , learn its rotational period .
How many times have you re-nuked your tea only to find that when you opened the microwave door , the teacup handle was oriented towards the rear , forcing you to reach awkwardly around the back to extract your beverage without burning yourself ?
The time lost in handle - hunting can be an order of magnitude greater than what you save on the keypad , so give top priority to learning the period of rotation of your turntable .
When shopping for a new microwave , look for one with a rotational period of 5.5 or 11 seconds , since then your 5 - 5 and 8 - 8 nukes will always return the cooked item to its original orientation ( i.e. handle facing out ) .
But if you ’re stuck with a less functional period of rotation and the handle always ends up facing the rear after your preferred nuke times , then learn to insert the cold mug with the handle facing the rear , so it will be facing outwards post - nuking .
Of course , another solution is to buy two - handled mugs or teacups , which is fine if sophistication lacks appeal to you .
4. Multitask with multiple microwaves .
How many times have you had to wait for the microwave to finish one item before you nuke a second or third item , like reheating leftovers and then making a cup of tea ?
Surely you have better things to do than stand around soaking up radiation for 10 minutes .
New microwave ovens can be bought for less than $ 50 .
You should have at least three stacked in your kitchen and at least one in every room of your home .
Reheat leftovers for the entire family in minutes .
Build your own nuke farm , and multi - nuke your way to faster meals for life .
Just be sure not to blow a fuse by running too many other appliances at the same time .
By applying these tips , you could save yourself precious seconds per day , which over the course of a lifetime , should be more than enough to recoop the time spent learning them … unless , of course , you ’re reading this on your deathbed , in which case you have my sincerest apologies ( and my pity ) .
Next time :

Windows Vista will ship with anti-piracy technology that will lock down the OS if it has not been activated within 30 days of first use , Microsoft announced today .
If the OS is not activated , Windows will switch to a reduced functionality mode that will cripple the OS .
This is but one of many planned features of Microsoft 's new Software Protection Platform ( SPP ) , shared by both Windows Vista and the forthcoming Longhorn Server , due sometime late next year ( at the earliest ) .
Anti-piracy at installation
As with Windows XP , Windows Vista and Longhorn Server will both feature newly revamped versions of what we 've come to know as Windows Product Activation ( WPA ) .
After installation , users will have 30 days to " activate " Windows , by which Microsoft means that users will have to provide a product key to fully unlock the OS .
If a user fails to supply a valid key in that timeframe , Windows Vista will respond with a new set of options :
Reduced Functionality Mode : this allows minimal use of the OS until it is validated .
Microsoft has not disclosed full technical details , but they have indicated that
the web browser ( presumably IE ) will work for about an hour before interrupting the session and forcing you to log off .
Additional limitations are described below .
: this allows minimal use of the OS until it is validated .
Microsoft has not disclosed full technical details , but they have indicated that the web browser ( presumably IE ) will work for about an hour before interrupting the session and forcing you to log off .
Additional limitations are described below .
Buy a key online : hop online , buy a new key , and you 're done .
: hop online , buy a new key , and you 're done .
Phone in for activation : instructions on how to activate over the phone rather than the Internet .
: instructions on how to activate over the phone rather than the Internet .
Enter your key : Oops , it was under the coffee table book the whole time .
Notably , Microsoft is adamant that these technologies " cannot and will not turn off your computer . "
Reduced functionality mode will also disable Aero , the new Windows Vista interface , and any " Premium " or " Ultimate " features of the OS will be completely locked down .
Additionally , users will only be able to obtain security updates marked as " critical . "
Other downloads and updates will not be available .
This anti-piracy mode will also disable other installed applications such as Office , making it impossible for a user to edit documents .
Users can view documents by using the web browser , but Microsoft has essentially designed the system to prevent " read / write " access .
The general approach is quite clear : reduce the computer to a web browsing station and make it inconvenient to be a pirate .
Microsoft has not taken the extra step and simply disabled the computer entirely , apparently in an effort to court users trapped by counterfeiters .
It also has ostensible public relations benefits stemming back to the days of the WGA phone - home scandal .
Keeping an eye on things
Unlike Windows XP , Vista will monitor the activation status of the computer even after the initial 30 - day period .
If the technology later decides that a key is no longer valid , through either a software update or via some other means , it will give the user another 30 - day period to rectify the situation .
This is where Windows Genuine Advantage comes in .
WGA will not throw the machine into full reduced - functionality mode if activation has been completed once .
Instead it will disable Aero , ReadyBoost , and Windows Defender , and it will display a persistent notice in the lower right - hand corner of the desktop that reads : " This copy of Windows is not genuine . "
WGA is intended to monitor systems for evidence of tampering post-activation .
In our estimation , this is in large part because Windows Anytime Upgrade will allow users to add new features to the OS on the fly , Microsoft is keen to protect this feature by watching for post-activation hacks on the system , and the OS will reportedly perform occasional internal checks on itself to search for evidence of tampering .
Cori Hartje , director of Microsoft ’s Genuine Software Initiative , made it clear that Microsoft intends to use this technology in additional Microsoft products at a later time .
Hartje cited a Business Software Alliance report on piracy which claims that there were losses of $ 35 billion across the software industry due to piracy .
As we have reported before , Microsoft 's primary concern at this point is stopping both casual piracy and counterfeiters .
I know from conversations with people inside the company that there are conflicting approaches to how to deal with this problem , but no one is under the illusion that that SPP , WPA , or WGA is going to completely eliminate piracy .
The company is interested in continuing to build tools that make it difficult and inconvenience to be a pirate , however .
Ms Khanom was discharged from the jury during the trial
Ruhela Khanom , in her 20s , was accused of hiding an MP3 player and earphones beneath an Islamic hijab or headscarf .
She was discharged at the Blackfriars Crown Court trial of Alan Wicks , later jailed for life for murdering his wife .
The attorney general has decided not to refer the matter to the High Court because of insufficient evidence .
A statement from the office of the Attorney General , Baroness Scotland , said she had " considered carefully the papers in this matter , in particular the witness statements , and has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of proving beyond reasonable doubt any alleged contempt of court " .
Jury service
Ms Khanom was discharged by the trial judge , Judge Roger Chapple , after the prosecutor Peter Clarke QC claimed the juror had not been paying attention while the defendant was in the witness box giving key evidence .
Having looked very carefully at this case at the heart of is this whether this lady deliberately ignored the evidence
Judge Aiden Marron QC
When jurors misbehave
Wicks , 72 , was later convicted of bludgeoning to death his wife , Pamela , at their home in Hayes , west London , after taking out £ 150,000 life insurance .
At the end of the trial , it was also revealed Ms Khanom had repeatedly tried to avoid jury service .
During the trial , Judge Chapple warned her after she appeared to be doodling on a pad while evidence was being read out .
' Tinny music '
Mr Clarke initially asked for her to be discharged , but the judge resisted , saying jurors could only be discharged for " very , very serious and improper behaviour " .
But the following day one of the defence lawyers thought she spotted a wire under the hijab .
JURY SERVICE
People under 18 and over 70 are not eligible Every year 185,000 people in England and Wales do jury service
In the past doctors , lawyers , vicars and politicians were excluded from jury service Nowadays the only people excused from jury service are the mentally ill and those who have served custodial sentences
Later the judge said he had thought he could hear " tinny music " during the trial but dismissed it as his imagination .
The trial judge referred the matter to Judge Aidan Marron QC who considered the matter earlier this month .
Judge Marron said : " The police have investigated this matter and assembled a file .
" Having looked very carefully at this case at the heart of is this whether this lady deliberately ignored the evidence .
" That means that she was listening to music during the course of the evidence .
" Although there may be allegations she was persistently late and was quite indifferent to listening to the evidence and studying documentation ... these matters demonstrate mindset but do not constitute contempt of court .
" The fundamental allegation is whether she was deliberately ignoring the evidence by listening to music . "
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said : " The attorney general has taken the decision not to prosecute based on the evidence before her .
But there have been instances in the past of jurors doing inappropriate things and having been penalised for it . "
She said the law was tightened a few years ago to reduce the number of people able to excuse themselves from jury service .
Why is the question " Why wo n't God heal amputees ? " so important ?
" Why wo n't God heal amputees ? " may seem like an odd name for a Web site .
The reason for choosing it is simple : this is one of the most important questions that we can ask about God .
The question , " Why wo n't God heal amputees ? " probes into a fundamental aspect of prayer and exposes it for observation .
This aspect of prayer has to do with ambiguity and coincidence .
The obvious question to ask is :
What cured you ?
Was it the surgery / chemotherapy , or was it God ?
Is there any way to know whether God is playing a role or not when we pray ?
Unless you take the time to intelligently analyze this situation , it looks ambiguous .
God might have miraculously cured your disease , as many Christians believe .
But God might also be imaginary , and the chemotherapy drugs and surgery are the things that cured you .
Or your body 's immune system might have cured the cancer itself .
When your tumor disappeared , in other words , it might simply have been a complete coincidence that you happened to pray .
Your prayer may have had zero effect .
How can we determine whether it is God or coincidence that worked the cure ?
One way is to eliminate the ambiguity .
In a non-ambiguous situation , there is no potential for coincidence .
Because there is no ambiguity , we can actually know whether God is answering the prayer or not .
That is what we are doing when we look at amputees .
Think about it this way .
The Bible clearly promises that God answers prayers .
For example , in Mark 11:24 Jesus says , " Therefore I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours . "
And billions of Christians believe these promises .
You can find thousands of books , magazine articles and Web sites talking about the power of prayer .
According to believers ,
God is answering millions of their prayers every day .
So what should happen if we pray to God to restore amputated limbs ?
Clearly , if God is real , limbs should regenerate through prayer .
In reality , they do not .
Why not ?
Because God is imaginary .
Notice that there is zero ambiguity in this situation .
There is only one way for a limb to regenerate through prayer :
God must exist and God must answer prayers .
What we find is that whenever we create a unambiguous situation like this and look at the results of prayer , prayer never works .
God never " answers prayers " if there is no possibility of coincidence .
We will approach this issue from several different angles in this book , but Chapters 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 are particularly important :
never
never
One of the most scientifically rigorous studies yet , published earlier this month , found that the prayers of a distant congregation did not reduce the major complications or death rate in patients hospitalized for heart treatments . [ ref ]
A review of 17 past studies of '' distant healing , " published in 2003 by a British researcher , found no significant effect for prayer or other healing methods .
You can see the same effect in the following prayer .
Let 's assume that you are a true believer and you do believe that God cures cancer .
What would happen if we get down on our knees and pray to God in this way :
Dear God , almighty , all - powerful , all - loving creator of the universe , we pray to you to cure every case of cancer on this planet tonight .
We pray in faith , knowing you will bless us as you describe in Matthew 7:7 , Matthew 17:20 , Matthew 21:21 , Mark 11:24 , John 14:12 - 14 , Matthew 18:19 and James 5:15 - 16 .
In Jesus ' name we pray , Amen .
The fact is , what this prayer does is remove ambiguity .
As soon as we do that , we see the true nature of " God . "
There is no way that a coincidence can answer this prayer , and , sure enough , the prayer goes unanswered .
If you look at the data , you can see exactly what is happening here :
When we pray to God about any non-ambigous situation , God never answers the prayer .
answers the prayer .
When we analyse any ambiguous prayer using statistical tools , we find zero effect from prayer .

AIDS drug 's efficacy confirmed / Further studies on darunavir show success against resistant HIV
A new AIDS drug that received accelerated federal approval last summer is significantly better at attacking highly resistant HIV than existing drugs , according to a study of 230 patients published Wednesday .
Darunavir , part of the decade - old class of drugs known as protease inhibitors , lowered virus levels to the undetectable range in 45 percent of patients after 48 weeks .
By comparison , 10 percent of patients on other drug regimens showed similar declines .
" The results were very , very good -- in many ways , perhaps , better than anyone would 've expected , " said Dr. Rodger MacArthur , an infectious - diseases specialist at Wayne State University in Detroit , who was not affiliated with the study .
The results of the patient study , combined with the recent development of several new classes of AIDS medications , have opened a whole new realm of options to battle the increasing problem of drug - resistant HIV , according to Dr. Steven Johnson , director of the HIV / AIDS Clinical Program at the University of Colorado .
Darunavir , trade named Prezista , was approved last year before normal testing was completed to meet the urgent need of those patients with drug - resistant HIV .
The approval required the drug 's developer , Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd. of Yardley , Pa. , to continue safety and efficacy testing .
The latest results , published in the medical journal Lancet , combined two international studies funded by Tibotec .
The study looked at patients who had failed to respond to at least three different kinds of AIDS drugs
All of the patients were given a standard drug regimen chosen by their doctors .
In addition , 110 patients were given 600 milligrams of darunavir boosted with 100 milligrams of the protease inhibitor ritonavir to increase effectiveness .
The drugs were taken twice a day .
The primary goal was to reduce the amount of virus in patients ' blood by a factor of 10 -- a key reduction that is known to lead to better survival .
After 48 weeks , 61 percent of patients in the darunavir group had achieved that .
About 15 percent of patients in the control group saw a similar decline .
Virus levels dropped to undetectable levels in most of the darunavir patients , according to the study .
Dr. Charles Farthing , one of the study 's authors and chief of medicine at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles , said that he was impressed with darunavir 's effect on a small subgroup of patients that had previously failed to respond to various drug therapy .
Among those patients , 20 percent saw their virus levels drop to the undetectable range .
" I was almost staggered , " Farthing said , adding that one patient who had failed to respond to five other drug regimens is now " fit as a fiddle . "
There appeared to be no significant difference in side effects between the darunavir and the other drug regimens , according to the study .
The researchers are now planning to investigate if darunavir also should be used for newly infected patients .
Who 's Counting : Hofstadter 's Strange Loops -- as Well as Colbert and Borat Book says our own reality is complicated and multilayered .
June 3 , 2007  --
Who are you ?
Douglas Hofstadter , the Pulitzer Prize - winning author of " Godel , Escher , Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid , " has just written a sequel to that much - acclaimed book in which he focuses on the nature of consciousness and self .
What does it mean to be conscious , to be self - aware ?
What is a self ?
What is an " I " ?
One reason it is so difficult to get a scientific handle on these questions is that we 're too close to them .
We can't employ the usual scientific technique of stripping away the subjective elements of a phenomenon to arrive at an objective account of it since it is the subjective elements we want to understand .
The gist of Hofstadter 's answer to these questions in " I Am a Strange Loop " is that the self and awareness are best understood by looking at higher - level patterns and structures made possible by the underlying biochemistry of our brains .
These patterns and structures are self - referential and emerge over time from complex neuronal activity .
What does this mean ?
One of the joys of Hofstadter 's book is that it is full of suggestive metaphors .
To hint at the unexpected consequences of even the simplest self - reference , for example , he considers a video camera aimed at a television monitor that shows its own output resulting , especially when the camera is moving , in a variety of hall - of - mirrors effects , some familiar , some not .
Careeniums and Simmballs
Another illuminating metaphor helps elucidate how symbolic thought emerges from lower - level neuronal buzz .
Hofstadter asks us to imagine a billiard table with countless small interacting magnetic marbles , or simms .
These simms careen around the table , leading Hofstadter to term it the careenium .
Sometimes these simms clump together magnetically and form spherical clusters of simms or simmballs .
The simms move around randomly , but these larger simmballs have trajectories that are partially determined by external forces to the careenium , and their movement thus begins to model conditions outside the careenium .
Substituting cranium for careenium , individual neurons for simms , and symbols for simmballs , we understand that these symbols and structures gradually reflect a more and more refined representation of the outside world .
Note that this awareness does not inhere in individual nerve cells but in the large - scale structures , the symbols , within the brain .
Symbols develop for all manner of entities including , at a sufficiently complex level of development , a symbol for an " I , " that is , a symbol that represents itself .
This symbol is aware of itself and of other objects , people , ideas , desires , fears , motivations , et cetera , but not of the neurons of which it 's composed .
The stories of our " I " symbols are the stories of our lives .
Strange Loops and Godel
This self - referential emergent loop that is the " I " symbol is indeed strange and abstract .
Hofstadter argues that neuronal commotion can give rise to high - level symbolic thought in something like the way that dry statements about numbers can be interpreted , via appropriately clever codings and other techniques , as high - level statements about provability , consistency and the like .
As Kurt Godel showed , statements about numbers have coded within them higher - level statements that " talk " about themselves and the arithmetic system of which they 're a part .
Likewise , a long developmental process has resulted in neuronal movements having coded within them higher - level symbolic patterns that " talk " about the world and themselves .
This self - reference and criss - crossing of levels is why we 're all strange loops , or , as Hofstadter also puts it , " hallucinations hallucinated by hallucinations . "
That 's the almost criminally abbreviated gist of this wonderful book , but there 's much more in " I Am a Strange Loop . "
Included are discussions of why these high - level mind patterns are not necessarily dependent on the particular physical stuff of the brain , of how identities can be distributed throughout several brains , of gradual self - construction and degrees of self - awareness , and of ways we model others in our minds and thus give them a pale sort of life within us .
Reflections in Humor and Popular Culture
This all may seem quite esoteric , but questions like these lie near the surface of popular culture from the virtual world of " Second Life " to the surreal world of television news .
I just read of a panel discussion held in Colorado , for example , whose subject was the number of levels of reality present if Stephen Colbert , anchor of the faux news " Colbert Report , " were to interview Sacha Baron Cohen , creator of the characters Borat and Ali G .
Colbert is , one senses , a very nice guy , but he is also a comedian who pretends to be a self - centered , overbearing blowhard of a television pundit .
Cohen is intelligent and thoughtful , but he is also a comedian pretending to be an ignorant , anti-Semitic homophobe .
We sit at home watching the interview and forming little ancillary " I " symbols in our minds for each of these men as well as for their ancillary sub " I " 's .
This self - referential tangle , being indefinitely extensible and recursive , leads to strange psychological effects , one being that the characters played by Colbert and Cohen can be more truthful in disguise than they can if they present themselves straight .
That we can understand these various levels and personas , their interaction , and analogies to other situations is testament to how natural are some of the seemingly abstract ideas in " I Am a Strange Loop . "
Humor , in particular , calls on our ability to model others ' personalities , understand their points of view , and stand outside ourselves .
Even the verbal and nonverbal cues ( raising an eyebrow , changing one 's tone of voice , winking ) that are present in joke - telling are somewhat paradoxical .
They say , in effect , " This is unreal , " and they are more or less equivalent to the classic " I am lying , " or , " This statement is false , " which is true if and only if it 's false .
Strange and loopy are we .

Resisting the binary blob
Last week , LWN pointed at a software review claiming that Fedora Core 6 was so bad that the whole distribution should simply be shut down .
The failing which led to such a dire prescription was a lack of proprietary software .
According to the reviewer :
I appreciate the fact that distributions like Fedora Core are still focused on free - as - in - rights software , but today 's Web content requires more proprietary browser plugins than yesterday 's did , and today 's hardware is increasingly designed to be dependent on proprietary binary blobs in the form of firmware and driver packages ...
Users do not want to hear reasons and excuses for why the operating environment does n't work with their favorite Web sites or computer hardware -- all they know is that it does n't work , and making it work is not a simple or obvious process .
This reviewer is not the only one to express this point of view ; there would appear to be a rising chorus out there calling on Linux distributors to load up their systems with proprietary code .
Some distributors have heeded this call , as witnessed by ( for example ) Ubuntu 's decision to include more binary drivers by default in its next release .
It 's not too hard to see where this pressure is coming from .
A prospective user with a problematic laptop will be happier with a distribution which " just works . "
Most of the people who truly care about free software are likely to be using a free system already , so it is easy to imagine that the next wave of users will be less concerned - at the outset - about software freedom .
So they will gravitate toward a system which does what they want to do ( running on closed hardware , playing patent - encumbered media , etc. ) without concerning themselves much about the provenance of the software they are using .
The fact that many of these users worry little about software freedom now does not mean that they will never care , however .
Very few of us were born knowing that free software is a better solution , that using free software is an important part of being free in general .
Just like most of us have learned , over time , that saving some of the money we earn , while perhaps being inconvenient in the short term , brings long - term benefits , we have also learned that using free software - and helping to improve that software - is better in the long term .
Certainly some subset of the new users coming to Linux will come to understand this fact as well .
But it will not matter how well these users understand the fine points of software freedom if , by the time they have figured it out , there are no free operating systems for them to run .
If we want free systems then , we have to build and use free systems now .
There can be a place for a binary blob which enables a specific bit of hardware to work ; your editor would argue that running such a blob is not an inherently immoral act .
But it is not necessarily a wise act , and a distribution which quietly installs such blobs on an unsuspecting user 's system in the name of " it just works " is not necessarily doing that user any favors .
As a thought experiment , consider how things might have gone if the Linux community had accepted the " just works ( most of the time ) " non-free Java implementation that Sun made available .
Linux distributors , rather than put large amounts of work into making Java code work with free alternatives , could have simply shipped Sun 's version .
Had they done so , would we have ( the promise of ) a GPL - licensed Java from Sun now ?
If we simply accept proprietary drivers in the name of " it just works , " when , exactly , do we think free drivers will become available ?
So criticism of Fedora - or any other distributor which sticks to free software principles - is , at best , misplaced .
There are proprietary systems out there for people who want to run them , but Linux is about free software .
It makes no sense to try to push proprietary code onto a distribution which has set a goal of being 100 % free , and it is silly to criticize such a distribution for containing only free software .
We should , instead , be appreciative of the vast amount of work that has gone into giving us a 100 % free system - and help to improve that system .
Along these lines , it becomes natural to wonder why the Free Software Foundation has not recognized the work done by the Fedora Project to make its distribution entirely free .
Instead , the FSF has put its energy into promoting obscure distributions like gNewSense and UTUTO .
It seems that the Fedora developers and the FSF have been talking about recognition for Fedora , resulting in the posting of this message from Richard Stallman .
It covers a number of issues , including firmware , fonts , patents , and more .
One sticking point , it would seem , is this :
We can certainly go through the [ Fedora packaging ] guidelines .
We have not yet done so , but we know of one problem in the current policy : it says that packages can be included which qualify as open source but not as free software .
In other words , not all packages need to meet the definition of free software .
Given the people involved with Fedora , and the work that has been done to eliminate packages with problematic licensing , your editor has no qualms in saying that Fedora is a truly free distribution .
It is unfortunate that the work which has gone into the creation of this distribution is not as widely recognized as it should be .
If we want to promote free software , and if we want to live in a world where we can use exclusively free software , we should not hesitate to acknowledge the work of those who have built free systems , and who have not given in to those pushing for the addition of proprietary code .
They are doing the work we so very much want to see done , and we are far richer for it .
During an official welcome ceremony on the White House lawn on Monday , Mr Bush stumbled over a line in his speech , initially saying the Queen had helped celebrate the US bicentennial in 1776 , rather than 1976 .
Realising his mistake , he winked broadly at the monarch before turning back to the assembled dignitaries to say : " She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child . "
At a formal dinner last night at the British ambassador 's residence in Washington , the Queen opened her speech with a toast to the US president .
Grinning playfully , she began : " I wondered whether I should start this toast by saying , ' When I was here in 1776 ... ' "
The guests , including Mr Bush , erupted in laughter .
In his own speech , the president responded : " Your Majesty , I ca n't top that one . "
Away from the mutual ribbing , and on the day devolved government returned to Northern Ireland , the Queen thanked Mr Bush for previous US efforts in helping to bring peace to the region .
A few hours after the dinner , the 81 - year - old monarch and Prince Philip flew home to Britain , ending the first state visit to the US for 16 years .
The six - day east coast tour also saw the Queen attend the Kentucky Derby and meet survivors of the Virginia Tech gun massacre .

In Iraq , the Sunni Association of Muslim Scholars is accusing the US military of carrying out a massacre during a pre-dawn raid in a small village Northeast of Baghdad .
The Association said the raid , which was carried out on Monday in Muqtadadiya , left five dead including an elderly man , a young man , and a forty - day - old baby .
The association ’s spokesman , Mothana al - Dhari :
“ What happened is that the American forces raided the house of Sheik Riyad al - Tiyah before sunrise .
They did n’t find the Sheik , but they found his brother and his family .
They were sleeping on the roof , escaping from the heat up the Summer .
[ The US military ] killed two brothers .
Her name was Tabarak and she was 40 days old .
They also killed two of the neighbors that looked from their roof next door to see what was happening in their neighbor ’s house and the Americans shot them and killed both of them . ”
The Pentagon has a different version of Monday ’s events .
In a press release datelined Baghdad , the Multinational Forces Iraq said the raid targeted a safe - house inhabited by people with ties to terrorist finances and foreign fighters .
“ As Coalition forces assaulted the target , they were immediately engaged by terrorist forces , ” the statement read .
“ In the ensuing firefight , two terrorists were killed Coalition forces found blasting caps , improvised explosive device materials , and multiple ammunition rack systems and weapons on the objective . ”
The military admitted one child was killed , but did not take responsibility for the death .
As with most cases , it ’s difficult to tell which side is telling the truth in this story .
The security situation around Baghdad is so dangerous ; no reporters have been able to visit the area to investigate .
Sarmad Abdul - Karem is the Director of Iraq4All News , which posted the Sunni Association ’s allegations on its website .
“ Everything you see in the news is mostly propoganda , ” he conceded .
“ There is a lot of hiding information and a lot of censorship .
We ca n’t keep up ! ”
Abdul - Karem said his office receives up to 150 reports a day of killings carried out by all sides .
For the most part , he “ just got tired and we stopped publishing them , ” he said .
Censorship seems to be on the rise in Iraq .
Two years ago , the Iraqi government banned al - Jazeera , the largest and most popular Arabic satellite news channel and yesterday the Iraqi Cabinet banned its main competitor  Dubai - based al - Arabiya for allegedly stoking the flames of sectarian conflict .
In addition , Joel Campagna of the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists said “ Working reporters have repeatedly been detained at the hands of the US military and Iraqi security forces .
There are also efforts by local authorities to use the courts to punish outspoken independent journalists .
There was a case just last week where two reporters were jailed for 10 years for allegedly insulting a former governor . ”
In such an environment , Mothana al - Dhari of the Sunni Association of Muslim Scholars is concerned important humanitarian stories are being ignored .
“ It can be difficult getting to the places where incidents occur , ” he said .
“ That makes journalists comfortable taking quotes from the occupation forces .
But there are so many ( massacres by US forces ) and you can believe from these incidents that it ’s a pattern of action of the occupation .
It ’s not just an accident . ”

Last year I spent a ton of time working with “ Avalon ” , now known as Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) .
I wrote about this on my blog under the title Avalon Adventures .
With a lot of time , sweat and help from folks at Microsoft I managed to build a rudimentary data entry application .
The focus of my research was to see if Avalon was capable of building applications for line of business .
I came to the conclusion that Avalon still needed a lot of work .
I wrote up my conclusions under a blog entry called “ Avalon Adventures :
The good , bad and ugly ” .
http://blogs.officezealot.com/rod/archive/2005/01/18/3885.aspx
This winter / spring I did a number of presentations in Canada to demonstrate how to use WPF for creating line of business applications .
The experience this time went much smoother for a number of reasons which I will illustrate below .
I also had some similar experience in the bad and ugly departments as well .
The Good
More Controls Now
Over the last year a number of new controls were added to WPF .
Menus , progress bars , tree views , rich text editing .
This is definitely a positive direction .
Overall the mix of controls is getting richer with each version .
It will take a long time before the collection of controls is on par with what we have in Windows forms but the story is definitely getting better ..
XAML Markup
XAML as a UI Markup Language is really cool .
The more and more I work with XAML I find its mechanisms for specifying UI very nice .
It is very easy to follow how a form is intended to be laid out .
Windows Forms should have done this from day one .
XAML has some flaws in that it has the potential to become mind numbingly complex and I am not 100 % how this stuff will be “ debuggable ”
Styles Rock
In this last round of my experimentation I fell in love with the concept of applying < Style > tags .
The cool thing is that < Style > tags allow you to specify the look and feel for all components in your application .
You can specify the color , font , font attributes , etc at the highest level of the application .
The most interesting aspect of this is that these specifications occur at the Type level .
Meaning you can specify that all objects that inherits from the Control class have specific attributes .
WPF Books Now On Sale
Publishers have released some good books on WPF .
One of the better ones I have used is Programming Windows Presentation Foundation by Chris Sells and Ian Griffiths .
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596101139/sr=8-2/qid=1147036056/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-5182252-4199047?%5Fencoding=UTF8
There is also a new book in the works from Charles Petzold .
You can follow his progress in creating his book at
http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/blog.xml
There is one caveat about the currently shipping set of books .
The ones I have read are out of date in a number of areas .
The XAML specification is rather fluid and a number of sections of these books are simply incorrect .
I know like Chris Sells provide errata on his blog ( www.sellsbrothers.com).
Data Binding Still Rocks
I still love the very granular control of Data Binding in WPF .
Pretty much every control in WPF has a property called DataContext .
You use this project to attach data to your individual controls .
This data can be XML , ADO.
NET DataSets or custom objects .
You are also not limited to one type of data for your form .
One control can be bound to an ADO .
Net dataset while another can be bound to an object .
3rd Party Market
There is a small 3rd party market now .
At the last PDC we saw controls from Infragistics that solve the problem of a missing grid control ( more on that later ) .
I expect that Infragistics , Component One , Developers Express and other vendors are hard at work on there WPF control sets .
There is also a product called Aurora from www.mobiform .
Aurora is a very nice XAML design tool .
VB.NET Citizenship
Being a VB.NET MVP one complaint I had was the lack of constructs familiar to VB.NET developers .
One item that I really like about VB.NET is the Handles statement .
This statement allows you to attach an event to a subroutine .
This feature has been implemented .
Thanks WPF team for that .
The Bad
Manual XAML Coding Required
Out of the box you are still required to hand code your XAML .
Cider ( discussed below ) is a weak tool for doing layout and provides very limited control of your XAML form development .
Aurora ( mentioned above and below ) is a better tool than MSFT ’s offering .
Weak Background Compilation of XAML
When you manually code your XAML your controls do n’t consistently show up in the code behind .
In other words if you add the following control < TextBox ID = ” txtLastNane ” > you wo n’t see this object in code behind files Intellisense until you manually compile your code .
XAML Specification Fluidity
The specification and underlying technologies for WPF and XAML seem to be very fluid in nature .
Every version contains breaking changes .
This is to be expected in a brand new technology like WPF .
But at some time this needs to slow down .
Still I feel the spec needs more revision at this point .
XAML is inconsistent in a number of areas and needs more work to improve consistency .
XAML Inconsistencies
One of the goals of .NET was to add some level of consistency .
All classes inherit from objects , have a ToString method , have a GetType method , etc. UI elements in WinForms have a Text element rather than one having a Text element and another having a Caption element ( as we faced in VB6 ) .
This same careful attention to detail missed the XAML team .
For instance :
< Button > Hello World </ Button >
< Menu >
< MenuItem Header= ’ Rodman ’/>
</ Menu >
Why do these two elements have greatly different markup for a common task .
Either the < Button > element needs to have a Text attribute or the < MenuItem > element needs to support markup similar to the < Button > element .
I think MSFT needs to look at this before they ship .
Stale Blog Code
There has been a lot of work on WPF by numerous bloggers .
When you Google stuff on WPF you often come across Blog entries written for old versions of WPF .
Because of the fluidity of the XAML spec these are often grossly out of date .
I am guilty of this as well .
I know for a fact none of my old blog entries will work with current versions of WPF .
This is not the fault of the teams at MSFT just a statement of warning about old examples .
Maybe we as bloggers should tag our articles on what version of WPF ( or other technology ) they will still work with .
The Ugly
Weak Flavored Cider
Cider at this point ( based on the Feb 2006 CTP ) is just plain weak .
Cider is the code name for the WPF tools that integrate with Visual Studio 2005 .
Basically all Cider provides at this point is a mechanism for dragging and dropping controls onto a WPF form .
It has some rudimentary control over properties but thats about it .
This tool needs lots of work .
I would n’t even go as far as calling this tool Alpha .
Microsoft needs to reconsider putting tools out that are in this early stage of development .
FWIW there is a pretty cool UI designer tool called Aurora .
Aurora is from a company called Mobiform and can be found at www.mobiform.com.
From what I can tell Aurora is written in WPF .
It is hands above better than Cider .
CAVEAT : I have not played with Sparkle which is a standalone XAML / WPF editor .
I am looking at this from the developers standpoint and the tools that work in VS .
NET .
From what I have read / seen about Sparkle this technology looks pretty cool .
But it is geared much more for designers and not developers .
Documentation is Still Lacking
It is really frustrating to work with a new technology that is so poorly documented .
This has been the case in the software industry for decades and I am not sure if it will ever change .
In my opinion every class and its properties , events and methods should be documented with an example .
I ca n’t understand how a company that has a specification process as good as Microsoft can keep churning out documentation that is so poor .
MSFT is in the business of building tools for developers they should explain how to use them .
Every specification should include an example of a properties use .
These examples should change as the specification changes .
Automated tools could then extract these examples from the specifications .
This is much like XML comments in classes in .NET .
XAML is Difficult / Impossible to Debug
The compiler for XAML needs to come up with useful errors telling developers what is clearly wrong with there markup .
XML namespace mismatch errors are insufficient .
The XAML team needs to take a look at the VB helper technology that looks at an error and does its best to suggest a proper fix to a problem .
Missing Grid Component
Sill ugly and MIA from all releases so far .
This is still the most obviously missing component .
The reaction from developers is always the same when I point out this short coming ….
WHAT !?!?!?!?!?!
How could they have missed that one ?
Is WPF Ready for Prime Time ?
In this authors opinion no .
WPF as a technology has a number of really cool features .
The Good section of this post is sure getting “ Gooder ” ( Thanks Mr Bush J ) .
But this technology still has a ways to go .
I think some of the shortcomings will limit its adoption by mainstream developers for some time .
The developer tools story needs to improve greatly .
Debugging needs more work .
WPF is definitely a 1.0 version and I feel its adoption will happen when its 2.0 version releases .
The story , of course , is election fraud .
Gaming the electoral system from the inside .
To unfairly favor republicans .
Favors and promotions for those who go along .
Demotions , firings and blacklisting of those who do n’t .
Nonexistent charges of voter fraud and threats or coercion for these charges to be investigated .
Illegal redistricting .
Petty lawsuits against the Voting Rights Act. Voter ID laws that border on illegal , if not overtly illegal .
Conflict of interest between party " reelection officials " and Secretary ( ies ) of State .
Get accustomed to hearing about it , prepare yourself to say it .
And not just things that can be dismissed such as exit poll discrepancies or hackable voting machines .
The real deal .
The whole enchilada .
It does n’t get any lower than this .
Using any means necessary to get and remain in power .
I first mentioned it a couple of weeks ago , and then again in much more detail last week .
And even since last week , there has been a detailed piece from ePluribus Media on the DOJ ’s Voting Rights Section ’s Special Litigation Counsel Robert Popper and his major conflicts of interest with respect to voting rights , the Help America Vote Act and the Voting Rights Act .
There has been an article by McClatchy about Hans Von Spakovsky and his connection to voter ID laws , his attempts to influence the federal Election Assistance Commission 's research into the dimensions of voter fraud nationally and the impact of restrictive voter ID laws - research that could undermine a vote - suppression agenda , as well as other actions and campaigns to suppress voter rights of minorities .
Oh , by the way , Hans Von Spakovsky was a civil rights lawyer in the Justice Department and a recess appointment to the Federal Elections Commission .
And that is in just three days .
Who knows what the rest of this week will bring in terms of surprises .
There is still talk about the US Attorney purge being " political " .
And even though that is , on the most basic level , true – it goes way way beyond that .
To describe it as mere politics is to justify it as sleazy but legal .
However , to describe it as it is blatant and concerted actions to promote those who helped and punish those who hindered efforts to suppress minority votes or influence the election in favor of republicans is more powerful , more truthful – and more scary .
The evidence is mounting at a furious pace .
We have someone ( Von Spakovsky ) who is linked to voter suppression efforts within the republican party not only put in a position as a civil rights lawyer at the Justice Department , but on the goddamn Federal Elections Commission .
You have Robert Popper – an attorney with a notorious and detailed history of bringing ( many times baseless ) lawsuits in order to target minority voters and districts as the Voting Rights Section ’s Special Litigation Counsel .
You have little to no cases or investigations into voter suppression since 2001 , yet numerous suits and investigations into voter rolls that were n’t properly purged .
You have Tim Griffin , a man who was responsible at the Republican National Committee for " caging " activities that suppressed minority voters who were stationed in Iraq , which he is currently under investigation for , promoted ( at Karl Rove ’s request and hidden from Congressional investigations ) to US Attorney .
You have not one , not two , not three but at least four US attorneys OTHER THAN GRIFFIN whose jobs depended on whether they brought charges of voter fraud or charges in general against Democrats close to Election Day 2006 .
You have the White House itself - the Big Cheese , home of both " the Decider " AND " Commander Guy " – including Karl Rove ’s office AND Alberto Gonzales ’ office discussing the desire to pursue voter fraud cases against Democrats in New Mexico , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania a mere few weeks before the 2006 elections .
It goes back even further than this .
Phone jamming in NH tied to Abramoff , the NH Republican Party and Tom DeLay .
Redistricting in TX in between census periods and violations relating to the redistricting .
Voting machines that were used even after they were decertified as unsafe .
Willful acts to destroy and disqualify Democratic voter registration cards and applications – by the Secretary of State of the state that " swung " the 2004 election , by voter registration groups associated with the republican party .
Thousands – tens of thousands purged from voter rolls in Georgia , Florida and other states .
None of this being investigated .
Who knows how many votes were cast but not counted .
I have heard numbers that were in the millions , but I ca n’t vouch for the accuracy of these numbers .
Who knows how many people did not get the chance to vote because of being purged , suppressed or illegally challenged by republican party operatives ?
Again , none of this investigated .
We do know one thing .
A very strong pattern has emerged and continues to emerge .
A pattern that touches state republican party officials , national republican party officials , the Justice Department , the White House , Congress , and the very groups whose purpose is the HELP voting rights and ensure that all votes are counted – the Voting Rights Section , the Civil Rights Section , the Federal Elections Commission .
All of this done by design .
By the republican party .
At all levels .
It is a simple story to tell , as ugly and complicated as it is to untangle .
The republican party has used its power to undermine and suppress the votes of those most likely to vote Democratic in order to keep power .
It should spell doom for the republican party for decades to come .
Is anyone brave enough to call a duck a duck , take this story and give it the exposure it deserves ?

（子供の名前）が行方不明になってしまいました。
３月８日から全く消息が摘めない状態です。
捜索願も出しましたが警察は何かないと動いてくれないでしょう
名前：＊＊＊＊＊ ＊
年齢：一歳十一ヶ月 （４月２６日産まれ）
住所：横浜市戸塚区 消息を絶ったのは横浜市瀬谷区で す
服装：トーマスの靴を履いていました。
特徴：車が大好きでミニカーをいつも持っています。
お腹の左側に大きな蒙古汎があります。 父親として情けないのですがこの程度の情報しかありません。

少しでも多くの人間に協力していただき
少しでも早く（こどもの名前）を無事に保護したいです。
協力お願いします。お願いします。

（父親の名前） 当時、ワシ は「 TERRAZI とゆかいな仲間たち」っていうニュースサイトをやってて、
でもね、なんか違和感があった。2歳児なら自分から家出することもないわけで、警察が動かないのは不自然だし、誘拐なら下手に情報を公開するのはよくない。だから電話でいたずらではなく本人のものであることだけを確認した後、次の記事を出した。 当時、ワシは「 TERRAZIとゆかいな仲間たち」っていうニュースサイトをやってて、 掲示 板に上のが投稿された。他のニュースサイト管理人からも「てらじさんも協力して下さい！」って夜中なのに電話までかかってきたり。そりゃあもう大騒ぎだったのさ。でもね、なんか違和感があった。2歳児なら自分から家出することもないわけで、警察が動かないのは不自然だし、誘拐なら下手に情報を公開するのはよくない。だから電話でいたずらではなく本人のものであることだけを確認した後、次の記事を出した。
行方不明の男児の情報を求めたサイトを紹介しないことについて
横浜市で行方不明だという、2才男児の情報を求めたサイトが、各方面で話題になっています。そのほとんどが捜索に協力しようと、リンクを張ったり、各サイトにリンクを張るよう呼びかけたモノです。こうした善意の輪が広がることは素晴らしいことだと思います。
ですが、このサイトに書いてある内容は「３月８日から全く消息が摘めない状態です。捜索願も出しましたが警察は何かないと動いてくれないでしょう」ということだけで、「行方不明」が単なる「迷子」のようなものか、「誘拐」のような犯罪に巻き込まれたものなのか、全く判断出来ません。
もし、警察やマスコミが動かないのが、「動けない」、たとえば誘拐事件における「報道協定」のような状態としたら、このことを安易に広めることは、警察の捜査を妨害してしまうことになりかねません。
当サイトでは、このような生死に関わる出来事を、事実関係を確認しないまま安易に紹介することはできないと判断しました。そのため、BBSに書き込まれたリンクもいったん削除しました。このことを了解下さい。事実関係が明らかになり、紹介した方がよい状態になりましたら、あらためて紹介するつもりです。
最後になりましたが、行方不明の男児が無事保護されることを、心より願っています。

全く掴めない状態です。妻と一緒にいると考えるのが通常なのでしょうが
一週間以上どこにも連絡なしで行方不明で心配しています。
ただの家出かも知れないと思って一週間ほって置きましたが、
当日も別段変わった様子もなく家出にしては不自然な部分も多くあり
何かの事件にでも巻き込まれてるんではないかとＨＰで
皆さんに協力を求めたしだいです。
９９．９％家出だとしても０．１％でも事件性があるのであれば
全力で探し出してあげたい
何かあってからでは手遅れなので皆さんに呼びかけてます。

（ 3/16 追記） 該当サイトに追加情報がアップされました。行方不明の男児と同時に母親もいなくなったそうです。つまり「母親がこどもを連れて家出した」という可能性が大きいということです。しかし父親は「９９．９％家出だとしても０．１％でも事件性があるのであれば全力で探し出してあげたい。何かあってからでは手遅れなので皆さんに呼びかけてます。」と言っています。
私はその0.1%に、ネットで大騒ぎになっているのを犯人が見て、早まってしまうかもしれない可能性を考えました。だからやはり紹介することはできません。
一夜のうちにネット世論は、 「 気の毒なお父さんのためにみんなで息子さんを探そう！」から、「電波系な父親からみんなで息子さんとお母さんを守ろう！」と変わっています。彼の知人のサイトは次々と閉鎖や休止や掲示板閉鎖という状態になり、同情してこの出来事を紹介しリンクを張っていたサイトも、リンクを外したり、失望と非難の声をあげたりしています。
私の周辺も最初はとても心配し、本人に電話までしました。だが故に裏切られたような感情を隠すことは正直出来ません。「こんなヤツは晒しあげてしまえ！」という声も強くあります。しかしこのサイトには、おそらくはなんの罪もない、２歳の男の子のかわいらしい笑顔の写真が大きく貼ってあります。晒しあげて一番傷つくのは一体誰なのでしょうか？
この夫婦の間になにがあったのかはわかりません。しかし、このようなことをして最も傷ついてしまうのは、他の誰でもない最愛の息子であることに、早く気がついて欲しいと強く思います。 （て） これに対しての読者の反応↓ おやじ：カバチタレでもあったテーマですねぇ…＜ドラマ

Researchers have found that when households take possession of a car the time they spend walking falls from an average of nearly two hours to less than one hour a week .
Experts are still arguing over what is generating Britain 's growing obesity crisis - more food or less exercise ?
The report from the Institute for European Environmental Policy claims to show that the main cause is falling activity levels - and the biggest culprit is not less time spent at the gym or playing sport , but simply walking around less .
' We 're not saying that a decline in walking is totally responsible for the rise in obesity , but the evidence points to the fact that it's a decline in physical activity that is the major determinant , and it's a replacement of walking by car use which is the main determinant [ of that ] , ' said Adrian Davis , an expert in health and transport policy and one of the authors of the report .
The researchers found that since the mid-Seventies the proportion of households without a car has halved , from 41 per cent to 19 per cent .
At the same time the average time an adult spends walking has fallen from 87 hours to 67 hours a year , while time spent driving has risen from 91 to 151 hours .
Based on these figures , the report calculates that the average adult burns 26 fewer calories a day - leading to an average weight gain of 2lb 11 oz each year .
The study is part of an attempt to link health issues with the environmental pollution caused by motoring , and to encourage ministers to tackle both by promoting more walking .
The institute is calling for towns and cities to be made more pedestrian - friendly , for example by making pavements wider and improving street lighting .
The study will further fuel the debate over the causes of obesity , which is linked to heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
It cites previous studies claiming that British people are not consuming many more calories than a generation ago , so lower activity levels must be to blame .
However , Tim Marsh , associate director of the National Heart Forum , said other evidence suggested that people were eating more - by snacking , rather than at mealtimes - but were ' under reporting ' how much they consumed .
This argument was boosted last week by a study from the Medical Research Council , which claimed that fatter people were more likely to underestimate their consumption .
' You have to do an awful lot of walking to burn off the calories , ' added Marsh .
Healthy steps
An hour 's brisk walking will burn off ...

2007-08-15 15:39:00 PDT
SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco International Airport is poised to open a new fast - pass program that will help registered passengers avoid lines at security checkpoints , Mayor Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday during an unveiling at the airport .
The program , named Clear , will begin in the next few weeks , although enrollment at the airport began Tuesday .
Clear has been operating at Mineta San Jose International Airport since January .
The program , offered by the company Verified Identity Pass , requires passengers who enroll to submit to an in - depth background check , provide hand or eye retina scans and pay a $ 99.95 annual fee .
In return , registered passengers get an identity card containing their encrypted fingerprint or iris images that allows them access to a separate line through security checkpoints .
Passengers will still have to be checked by security screeners but will circumvent any line at the standard checkpoint , airport spokesman Michael McCarron said .
" Right now , our average wait time is from five to seven minutes , " McCarron said .
" For people who participate in the Clear program , it will be a lot less than that . "
Clear 's enrollment stations at SFO are located in domestic Terminals One and Three , and in the downtown Hyatt Regency .
Clear will expand enrollment to the International Terminal in the fall .
Travelers can begin the enrollment process online at : www.flyclear.com
“ FUD ” Has Become Meaningless
It ’s Time to Drop an Over-used Word by Kai MacTane
Once upon a time , the term “ FUD ” meant something .
Journalists writing for IT - oriented publications like Information Week and Wired got used to writing little explations like “ ‘ FUD ’ stands for ‘ fear , uncertainty , and doubt ’ ” every time a source used the term in a quote .
But somewhere along the way , throngs of unthinking Slashdotters and open - source partisans killed the term .
By abusing it to mean “ any pronouncement about technology that I disagree with ” , they ’ve rendered it almost completely meaningless .
The word now means whatever its user wants it to mean , and might as well be abandoned .
The History of “ FUD ”
It dates all the way back to the days when IBM was the biggest player in the mainframe market , when IBM ’s marketing people would warn prospective buyers of the plethora of unfortunate things that befell people who were rash enough to buy competing products from companies like Amdahl .
Phrases like “ nobody ever got fired for buying IBM ” subtly implied that people did , indeed , get fired for buying Amdahl ( or , later , DEC ) .
Instead of looking at the technical merits of the products , they played on people ’s insecurities .
In a lot of ways , FUD is like the Erisian “ witnessing technique ” suggested in the Principia Discordia : — from “ A Primer for Erisian Evangelists ” “ If [ your target ] , wonder of wonders , still remains obstinate , then finally ... [ warn him ] that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip .
Then put him on your mailing list . ”
Of course , the Principia ’s writers were being satirical .
But IBM ’s FUD techniques were effectively the IT world ’s equivalent of the fear - mongering evangelical style the Principia was lampooning .
In short , saying “ this stuff is FUD ” used to be a shorthand way of saying “ This stuff is n’t just false , it ’s deliberately misleading , in a way that ’s designed to play on people ’s anxieties in order to keep them supporting the market leader .
It ’s not just factually incorrect ; it ’s a deliberate lie being used as a business tactic . ”
It does n’t mean that any more .
Thanks to relentless over - use and even outright abuse by legions of F / OSS fanboys , “ FUD ” now means little more than “ You poopy - head !
Shut up ! ”
It ’s like saying someone is “ helping the terrorists ” or just plain “ un - American ” ; the modern - day equivalent of calling someone a communist .
It ’s not a real word with actual meaning .
Consider the following examples of live usage in 2006 :
Do n’t Criticize Ruby
Joel Spolsky , in the course of answering a question about enterprise - level Web framework platforms , mentions his honest impression of Ruby : it ’s slow , and not mature enough to bet your entire business on .
Though Spolsky can’t possibly benefit ( or be harmed ) by a downturn ( or an upturn ) in Ruby or Rails adoption , Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson calls Joel ’s post “ one of the purest forms of FUD I ’ve ever seen ” , mistaking one writer ’s admission that he has some fears , uncertainties , and doubts for a marketing division ’s attempts to instill those emotions .
( It ’s interesting to note , way down in the comments , Des Traynor ’s cogent rebuttal to Hansson , and the way it stands out from the Rails fans ’ groupthink . )
Still , Hansson ’s misuse of “ FUD ” is at least somewhat defensible —
Spolsky does admit to feeling those emotions , even if there ’s nothing tactical about it .
Other writers bend the word even further .
Still dealing with the Ruby world , one blogger promoting automated code testing mentions that “ One of the common complaints and FUD mentioned about Ruby and Rails is non-existent or weak support for debugging ” .
So , we once again have a Ruby fan effectively claiming that if programmers have critiques of a programming language , and voice them publicly ( perhaps in the hope that their concerns will be addressed in the next version ) , it 's tantamount to a strategic assault on that language .
Imagine if Niklaus Wirth had reacted with such petulance when Brian Kernighan criticized Pascal .
Instead , he took many of the criticisms to heart in designing his later languages , and in 2002 wrote that he was convinced “ that its successors Modula and Oberon are much more mature and refined designs than Pascal .
They form a family , and each descendant profited from experiences with its ancestors . ”
Do n’t Criticize Wikipedia , Either
Then there ’s Brian Meidell , who writes that “ [ t ] here has been a lot of FUD about whether [ W ] ikipedia is a bad thing , and how contents on a wiki ca n’t be trusted because it ’s publicly editable . ”
Well , yes , people have been publicly questioning the accuracy and trustworthiness of user - editable resources .
Before people decide to trust Wikipedia like Jimbo Wales wants us to , we want to kick the tires first .
Testing something out is good common sense , not FUD .
Beyond the Edge of FUD
In a blog entry questioning why the indigenous Chilean tribe known as the Mapuche felt the need to sue Microsoft for releasing a version of Windows localized in their language , the writer asks , “ Is this just about anti-Microsoft FUD , or is there a problem with the resulting product ? ”
It ’s unclear what “ anti-Microsoft FUD ” is supposed to refer to in this instance :
The way people like to sue large and well - financed corporate targets , hoping to collect some of that money for themselves ?
The fact that lots of people love to hate Microsoft and complain about them frequently ?
Seriously , where ’s the FUD ?
Finally there ’s Armin Wallrab , who takes issue with IBM ’s critique of Sun ’s choice of open - source license for Java , claiming that “ IBM still seems to fight in the cold war and pulls the old ( but well known ) strategy ‘ fear , uncertainty and doubt ’ — FUD . ” But in the article he links to and is commenting on , it ’s hard to find IBM promoting any of those three things .
Instead , IBM simply says that they ’ve already told Sun they think the Apache License would have been a better choice , and they have n’t changed their mind about that .
Much like the Ruby partisans , in Wallrab ’s world the mere act of voicing disagreement or difference of opinion is equated with “ spreading FUD ” .
It ’s interesting to note that Wallrab is a Sun employee — perhaps some IBMer could consider Wallrab ’s disapproval of IBM ’s critique to also be FUD ?
After all , what ’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander .
With such a wide and fluid definition , anything can be FUD .
The term has become completely meaningless , and might as well just be dropped entirely .
It ’s dead , Jim .
And you know what ?
I think that ’s a good thing .
Without “ FUD ” available as a generic snarl word , people will have to actually point out real flaws in each other ’s arguments , instead of just calling them silly names .

Nice article on security theater from Government Executive :
John Mueller suspects he might have become cable news programs ’ go - to foil on terrorism .
The author of Overblown : How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats , and Why We Believe Them ( Free Press , 2006 ) thinks America has overreacted .
The greatly exaggerated threat of terrorism , he says , has cost the country far more than terrorist attacks ever did .
Watching his Sept. 12 , 2006 , appearance on Fox & Friends is unintentionally hilarious .
Mueller calmly and politely asks the hosts to at least consider his thesis .
But filled with alarm and urgency , they appear bewildered and exasperated .
They speak to Mueller as if he is from another planet and cannot be reasoned with .
That reaction is one measure of the contagion of alarmism .
Mueller ’s book is filled with statistics meant to put terrorism in context .
For example , international terrorism annually causes the same number of deaths as drowning in bathtubs or bee stings .
It would take a repeat of Sept. 11 every month of the year to make flying as dangerous as driving .
Over a lifetime , the chance of being killed by a terrorist is about the same as being struck by a meteor .
Mueller ’s conclusions :
An American ’s risk of dying at the hands of a terrorist is microscopic .
The likelihood of another Sept. 11 - style attack is nearly nil because it would lack the element of surprise .
America can easily absorb the damage from most conceivable attacks .
And the suggestion that al Qaeda poses an existential threat to the United States is ridiculous .
Mueller ’s statistics and conclusions are jarring only because they so starkly contradict the widely disseminated and broadly accepted image of terrorism as an urgent and all - encompassing threat .
American reaction to two failed attacks in Britain in June further illustrates our national hysteria .
British police found and defused two car bombs before they could be detonated , and two would - be bombers rammed their car into a terminal at Glasgow Airport .
Even though no bystanders were hurt and British authorities labeled both episodes failures , the response on American cable television and Capitol Hill was frenzied , frequently emphasizing how many people could have been killed .
“ The discovery of a deadly car bomb in London today is another harsh reminder that we are in a war against an enemy that will target us anywhere and everywhere , ” read an e-mailed statement from Sen.
Joe Lieberman , I - Conn .
“ Terrorism is not just a threat .
It is a reality , and we must confront and defeat it . ”
The bombs that never detonated were “ deadly . ”
Terrorists are “ anywhere and everywhere . ”
Even those who believe it is a threat are understating ; it ’s “ more than a threat . ”
Mueller , an Ohio State University political science professor , is more analytical than shrill .
Politicians are being politicians , and security businesses are being security businesses , he says .
“ It ’s just like selling insurance – you say , ‘ Your house could burn down . ’
You do n’t have an incentive to say , ‘ Your house will never burn down . ’
And you ’re not lying , ” he says .
Social science research suggests that humans tend to glom onto the most alarmist perspective even if they are told how unlikely it is , he adds .
We inflate the danger of things we do n’t control and exaggerate the risk of spectacular events while downplaying the likelihood of common ones .
We are more afraid of terrorism than car accidents or street crime , even though the latter are far more common .
Statistical outliers like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are viewed not as anomalies , but as harbingers of what ’s to come .
Sen . George Allen was the unintentional creator of the Macaca moment -- and it sank him .
GOP issues rules to avoid Macaca moments
The Macaca moment has morphed into an official learning tool for the Republican establishment .
Advertisement
It 's right there , on pages 18 and 22 of an Internet guide from the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee that its chairman , Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , hopes will become scripture for the 2008 candidates .
Always assume you 're being recorded , and always record your opponent .
The blogs -- oh , scratch that -- the Republican blogs are your friends , so use them for rapid response in good times and bad .
" The paradigmatic example of failure to do so is the ' macaca ' moment , " reads the guidebook ( excerpted here ) , referring to a remark last year by former Sen. George Allen ( R - Va. ) that was captured on video and sunk his reelection campaign .
And btw , the mainstream media are so , uh , 2006 .
The first stop for press secretaries , according to the guidebook , should be bloggers who can create " buzz " and inevitably trigger stories in the drippy MSM .
The guidebook , 39 pages long and distributed last week to GOP Senate campaigns , underscores attempts by Republicans to level the Web - based playing field after Democrats , in Ensign 's view , leveraged their Internet savvy into electoral wins .
Republicans remain almost haunted by their 2006 missteps , particularly the way the macaca incident exposed chasms in their new media campaign strategy .
" It is critical that Republicans not let Democrats continue the edge , " Ensign said .
" They have had an edge on us . "
The NRSC has hired two press secretaries for blogger outreach , and an in - house Web designer and video producer to assist campaigns .
The committee also built a production studio in its basement for candidates to cut Web ads and trained campaign aides .
" Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , " said Matthew Miller , spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
" I 'm glad the NRSC discovered the Internet in 2007 . "
Miller said the committee hired an online communications director two years ago , and has been training Senate candidates for months on Web strategy .
" This is n't new for us , " he said .
So you do n't have to , we combed the Republican guide book to write up this truncated guide to the strategies that will shape the GOP 's 2008 Senate campaigns :
Live on film .
This is perhaps the single biggest lesson learned from 2006 .
Video -- and the ease with which it 's distributed , usually via YouTube -- can be a candidate 's greatest friend , or foe .
" Every campaign should film their candidate and record his / her every move at any event that is open to the public , " the guide states .
" Campaigns should also remind their candidate that they should assume there is a camera on them at all times and act accordingly .
It is also recommended that campaigns film their opponents ' public events as well . "
Not only that , candidates must appear in videos on their websites .
They need to talk about issues .
They need to make personal appeals for money ( " Not only are supporters often more inclined to give if they are urged do so by the candidate , but a video placed right on the donation page often increases the amount they give . " ) .
They need to go Oprah - style and get personal in a video blog , or vlog .
Do n't be antisocial .
Yes , that crazy thing the kids are doing these days -- posting their life details on social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook -- can be good for candidates , too .
The NRSC calls it " the next big thing in politics . "
So candidates need to step to it and start talking about their favorite ice cream flavors and such .
Will TMI ( too much information ) be MIA in 2008 ?
Open the campaign checkbook .
Hire at least one staff member , but hopefully three , to lasso the wild Web .
Basically , the Internet can't be a payroll afterthought .
Campaigns must have people who constantly update the website , manage postings on YouTube and MySpace , and monitor the hundreds , if not thousands , of chattering bloggers .
Remember the top blog dogs .
Speaking of which , get in good with five of the best - read national conservative bloggers .
The guide names names : Instapundit , Michelle Malkin , Captain 's Quarters , Power Line and Hugh Hewitt .
Do the same locally .
Do an interview with " one friendly blogger , " and interest from other local bloggers should follow .
Make blogs your first point of contact .
It used to be that campaigns checked in with newspaper reporters , then everybody else .
Now , friendly blogs should be the first point of contact .
( The NRSC bumped the mainstream media to step eight on its nine - step plan for communicating the campaign 's message to the public . )
The non-friendly blogs , i.e. " hostile , liberal blogs , " should never be engaged directly by campaigns .
" Doing so only legitimizes them , " the guide states .
Leave that up to surrogates .
Instead , monitor the critical sites for inaccuracies that can be " useful down the road to delegitimize these blogs as a source for reliable information to the mainstream media . "
But really , bloggers are no different from the MSM .
OK , so maybe they have at least two things in common :
They both like scoops and feeling special .
" Bloggers , particular national bloggers who 've developed a reputation , have no interest in being BCC'd on a press release , " the guide states .
" They do , however , eagerly desire inside information about rapidly developing storylines of interest to their audiences .
Personalized attention is important .
Quick , personal response to any questions or concerns they may have about the information that you give them is also important . "
Blogs are your canary .
Treat them " as an ' early warning system ' to help discern if an opponent 's attacks are gaining traction , " the guide reads , using Allen 's campaign as an example .
" Conservative blogs , who had long been lauding Sen. George Allen , were annoyed by shifting justifications and turned on Allen with a vengeance .
Sen .
Allen was never able to regain his status with bloggers , many of whom , at the time , were still touting Allen for President . "
Blog yourself .
They are an essential tool , the guide states , to thank donors and update supporters on the campaign .
The NRSC , however , could serve as a cautionary tale .
It recently tried something different on its blog , removing the veneer of party unity and giving voice to critics of the Senate 's bipartisan immigration bill .
It caused a stir , and the site is no longer available .
An NRSC spokeswoman said the site " was never fully launched . ''
One last thing :
Do n't get sued .
There are copyrights , trademarks and privacy laws .
Be careful , give credit and pay the fees to use a photo .
It 's worth it to do so , the guide states , " rather than taking the chance of defending your actions in court . "

Editor 's note : Roland Martin is a CNN contributor and talk - show host on WVON - AM in Chicago , Illinois .
He is the author of " Listening to the Spirit Within : 50 Perspectives on Faith . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
When did it come to the point that being a Christian meant caring about only two issues , ­ abortion and homosexuality ?
Ask the nonreligious what being a Christian today means , and based on what we see and read , it 's a good bet they will say that followers of Jesus Christ are preoccupied with those two points .
Poverty ?
Whatever .
Homelessness ?
An afterthought .
A widening gap between the have and have - nots ?
Immaterial .
Divorce ?
The divorce rate of Christians mirrors the national average , so that 's no big deal .
The point is that being a Christian should be about more than abortion and homosexuality , and it's high time that those not considered a part of the religious right expose the hypocrisy of our brothers and sisters in Christianity and take back the faith .
And those on the left who believe they have a " get out of sin free " card must not be allowed to justify their actions .
Many people believe we are engaged in a holy war .
And we are .
But it 's not with Muslims .
The real war -- ­ the silent war ­-- is being engaged among Christians , and that 's what we must set our sights on .
As we celebrate Holy Week , our focus is on the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ .
But are n't we also to recommit ourselves to live more like Jesus ?
Did Jesus spend his time focusing on all that he did n't like , or did Jesus raise the consciousness of the people to understand love , compassion and teach them about following the will of God ?
As a layman studying to receive a master 's in Christian communications , and the husband of an ordained minister , it 's troubling to listen to " Christian radio " and hear the kind of hate spewing out of the mouths of my brothers and sisters in the faith .
In fact , I 've grown tired of people who pimp God .
That 's right ; we have a litany of individuals today who are holy , holy , holy , sing hallelujah , talk about how they love the Lord , but when it 's time to walk the walk , somehow the spirit evaporates .
A couple of years ago I took exception to an e-mail blast from the Concerned Women for America .
The group was angry that Democrats were blocking certain judges put up for the federal bench by President Bush .
It called on Americans to fight Democrats who wanted to keep Christians off the bench .
So I called and sent an e-mail asking , " So , where were you when President Clinton appointed Christian judges to the bench ?
Were they truly behind Christian judges , or Republican Christian judges ?
Surprise , surprise .
There was never a response .
An African - American pastor I know in the Midwest was asked by a group of mostly white clergy to march in an anti-abortion rally .
He was fine with that , but then asked the clergy if they would work with him to fight crack houses in predominantly black neighborhoods .
" That 's really your problem , " he was told .
They saw abortion as a moral imperative , but not a community ravaged by crack .
If abortion and gay marriage are part of the Christian agenda , I have no issue with that .
Those are moral issues that should be of importance to people of the faith , but the agenda should be much , much broader .
I 'm looking for the day when Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson , Joyce Meyer , James Dobson , Tony Perkins , James Kennedy , Rod Parsley , " Patriot Pastors " and Rick Warren will sit at the same table as Jesse Jackson , Al Sharpton , Cynthia Hale , Eddie L. Long , James Meek , Fred Price , Emmanuel Cleaver and Floyd Flake to establish a call to arms on racism , AIDS , police brutality , a national health care policy , our sorry education system .
If they all say they love and worship one God , one Jesus , let 's see them rally their members behind one agenda .
I stand here today not as a Republican or a liberal .
And do n't bother calling me a Democrat or a conservative .
I am a man,­ an African - American man ­who has professed that Jesus Christ is Lord , and that 's to whom I bow down .
If you concur , it 's time to stop allowing a chosen few to speak for the masses .
Quit letting them define the agenda .
So put on the full armor of God because we have work to do .

Roland Martin's attack on Pro-Life Christians was really uncalled for .
How can a Christian NOT be concerned while little babies are brutally MURDERED every day by Abortion ?
Mr. Martin , as long as innocent babies are allowed to be killed , the life issue will be our # 1 issue !
Paul Lai , Longwood , Florida
How emphatically can I say " I agree wholeheartedly ! " with Roland Martin 's comments .
The so - called " Religious Right " have indeed hijacked not just " the Christian agenda " but Christianity itself .
To me , Christian love is embodied in Micah 6:8 : do justice , love mercy , and walk in humility with your Lord .
The amount of time the Bible spent talking about homosexuality and abortion is a micro-fraction of what it teaches us about hypocrites and presumptuous , insensitive , judgmental types .
The religious right does NOT speak for Jesus ; it does n't look like they even know the language .
B. Olson , Little Falls , Minnesota
This kind of verbal attack against " fellow brothers and sisters in Christ " is really sad .
Those who truly love the Lord will devote as much time , energy , money , prayers , and effort to fight for the truth and standards that they believe that God , through the Bible , has commanded .
It makes me sick and sad to see Christians who are openly and boldly addressing anti-Christian hot - button topics attacked themselves ; being called " narrow minded " or accused of not talking about another moral issue .

Bravo !
I am a white , conservative , Christian Republican , Southern Baptist who believes that Christians should be concerned with all sorts of issues .
Thank you for your open and honest writing .
Keep it up !

The question is " what would Jesus really do ? "
He would say to stop talking and start working !
The author is right ; there are so many Christians that fight with others ( both , Christians and non Christians ) .
Stop fighting , start working .
What do you do for Jesus as a Christian believer ?
Be honest .

The Church has adapted to pop-culture .
There is no way to take back faith and return to solid Christian roots , when a large percentage of American Churches have adopted services to imitate a secular society .
There is no hope as it stands .
Once the Churches became nothing more than entertainment all was lost .

I am part of the vast right wing conspiracy that President Clinton and his wife have referred to over the years .
I am a born again Southern Baptist Christian .
I am on the extreme right side of social issues .
My response to this article is AMEN !!!!
Great points !!!!
I could n't agree more !!!
It 's time that everyone throw away their political beliefs and " live their faith . "
Derek , Honolulu , Hawaii
I agree that the current " Christian Agenda " is far too narrow and excludes the primary teachings of Jesus .
But the solution is not to have a bunch of white preachers sit down with a bunch of black preachers and come up with a unanimous agenda for everyone .
That 's another step down the road to socialism .
The solution lies in individual blacks and whites coming up with what they feel is important on their own , with the help of the New Testament , instead of relying on fake Christians like Jerry Falwell to tell them what to think .
A fundamentalist church pastor had sex with two of his teenage daughters to educate them on how to be good wives , a South Australian court has heard .
The 54 - year - old man , who cannot be named , was today sentenced in the SA District Court to eight and a half years jail after pleading guilty to seven counts each of incest and unlawful sexual intercourse .
The court heard that the man had sex with his daughters for nearly a decade from 1991 when they were aged 13 and 15 at the family property .
U.S. Muslims reject extremism , poll finds
Pew reports a diverse group with a mostly positive view of society
WASHINGTON — Unlike Muslim minorities in many European countries , U.S. Muslims are highly assimilated , close to parity with other Americans in income and overwhelmingly opposed to Islamic extremism , according to the first major , nationwide random survey of Muslims .
The survey by the Pew Research Center found that 78 percent of U.S. Muslims said the use of suicide bombings against civilian targets to defend Islam is never justified .
Five percent said it is justified " rarely , " 7 percent said " sometimes , " and 1 percent said " often . "
By comparison , Muslims in France , Spain and Britain were almost twice as likely to say suicide bombing is sometimes or often justified .
Titled Muslim Americans : Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream , the Pew report draws a picture of a diverse population of 2.35 million U.S. Muslims , of which two - thirds of the adults were born abroad and which has a generally positive view of the larger society .
Most call their communities good or excellent places to live , and most report that a large portion of their closest friends are non-Muslims .
They are a bit more satisfied than the general public with the state of the nation .
On balance , they believe that Muslims coming to the United States should adopt American customs , rather than trying to remain distinct .
And they are even more inclined than other Americans to say that people who want to get ahead can make it in the United States if they work hard ; 71 percent of U.S. Muslims agreed with that statement , compared to 64 percent of the general public .
" What emerges is the great success of the Muslim - American population in its socioeconomic assimilation , " said Amaney Jamal , an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University who was a senior adviser on the poll .
" Given that for the past few years they 've been dealing with the backlash from 9/11 , these numbers are extremely impressive . "
Native - born black Muslims , who represent about 20 percent of the Muslim population , are its most disillusioned segment , the report shows .
Just 13 percent are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. , compared with 29 percent of other native - born Muslims and 45 percent of Muslim immigrants .
Andrew Kohut , president of the Pew Research Center , said one of the poll 's most striking findings is that black Muslims are considerably more likely than immigrant Muslims to express support for al - Qaida .
Nine percent of black Muslims expressed a favorable attitude toward Osama bin Laden 's terrorist organization , and 36 percent held a very unfavorable view .
Among foreign - born Muslims , 3 percent voiced a favorable view of al - Qaida , and 63 percent took a " very unfavorable " position .
The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life surveyed 1,050 Muslim adults in four languages — English , Arabic , Urdu and Farsi .
The overall margin of sampling error was five percentage points .
I ’ve been using C and C++ for over twenty years now , and I ’m very fluent in both of them .
C++ has been my preferred language for pretty much any programming task for most of that time , and I have n’t seen any point to learning other programming languages because some of them are at best equivalent in power to C++ , and most are noticeably poorer .
However , as I described a few days ago , I decided to learn Lisp , primarily because Paul Graham insists that it ’s the most powerful language out there .
I could n’t see that it was any more powerful than C++ , but enough smart people seemed to agree with Paul that I had to admit that I could be wrong on that score .
Well , I just finished chapter nine of Practical Common Lisp , and I ’m finally convinced .
Up until now , everything that I ’d seen done in Lisp could easily be done in C++ too .
The only real difference was a little more verbosity .
But the unit - testing framework that was developed in that chapter … while I think I could do the same thing in C++ with the Boost library , template functions , function pointers , and a C - style macro , it still would n’t be nearly as elegant as the Lisp version , and it would be noticeably more verbose .
And it would require some fairly esoteric C and C++ features , things that even I — a fluent user with decades of experience behind me — would have to delve into reference works to figure out , whereas it uses only standard features of the Lisp language .
It would also take me about the same amount of coding time in both languages , which considering my very different levels of expertise in them , is another big win for Lisp .
I ’m still planning to use C++ for most of my professional work — I worked long and hard for the kind of expertise that I have in it , and all of my professional tools are geared toward it as well .
But Lisp is definitely going to play a big part in my personal programming from now on , and likely in the prototyping stages of my professional code as well .
To no one 's surprise , a federal judge has blocked a California law that required retailers to label violent video games and prohibited their sale to minors .
Passed in 2005 , the law enjoyed strong support from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger but never went into effect after Judge Ronald Whyte issued a preliminary injunction against its enforcement .
Judge Whyte found the California law problematic on several levels .
He agreed with the Entertainment Software Association 's position — and that of other courts — that the law was unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds .
He was also critical of arguments that video game violence causes real - world violence .
" At this point , there has been no showing that violent video games as defined in the Act , in the absence of other violent media , cause injury to children , " he wrote in his decision .
" Although some reputable professional individuals and organizations have expressed particular concern about the interactive nature of video games , there is no generally accepted study that supports that concern . "
The ruling keeps the ESA 's winning streak in its fight against state video game legislation intact : every state law that the ESA has challenged in court has been overturned .
In many cases , the ESA has managed to be reimbursed for its legal fees .
The taxpayers of Illinois got to foot a million - dollar legal bill after the state 's ill - conceived video game law was found to be unconstitutional .
Even worse , the state government had to raid the welfare fund to pay it .
Louisiana and Michigan have also found themselves writing checks to the ESA 's lawyers .
" The ESA is pleased with today 's permanent injunction ruling as it cements nationwide judicial consensus that our self - regulatory efforts work and attempts to regulate computer and video games are unconstitutional , " ESA director of media relations Dan Hewitt said in a statement given to Ars Technica .
" We look forward to the opportunity this ruling now affords us and invite legislators , community leaders , and family advocates to raise awareness and usage of the resources we provide . "
In contrast , Governor Schwarzenegger vowed to press on with the legal fight .
" I signed this important measure to ensure that parents are involved in determining which video games are appropriate for their children , " said the Governor in a statement .
" Many of these games are made for adults and choosing games that are appropriate for kids should be a decision made by their parents . "
Parents do n't need state legislation in order to determine which games are age - appropriate , but laws banning the sale of violent video games have proven to be an easy way for politicians to score points with some constituencies — while alienating others .
Toyota 's totally bizarre recall
Why would Toyota issue a recall designed to make vehicles less safe ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
This fall , Toyota will voluntarily recall nearly 160,000 Toyota Tundra pickups so that they can be made less safe for children riding in the front seat .
No , that 's not a mistake - at least not on our part .
2004 Toyota Tundra
The recall , announced Monday , is meant to make Tundras comply with a set of safety regulations .
The rules say that vehicles built after 2002 must have a child - seat anchor system known as LATCH in the front seat if they also have a front - seat airbag shut - off switch .
The Tundras in question were built with an airbag shut - off switch but not the LATCH system .
The solution ?
Spend lots of money and inconvenience customers ... to remove the airbag shut - off switch .
The move not only does n't enhance the safety of these vehicles , it actually makes the vehicles unsafe for small children riding in the front seat .
Those shut - off switches exist because airbags can injure and even kill small children even in otherwise minor crashes .
Meanwhile , even without a LATCH system ( which stands for lower anchorages and tethers for children ) , parents can still install safety seats using seatbelts .
Toyota originally discovered the compliance issue and , in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) in July 2005 , the company asked regulators to let them to ignore it as " inconsequential to safety . "
NHTSA denied that petition .
So Toyota asked NHTSA to reconsider , arguing that the solution would be worse than the problem .
" [ We ] believe that the agency should understand that the likely remedy is to remove the airbag cut - off switches , " Toyota lawyers wrote to NHTSA in October of 2005 .
Toyota has no other choice , Chris Tinto , Toyota 's vice president for regulatory affairs , told CNNMoney.com .
Placing the LATCH system in the trucks ' front seats would have been far too expensive .
" We still think it 's better with the cut - off switches in , " said Tinto said .
But rules are rules , so it 's out with the switches .
What 's more , to comply with the rule , Toyota is currently building new Tundra trucks without the switches , Tinto said .
Of course , regardless of LATCH systems or airbag cut - off switches , children are always safest in a back seat if at all possible .
The Tundra trucks being recalled do have back seats , albeit small ones .
But people sometimes put small children in the front seats of cars and trucks for various reasons .
For example , according to NHTSA , the Tundra 's back seats are too small to fit rear - facing seats , the kind that infants ride in .
In its final decision .
published on June 28 , 2006 , NHTSA pointed out that the method a manufacturer might choose to remedy a compliance issue is not a determining factor when deciding that it must be fixed , so Toyota 's warning made no difference .
Any issue NHTSA might have with Toyota 's solution to the problem will have to wait for another round of memos .
" We are closely reviewing Toyota 's remedy , " said Rae Tyson , a spokesman for NHTSA .

Report : Toyota recalling Tundras

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The prescription drugs allegedly found in Al Gore III 's possession this week are favorites among young people , according to drug abuse experts , who say prescription drugs may soon overtake street drugs in popularity .
Some young people perceive that prescription drugs are safer than street drugs , experts say .
" I would n't be surprised if right now at this point in time , there are more kids abusing prescription drugs than abusing marijuana , " said Joseph A. Califano Jr. , chairman and president of CASA , the National Center on Alcohol and Substance Abuse at Columbia University .
Gore was arrested on charges of possessing -- in addition to marijuana -- Vicodin , Xanax , Valium and Adderall .
According to a CASA report , between 1993 and 2005 the proportion of college students abusing Vicodin and other opiods went up 343 percent , about 240,000 individuals .
The numbers increased 450 percent , or by 170,000 students , for tranquilizers such as Xanax and Valium , and 93 percent , or 225,000 students , for stimulants , including Adderall .
Prescription drug abuse is particularly common among upper middle class students , according to Lisa Jack , a clinical psychologist at Augsburg College in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
" It just goes to show that where you 're from does n't matter , " Jack said .
And young people do n't have to go far to get these drugs .
" Prescription drugs are very easy for kids to get , " Califano said .
" They can get them from the Internet .
They can get them from their parents ' medicine cabinets .
They can get them from their friends . "
He said often students get them from friends who were prescribed these drugs legitimately .
" Kids sell them to each other , " Jack said .
" Drug trading happens all the time . "
Experts say it 's particularly a problem with Adderall , a drug prescribed legitimately to millions of young people with attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
According to CASA , more than a third of children ages 11 - 18 in Wisconsin and Minnesota who'd been prescribed Adderall and other ADHD medications reported being approached to sell or trade their drugs .
And often they say yes , according to one Canadian study that found one out of four teens who'd been legitimately prescribed Ritalin gave or sold some of their drugs .
Another appeal to prescription drugs , besides the easy access , is that young people often perceive them as safer .
" They do n't have to go to the streets and deal with some guy they do n't know and get marijuana where they do n't know what 's in it , " Califano said .
" Also , they see their parents using these drugs , so they seem safe . "
Jack said prescription drugs can be more challenging to treat than addiction to street drugs .
" In traditional drug abuse , addicts can say , ' I 've been using meth or coke or pot , ' and an addiction specialist knows what to do , " she said .
But with prescription drugs , " sometimes the kids do n't even know what they 've been taking .
They just pass the pills around . "
Part of the solution would be for drug makers to formulate their products so they 're harder to abuse , said Califano , adding that anti-drug campaigns also should focus more on prescription drug abuse .
Parents need to do their part as well , he said .
" When I was a kid in Brooklyn , when parents had liquor , they locked up the liquor cabinet , " he said .
" Maybe parents need to lock up the medicine cabinet . "

Pastor who preached against gays arrested on lewdness charge
OKLAHOMA CITY ( AP ) 
A pastor who has spoken out against homosexuality was arrested after propositioning a male undercover police officer outside a hotel , authorities said .
As the Rev. Lonnie Latham , 59 , left jail Wednesday , he said " I was set up .
I was in the area pastoring to police . "
Latham , a member of the Southern Baptist Convention 's executive committee , was arrested Tuesday and charged with offering to engage in an act of lewdness , Capt .
Jeffrey Becker said .
Calls to Latham and his South Tulsa Baptist Church were not returned for comment .
Latham has supported a convention directive urging members to befriend gays and lesbians and try to convince them that they can become heterosexual " if they accept Jesus Christ as their savior and reject their ' sinful , destructive lifestyle . ' "
The Southern Baptist Convention is the nation 's largest Protestant denomination .
Messages left for the convention were not returned .

Genetic tweak makes virus favour human nose and throat .
Turkish Agriculture Ministry employees collect poultry for culling in the village of Cebeci , Turkey © WHO
Researchers have sequenced the bird flu viruses that killed two people in Turkey in early January , and say that one of them contains a worrying mutation .
This genetic tweak can make the H5N1 virus more adapted to humans than to birds , and more adapted to the nose and throat than to the lungs .
This latter effect could help to increase the chances of bird flu being transmitted between people , researchers say .
They add that many more mutations would probably be necessary before the virus is capable of sparking a full - blown pandemic , in which disease spreads like wild fire from person to person .
The samples of H5N1 virus , taken from the first two victims who died of bird flu in Turkey , were sequenced at a World Health Organisation ( WHO ) collaborating centre at the National Institute for Medical Research in London , UK .
The results were announced on Thursday 12 January , along with confirmation of two new cases : bird flu has now also struck Sanliurfa Province , near Turkey 's southern border with Syria , and Siirt Province , in the eastern part of Turkey .
The total number of reported human cases has now reached 18 in less than two weeks , three of which have been fatal .
In a bind
The WHO has released details of only one of the mutations found in the viruses .
This genetic change results in a substitution of the amino acid serine by another amino acid , asparagine , at a specific position in one of the virus 's proteins ; a protein that helps the flu virus to bind to receptors on host cells .
This mutation has been observed twice before : in a father and son in Hong Kong in February 2003 , and in one fatal case in Vietnam last year .
It is known to increase the affinity of the virus for human receptors over poultry ones .
Until samples from the remaining cases are sequenced over the coming week , it is unknown how many of these came from viruses with the same mutation .
If many prove to have the same tweak , this may help to account for the relatively large size of Turkey 's rapid outbreak .
The WHO 's current explanation for the spate of cases is simply that people are bringing chickens into their homes during the harsh Turkish winter .
Nose and throat
The mutation also has a secondary effect , which may be more worrying .
There are two subtypes of receptors in the human respiratory tract : alpha 2.3 , which occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract ; and alpha 2.6 , which occurs mainly in the nose and throat .
Human flu viruses typically show a preference for the 2.6 receptors , whereas H5N1 strains typically prefer 2.3 .
This is good news for those worried about bird flu , since human - to - human transmission is thought to be more likely via droplets coughed from the nose and throat than from infections lower down .
But the mutation found in the Turkey viruses is also known to be able to increase the affinity for H5N1 to the 2.6 receptors , points out Sylvie van der Werf , head of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Respiratory Viruses at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , France .
Van der
Werf adds that this affinity will , however , be affected by other genetic changes in the virus , which at present are an unknown factor .
Multiple mutations
ADVERTISEMENT
Thankfully , one mutation alone is unlikely to lead to efficient human - to - human transmission .
The genetic changes that would allow this to happen are poorly understood , but are thought to require an exact combination of changes in multiple genes .
" Adaptation to humans is a polygenic trait .
It requires mutations in each of the eight segments of the virus 's genome .
Every one has to be correctly optimized to ensure human - to - human transmission , " explains Edward Holmes , who is studying virus evolution at Pennsylvania State University in Philadelphia .
" You are talking multiple mutations across the entire genome . "
That 's an improbable , but not impossible event .
Researchers continue to examine the genome of bird flu viruses , and are taking measures to stop the spread of disease among birds and people in Turkey .

of the United States is supposed to be under the control of our democratically elected civilian government .
But is it ?
An explosive new book by David Talbot , Brothers : The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years , examines the hostility that existed between the Kennedy brothers and their own military , intelligence and enforcement agencies during the JFK administration in the early 1960s .
The book also reveals that Robert Kennedy , who was Attorney General during his brother 's presidency , believed that JFK was killed by an insider conspiracy of powerful players who did n't like some of the president 's actions .
It underscores a troubling lesson we seem to never learn : that within all power structures , and certainly within Presidential Administrations , there are often struggles for domination , competing agendas , and subterfuge .
Policies and military actions can veer in dangerous directions that have little to do with normal democratic processes .
The book is also a fascinating read , illuminating a contentious cast of characters including Jack and Bobby ; CIA weirdos like James Jesus Angleton and Howard Hunt ; and military madmen like Curtis Lemay and Lyman Lemnitzer .
I interviewed David Talbot , founder and former Editor - In - Chief of Salon.com for The RU Sirius Show .
He was also Senior Editor for Mother Jones , and has written for Rolling Stone and many other publications .
He recently debated Vincent Bugliosi about the JFK assassination as part of a cover feature in Time magazine .
Jamais Cascio and Jeff Diehl joined me in this interview .
Your book shows that there was a terrible relationship between JFK and some members of his administration and the entire National Security establishment .
It 's all of a piece , but I think the situation with Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military really stands out ... They were his nemesis .
They were very frightening .
Yeah .
The Kennedy administration was beleaguered and besieged by its own government .
That was a revelation for me .
After the Bay of Pigs fiasco , when Kennedy refuses to reinforce the CIA with U.S. troops and the Air Force , the government was pretty much at war with itself .
Up to that point , they believed that Kennedy was a weak President – he was in over his head .
And they were determined to run the country the way they wanted to .
They suckered Kennedy into letting this invasion happen .
Apparently , there was a fairly recent revelation that the CIA knew the Bay of Pigs was n't going to work and they were sure that Kennedy would be forced to mount an invasion .
That 's right .
I think they were trying to sandbag him .
They knew he was young and inexperienced .
According to the CIA 's own internal history of the Bay of Pigs , which was released and de-classified in 2005 , they knew that it would fail .
They knew that their own motley brigade of Cuban exiles were n't sufficient to defeat Castro , and they thought that Kennedy 's hand would be forced to send in the Marines and Air Force once these guys were pinned down on the beaches .
But he did n't .
He was very loath to widen the war .
He knew — as the CIA itself later determined in an intelligence estimate — that if we were to do that , it would end up like what we 're seeing today in Iraq .
U.S. forces would have quickly swept aside Castro 's military , they'd have marched on to Havana and then they would 've gotten bogged down in a long and bloody occupation .
Did Kennedy suspect that he had been sandbagged ?
Yes .
And he was furious .
Afterwards , he famously threatened to shatter the CIA and scatter it to the winds .
And he did fire the top two officials of the CIA — Allen Dulles , who ironically later became the most active member of the Warren Commission ( to investigate the assassination of JFK ) , and Richard Bissell .
And he was constantly re-shuffling his Joint Chiefs , because they were some frightening characters as well .
The head of the Air Force , Curtis LeMay , actually thought you could fight and win a nuclear war .
LeMay comes across in this book as actually very anxious to just get right into a nuclear war .
And there 's another character – Lyman Lemnitzer — true psycho maniacs .
Talk a little bit about these characters .
Those are two of my favorites !
Curtis LeMay was this cigar - chomping World War II hero who had devastated Japan with firebombing assaults during that war .
He knew that , in the early ' 60s , America had massive nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union .
And he thought that was our window of opportunity to take the commies out .
Do it now .
We would , of course , suffer millions of casualties of our own , but he argued with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara that you could still win the war as long as you had more weapons in the end .
The one who dies with the most bombs wins .
Exactly .
LeMay , of course , was the inspiration for General Jack Ripper in Dr. Strangelove .
And he was George Wallace 's Vice Presidential candidate in 1968 .
Lyman Lemnitzer is another frightening character .
Kennedy thought he was a dope — that 's what Arthur Schlesinger , the Kennedy historian , told me .
This is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Right .
A complete idiot .
Yeah , a complete idiot .
And at one point , he came up with a scheme called Operation Northwoods , which he presents to McNamara and Kennedy .
The 9/11 conspiracy people bring that up all the time .
Yes , because it obviously has some potentially interesting parallels with what happened on 9/11 , depending on what you think 9/11 was all about .
In any case , this was a plan to provoke a number of terrorist acts on U.S. soil and blame it on Castro as a way of creating a pretext for a war on Cuba .
The plan included setting off bombs in Miami and Washington and killing American citizens and blaming it on Fidel .
In Body of Secrets : Anatomy of the Ultra - Secret National Security Agency , James Bamford reported that one of the ideas was to blow up John Glenn in space , and blame it on the Cubans .
( Laughs ) Yes .
You asked McNamara about it , and McNamara did n't even remember it .
I get the sense that the Kennedy administration did n't even take it seriously .
They just kind of tossed it in the wastebasket .
I found a memo that Lyman and Lemnitzer did bring it up in the meeting with Kennedy , and he dismissed it out of hand .
And Kennedy said , " I hope you 're prepared for a wider war . "
In other words , he thought the Soviets would move against West Berlin if we were to move on Cuba .
I think Jack Kennedy was a wise and temperate man who'd learned the horrors of war firsthand as a young Navy officer in World War II .
His own brother , who was a Navy pilot in World War II , had been shot down and killed during that war .
So he was n't like the kind of rich kids we see in office today in the White House … Although he was a rich kid .
That 's right .
He was a rich kid .
But he actually served in the military , and he knew firsthand the horrors of war .
I love this expression that you use to describe how Kennedy operated .
" In the end , JFK threaded the needle of Berlin , as he would do repeatedly during his administration , avoiding either an explosive confrontation or embarrassing capitulation in an artful dance , combining tough speech , symbolic military measures , and back channel diplomacy . "
Threading the needle – he was trying to sneak down the middle .
Right .
He was a skillful guy at the game of politics .
He knew that if he came out too publicly as a force for peace , he would be pilloried by the far right , which was on the rise in those days – and was strong in the military — and he would be portrayed as a wimp .
And , of course , Democrats have been portrayed that way ever since .
But Kennedy was artful about avoiding that label .
At the same time , behind the scenes , he was clearly trying to thread the needle and get out of these war situations — in Berlin , in Vietnam , in Laos , and in Cuba .
How would you compare the pressures that he had from the right wing military establishment and the CIA — and a public that was prone toward being swayed by labeling someone a wimp — and the situation today .
Because in reading the book , it makes me think things were much crazier then than they are now .
Well , the stakes were certainly higher .
The world was on the brink of nuclear holocaust throughout the Kennedy years .
And there was a very active right wing in this country agitating for war .
Within the military , there was a figure named General Edwin Walker .
He was actually a very revered figure in the army .
He was stationed in West Germany where he distributed far right John Bircher propaganda to his active duty soldiers and advised them how to vote .
Of course , he was telling them to vote against the Democrats .
Kennedy finally forced him out of the service and he became very active campaigning against Kennedy policies .
He even went down to Ole Miss , the University of Mississippi , at the height of some serious disturbances there .
A black student , James Meredith , was the first to enroll at the University and it set off white riots .
Walker was stirring up those riots .
Talking about how crazy things were then , the Ole Miss story is perhaps one of the most intense moments in your book .
We would totally freak out if something like that happened now .
Absolutely .
And if a movie were ever made of my book , this would be one of the most intense scenes in it .
Cinematic .
Cinematic .
You know , the Kennedys get blamed for being slow to move on Civil Rights .
But certainly by 1962 , his second year in office , JFK and his Attorney General Bobby Kennedy were moving pretty aggressively on Civil Rights .
And when James Meredith , a former Air Force sergeant , becomes the first black student to enroll at this all - white , racist university — the University of Mississippi – all hell broke loose in the South .
The governor , Ross Barnett , was riling people up down there and the local Klan was mobilized .
And this former military officer , Edwin Walker attempted to rally the entire South to take its final stand on the campus to prevent desegregation .
It was called the last battle of the Civil War .
It was almost like civil war .
Yeah , thousands of people from all over the South descended on the university .
Some of them had squirrel guns ; some had homemade bombs , bricks — anything they could throw at the beleaguered federal marshals who were protecting James Meredith .
A thin line of federal officers had been quickly mobilized to protect Meredith , as well as prison guards .
They even used drug enforcement people .
They had all been sort of mobilized at the last minute under Nicholas Katzenbach , who was an aide to Bobby Kennedy .
So they were outside the administration building all night long as the riot got more and more out of control .
They were down to their last tear gas canisters , which is all they have to try to disperse these rioters who were armed to the teeth .
Two people were shot and killed and many wounded .
Many of the federal marshals were wounded and bleeding .
It was a scene of complete bloody chaos .
The military was supposed to reinforce these marshals and drive away the rioters , but they were very slow to move .
And there are tapes of conversations inside the White House that night between President Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy , and their aides Ted Sorensen and Kenny O'Donnell .
There was an increasing level of hysteria within the White House as they realize that the federal marshals are about to be overwhelmed and Meredith could be lynched by this mob .
And they were on the phone to the army , constantly ... One of Kennedy 's friends was right there in the thick of it .
The deputy aide , Nicholas Katzenbach , was right there .
He was a World War II veteran , but he too was beginning to sound increasingly desperate …
" Where is the military ? "
And Bobby Kennedy was yelling at the military , " Where are you ? "
In retrospect , it looks like it was probably just a badly run operation , and they were n't prepared to move as quickly as they had to that night .
But the feeling within the Kennedy group that night was that it was treasonous .
And they talk about the book , Seven Days in May , which was a best seller at the time .
It was written by Fletcher Knebel , who was a friend of Kennedy's , about an attempted military coup in Washington .
And the Kennedy 's were asking themselves , " Is this happening in the United States ? " Kennedy wanted to get that film made .
He wanted that film made — I think — not only as a shot across the bow to the generals but also as a warning to the American people .
You know , you think the President 's in command of the military at all times , but the Kennedys ' felt – that night at least — that the control was slipping out of their hands .
And this seems to be the story of the book .
During the '60s and ' 70s , within underground culture , a lot of people liked to say that the Kennedy assassination was essentially a coup d'etat .
This does n't seem far from the story you tell in your book .
Would you embrace that language ?
Well , you know , the assassination of JFK is a dark labyrinth .
It 's possibly the darkest labyrinth in my lifetime , the biggest mystery .
Many books have been written about it and I did n't want to go down that same tunnel .
But I wanted to follow Bobby 's footsteps , because Bobby Kennedy was the Attorney General of the United States and one of the most aggressive investigators in American public life in his day .
And he was utterly devoted to his older brother , President Kennedy .
So I wanted to know what he really thought .
I thought doing that would shed light on this case .
And the truth is , starting from the afternoon of that terrible day in Dallas ; Bobby Kennedy believed that his brother 's assassination was a conspiracy .
He looked immediately at the CIA and its secret war on Castro as the source of the plot .
His public posture was to embrace the Warren Report , but in the meantime he organized his own explorations .
That 's right .
I believe he rather tepidly endorsed the Warren Report in public because he knew his own power to investigate the crime was quickly fading , as soon as his brother was killed .
The new President , Lyndon Johnson , hated his guts .
The head of the investigation into the assassination , J. Edgar Hoover , head of the FBI , was also a poisonous enemy of Bobby Kennedy's .
So Bobby knew his own power as Attorney General was quickly evaporating .
He was determined to get back to the White House as President to re-open the investigation .
Assuming that this assassination was an inside job , and that it was on behalf of the people who wanted to go to war with Cuba — why did n't something happen after Kennedy was gone and then Johnson was in office ?
Well , they got their war , but not on Cuba .
They got their war in Vietnam .
I understand that JFK was determined to withdraw entirely from Vietnam after he was successfully re-elected in ' 64 .
He knew he would be facing a strong challenge from Barry Goldwater , and he was n't about to give Goldwater a weapon by withdrawing from Vietnam before the campaign .
But he told his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara — who I interviewed — and Kenny O'Donnell , and other key aides that he fully intended to withdraw .
And , of course , he only had 16,000 troops there at that point .
Not the half million that LBJ and Nixon later had .
He knew that it was up to the South Vietnamese people to win that war , and the Americans could n't win it for them .
Just like Iraq today .
This is what McNamara told me , and I think it 's true .
McNamara has no reason to lie about it .
In fact , he has every reason to say the opposite because , of course , he was responsible , along with Johnson , for the tragic escalation of that war .
He could 've pinned it on JFK , but he did n't .
So I believe the military - industrial complex — these forces that work in America , did get their war finally .
Kennedy constantly frustrated them , but they got their war .
It was in Vietnam .
Some of the theories around the JFK assassination tend to be bizarre .
Oliver Stone 's movie is maybe a little bit out there .
And the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison became sort of the focal point for theories .
What do you think about Garrison , and what did Bobby Kennedy think about Garrison ?
Well , I actually think there 's a certain heroism to both Garrison and Oliver Stone for standing up — particularly Garrison , who tried to re-open the case .
I think he was in over his head .
He made some wrong decisions .
Ultimately , he set back the cause of the investigation when he lost his case .
So I think of them both as flawed heroes .
I think many of the things that Stone was looking at in JFK were close to the truth , and close to what Bobby Kennedy suspected .
So Oliver Stone was n't completely off the wall .
But he 's not a historian or a journalist , and it was n't a documentary , so he used dramatic license .
But he certainly succeeded in re-opening this debate .
As a journalist , in 1991 , I became interested in all this because of that film .
As did many Americans .
So he provided a service when the American media and the government had completely failed to get at the truth .
It took a filmmaker to re-open the debate .
A shitload of books have come out since that have claimed to prove that it was , in fact , Lee Harvey Oswald and he was a lone gunman .
The most recent one by Vincent Bugliosi came out virtually at the same time as yours .
Bugliosi 's book is massive .
Have you read it ? 1600 pages !
No , I could n't face all 1600 pages .
But I have dipped into it .
I read sections that pertained to my book .
He 's a lawyer so he can essentially prove anything , and that 's what he 's done .
He 's attempted to pin it on Oswald .
There are many flaws in the book .
In terms of his material about Bobby Kennedy , for instance , he 's all wrong .
He thinks Bobby Kennedy accepted the Warren report , both privately and publicly .
And that 's just not the case .
I think there 's such enduring fascination with this because it 's still the biggest mystery in American political history .
Americans know , in their hearts , that something very dark happened in Dallas , and they have n't been given the full truth .
Polls consistently show that upwards of 75 - 80 % of the American people do n't believe the Warren report .
But people say , " Oh , we 'll never know the truth .
There are so many theories out there . "
But in truth , we know more than we think .
And a respectable body of opinion by the best researchers has really coalesced around one theory of this crime , and it happens to be what Bobby Kennedy thought .
He believed that the plot against JFK grew out of the CIA 's shadowy operation against Fidel Castro .
It was an operation that brought together the CIA , the Mafia and militant Cuban exiles .
And that , I believe , is where the conspiracy came from .
The House Select Committee on Assassinations , which I think is the best governmental investigation into Dallas , also came to similar conclusions in the late 1970s .
Anthony Summer , a very good Irish investigative journalist who worked for the BBC came to similar conclusions in his book , The Kennedy Conspiracy .
Jeff Morley of the Washington Post , who I think is the best working journalist on this beat in America , is also looking in the same direction .
We 're talking about the Mafia , the CIA , and Cuban exiles .
But are there some specific individuals that you feel were very likely to have been involved in this ?
Well , one of them , of course , is Howard Hunt .
He was the head of the Watergate burglary team and a former CIA agent who was very much a part of the war on Castro .
And in January of this year , as he was dying , he made a series of confessions to his son , St. John .
And he said that he was invited to a CIA safehouse meeting in 1963 in Miami where the plot to kill President Kennedy was discussed .
He named William Harvey and David Morales as other likely suspects .
In fact , he says that David Morales , who was another well - known CIA figure , was at that meeting .
And he names David Phillips .
Those are key CIA names .
What comes across in your book is that Bobby Kennedy , like his brother , played a delicate game in behaving militantly towards Cuba , and even taking small actions , short of invasion and bombing — tepid stuff that really would n't do anything .
That 's right .
And Bobby Kennedy was militantly anti-communist .
He was no fan of Fidel Castro .
But he was outraged after the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs .
He knew this was a humiliation for his brother and he took it personally .
He was that kind of guy .
Someone described him to me as being like an Irish cop — he was a young man and he tended to see things in black and white .
He was a work in progress at that point .
He was 35 when he became Attorney General .
But I think he grew quickly while he was in office .
And my evidence suggests that by 1962 , the Kennedys were doing a two - track strategy with Castro .
As you say , they were operating something called Operation Mongoose – a series of pinprick actions directed against Fidel Castro meant to de-stabilize his government .
These were not assassination plots .
And it looks like they were doing it for political reasons back home because they were under intense pressure from the far right to do something about Castro .
It was more or less for show .
Meanwhile , in the final months of the administration , JFK opened up a secret peace channel to Castro through an assistant to our U.N. ambassador named William Attwood and an ABC newswoman named Lisa Howard .
She also happened to be sleeping with Fidel .
And she was bugged by the CIA .
That 's right .
I can sort of understand the right wing 's level of paranoia .
Here you have John Kennedy going through back channels to Cuba with a woman who 's sleeping with Castro .
And Bobby Kennedy , at some point , seems to become friends with somebody in the Khrushchev government .
He sort of gripes about the right - wingers he has to deal with to this guy .
And I can imagine how some rightwinger listening in might think , " What ?
That 's treason !
" Consorting with the enemy .
Exactly .
I think you could understand the hard - liner 's point of view .
They believed the Kennedys were young ; they were in over their heads , and they were kind of out of control .
In fact , they 're wiretapping a former CIA wife named Mary Meyer , and they found out that , after her divorce from her husband , Cord Meyer , she was sleeping with President Kennedy .
And she was trying to turn him on to LSD .
Half my audience is having an orgasm right now , because they 've been waiting for us to bring up the Mary Meyer thing .
And my old friend Tim Leary does have a brief cameo role in your book .
Absolutely .
Tell a little bit about that .
Well , Mary Meyer met JFK when they were both in prep school .
She started off very much a blueblood from the very prominent Pinchot family .
Then she married this CIA official , Cord Meyer .
And she divorced him as he became more and more right wing .
She was going in the opposite direction , politically .
By the early 60s , Mary Meyer was kind of a pre-hippie hippie .
She was an artist and a painter living in Georgetown .
And she had divorced her husband and she was having an affair with the President .
And I think it was quite a serious relationship — it was n't one of these fiddle - and - faddle kind of flings that Kennedy would have .
He was really deeply into Mary Meyer ( in more ways than one ) .
And in this idyllic period in the early ' 60s , she was taken with the idea that peace , love and drugs could change the world .
Specifically , she was out to turn on the world 's leaders to the idea that they do n't have to be in a constant state of war .
So she went to Harvard , where Timothy Leary , of course , was still a respected professor in those days .
Semi-respected .( Laughs )
And she asked his help .
She was setting up these acid experiments involving some of the more prominent men in Washington .
She was doing this through their mistresses and wives .
Apparently , she has some of these sessions , and she thought they were succeeding quite well .
But one day she came back to Leary in a panic and told him things had gone terribly awry .
One of the women had sort of gone public and exposed what was happening .
And Mary was very alarmed about what the consequences would be and even asked if she could hide out at Leary 's ...... at Millbrook .
Not a great place to hide out .
A big estate , but probably spied upon just as much as the White House !
Leary lost touch with her a while and JFK was assassinated .
About a year after the assassination , he looked up Mary Meyer and found out to his horror that she had also died a violent death while walking on a towpath along a canal in Washington .
In broad daylight , a man came up to her and killed her , execution style — shot her through the head and the heart .
She was n't sexually violated and nothing was stolen .
It was just an execution - style murder that was never solved .
Apparently at some point , James Jesus Angleton mentioned Mary Meyer in the context of LSD .
That 's right .
He played a strange role in this .
Angleton is one of the more spectral and spooky figures in the CIA historyJust an incredibly weird guy .
Very odd man — head of CIA counter - intelligence .
He spent his whole life doing these mind games in which he was trying to prevent the Soviet Union from penetrating American intelligence .
And some people believe that he ruined the CIA through his paranoia .
In any case , he was obsessed with Mary Meyer .
Ben Bradlee , the former editor of the Washington Post , knew both of them because he was Mary Meyer 's brother - in - law .
He thought Angleton was romantically and sexually obsessed with Mary Meyer .
He wiretapped her .
And I believe that he knew about the affair between Mary Meyer and Kennedy .
So potentially , the CIA knew that Kennedy was doing drugs .
One more nail , I think , in JFK 's coffin .
They believed this young President was out of control .
After Meyer was killed , Angleton showed up at her home , and then at her studio , trying to pick the lock ... which he was good at .
Ben Bradlee and his wife found him there .
Apparently he was looking for her diary .
And the diary 's a source of much speculation .
Eventually the diary was found .
And for some reason , Mary 's sister ( Bradlee 's wife ) gave it to Angleton to destroy .
He did n't do it , and she later asked for it back .
She claimed that she disposed of it .
In this diary , of course , are entries about her affair with JFK and who knows what else .
We presumably have an elected representative who is Commander - In - Chief of the military and is in control of these other organizations .
But we know that both Carter and Clinton had a hard time with the National Security establishments .
I guess any time anybody to the left of Attila the Hun gets into power , the question becomes whether they 're really in control of the military or whether the military is in control of them .
I think so .
Clinton , of course , set them off right away with his policies on gays in the military .
And that provoked a sharp reaction .
He could n't salute properly .
He could n't salute properly .
He had n't served himself — he was n't one of them .
And I think that any progressive president that takes office now will face a similar kind of response from hardline elements in the government that JFK was forced to confront .
That 's why these historical lessons are very important for us to understand .
It 's important to see what any progressive in the White House is going to be up against .
There will always be elements of this military - industrial complex that will be pushing war for power and profit .
There will always be that impulse .
It takes a formidable leader to stand up to those pressures .
Today , with Iraq , were n't some people in the military advising not to invade ?
That 's the irony .
The real nut cases are in the White House today , and not so much the Pentagon or CIA .
The CIA and the Pentagon have been forces for restraint under the crazy Bush - Cheney administration .
Does that bode better , then , for a progressive White House ?
I think they might be happy to get a centrist back into the White House .
Maybe , but there are always these lobbies .
You know , Rumsfeld and Cheney came out of that kind of thing .
They were working for military contractors and lobbying organizations that were always pushing for the next war .
We 're already hearing about Iran .
Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran , as McCain joked .
Not really a funny joke .
Steve Wozniak thought it was funny .
Strange sense of humor , that Steve .
In any case , I think whoever 's in the White House is going to be facing those pressures .
And sometimes you have someone in the White House who 's part of that kind of crazy war lobby , like the current administration .
In American culture , we now have a sensitivity to conspiracy .
While there were certainly conspiracies and scandals in the era before Kennedy , there was n't the expectation that the government was going to be corrupt in such a violent way .
Today , we 're maybe overly conscious of the potential for conspiracy .
A perfect example is the willingness of so many people to believe in the most massively bizarre conspiracies around 9/11 .
So it seems to me that it 's much trickier for these conspiracies to be carried off successfully .
I think that 's true and it 's not true .
But I agree with your point that the public is more conspiratorially inclined today than when I was growing up as a kid , before Dallas .
On the other hand , the gatekeepers — the opinion elite in this country .
The media ... They 've had a backlash .
Very much so .
They 're very suspicious of any conspiracy theories .
The reaction to my book in the media world is very interesting .
Are you a wingnut ?
It 's been very mixed .
I was severely chastised in the Boston Globe and the Washington Post for being too conspiracy minded .
But that 's why I did n't really frame this book as a conspiracy book .
And I rooted it in historical fact , and documented it all very carefully .
I interviewed over 150 former Kennedy administration officials , friends and colleagues .
I went through thousands of documents that are available now .
And it 's very clear from those documents that the Kennedy administration was at war with itself .
And it 's clear that Bobby Kennedy suspected a plot .
That 's historical fact .
That 's not my speculation .
That 's the truth .
Have people talked about Bobby Kennedy 's suspicions in the past – or is this a breakout news item ?
It 's the headline from my book .
I mean , there have been rumors about it , and little bits about it in a couple of other books like Robert Kennedy and His Times by Schlesinger .
But no one has really delved deeply into it .
I believe that these questions about conspiracy are important in a larger sense .
The American public 's imagination has become so inflamed because they know — on some gut level — that they 're being lied to by one administration after another — and particularly by this administration .
And they lied about something as important as war — the run-up to the war in Iraq .
I think the American people are so fed up with this — they 're so skeptical now that , in a way — it 's even more difficult for researchers like me to break through and to say , " Look , not everything 's a conspiracy , but some things are . "
American power works like power does around the world .
Sometimes we like to think we 're exceptional .
Dark things happen in Latin American countries .
Dark things happen in European countries .
But for some reason , some Americans have a certain naiveté – particularly the media .
We like to think we 're above that kind of thing .
But America is capable of dark things .
We should know that by now .
We have to sort that out .
As researchers , journalists and historians , it 's our job to sort fact from fiction .
Everything is n't a conspiracy —
I 'm very skeptical of a lot of the 9/11 stuff that I 've seen .
But on the other hand , I think that what happened in Dallas was clearly very dark and sinister , and we have n't been told the full truth about it .
As you said , these things do happen , and in some ways , none of this is terribly shocking .
And I thought about this as I was reading about Bobby Kennedy 's struggles with the Mafia .
And there was this interesting contrast in the personalities of the Kennedy brothers — JFK was more of a hedonist and Bobby was a very strict moralist .
And Bobby got into this thing with the Mafia while John was still hanging out with Frank Sinatra .
Reading this , at some point I almost start to identify with the Mafia guys ... After Bobby 's been at them for a while , you have to sympathize with them .
Well , you know , these guys are saying ( New York Italian accent ) " 'ey !
I thought we had a deal here ! "
You know ?
They did .
They thought they had a deal .
Exactly .
They had a deal with the old man , Joe Kennedy .
I think that was actually the source of Bobby 's energy and fervor on the subject .
It was a great Oedipal drama .
Joe Kennedy , the great family patriarch , built the fortune any way he could .
He was a pirate .
He built it through Wall Street speculation ; through shady Hollywood deals and building a movie empire ; and through bootlegging .
The bootlegging business and the Hollywood business brought him into contact with the mob , as partners .
I believe he brought the mob into the campaign in 1960 when JFK ran for President in 1960 and they helped push JFK over the top , The Kennedys were n't alone in this , of course .
That 's the way the game was played .
Nixon had his own mob contacts and his own vote theft .
But Bobby was a devout Catholic and he was aware of this .
He loved his father deeply , but I believe he was also ashamed of much of his father 's past .
Was there conflict between John and Bobby because they had such different personalities ?
I think JFK was bemused by how ardent his younger brother was .
As you say , Jack was more like a prince .
He was a debonair , sophisticated guy who had no problems hanging out with some shady characters himself , like Frank Sinatra .
Bobby Kennedy was a different animal .
But JFK also loved his brother 's devotion and his energy and commitment , and respected him enormously .
And he kept giving Bobby more and more responsibility in that government .
They did n't trust the CIA , the Pentagon , and much of their own administration , like the Secretary of State , Dean Rusk .
So their government really became a family affair .
He kept giving more and more of the tasks of government to his Attorney General — his brother .
Was the assassination of Bobby Kennedy part of this , or was it just a lone nut .
I did n't focus on that much in my book .
But I do raise questions about it .
I interviewed a number of people who were there that night in Los Angeles when Bobby Kennedy was gunned down at the Ambassador hotel after winning the California primary .
One of them was Frank Burns .
He was an aide to Jesse Unruh , speaker of the California Assembly , and a Democratic Party lawyer .
He was one of the guys wrestling with the convicted assassin , Sirhan Sirhan , for the gun .
He said Sirhan was standing four to five feet in front of Bobby as he's walking through the hotel pantry , but the fatal shot was delivered at point - blank range behind Bobby 's ear , right into his skull .
Thomas Naguchi , the coroner of Los Angeles County , also said there was no way Sirhan could have fired that fatal shot , given where he was standing .
Obviously Sirhan was playing some role that night .
He had a gun .
He fired at Bobby .
But I do n't think the fatal bullet came from Sirhan 's gun .
Most of the book is not about the assassination .
It 's about the Kennedy administration .
You 're basically rehabilitating their progressive reputation and their intentions regarding war and peace .
Yes !
Is there a final take - home lesson for us ?
JFK wanted his epitaph to be , " He kept the peace . "
And he delivered a beautiful speech along these lines at American University in 1963 , saying " We all live on the same small planet .
We all breathe the same air .
We all cherish our children 's future .
And we 're all mortal .
" He was saying that about America and our enemies — the Soviet Union .
I think we need to have this kind of visionary leadership again to make this world a safer , more peaceful place .
Let me see if I have all the good news straight .
When Sunnis attack Shi’a , we 're supposed to consider it encouraging news .
Q : Let me follow on that , because I think some American officials have called [ the attack on the Askariya shrine in Samarra ] an act of desperation .
And I ’m wondering how this is seen as an act of desperation .
Does that mean that the terrorists are so concerned that they ’re sort of being shut down , and that the surge is so effective that they ’re now desperate to make a statement ?
SNOW : … It does fit a pattern that we see throughout the region , which is that when you see things moving towards success , or when you see signs of success , that there are acts of violence .
When we help Sunnis attack other Sunnis , we 're also supposed to consider that encouraging news .
American commanders say they have successfully tested the strategy in Anbar Province west of Baghdad and have held talks with Sunni groups in at least four areas of central and north - central Iraq where the insurgency has been strong .
In some cases , the American commanders say , the Sunni groups are suspected of involvement in past attacks on American troops or of having links to such groups .
And when Sunni and Shi’a are attacking Americans , that apparently is supposed to be encouraging news , too .
Need proof that the “ surge ” is working ?
Gen. David Petraeus has this to offer :
The bad guys are starting to kill Americans rather than Iraqis .
If I did n’t know better , I might think that no matter what happens on the ground in Iraq , war supporters in the administration are going to tell us that it ’s an encouraging sign .

Ah… blogs - one of the best ways to waste lots of time .
Here are the top 10 tips we ’ve found for being more productive when reading blogs .
Before going any further investigate different blog readers - if you ’re going to spend time reading blogs , use the right tools for the job .
Different blog aggregators engender different usage styles - find one that is as efficient as possible .
We use Bloglines for a number of reasons outlined below these tips .
Try resizing your browser or news reader to make the text appear in a thin column about 8 words wide so that you can speed read it .
Before attempting to change your habits , get a handle on your addiction - record how much time you spend reading each of your blogs or blog groups .
Now set time limits and times when you ’ll read blogs - and stick to them .
For example , 12:00 - 12:30 and 3:30 - 4:00 .
Set up something to enforce the limit - perhaps an alarm , or tell a friend / colleague you ’ll buy them a dvd if they catch you reading blogs outside the time limits .
Limit how many feeds you subscribe to on a particular topic .
If you add a new feed , strongly consider deleting one of your old ones .
Periodically test your feeds .
Leave a feed unread for a week .
Then spend some time doing a catchup and ask yourself “ was that really worth my time ? ”
Organise your categories not by topic ( tech , java , games , news etc ) but by importance and / or reading frequency .
Example categories :
Important / Must Read
Daily - blogs you check daily
Every monday - blogs you check every monday
Every friday
Weekly
Monthly
etc
Add a ‘ quarantine ’ category for new blogs that you ’re adding to your aggregator .
After a week or so , decide whether you really want to keep that blog and move it to the appropriate category .
Add an ‘ ignore ’ category for blogs that you no longer read - this helps you remember your decision .
If you ever come across the blog in the future and think “ ooh , I ’ll add that to my aggregator ” , you ’ll see that it ’s something you decided was n’t worth your time .
Consider subscribing to only a subset of a person ’s blog .
Someone may have interesting things to say about your favorite topic but do you really want to know about their thanksgiving dinner as well ?
Many bloggers tag their posts into categories and it ’s often possible to get category - specific feeds .
For an example , see our list of categories in the sidebar .
What we like about bloglines :
it ’s with us wherever there ’s a net connection so there ’s no need to synch between home and work
you do n’t have to click on each item to read each entry - one click on a blog or group of blogs and all the posts will be presented on one page
it ’ stores up ’ entries - if you have n’t looked at a feed for a while , instead of just getting , say , the last 10 articles in the feed ’s xml , you ’ll get every item since your last check , up to 200 items
Here ’s a bonus tip for those of you that write blog posts - to help people quickly read your posts , somehow highlight the essence of your posts like we ’ve done with the bold text in this post .

Enjoy your summer holiday - while it lasts .
One of the unwritten rules of being a fully fledged member of the taxpaying workforce is that the two weeks you 've looked forward to all year will fly past as if it had only been a few days .
Yet when childhood holidays are recalled , they seemed to stretch out into eternity .
Sure , they were longer .
But it 's no secret that with advancing years comes the sense that time is accelerating .
Yet it does n't have to be like that , says Steve Taylor , who teaches courses on personal development at the University of Manchester .
Clock time may be about minutes and hours , but Real Time is down to how we experience it , which differs from person to person depending on what we 're doing .
Children are incredibly awake to the world around us , so time passes slowly for them
Steve Taylor
Author , Making Time
In developing what he calls the perceptual theory , first put forward by American psychologist William James in the 19th Century , Taylor says time is related to how much " information " someone is taking in from the world around them .
" Children are experiencing everything for the first time , all their experiences are new .
They also have an amazingly intense vision of the world , an amazing fresh perception .
Children are incredibly awake to the world around us , so time passes slowly for them . "
Information - not from books or the internet , but through perceptions of the world - stretches time and as people get older they have fewer new experiences , he says .
" There is less novelty in our life and you become used to the world and more familiar .
You take in less information from the world around us and time is less stretched with information . "
' In the zone '
A possible explanation is that the brain and its capacity to perceive time are affected by the units of information it is asked to process .
So the eight months Taylor once spent in Germany seemed like eight years , he says , because of the number of new experiences crammed in .
He also gives credence to the proportional theory , which is that as we get older , a year is a smaller part of our life as a whole , so seems to pass quicker .
DOES TIME FLY HAVING FUN ?
It does if in a state of absorption , chatting to friends or watching an enjoyable film
But not always .
Two weeks exploring the Andes , having new experiences , may seem longer Source : Steve Taylor
This shift to " slow motion " can also be achieved by top sportsmen .
George Best and former basketball player Michael Jordan are among those to have remarked on how time seemed to slow down when they were " in the zone " .
" I do n't think it 's a delusion , " says Taylor .
" Time is n't something real or something absolute , it 's something created by our minds .
" Einstein showed in his theory of relativity that time is related to other factors .
So it 's not just an illusion , they [ the sportsmen ] are actually slowing down time .
It 's the same in accident situations , we shift out of our normal consciousness . "
Tiger Woods reportedly learnt a variation of tai-chi as a child
" If the brain waves are in synch with the heart rhythms , this is the way the body moves into a state called ' the zone ' .
It 's like playing in slow motion and you have gone beyond linear time . "
Perception is brilliantly enhanced to the point where even the yellow dot on the squash ball can be seen during play , he says .
Top footballers like Best and Paul Gascoigne had a sporting intelligence that was spontaneous and gave them an ability to see space in a different way , says Mr Hall , but it can also be trained .
If you can control time , it is no longer our enemy
Steve Taylor
Mr Taylor believes time is elastic , not solid , so a man on a three - hour plane journey can have a longer " psychological time " than the passenger next to him .
And a man who dies at 40 can live a longer life than a man who dies at 80 if he has travelled around the world and had new experiences .
Western culture , unlike some indigenous peoples , presents a linear view of time , with human lives like a river running through the past , present and future , he says .
Hiro in the BBC's Heroes is able to stop time
" Make sure your life is as full of new experiences as possible .
If you live a life that 's full of routine , then time will always speed up but if you make an effort to travel to new environments and expose yourself to new situations , new challenges , even something simple like a new route to work , new interests , new hobbies , then this degree of newness slows down time . "
Similarly , spending an evening in a " state of absorption " reading a book or watching a DVD will make the time pass quickly , as will a holiday spent on a beach or by a pool .
But varying the activities will help stretch out the minutes and hours .
" We try to extend our lives by keeping fit and having a healthy diet , which is fine but it's also possible to lengthen our life by changing our experience of time and having new experiences and spending more time living in the present .
" We often feel threatened or negative towards things we can't control , helpless ... so if you can control time , it is no longer the enemy . "
So summer holidays need n't pass so quickly .
But you 'll need to leave the pool and put the book down in order to stop it .
Making Time by Steve Taylor is published by Icon Books .
A selection of your comments appears below .
I once was involved in a road accident where time for me did indeed appear to slow down .
I imagine that at times of imminent danger the brain instinctively reacts by speeding up its data processing of the senses .
A response intended to increase the chances of survival .
Our perception that time slows down is probably due to the fact that the brain has performed many more scans and therefore acquired more data per unit of time than relative to its normal state .
Brain state is probably the key issue .
People often report that time appears distorted for instance when day dreaming , hypnotised or meditating .
Richard Dunkling , London
As a child you have no responsibility .
You enjoy your free time because you have no guilt that you could be doing one of the things on your endless to - do list , nor do you have the dread that in a short time it 's back to work for another 12 months .
A child tends to live for the moment and does n't worry about how many days of the holiday are left .
Instead of thinking about holidays in terms of how much time is left , we always think about how little time is left .
For many adults their holiday is over after the first week , because then they start worrying that they 're going home soon .
Maybe if we started to look at the glass as half full , time would n't go so quickly .

Perception is our everything .
So I suppose that our perception of time , and how fast it passes , is also down to personal variation .
Very thought provoking article .
Andy , Bournemouth
I 'm unconvinced by this .
Firstly a lot of our perception of how quickly time passes is based on memories .
We all think that in childhood time passes slowly , but how many of us sat and wrote these thoughts down at the time , or sat pondering them ?
None .
Because there is no reference point in the future .
The point about taking in information ties in with this .
Everything when we were young was new so we have more memories from that time therefore it seemed to go on longer .
Familiarity with a routine will make time seem to go more quickly , but , I think , not for the reasons above .
It is far more to do with looking backwards and considering memories than it is about experiencing the present .
Phil , Reading , UK
An interesting article .
I have given much consideration to ' proportional theory ' and think it accounts towards how we perceive time as a whole as opposed to the time we are experiencing each day .
I believe time is all about perception and especially two factors ' enjoyment ' and ' fear ' .
The more we enjoy a task the quicker time passes by , in parallel the more we fear time is running out the quicker it passes .
On the other hand the less we enjoy a task the more time drags .
Anthony M Gray , Bushey , Herts
When we go to work on Monday we start counting down to Friday , we cannot wait for our summer holidays and then when they arrive they have gone in a flash .
I seem to have grown old overnight , where have all the years gone ?
When I was a child I had no perception of time , everything was new , everything was a challenge , all the fun disappears and we fall into a rut , exploring a new route to work becomes finding a faster route to work .
We ought to slow down , take stock of the time that is left and enjoy it .
Roger Billam , Chesterfield , UK .
I think I prefer the metabolism theory .
Animals with the highest metabolic rates seem to have the shortest lifespans ; a mouse at one year as against a turtle at perhaps two hundred years .
But at the end of day , I suggest , each feels that he has lived the equivalent time .
Geoff Leonard , Hornsby , NSW , Australia
Absolutely riveting ; I have held similar " theories " akin to these thoughts but have not ever organised them into a structure with context as this article does .
Excellent .
Thank you
Roger , Southsea
Sounds like somebody has been reading Catch 22 .
A character in the book notices that time flies when you 're having fun .
Therefore , to have a ' long ' life , you need to be bored for as much time as possible .
He hates clay pigeon shooting , so that is all he does with his free time .
By doing this he ensures he has a ' long ' ( but awful ) life , as opposed to a ' short ' ( but great ) life .
Rob , London
Absolute rubbish .
This blurs the lines between perceiving time as passing slower or faster which I 'm sure everyone has experienced and actually being able to control the passage of time .
Also , he contradicts what many experience : doing mundane , routine tasks make the day appear longer not shorter !
David Rendall , Aberdeen
If this is the case , why does time pass so slowly when we 're bored ?
And why does a one - week holiday flash past way quicker than one week at work would ?
I 'm not convinced ..
Rob , Letterkenny , Ireland
There are some good points here .
It 's such a shame it 's spoiled by a very naive understanding of science .
To say that special relativity denies the existence of time and that it is something created by our minds demonstrates a gross ignorance of Einstein 's work .
Saying that one can actually slow down time by using your mind is akin to telling yourself that sprouts taste like vanilla ice cream .
It 's a self - made delusion which you can convince yourself of , regardless of the cold , hard fact that the chemical composition of sprouts and ice cream are different and will therefore react differently with the taste buds on your tongue .
Simon Meadows , Gatwick , England
This article is superb , really gives you a lot to think about .
It 's funny how we want work time to speed up and other time like being with friends to slow down .
I like the new experience theory .
Maybe we just have to pay attention more and actively seek out detail .
I 'll have to give it a try .
Frank Kerrigan , Glasgow
Is it not just a case that in young people body metabolism is a lot faster and therefore time appears to move slower and in older people body metabolism has slowed down thus giving the illusion that time is actually passing faster
Martin Lee , Bournemouth UK
The older you get , the more you look back into the past .
The path you made is dotted with highlights ( and lowlights ) and only those are remembered , making the time that has passed seem that much more compressed , thus shorter .
So it 's all a case of perspective .
Living in the here and now is preferential , while still making future plans .
To live in the past only reinforces the illusion that time passes quickly , which it does not .
Life is short ?
No it 's not , it 's the longest thing you 'll ever do !
Julian , Twickenham , UK
I 'm 27 and no philosopher .
But this is an interesting article .
I feel that the more emphasis you give to time , the more real it is for you ( when in fact there is no physical reality , it is fabricated ) , and therefore you feel the burden of ' passing time ' .
If you take psychological time out of your life and concentrate solely on the present , then you 'll have all the ' time ' in the world , and the deep seated contentment that goes hand in hand with deeper involvement in life .
It is not just children who live in such a way ... as an adult , the less you think and the more you just perceive means life seems to pass you by in slow motion .
You do n't just need to look for new experiences .... you need a better relationship with what is in front of you , even if it is something you have seen many times before .
Carl , Birmingham , England
The explanations could have been more precise : this is talking about the perception of time by an individual .
No - one ever actually slows time down - that would obviously affect everyone and everything , not just the person doing it .

ABC host tells Paul , Gravel they have no chance to win David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 9 , 2007 Print This Email This On Sunday 's edition of This Week , ABC 's chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos reported on " the long - shot candidates who are lighting up this presidential race : " former Democratic Sen. Mike Gravel and Republican Rep. Ron Paul .
While providing both underdogs with prime network coverage , the one - time communications director for President Clinton also told the candidates straight to their faces that he did n't believe either could win .
Stephanopoulous pressed Paul on his calls for immediate withdrawal of the troops from Iraq , saying , " Do n't we have a responsibility to those we leave behind ? "
" It 's a tragedy of what 's happening , what we 're going to leave behind , " replied Paul .
" But we do n't know it 's going to be as bad as those who are predicting bad things -- just remember , the people who are predicting these very , very dire things to happen are the same ones who predicted it would be a cakewalk .
...
Think of Vietnam .
It worked out much better than anybody predicted . "
" The main motivating factor of the hostility to this country ... is our presence in the Middle East , " continued Paul .
" The sooner we get out of there , the better .
...
We have done a great service to Osama bin Laden , inadvertently , because it 's a recruiting tool for him .
...
We have become isolated from the world .
..
We have more enemies today , more enemies and less friends than we have ever had in our country . "
Stephanopoulos then asked Paul , " What 's success for you in this campaign ? " but cut off the start of Paul 's response , " Well , to win ... " with an interjected " That 's not going to happen ! "
" Do you know absolutely ? "
Paul came back .
Do you want to bet every cent in your pocket for that ?
...
The odds are great ... but I would say that what has happened so far has been 100 times greater than I anticipated . "
Stephanopoulos next turned to Mike Gravel , whom he described as " something of a sentation " on the Net , due to his debate performance and surreal videos .
" It 's a metaphor , " said Gravel of his " Rock " video .
" You get a fixation of a thought you want to have , something you want to do , and you go do it .
... the ripples , the ripples -- it 's a metaphor , George .
The ripples show the effect , and then you march off into the horizon . "
" What are the ripples you want to send out in this campaign ? " asked Stephanopoulos .
" We 've got to pull away from politics as usual , " answered Gravel , expanding on his statement at the Democratic debate that most of his fellow - candidates lack moral judgment .
" They 've got the power to end this war , and they 're not doing anything about it .
And that , in my mind , is immoral . "
Gravel insisted that the votes against Bush " are there now " and that you just have to get them .
He recalled his own extended filibuster of the draft during the Vietnam War , saying , " Five months , and there 's no draft in the United States today , and I 'm proud that George Bush does not have the boots on the ground to invade Iran . "
When Stephanopoulos pointed out that many Democrats fear their party 's opposition to the Vietnam War has cost them political support in the decades since , Gravel retorted , " What 's more important ?
Getting office ?
Or doing the moral thing and stop people from dying ?
I 'll tell you , if that 's the sacrifice we 've got to pay to stop these people from dying and killing these Iraqis , I 'll pay that sacrifice every day of the week . "
Stephanopoulos concluded by saying to Gravel , as he had to Paul , " You 're not going to be president . "
Gravel 's response was , " One of the great beauties of this great country of ours is that anything is possible in politics .
You just have a tough time accepting it . "
The following video is from ABC's This Week , broadcast on July 8 . # Transcript : GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS :
We were back on the trail this week with the long - shot candidates who were lighting up this presidential race .
Democrat Mike Gravel served two Senate terms in the 1970s , where he led the fight against the Vietnam War. SEN .
MIKE GRAVEL ( D - AK ) ( Former Senator ) : ( From tape . )
Our policy in Vietnam is crumbling around our ears today .
Today I publicly announced my candidacy for the vice president .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : And nominated himself vice president in 1972 .
Seventy - seven now , he wants the top job to stop another war .
SEN .
GRAVEL : You know what 's worst than a soldier dying in vain is more soldiers dying in vain .
REP .
RON PAUL ( R - TX ) ( Former Congressman ) : ( From tape . )
It was a mistake to go , so it 's a mistake to stay and if we make - MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Republican Ron Paul is the only candidate in his party against the Iraq war from the start .
A ten -term congressman from Texas he's also an obstetrician who 's delivered more than 4,000 babies .
REP .
PAUL : ( From tape . )
Vote for the principles of freedom .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : And he was the libertarian candidate for president in 1988 .
I spoke with both men in Washington on Friday starting with Congressman Paul , who had a nice crowd assemble on the street .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : How 's it going ?
REP .
PAUL : Hi , how are you ?
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He also came with a little news .
After a burst of fundraising in a second quarter , he has more campaign cash on hand than the former frontrunner , John McCain .
REP .
PAUL : I think some of the candidates are on the downslope , we 're on the upslope , so can you imagine what it will be like if we do as well on the next quarter and quadruple our income and our numbers .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : How do you count for ?
What do you think happened ?
REP .
PAUL : To simplify , I would say I think people have underestimated the number of people in this country that are interested in a freedom message - just being free , free of the government , you know , oppression of us whether it's on our personal liberties or economic liberties and they certainly like the foreign policy of nonintervention ; you know , just to stay out of the internal affairs of others .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me get into that message of nonintervention starting with Iraq .
You were the only candidate on the stage in the Republican debates who was against the war in Iraq from the very beginning and you want the troops to get out right now .
But do n't we have a responsibility to those we leave behind ?
REP .
PAUL : We have a lot of responsibility , but it's to the American people .
We have it to our troops .
We need to get them out of a bad situation , we need to get them out of harm 's way , and we need to protect the American taxpayer .
It 's a tragedy of what 's happening , what we 're going to leave behind , but we do n't know it 's going to be as bad as those who are predicting bad things .
Just remember , people who are predicting these very , very dire things to happen are the same ones who predicted it would be a cakewalk .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you are willing to pay the price even if that is the price ?
REP .
PAUL : Well , it 's not - it 's not much of a price to save our men and save our taxpayer and change our foreign policy to be more sensible .
Think of Vietnam .
It worked out much better than anybody predicted .
We 're achieving with Vietnam what the founders ' advised us to achieve with everybody : friendship and trade , not a belligerent attitude of forcing our wishes on other people .
REP .
PAUL : ( From tape . )
Thank you Mr. Speaker .
I rise to urge the Congress to think twice before thrusting this nation into a war without merit .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You started out as a very lonely voice in the Republican Party , but it seems that more Republicans are inching your way , at least towards starting to pull out from Iraq .
Do you believe that come next year the Republican Party position will be it's time to withdraw , it 's time to get out ?
REP .
PAUL : If they are , they can't - they wo n't have a prayer in the election .
I mean , where are their political instincts ?
That 's why they are starting to shift .
I mean , we 'll take them any way that we can get them - you know , support for a more sane foreign policy .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You would completely pull out of the Middle East ?
REP .
PAUL : The main motivating factor of the hostility to this country - I 've said it before , it 's absolutely true - is our presence in the Middle East .
The sooner we get out of there , the better .
REP .
PAUL : ( From tape . )
Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us ?
They attack us because we 've been over there .
We 've been bombing Iraq for ten years .
RUDY GIULIANI : ( From tape . )
That 's an extraordinary statement .
As someone who lived through the attack of September 11th , that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq - I do n't think I 've ever heard that before and I 've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th .
( Applause ) MR . STEPHANOPOULOS : Rudy Giuliani said that you did n't know what you were talking about .
REP .
PAUL : Well , that revealed a bit of lack of knowledge , to put it mildy , on his part because there 's been so many books - our CIA defends my position .
The 9/11 report defends my position .
Paul Wolfowitz defends my position MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You have no regrets for what you said ?
REP .
PAUL : Oh , no , but he was demagoguing it .
Everybody saw through that .
He was the great patriot and he was trying to say I 'm blaming America .
I 'm blaming bad policy ; I 'm not blaming our victims .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Do you think Rudy Giuliani knows better than what he said ?
REP .
PAUL : He knows better now .
I think he probably just looked at it superficially .
He probably looked at the politics of getting the attention of hawkis - type conservatives , and he got the applause so he was probably reinforced .
But I 'll bet you the week later he was n't nearly as reinforced because they are using different language now - the general Republican leadership - on this whole issue .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But President Bush says if we retreat from Iraq , al Qaeda , all of its allies , are going to attack us here at home .
REP .
PAUL : Well , I disagree .
He believes that and he believes it sincerely , but I do n't think he 's correct on that because I think we have done a great service to Osama bin Laden , inadvertently , because it 's a recruiting tool for him .
But what has happened to us ?
We have become isolated from the world .
They charge me with are you an isolationist ?
No. Isolationism is being practiced today .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Are n't you proud of being an isolationist ?
REP .
PAUL : I do n't like the word .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : You 'd also pull out of the United Nations , you 'd pull out of the International Monetary Fund , you 'd pull out of the World Bank ?
REP .
PAUL : Yes , but George Washington was n't for all those groups either .
We did n't have a president for that until after World War II , so I do n't think that isolation .
I want to trade with people .
We have more enemies today and more enemies - more enemies and less friends than we have ever had in our country .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You ran after president in 1988 as a libertarian .
REP .
PAUL : ( From tape . )
The libertarian party and the libertarian message offers a choice .
It offers a choice for the American people not to have to vote for the lesser of evil .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : You 're running as a Republican this time .
Why ?
REP .
PAUL : Well , I was elected to Congress 10 times as a Republican .
That 's a pretty good reason .
I 've been able to deliver this constitutional , very libertarian message to my district and they like it and they reelect me .
And it 's practical .
Third parties are - the laws are biased against them .
Unless you 're a billionaire , you can't even get on the ballot .
So that 's not very democratic .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 've also really built up a reputation for living out your libertarian principles .
You served , as you said , 20 years in Congress but you 're not going to take a congressional pension .
REP .
PAUL : Right .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
As an obstetrician , you never took Medicare or Medicaid for your patients .
REP .
PAUL : Never .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You did n't allow your children to take student loans for college ?
REP .
PAUL : No , because my goal was that they would work and I would help them , and that they would n't have debt , but not to borrow from the taxpayers .
It 's not the government .
The government has nothing .
They want to steal the credit from somebody who 's trying to start a small business someplace .
So if you steal credit out , that means there 's a pain and suffering for somebody that 's invisible .
So I would n't participate .
I consider that an immoral act .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Do you think the Republican Party has stayed true to its small government principles ?
REP .
PAUL : They have n't stayed true to their principles about less government .
What happened in this administration ?
They took it over and we had massive increases in entitlements and we have international conflict , so the party has lost its way .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What 's success for you in this campaign ?
REP .
PAUL : What 's success ?
Well , to win is one .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That 's not going to happen .
REP .
PAUL : You know absolutely ?
You want to bet your every cent in your pocket for that ?
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . REP .
PAUL : You are .
Okay .
I thought so when I ran for Congress .
I would n't bet anything I could have been elected to Congress .
The odds are great .
The odds are difficult and I know that .
But I would say that what has happened so far is about 100 times greater than I anticipated .
And I think that we have surprised a lot of people already , and I think we 're going to surprise a lot more .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
If the odds are stacked against Ron Paul , they 're out of this world for Mike Gravel .
SEN .
MIKE GRAVEL ( D - AK ) : ( From tape . )
Okay , we 're going 90 - we 're going 93 north .
It 's the next exit .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
On the trail , he 's on his own .
MS. : ( From tape . )
Who are you , dear ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : ( From tape . )
Mike Gravel . I 'm Senator Gravel .
MS. : ( From tape . )
Are you running for something ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : ( From tape . )
I 'm running for president .
Yes , I am .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But on the web , he 's something of a sensation thanks to his fiery debates - SEN .
GRAVEL : ( From tape . )
And I 've got to tell you , after standing up with them , some of these people frighten me .
They frighten me .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : - and this surreal campaign video .
Gravel stares straight to camera for more than a minute .
What 's the point ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : It 's a metaphor .
And it's two young teachers in Southern California that wanted to film me and I said fine , you can have as much time as you need .
And the metaphor that they see - and I was flattered by it - but it's a metaphor not only for a presidential candidate , for any citizen .
What it is you get a fixation of a thought you want to have , something you want to do , then you go do it .
We constantly - ( unintelligible ) - society - MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Throw a rock in a lake ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : Listen , the ripples .
The ripples - it 's a metaphor , George .
The ripples show the effect and then you march off into the horizon .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So let 's follow the metaphor .
What are the ripples you want to send out in this campaign ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : Thank you for asking that , because the ripples are that we 've got to pull away from politics as usual .
I 'll give you an example .
At the last debate on the 32nd wing at the end I made the statement about their being immoral .
SEN .
GRAVEL : ( From tape . )
We have to have a president who has moral judgment .
Most of the people on this stage with me do not have that judgment and have proven it by the simple fact of what they 've done .
SEN .
GRAVEL : It 's not their personal life I was talking about .
I was talking about the fact that those presidential candidates that are standing up with me , they 've got the power to end this war and they 're not doing anything about it .
And that in my mind is immoral , because as we we 're talking then , as we 're talking now , George , human beings are dying and American soldiers are getting their bodies blown apart and we 're killing Iraqis , and there 's no reason for it .
We can stop that .
And so if they aspire to be president , they ought to show some leadership in the Congress right now to end it .
And I 've given them the tools to do this with , and they do n't pick up on it .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The tools to do this with ?
You want to have the president criminally indicted .
SEN .
GRAVEL : Oh , yes .
Only if he does n't end the war .
Well , stop and think now .
They 'll say " well , Hillary is classic .
Oh , we do n't have the votes . "
What do you mean you do n't have the votes ?
You go get the votes by the scruff of the neck .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
They 're not there now .
SEN .
GRAVEL : They are there now .
They are there now , George .
And how you get them is real simple .
You turn around and you have a vote on cloture every single day , seven days a week .
You cut out the August recess , and then when it comes back and the president vetoes this law , you turn around and have a veto override every single day - MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The strategy does come from your own personal experience , does n't it ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : That 's right .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Vietnam .
SEN .
GRAVEL : Vietnam , filibustering , being tough .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You had a one - man filibuster against the draft .
SEN .
GRAVEL : That 's right .
Five months , and there 's no draft in the United States today , and I 'm proud that George Bush does not have the boots on the ground to invade Iran .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : You also read the Pentagon papers into the Congressional record .
SEN .
GRAVEL : ( From tape . )
The papers prove that for 20 years , and certainly for the last 10 years , we have been victims of our Southeast Asia policy , not masters of it .
SEN .
GRAVEL : You did n't think that I was treated like a skunk at the party back then ?
And of course , now we look back " well , my God , this person showed courage . "
I could have gone to jail .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
It was an emotional time .
( Cross talk . )
SEN .
GRAVEL : - show leadership , and the Lee Iacocca 's title for his book is " Where Have all the Leaders Gone . "
Well , George , this leader is back , and I 'm a tough leader and I 'm going to hold all of these other people accountable .
They want to be president ?
Let them show their bona fides to be president .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 've said that no person who voted for the war is qualified to be president .
That knocks out Hillary Clinton .
That knocks out Joe Biden .
SEN .
GRAVEL : That 's right .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : That knocks out Chris Dodd .
SEN .
GRAVEL : That 's right .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : That knocks out John Edwards .
SEN .
GRAVEL : That 's right .
And it will knock out Obama if he does n't shape up and help end the war now , because if he wants to show he 's a leader , you do it in the Senate where he is .
He 's got power .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : He voted against the funding .
SEN .
GRAVEL : Hey .
They voted four times .
He and Hillary voted for this vote that meant nothing on the water bill .
What does that mean ?
That means you 're standing there and this is a symbolic vote .
Hypocrisy is what it is , George : hypocrisy .
People are dying , and they 're interested in the symbolic vote ?
Give me a break .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The strategy you followed in the 1970s did eventually end the war .
You cut off funding , the war ended , but a lot of Democrats fear that the party paid a price .
And it kept them out of the White House for years .
SEN .
GRAVEL : Well George , you just put your finger on it .
What 's more important ?
Getting office or doing the moral thing and stop people from dying ?
I 'll tell you , if that 's the sacrifice we 've got to pay to stop these Americans from dying and killing these Iraqis , I 'll pay that sacrifice every day of the week .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : I 've been watching you in these debates and you seem to be having the time of your life .
SCOTT SPRADLING ( Debate moderator ) : ( From tape . )
If you are elected president , how , if at all , would use former President Bill Clinton in your administration ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : ( From tape . )
Well , I 'd send him as a roving ambassador around the world .
He 'd be good .
He could take his wife with him , it will still be in the Senate .
( Laughter . ) SEN .
GRAVEL : I do n't know if I would say - characterize it as " the time of my life . "
I 'm a passionate person .
I feel deeply .
And so what I want to do is I want to fight .
We are a great country , and we are at the tipping point .
I do n't know which side we 're going to tip on , but '08 is as important election as 1877 when they made the decision that changed the South .
Right now , we 're going to make a decision in '08 whether we continue to go downhill with our empire building , and I will tell you very frankly that with respect to Hillary and the president , I view them as a package of one .
They knew what was going on , but they made a political vote .
And that political vote was to give Bush the power to go to war .
That 's what it was all about .
In my mind that is a vote that showed they were morally tone - deaf - the both of them .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So Hillary Clinton 's not going to get your vote .
Who is ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : I 'm going to vote for myself .
What are you talking about , George ?
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you 're not going to be president .
SEN .
GRAVEL : I 'll be president when it ends .
George , I 'll be president .
And you know something ?
One of the great beauties of this great country of ours is that anything is possible in politics .
You just have a tough time accepting it .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Now what I 'm thinking of right now , again , is your video , and you say it 's a metaphor .
You could also say it 's a piece of absurd performance art , but it gets attention .
And you are getting attention in this campaign .
My question is , what are you going to do with it ?
SEN .
GRAVEL : Is n't that how one gets elected ?
By getting attention ?
Then people maybe will listen to me when I say I want to empower you as a lawmaker , because the answer is not in government , the answer is with the American people .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you 're not going to give up until you 're president .
SEN .
GRAVEL : Of course .
And I will be president .
You heard it here .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Everybody deserves to be heard .
債務整理を安心して任せる為の弁護士選び
弁護士選びを間違えると債務整理で失敗する
債務整理は借金返済が難しくなり、これ以上は困難だと判断した場合に借金の減額、あるいは返済の免除を目的とした法的に用意された措置です。
債務整理というのは全体的な言い方を指していて、細かく分類すると自己破産、個人再生、任意整理があります。
弁護士事務所によっては得意としている分野や経験の少ない分野があったりするので、弁護士選びを間違えると後から後悔する事になるかもしれません。
弁護士は法律のスペシャリストでなんでも詳しくて得意なんてイメージをお持ちの方もいるかもしれませんが、全ての弁護士に当てはまるわけではありません。
中々普段なら接する事のない法律ですから、手続きに関しては無知に近いはずです。
ですので、弁護士のような専門家に依頼するわけなのですが、債務整理を扱う弁護士事務所といっても全国には無数といっていいほど存在しています。
しかし、ここで問題になってくるのが、どんな事務所を選べばいいのか？と。
もう借金で手に負えない状況なのに、これ以上失敗はしたくない！
とりあえず一刻でも早く借金問題を解決させたい！
そんな人向けに債務整理を得意としている弁護士事務所を紹介しているので参考にしてみて下さい。
弁護士選びが債務整理を制すると言っても過言ではありません。
借金返済が出来なかったら人生終わり？ 借金が払えなくなったら人生が終わりのようなイメージを持っている方もいるかもしれませんね。
極少数ではありますが中には自殺をしたり犯罪をして借金から逃れたいと思う人がいるのも事実です。
しかし、合法で借金問題が解決する方法があるのならば利用する手はありませんよね。
もちろん利用するには今後の生活上の不便はあるかもしれませんが、このまま借金に怯える毎日を送るよりは遥かにマシでしょう。
また、先延ばしにしたところで借金が延滞すればするほど借金が増えるだけですし、終わりが来るのは時間の問題だと言えます。
ほんの少しの勇気を出すだけで借金の終わりが早まります！
終わりが来るのは明日かもしれませんし、数年後かもしれません。
しかし、このまま借金を放置していても現状は変わりません。
多くの人がする任意整理！無理なくバレずに完済が近付く
債務整理の中でも圧倒的多くの人が利用しているのが任意整理です。
任意整理は裁判所を通さずに手続きが出来る為、家族や職場など誰にもバレずに借金の減額、そして利息の免除が見込めるので完済が圧倒的に早まる事もあり、借金問題を法的に解決したいと思う多くの人は任意整理をします。
借金が増える主な原因の代表は消費者金融カードローンやクレジットカードのキャッシング利用時の高めの利息です。
これは借金が膨れ上がって気付く事かと思いますが、現在なんともならないような借金を抱えてしまっている人は利息が邪魔をして元金が全然減っていかないような事態になっているはずです。
そんな状況なら今すぐにでも任意整理をして毎月の返済を楽にし、完済までの道のりを早める事がオススメです。

Imagine a mechanical Pelé or David Beckham six times smaller than an amoeba playing with a “ soccer ball ” no wider than a human hair on a field that can fit on a grain of rice .
Purely science fiction ?
Not anymore .
The U.S. Department of Commerce ’s National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) organizes the first nanoscale soccer games at the 2007 RoboCup in Atlanta , Ga. , on July 7 - 8 , 2007 .
Team : CMU 1 -- Carnegie Mellon University ( Pittsburgh , PA ) ; Length ≈300 µm ; Silicon Dioxide and Aluminum
RoboCup is an annual international competition designed to foster innovations and advances in artificial intelligence and intelligent robotics by using the game of soccer as a testing ground .
NIST hopes that a competition between the smallest robots in RoboCup history will show the feasibility and accessibility of technologies for fabricating MicroElectroMechanical Systems ( MEMS ) , tiny mechanical devices that are built onto semiconductor chips and are measured in micrometers ( millionth of a meter ) .
The 2007 RoboCup features six competition leagues : Four - Legged , Humanoid , Middle Size , Small Size , Simulation and Rescue Robot .
RoboCup and NIST are jointly organizing this year ’s nanosoccer competition as a demonstration event with plans for it to become the Nanogram League in 2008 .
Five teams are entered in the Nanogram Demonstration Competition : two from Carnegie Mellon University ( Pittsburgh , Pa. ) , and one each from the U.S. Naval Academy ( Annapolis , Md. ) , the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( Zurich , Switzerland ) and Simon Fraser University ( Burnaby , British Columbia , Canada ) .
The soccer nanobots ( nanoscale robots ) operate under an optical microscope , are controlled by remote electronics using visual feedback and are viewed on a monitor .
While they are a few tens of micrometers to a few hundred micrometers long , the robots are considered “ nanoscale ” because their masses range from a few nanograms to a few hundred nanograms .
To win the competition , a nanobot must be fast , agile and capable of manipulating objects .
These abilities will be tested in three events : a two - millimeter dash in which each nanobot seeks the best time for a goal - to - goal sprint across the playing field ; a slalom drill where the path between goals is blocked by " defenders " ( polymer posts ) and a ball handling drill that requires robots to “ dribble ” as many “ nanoballs ” ( microdisks with the diameter of a human hair ) as possible into the goal within a 3 - minute period .

A NASA satellite has captured the first occurrence this summer of mysterious iridescent polar clouds that form 50 miles above Earth 's surface .
The first observations of these clouds by the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere ( AIM ) satellite occurred above 70 degrees north on May 25 .
Observers on the ground began seeing the clouds on June 6 over northern Europe .
AIM is the first satellite mission dedicated to the study of these unusual clouds .
These mystifying clouds are called Polar Mesospheric Clouds , or PMCs , when they are viewed from space and referred to as " night - shining " clouds , or noctilucent clouds , when viewed by observers on Earth .
The clouds form during the Northern Hemisphere 's summer season that begins in mid-May and extends through the end of August .
They are being seen by AIM 's instruments more frequently as the season progresses .
The clouds also are seen in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere during the summer months .
Very little is known about how these clouds form over the poles , why they are being seen more frequently and at lower latitudes than ever before , or why they have been growing brighter .
AIM will observe two complete polar mesospheric cloud seasons over both poles , documenting for the first time the entire , complex life cycle of PMCs .
" It is clear that PMCs are changing , a sign that a distant and rarified part of our atmosphere is being altered , and we do not understand how , why or what it means , " stated AIM principal investigator James Russell III , Hampton University , Hampton , Va .
" These observations suggest a connection with global change in the lower atmosphere and could represent an early warning that our Earth 's environment is being altered . "
The AIM instruments are returning valuable information on the global extent and variability of these clouds and preliminary information on their particle sizes and shapes .
Early indications are that the clouds occur at high latitudes early in the season then move to lower latitudes as time progresses .
The AIM science team is studying these new data to understand whether the changes in the clouds may be related to global climate change .
When the Northern Hemisphere summer season ends in mid- to late August , the AIM science team will not have to wait long before the Southern Hemisphere 's season starts .
This occurs about three months later in mid- to late November .
The Southern season lasts until approximately mid-March of 2008 .
Early results from the AIM mission will be reported at a major international conference focused on PMCs and other high altitude layered phenomena to be held at the end of August 2007 in Fairbanks , Alaska .
The satellite was launched on April 25 , only four weeks before the first science observations began .
During the satellite - commissioning phase and now in routine observations , all three state - of - the - art instruments have been working exceptionally well and returning high quality data .
The Cloud Imaging and Particle Size instrument offers a 2 - D look at the clouds , collecting multiple views from different angles .
The cameras are providing panoramic PMC images of the Arctic polar cap daily .
The Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment is measuring new information on cloud particles : their variability with altitude , the chemicals within the clouds and the environment in which the clouds form .
The Cosmic Dust Experiment is recording the amount of space dust that enters Earth 's atmosphere to help scientists assess the role this dust plays in PMC formation .
The AIM mission coincides with the two - year , worldwide scientific community 's International Polar Year , and the mission is expected to make unique contributions to the International Polar Year 's objective of advancing polar research .

What does a true , next - generation Internet word processor look like , one that deeply embeds the browser and community ?
The word processors we have today are like a bad haircut from the 1990s .
Microsoft Word , for example , is focused on printing pretty documents on paper , rather than focusing on such activities as lightweight collaboration , browser - based documents , advanced hypertext , and more .
This is probably due to a breakdown in the market and a lack of imagination .
We do n't need new clones of Microsoft Office on the web -- what we need is deep , sustained innovation that merges Wikis into our documents and browser , and solves the conundrum of why groupware sucks .
I have been obsessed with this research question for a long time .
I 've taken several stabs at it , turning the wheel a few times .
The first one was OpenPortal , a project of mine from about 1999 .
In OpenPortal I combined DHTML like easy editing with the Wiki philosophy .
From the OpenPortal docs :
The second big project along these lines was Paper Airplane , which I touch on in the next research question .
An interesting side effect of this research question is that almost everything I have done the last two years doing strange stuff with Ajax , such as the history support stuff with RSH ; the client - side storage stuff with Dojo Storage ; and the offline browser support with Dojo Offline was all done with an eye towards this goal : a few years ago I started another next - generation Wiki embedding some of the ideas above , named Kiwi , and wanted it to work offline , have good history support , etc .
I then ended up working on those side issues instead of the primary question and Kiwi , which is not necessarily a bad thing .
The flip side of the previous question is :
How far can we push the present generation of web browsers from the inside through clever tricks ?
Even as we are trying to push browsers from the outside in new directions , we can also see how far browsers can be expanded from the inside .
This research question has been my main focus the last two years , with the work done on the Really Simple History library for bookmark and back button support for Ajax applications ; AMASS and Dojo Storage for large client - side storage ; Dojo Offline for offline web apps ; and HyperScope and Purple Include for expanded hypertext abilities on the contemporary web .
To be honest , at this point I 'm not quite sure how to personally push it forward more , except for the advanced hypertext stuff ( see below ) .
How can we create communication technologies that provide ever greater levels of interpersonal connection , collapsing the geographical distance between loved ones and family ?
Related subgoal : how can we create mediated communication technologies that feel " unmediated " ?
I have friends and family all across the country since I 've moved around alot .
However , I feel like I can't really maintain a strong , real ongoing friendship with them when they live far away -- it 's more like our connection is on ' life support ' , and we touch base through the phone every now and then .
The real connection happens when they visit .
Why can't we create communication technologies that collapse geographical space and make it possible to really feel like they are next door ?
The ones we have so far do n't fill this need yet for me ; connecting through email , for example , is like talking through a straw .
I have n't made any progress on this goal or had any big realizations , but it is always in the back of my mind and one of the research questions that arises out of a real need of mine .
How can we create email systems that almost completely eliminate email from your life , allowing you to focus on the emails that you need to with as little time invested as possible ?
A related subgoal is : how can we create information technologies of focus and minimal distraction versus the technologies of information and collaboration overload that we have today ?
The last big breakthrough we had with email was GMail .
However , all of our email systems assume that we love email , enjoy spending time checking email , and that more is better .
With the arrival of all of our networking technologies , I believe that we do n't just have Information Overload but Collaboration Overload as well now , where everyone and the world is trying to contact us in some way , whether it is personal , professional , or about Viagra ads .
Not all emails are equal , and current systems force us to treat them like they are .
Some email systems allow you to create custom filters .
Last week , however , as I was spending hours creating and tending my Gmail filters I realized that the computer should be doing this for me .
Custom filters are n't enough -- they are just another distraction and thing that has to be attended to .
I think this area is ripe for some big innovations .
This is a new research goal for me , borne out of my own frustration currently with email , but I have a few ideas to throw at it .
Here are some ideas around GMail in particular .
The big idea is that more is not better -- GMail should not be dumping everything into the inbox .
The ideal situation is an empty inbox , where you see nothing .
GMail should strive to move as much out of the inbox as possible , into side containers that you can attend to when your time and energy permits , rather than as a constant tap tap tap on your shoulder -- not all taps are equal .
Gmail should :
be autotagging and figuring out my email lists , tagging them , and moving them out of my attention view .
For example , I am subscribed to a Coworking email list , a Hyperscope email list , and a Dojo email list -- these should be autotagged as coworking , hyperscope , and dojo and removed from my inbox .
figure out what are social networking emails ( MySpace , LinkedIn , Tagged , etc ) and get these the heck out of my main view , autotagging them as " social_network " .
These are the worst offenders -- I 'll get to them ( twice a month ) when I care and have time .
be figuring out who my friends are and tagging these as personal , also removing them from the main inbox and tagging them as ' personal ' .
It can either figure these out over time , or perhaps just import my MySpace social network in and figure it out from there -- I spent all this time building up a personal social network on MySpace , just import it into my email contacts so it can autotag these folks as ' personal ' and get them out of the inbox so they do n't get lost in the general email clutter , which is what happens for me now .
be figuring out my " professional " or business contacts and autotagging these as well , perhaps through my Linked In social network .
Get these out of the inbox as well .
If these social networks overlap ( MySpace and LinkedIn ) , then it will just tag them as both .
have an automatic personal assistant that goes to bat for me to deny others from grabbing my attention in a way that does n't work for me .
I should be able to register some keywords , such as Really Simple History for my open source library , and bounce back a reply ( an FAQ ) that satisfies the most common questions .
Perhaps I run several different businesses and could bounce back different FAQs for each .
autodiscover those crappy once a month " newletters " that everyone seems to send out ( my Yoga studio , dance place , etc. ) and again tag it as newsletters and get it out of the inbox
In general , I 've been thinking in terms of Attention Vampires -- things that steal my attention , and take away my creative energy versus making me feel better , more powerful , and more productive , a kind of Law of Conservation of Attention .
Is there software that promotes more of the former rather than of the latter ?
How can we create search systems that make answering our questions even more intuitive and integrated then they are now ?
Google is a fantastic invention .
Like any successful invention , ever since coming into contact with search that actually works I want even more of it :)
This research question ranges from being able to just talk into my phone and ask arbitrary questions ( why is n't 411 truly about any kind of information you need ? ) , to having search engines be able to " parse out " what they are dealing with a bit more , such as knowing what are ' How To ' articles , what are ' Recipes ' , what are ' Articles ' , etc . so that when I do a Google search saying " how to change car oil " Google can respond with a bit more formatting of a list of howto articles at the top of the search results .
Can we create hypertext technologies that transform how we link and talk about information and documents ?
Further , how can we port these hypertext technologies to the contemporary web so they are actually adopted ?
I love that the World Wide Web massively simplified hypertext to get it actually deployed and adopted by much of the world -- I think that was a brilliant approach by Tim Berners Lee .
However , it is now 2007 , and computers are now smarter ( and people are too when it comes to the conventions of hypertext ) -- it 's time to evolve our 8 - bit hypertext and introduce new capabilities .
Admittedly , most of the academic hypertext research has a morass of usability issues , however there are some great ideas in there ( most from Douglas Engelbart and Ted Nelson ) that could be cleaned up , ported to the contemporary web using clever Ajax tricks and usability studies , and integrated into our writing and publishing tools .
This is the focus of the HyperScope and Purple Include work I have been a member of .
There is just so much more cool and interesting ground we can cover in terms of ( usable ) hypertext than we have today .
Handling events still sucks -- how can we make scheduling and discovering events that are important and relevant to you and your groups suck much less than it does now ?
I 've long wanted a bumper sticker that says " Evite Must Die . "
I can't believe that it is 2007 and we are still using Evite -- using Evite gives me the same trashy feeling I get when I watch E Entertainment .
Event systems do n't communicate with each other , they are a pain in the butt to sync , their UIs suck , and more .
Why do I have to manually enter social events that I am interested in into my calendar ?
Why can't I just say that I am interested in yoga and meditation in my zip code , for example , and I could always just look at my calendar and find good and interesting yoga classes automatically there and recommended to me ?
I made this great giant poster during my sabbatical of all the free and interesting events happening in the city , yoga classes , etc . so that I could always have something ( cheap / interesting ) to do .
After making this , I was like , should n't the computer be doing this for me ?
How can we be more effective at creating ideas ?
I love creating new ideas and thinking outside the box -- I 'm always looking for new ways to facilitate brainstorming .
I once heard a great quote about relationships that I try to apply to my business relationships --
" Two people should stay together if together they are better people than they would be individually . " 98 % of the brainstorming I have encountered in my life feels like it makes the group less effective than they would be individually .
Perhaps group brainstorming is the problem , but I think it 's because the process by which we do group brainstorming is broken .
I 'm constantly looking for better ways to approach this ; I talk about three ways here : The Cranky Inventor , Sacred Cows , and I Against I .
BAGHDAD – Hopes are fading for early release of the large number of Iraqis detained under the so - called surge .
The " surge " is the new effort by US - led coalition forces to crack down on terror suspects .
The number of detainees held by the US military has increased by more than 50 percent since the US administration announced the surge six months ago , bringing the detainee population to at least 24,500 , according to US military officers in Iraq .
The officers have said the detainee population was 16,000 in February of this year .
The US military unit in charge of the detention centers in Iraq , Task Force 134 , reported Aug. 24 that the average length of detention for all detainees is about a year .
It reported also that there are about 800 juveniles held in detention facilities .
Estimates of the total number of Iraqi detainees vary , but most Iraqis believe the number is more than 50,000 .
According to Iraqi sources , as well as the US military , the vast majority of detainees are Sunni Arabs from the western areas of Iraq .
Most of them are detained without any charge or court warrant .
John Sifton , researcher for Human Rights Watch , told reporters Aug. 24 that " the allegations of abuse are far worse for Iraqi facilities than for those detainees in US custody .
It is difficult to know the Iraqi detainee population .
There are both official and unofficial Iraqi detention systems . "
Sifton said Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations " have concerns about a 50 percent increase in detainees because it is 50 percent more people at risk of having been arbitrarily detained or , worse , of being handed over to Iraqi officers who might subject them to torture . "
Sifton added that there are no reliable numbers provided by the Iraqi government on the number of detainees , and that the US military will not provide the numbers either .
" My three sons were selling vegetables in Baghdad at the wholesale market when Americans took them away over a year ago , " 55 - year - old Saadiya from the Abu Ghraib area west of Baghdad told IPS .
" We learned three months later that they were taken to Bucca prison near Basra .
They were only farmers , and now they are listed as terrorists just because they are Sunni . "
Stories like this are recounted all over the western areas of Iraq , where Sunni Arabs are the dominant population .
" A roadside bomb exploded near our house and killed three Americans , " Sumaya , a woman from the Dora area of southwest Baghdad told IPS .
" Then American tanks came with hundreds of soldiers and arrested over 30 men from the neighborhood , including my husband .
We were asleep when the blast occurred at 5 am , and it was curfew hours , but they still wanted us to tell them who did it .
Now I have to work and feed my four children . "
" A force from the Ministry of Interior took 45 men from our village nine months ago and we still do not know their whereabouts , " Farhan Abbas told IPS .
Abbas is from Youssufiya , 25 km south of Baghdad , and was visiting Baghdad in hope of finding information about the people detained from his neighborhood .
" We lost hope for them because when we went to the ministry to ask about them , they denied their arrest and told us it must be the militias dressed in uniform , " said Abbas .
" We argued that the force came in the ministry ’s vehicles , but they told us to get lost or else they would arrest us too . "
Two vice presidents of Iraq , Adel Abdul Mahdi , a Shi’ite with the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council , and Tariq al - Hashimi of the Sunni Iraqi Accord Front , recently visited Camp Cropper , a US military detention center near Baghdad International airport .
Al - Sharqiya television reported that while Mahdi did not talk to detainees , Hashimi talked with several of them at length and promised that their cases would be looked into shortly .
" You are better off here than outside , " Hashimi said to the detainees .
" It is much safer here than outside , believe me . "
" What a wonderful deputy president we have , " Ahmad Ali from Ramadi who was visiting Baghdad told IPS .
" He thinks people are better off in jail than at home . "
The Iraqi Accord Front withdrew from Maliki ’s government Aug. 1 because several of their demands had not been met .
The first was release of at least 80 percent of the detainees who are believed to be innocent .

An Iraqi who was told he would be electrocuted if he fell off the box .
In the era of Saddam Hussein , Abu Ghraib , twenty miles west of Baghdad , was one of the world ’s most notorious prisons , with torture , weekly executions , and vile living conditions .
As many as fifty thousand men and women — no accurate count is possible — were jammed into Abu Ghraib at one time , in twelve - by - twelve - foot cells that were little more than human holding pits .
In the looting that followed the regime ’s collapse , last April , the huge prison complex , by then deserted , was stripped of everything that could be removed , including doors , windows , and bricks .
The coalition authorities had the floors tiled , cells cleaned and repaired , and toilets , showers , and a new medical center added .
Abu Ghraib was now a U.S. military prison .
Most of the prisoners , however — by the fall there were several thousand , including women and teen - agers — were civilians , many of whom had been picked up in random military sweeps and at highway checkpoints .
They fell into three loosely defined categories : common criminals ; security detainees suspected of “ crimes against the coalition ” ; and a small number of suspected “ high - value ” leaders of the insurgency against the coalition forces .
Last June , Janis Karpinski , an Army reserve brigadier general , was named commander of the 800th Military Police Brigade and put in charge of military prisons in Iraq .
General Karpinski , the only female commander in the war zone , was an experienced operations and intelligence officer who had served with the Special Forces and in the 1991 Gulf War , but she had never run a prison system .
Now she was in charge of three large jails , eight battalions , and thirty - four hundred Army reservists , most of whom , like her , had no training in handling prisoners .
General Karpinski , who had wanted to be a soldier since she was five , is a business consultant in civilian life , and was enthusiastic about her new job .
In an interview last December with the St. Petersburg Times , she said that , for many of the Iraqi inmates at Abu Ghraib , “ living conditions now are better in prison than at home .
At one point we were concerned that they would n’t want to leave . ”
A month later , General Karpinski was formally admonished and quietly suspended , and a major investigation into the Army ’s prison system , authorized by Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez , the senior commander in Iraq , was under way .
A fifty - three - page report , obtained by The New Yorker , written by Major General Antonio M. Taguba and not meant for public release , was completed in late February .
Its conclusions about the institutional failures of the Army prison system were devastating .
Specifically , Taguba found that between October and December of 2003 there were numerous instances of “ sadistic , blatant , and wanton criminal abuses ” at Abu Ghraib .
This systematic and illegal abuse of detainees , Taguba reported , was perpetrated by soldiers of the 372nd Military Police Company , and also by members of the American intelligence community .
( The 372nd was attached to the 320th M.P. Battalion , which reported to Karpinski ’s brigade headquarters . )
Taguba ’s report listed some of the wrongdoing :
Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on detainees ; pouring cold water on naked detainees ; beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair ; threatening male detainees with rape ; allowing a military police guard to stitch the wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell ; sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick , and using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats of attack , and in one instance actually biting a detainee .
There was stunning evidence to support the allegations , Taguba added — “ detailed witness statements and the discovery of extremely graphic photographic evidence . ”
Photographs and videos taken by the soldiers as the abuses were happening were not included in his report , Taguba said , because of their “ extremely sensitive nature . ”
The photographs — several of which were broadcast on CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes 2 ” last week — show leering G.I.s taunting naked Iraqi prisoners who are forced to assume humiliating poses .
Six suspects — Staff Sergeant Ivan L. Frederick II , known as Chip , who was the senior enlisted man ; Specialist Charles A. Graner ; Sergeant Javal Davis ; Specialist Megan Ambuhl ; Specialist Sabrina Harman ; and Private Jeremy Sivits — are now facing prosecution in Iraq , on charges that include conspiracy , dereliction of duty , cruelty toward prisoners , maltreatment , assault , and indecent acts .
A seventh suspect , Private Lynndie England , was reassigned to Fort Bragg , North Carolina , after becoming pregnant .
The photographs tell it all .
In one , Private England , a cigarette dangling from her mouth , is giving a jaunty thumbs - up sign and pointing at the genitals of a young Iraqi , who is naked except for a sandbag over his head , as he masturbates .
Three other hooded and naked Iraqi prisoners are shown , hands reflexively crossed over their genitals .
A fifth prisoner has his hands at his sides .
In another , England stands arm in arm with Specialist Graner ; both are grinning and giving the thumbs - up behind a cluster of perhaps seven naked Iraqis , knees bent , piled clumsily on top of each other in a pyramid .
There is another photograph of a cluster of naked prisoners , again piled in a pyramid .
Near them stands Graner , smiling , his arms crossed ; a woman soldier stands in front of him , bending over , and she , too , is smiling .
Then , there is another cluster of hooded bodies , with a female soldier standing in front , taking photographs .
Yet another photograph shows a kneeling , naked , unhooded male prisoner , head momentarily turned away from the camera , posed to make it appear that he is performing oral sex on another male prisoner , who is naked and hooded .
Such dehumanization is unacceptable in any culture , but it is especially so in the Arab world .
Homosexual acts are against Islamic law and it is humiliating for men to be naked in front of other men , Bernard Haykel , a professor of Middle Eastern studies at New York University , explained .
“ Being put on top of each other and forced to masturbate , being naked in front of each other — it ’s all a form of torture , ” Haykel said .
Two Iraqi faces that do appear in the photographs are those of dead men .
There is the battered face of prisoner No. 153399 , and the bloodied body of another prisoner , wrapped in cellophane and packed in ice .
There is a photograph of an empty room , splattered with blood .
I 'm sorry , but this is just too weird :
Gainesville.com | The Gainesville Sun | Gainesville , Fla. :
After more than an hour of solemn ceremony naming Rep. Marco Rubio , R - West Miami , as the 2007 - 08 House speaker , Gov. Jeb Bush stepped to the podium in the House chamber last week and told a short story about " unleashing Chang , " his " mystical warrior " friend .
Here are Bush 's words , spoken before hundreds of lawmakers and politicians : " Chang is a mystical warrior .
Chang is somebody who believes in conservative principles , believes in entrepreneurial capitalism , believes in moral values that underpin a free society .
" I rely on Chang with great regularity in my public life .
He has been by my side and sometimes I let him down .
But Chang , this mystical warrior , has never let me down . "
Bush then unsheathed a golden sword and gave it to Rubio as a gift .
" I 'm going to bestow to you the sword of a great conservative warrior , " he said , as the crowd roared .
The crowd , however , could be excused for not understanding Bush 's enigmatic foray into the realm of Eastern mysticism .
We 're here to help .
In a 1989 Washington Post article on the politics of tennis , former President George Bush was quoted as threatening to " unleash Chang " as a means of intimidating other players .
The saying was apparently quite popular with Gov. Bush 's father , and referred to a legendary warrior named Chang who was called upon to settle political disputes in Chinese dynasties of yore .
The phrase has evolved , under Gov. Jeb Bush 's use , to mean the need to fix conflicts or disagreements over an issue .
Faced with a stalemate , the governor apparently " unleashes Chang " as a rhetorical device , signaling it 's time to stop arguing and start agreeing .
No word on if Rubio will unleash Chang , or the sword , as he faces squabbles in the future .
When George H. W. Bush in the 1970s and 1980s threatened to " unleash Chang " on his tennis opponents , he was referring to China 's onetime strongman and thereafter Taiwan 's dictator Chiang Kaishek , leader of the Nationalist Party , the man who had largely reunified China in the 1920s with his army 's " Northern Expedition , " lost the Chinese Civil War to Mao Zedong 's Chinese Communist Party , and then taken refuge with his Guomindang party cadres on Taiwan .
After the start of the Korean War , the American 7th Fleet protected Chiang ( and Taiwan ) from Mao's People 's Liberation Army .
Republican wingnuts , however , pretended that the 7th Fleet actually protected Mao's Communists ( who had , after all , won the Chinese Civil War ) from Chiang 's Nationalists ( who had , after all , lost it ) by keeping Chiang Kaishek leashed .
They periodically called for the U.S. to " unleash Chiang Kaishek " -- so that Chiang , you see , could invade and conquer the Chinese mainland .
When George H. W. Bush , playing tennis ( and losing ) in the 1970s and 1980s , would threaten to " unleash Chiang , " he was mocking the right - wing nuts of his generation .
But George H. W. Bush 's sons -- even the smart one , Jeb - - never got the joke .
They , you see , did n't know enough about world history or even the history of the Republican Party to know who Chiang Kaishek was , or what " Unleash Chiang ! " meant .
Hence Jeb Bush 's explanation that twentieth - century Chinese nationalist , socialist , general , and dictator Chiang Kaishek was a " mystical warrior ... who believes in conservative principles , believes in entrepreneurial capitalism , believes in moral values that underpin a free society . "
To me , that level of uncuriosity is scary .
Why is this family ruling us , again ?
Agriculture has been the main sticking point
The latest negotiations to try to secure a new global trade deal have collapsed without agreement .
Trade leaders from the European Union , US , India and Brazil had been meeting in Germany to find a breakthrough on the long - delayed Doha round of talks .
Brazil and India blamed the latest failure on the EU and US not offering enough concessions on agriculture .
The EU and US countered that Brazil and India were not opening up their markets to Western manufactured goods .
' Useless ' Brazil 's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said the Brazilian and Indian delegations had walked away from the negotiations in the eastern German city of Potsdam , because they had proved to be " useless " .
This week 's negotiations could not generate political consensus to meaningfully open markets to new trade - particularly in manufactured goods
Susan Schwab , US Trade Representative India 's Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath added that " there will have to be a substantial attitude change " from the EU and US .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said : " The president is disappointed that certain countries are blocking an opportunity to expand trade . "
US Trade Representative Susan Schwab said : " To meet the Doha Round 's promise , developed and advanced developing economies need to open their domestic markets for agricultural goods , industrial products , and services . "
" Unfortunately , this week 's negotiations could not generate political consensus to meaningfully open markets to new trade - particularly in manufactured goods . "
EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson echoed this argument , saying that " while in Europe we are prepared to pay a lot , we can not do it on less to nothing in return " .
Commercial interests
The collapse of these secretive trade talks is a good opportunity to develop an alternative approach to trade
Joe Zacune , Friends of the Earth , trade campaigner Environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth greeted the collapsed talks as good news .
Trade campaigner Joe Zacune said : " The collapse of these secretive trade talks is a good opportunity to develop an alternative approach to trade that works for developing countries and the environment . "
He said the proposals had been driven mainly by the EU and the US putting " commercial interests of their corporations before the needs of poor communities and their natural resources " .
Following the collapse , the EU said it had been prepared to cut its average farm tariffs by more than half .
" It took decades to obtain the same result in industry .
We were prepared to eliminate export subsidies by 2013 and cut trade distorting domestic farm subsidies by more than 70 % . "
Prolonged negotiations
The Doha Round of talks - named after the Qatari capital where discussions started in 2001 - have been repeatedly delayed because of continuing disagreements .
A key meeting in Hong Kong in December 2005 that was due to have established the final agreement ended in failure , and negotiations have drifted since then , despite a series of follow - up talks .
World Trade Organization boss Pascal Lamy recently warned that without a breakthrough very soon , the Doha Round could be put on hold for several years .
In the US , the President will lose the authority to negotiate a trade deal without Congress 's ability to offer amendments on 1 July , making it more difficult to agree any future deal .

I dont have kids .
My friends dont have kids .
My experience with little kids is fairly limited .
However , i have fairly extensive experience with junior high and high school kids .
And y'know what ?
They 're spoiled , arrogant little assholes .
When I see some kid at the restaurant that wont take off his headphones or put away his PSP to eat dinner , I want to slap his parents in the face .
When I watch Nanny 911 or Supernanny and I hear some beanbag housewife whining that she cant control her 3 year old , I want to kick my television set to the floor .
When I hear some little crotchfruit at Meijers throwing a tantrum because he cant have a video game / candy bar / toy , I want to go up to him and scream at him as loudly as i possibly can , until my throat is raw and bleeding and i'm screaming a fine red mist all over this little shit 's face .
What the fuck ever happened to discipline ?
NO MEANS NO .
It doesnt even have to involve spankings , I was spanked maybe 3 times when I was a kid .
Those 3 times were enough .
YOU'RE the parent , YOU'RE the adult , YOU ARE IN CONTROL .
I 'm sorry , but if you 're 30 and cant control a 3 year old you belong in a home with someone spooning applesauce into your stupid piehole .
If you dont want to take the time to be a parent , dont have kids .
It IS a choice , if abortion is against your beliefs then give the baby up to one of the thousands of couples who cant have kids but desperatly want them .
( unless their gay , because we all know gay people cant raise babies .
two people who love eachother are only allowed children if the peepees dont match . )
Parenting takes time and effort , I 'm pretty sure on that one , and by time and effort I do NOT mean plunking them down in front of the television for 5 hours .
It does not mean buying a 4 year old an X - BOX 360 so " he wont get bored . "
HE'S 4 . A four year old can play with a box and some lawn chairs for hours on end , and be perfectly happy .
However , when the kid is stacking the lawnchairs on the box and then trying to stand on top of it and falls , YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SUE THE LAWN CHAIR COMPANY .
You were supposed to be watching him , hell , maybe helping him build his fort , not sitting on your ass in the other room talking on the phone , painting your nails , and watching Dr. Phil .
You are not entitled to monetary damages because you 're an idiot .
I wish I was a judge , I 'd be like Judge Judy except with more profanity .
People , the world has been dumbed down enough .
Stop freaking out and whining about television / music / games / movies and fucking it up for adults .
You dont like the vulgar music your kids listen to ?
I agree , it 's a little disturbing to have a 10 year old walking around singing " my humps " or " crazy bitch " , so maybe dont buy them the cd's ?
I like the cd's and I 'm 26 years old , but because of your bitching certain stores wont carry the cds I might enjoy .
You dont like violent video games ?
Quit waiting in line for 234231 hours the day after Thanksgiving to buy them x - box nine billion .
Does your 8 year old really need a shirt that says TEASE and itty bitty shorts that say JUICY on the butt ?
You want to paint her a big red sandwich board that says " PEDOPHILES PLEASE LOOK AT ME " while you 're at it ?
Exercise a little discipline and maybe some personal self - control .
You dont have to buy them everything they ask for .
Or , if some analogies might help you out here , quit digging your own grave , quit making the bed that you will sleep in , quit shooting yourself in the foot .
Do not buy a video game and then freak out and attempt to sue video game companies because it " made " your kid attempt to torch your neighbors cat .
Do some research .
Wait , that might take up some of your Days of our Lives programming time , maybe try it at night , after you shoot your husband down for sex because you 've been too tired " watching the kids " all day .
He can sneak off to his laptop to look at porn , you can sit in the living room and actually try making yourself a better parent .
It 's so much easier to do that without those pesky kids around .
Fuck you and your whiny , spoiled , irritating , pussy kids . ( and before you email me saying YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER SO YOU DONT KNOW , realize that I dont care .
Whether or not I 'm a mother has nothing to do with how crappy you are as a parent .
When I see your child , it 's in public , where they should be on their best behavior .
If this is how they act in public , good fucking luck with them at home . )
2 . Why would oil production begin to decline ?
Ca n't we extract oil as fast as we want to , until it finally runs out , many years from now ?
" Peak oil " is the term used to describe the situation when the amount of oil that can be extracted from the earth in a given year begins to decline , because geological limitations are reached .
Extracting oil becomes more and more difficult , so that costs escalate and the amount of oil produced begins to decline .
The term peak oil generally relates to worldwide production , but a similar phenomenon exists for individual countries and other smaller areas .
The message that " peak oil " may be a problem is now reaching respected publications like Business Week .
But how can a person learn more ?
Information about peak oil is often fragmented , and the quality of the sources is questionable .
The purpose of this article is to document some of what is known about peak oil , so that readers have a better framework for understanding our current situation .
Many links are provided , so that readers can dig deeper if they like .
I wrote this article to put together answers to questions someone new to peak oil might have and to directly counter some common misunderstandings .
One topic I talk about is CERA estimates .
While there is a little overlap with Oil Quiz - Test Your Knowledge , most of it is different .
Pass along a link or a PDF ( available below ) to your friends .
What happens is n't quite as simple as " running out " .
Instead of running out , oil gets progressively more difficult to extract .
When a well is first drilled , the oil is often under pressure , so comes out quickly with virtually no effort .
Later , pressure drops , and it becomes necessary to inject one of several gasses to repressurize the wells .
Finally , when even this ceases to keep production up , the remaining oil is pumped out at a slow rate .
Another reason for production tapering off is that oil companies tend to develop the fields which are expected to have the highest return first , and save the smaller fields and fields with more challenging production profiles ( such as deep sea oil , very viscous oil , and oil combined with toxic chemicals ) until later .
3 . Do we have any historical reason to expect that oil production will begin to decline at some point ?
When we look at oil production in any given area , the production tends to rise until approximately 50 % of the oil that will eventually be extracted is gone , and then begins to decline .
For example ,
Figure 1 shows oil production of the United States .
A similar pattern holds for North Sea oil production ( Figure 2 ) .
We have now reached the point where oil production is declining , apparently for geological reasons , in the majority of oil - producing countries .
It logical to expect that world oil production will eventually begin to decline .
4 . What does world oil production look like ?
Figure 3 shows recent world oil production ( blue line ) , plus a rough estimate of future demand for oil ( red line ) , assuming world oil desired usage continues to grow at 2 % per year .
On this graph , a person can see that world oil production was rising fairly steadily , but recently has " stalled out " .
Based on data of the United States Energy Information Agency ( EIA ) , oil production for 2005 was a little higher than that for 2006 .
Partial 2007 data suggests that 2007 production may be a little lower than that for 2006 .
Because of this " stalled out " condition , there is a growing gap between what the world would like for petroleum production , and what is actually being produced .
At this point , the countries that are suffering a shortfall because the current price is too expensive are mostly third world countries from Africa and Asia .
The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) has expressed concern that oil production is not high enough , and believes that Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) should produce more .
5. Can OPEC raise its production of petroleum ?
Many people suspect that the answer to this question may be no .
Some publications report that Saudi Arabia is having production difficulties , as are several other OPEC countries ( Kuwait , Iran , Nigeria and Venezuela ) .
Saudi Arabia does not admit to any production problems .
EIA data indicates declining oil production for Saudi Arabia , even before OPEC production cuts were announced in the fall of 2006 .
It is likely that we will learn the truth about OPEC 's ability to raise production this winter .
OPEC has its next planned meeting in September .
Unless something very unusual happens , there will be a need for significantly higher oil production .
OPEC 's actions at that time will tell what the real situation is .
6 . Does n't OPEC report very large oil reserves ?
It seems like those high reserves would assure us that OPEC can increase its production at will .
No , the high reserves are n't all that helpful .
First , there are serious doubts about the accuracy of OPEC 's oil reserves .
The reserves are not audited numbers .
Countries may be motivated to exaggerate them , so as to increase their OPEC production allocations .
Analyses such as this one suggest that the reserves are likely overstated .
Second , even if OPEC reserves are accurate , the reserves tell us nothing about the flow rate .
If the reserves include much very viscous oil , it may take years and large amounts of other resources to produce a relatively small flow of oil .
One important piece of detective work regarding Saudi oil reserves was done a couple of years ago .
Matt Simmons analyzed published scientific papers relating to Saudi oil wells , and determined that Saudi wells were reaching a serious state of depletion .
He documented his findings in the book Twilight in the Desert .
This book is now available in paperback , and has been translated into German and Chinese .
7 . What is the pattern of world oil production in the next few years expected to look like ?
We can't know for certain , but Figure 4 shows three possible oil production scenarios as dotted lines .
If OPEC production is now falling , it is likely that we are at " peak oil " now , because production for the rest of the world is flat .
If we are at peak oil , we might expect future oil production to follow a pattern similar to Scenario 3 ( the lowest dotted line , with production falling immediately ) or possibly Scenario 2 ( the middle dotted line , with production falling after a plateau ) .
Several respected energy industry insiders , including Matt Simmons , energy investment banker and author of Twilight in the Desert , and Samsam Bahktiari , retired iranian oil executive , believe that we are at peak oil now .
Scenario 1 ( the top dotted line ) shows a scenario in which peak oil is still a few years off .
Some scientists believe that this is a more likely scenario .
The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas Newsletter forecasts peak oil in 2011 , four years from now .
The PhD thesis of Fredrik Robelius showed that peak oil is expected to occur between 2008 and 2018 .
Chris Skrebowski , author of the Megaprojects analysis forecasts a worldwide peak in 2011 / 2012 .
8 . Does everyone forecast peak oil within approximately the next 10 years ?
No .
The US Energy Information Administration 's model is based on an approach that does not consider geological constraints .
Instead , it is based more on expected demand .
In Figures 3 and 4 , expected demand is the red top line .
Forecasts on this basis tend to be higher than those considering geological constraints .
Forecasts of the IEA appear to use similar logic , since IEA also assumes that OPEC can meet supply shortfalls .
Another organization that is known for its rosy production forecasts is Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) .
CERA 's production forecasts are widely quoted in the news media , but it is not clear that they are particularly accurate .
Some concerns :
• CERA 's clients are companies in the energy field .
One would expect that these companies would like to hear " good news " about future growth prospects .
Thus , CERA is likely to be under more pressure to produce favorable forecasts than are independent scientists .
• CERA 's forecasts do not appear to be reproducible by independent scientists .
Chris Skrebowski and Fredrik Robelius ( see Question 7 ) both use field - by - field analyses that are in many ways similar to CERA 's approach , but come to very different conclusions .
• Where it is possible to test actual production against forecasts , CERA 's forecasts seem high .
Euan Mearns notes that in March 2006 CERA presented a model for UK 2006 oil production capacity showing around 2,350,000 barrels per day -- around 700,000 barrels per day higher than the actual production figure .
9 . When was peak oil first predicted ?
M. King Hubbert , in 1956 , first predicted that US oil production for the 48 states would peak in 1970 .
This prediction turned out to be correct , to everyone 's surprise .
He also predicted a world - wide peak around 2000 .
10 .
Will alternative energy sources be able to make up for the shortfall in petroleum production ?
At this point , it seems unlikely that they will make up the shortfall .
On Exhibit 4 , the gap that needs to be filled is the gap between future demand ( the top line ) and actual future production ( something in the vicinity of the dotted lines ) .
Clearly , the sooner production begins to drop and the steeper the decline in oil production , the bigger the gap that needs to be filled .
Even if production stays level , there can be a gap because demand continues to increase .
At this point , there does not seem to be any " silver bullet " for replacing the lost oil production .
Oil is unique in its abundance , its high energy density , and its portability .
There do appear to be a number of possible silver BBs , however .
These include :
• ethanol from corn ,
• ethanol from sugar ( generally imported ) ,
• biodiesel ,
• cellulosic ethanol from biomass , and
• coal - to - liquid .
None of these appears to be very scalable , especially in a short time - frame .
In addition , there are other drawbacks -- cost , environmental damage , and for coal - to - liquid , climate change issues .
Indirect approaches to circumventing the shortage , like using battery operated cars , may be part of the picture as well .
If these are used , they will probably need to be phased in slowly , as existing cars are retired .
It is likely that conservation will need to be part of the mix .
11 . What is " Energy Returned on Energy Invested " or " EROEI " ?
This is a concept that a person runs into frequently , if one reads any of the more advanced articles about peak oil on the internet .
Analysis based on EROEI helps to explain why many scientists are discouraged about the newer energy prospects - both alternatives like ethanol and " unconventional " oil like oil sands .
EROEI is a measure of how much energy an investor gets out , compared to how much energy the investor puts in .
Some of the energy invested is not in fuel directly , but in things that are made using fuel , like oil rigs and refining equipment .
In the early days of oil , much of the oil extracted came from highly pressurized wells , so little effort was required to get the oil out .
At that time , the typical EROEI was about 100 .
As those wells became depleted , more and more effort was required to get the oil out .
A typical EROEI for oil is now about 15 , considering additional costs like repressurization of wells and drilling in underwater locations .
One problem that we are running into with " unconventional oil " and alternatives is that it takes a huge amount of effort ( in terms of energy expended ) to get the energy out .
EROEI is in the low single digits for oil sands , and is barely above 1 for ethanol from corn .
Oil in very deep sea locations is also expected to have a low energy return ( assuming it can be extracted at all ) , because of all the very fancy equipment required .
If we had a huge amount of other energy from a readily available source that we could use for producing oil and oil alternatives , such as natural gas or coal , a low EROEI would not necessarily be a big issue .
But it is now becoming clear that natural gas is in nearly as short supply as oil , at least in North America .
And coal has a lot of issues as well -- it is implicated in climate change , is mixed with toxic pollutants , is not as easy to transport , and is not in as unlimited supply as most believe .
When we have energy sources with a low EROEI , we are using a lot of fuel to get oil or oil alternative .
The energy we have left to do everything else we do -- build roads , build shopping malls , produce food -- is less .
I once heard an estimate that it takes an average EROEI of 6 to have enough energy left over to fuel today 's society .
If new energy sources all have EROEIs of 3 or less , we are likely to
• Need a large share of workers to work in energy - related occupations
• Have less energy left over for other uses
• Experience a significant fall in our standard of living
12 . What are the indirect impacts of peak oil likely to be ?
We do n't know for certain .
Some issues that have been raised include :
• Will the food supply be adequate , if farmers are not able to get fuel for for their equipment and transportation is disrupted ?
• Will it be possible to supply all of the products that are currently made with petroleum , including asphalt , many chemicals , fabrics , and building supplies ?
• If there is a shortage of oil , will the new alternative energy sources really be sustainable ?
For example , will it be possible to service windmills adequately , if there is a severe shortage of oil ?
Will it be possible to produce enough corn for ethanol ?
• Will people be able to repay their debt , if standards of living fall ?
Will lenders be willing to provide more long - term loans , if it appears likely that future transportation will be disrupted ?
• Will there be problems with the monetary system , if there are major debt defaults ?
• Will the many economic concepts that we hear so frequently continue to apply , such as " globalization " , " companies should grow " , " fungible oil supply " , and " increased price will lead to greater supply or substitution " ?
• Will countries fight about the remaining oil supply ?
13 .
If the peak oil story is really this important , why have n't we been reading about it in the newspapers for years ?
Are you claiming there has been some sort of conspiracy ?
No conspiracy .
Just of a lot of things that seem to work together :
• Oil = Power .
A country with lots of oil ( and other fossil fuels ) has great power .
It can manufacture what it wants , outfit big armies , and generally be at the top of the pecking order .
For this reason , government officials may be tempted to exaggerate strengths and gloss over weaknesses on the energy front .
This is true for almost every country with oil -- US , Saudi Arabia , Russia , Venezuela , and others .
• Embarrassment about the drop in US oil production .
Prior to 1970 , the US was the world leader in oil production .
It was the undisputed world leader in manufacturing , and the economy was growing rapidly .
In 1970 , oil production started to drop .
This was a shock , because very few believed the prediction Hubbert had made in 1956 .
The drop in oil production meant a changing world role - to more of a service economy , and relatively less power .
This whole discussion was left out of textbooks .
If it had been included , people would have realized that a decline in world oil production would be coming some day , just like the decline in US production .
• Faith in OPEC oil reserves .
The Saudi oil company Aramco was taken over by Saudi Arabia in 1980 .
Shortly thereafter , the amount of oil reserves was doubled , without finding any more oil .
Other OPEC countries soon followed suit , since higher reserves meant higher oil production targets under OPEC rules .
Current OPEC reserves appear to be seriously overstated , but they are repeated endlessly as fact , in news media and textbooks .
• Faith in technology .
The fact that oil production would eventually decline has been known for about 50 years .
But many people who were aware of this problem assumed that technology would somehow overcome the problem .
If peak oil is viewed as an easily solvable problem , there is no reason to tell the public about it .
• Faith in economic theory .
Economic theory says that if there is a shortage , higher prices will encourage greater production or substitution .
Therefore , there should be no reason to worry .
14 . Even with all of these things going on , it seems like the peak oil story would be better publicized than it has been .
What else has kept the story off the front page ?
There are number of other things :
• The people who have discovered the peak oil story are by and large technical people -- people working in academia , people working for oil companies , and scientists who are close enough to the situation to say :
Wait a minute .
We see a huge change coming .
Oil is near the point where world - wide production will drop and we are n't finding any major technological solutions .
All we are finding is some little things that together do n't look like they will cover more than a small percentage of the problem .
The economy cannot continue to grow the way it has grown .
In fact , it looks like a major cutback is in store .
• Peak oil people are not well funded .
Their organizations are volunteer organizations .
Some of their work is done on internet blogs .
It is hard for them to match well - funded organizations like CERA .
• Peak oil does not mix well with standard economic theory .
Economic theory is repeated so often that everyone nearly everyone takes it as science or fact .
It is only when people step back and realize that economic theory is just a theory , and that it does not necessarily apply in a resource constrained world , that they can understand the peak oil situation .
• Newspapers have a happy story to tell -- one of growth , entertainment , selling lots of SUVs .
It is hard for a news organization to publish the peak oil story when it is so much at odds with the main message of the paper .
15 .
So who are the people who know the peak oil story ?
In Washington D. C. , Representative Roscoe Bartlett ( R - MD ) is the leader on the issue of peak oil .
There are many others who are peak oil aware .
The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas ( ASPO ) now has organizations in 11 countries .
There are also quite a number of local peak oil organizations .
There are quite a few people involved with internet sites that publish peak oil information and discuss the peak oil story .
A few of note :
• TheOilDrum.com - " Discussions about energy and our future " Features well - researched articles written by its staff .
40 % of its readers have postgraduate degrees .
• EnergyBulletin.net - Publishes peak oil and related articles that others submit .
Has good indexing features .
No discussion .
• Globalpublicmedia.com - Publishes speeches and other audio media related to " a postcarbon world " .
• Speeches by Matt Simmons Slides for the speeches by the author of " Twilight in the Desert " can be found at this site .
• aspo-usa.com -
The web site of the US version of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas .
Offers a weekly and daily newsletter .
There are also many others web sites dealing with peak oil .
Many of these can be found by searching for the words " Peak Oil " .
16 . Are governmental leaders aware of peak oil ?
Many of them seem to be .
We know that the leaders of OPEC are aware of peak oil because OPEC 's magazine talks about the issue .
A speech by one of their members on peak oil is printed on page 58 of the November 2006 OPEC Bulletin .
We strongly suspect that Russian and Venezuelan leaders are peak oil aware , because of their aggressive recent actions .
They know that because of peak oil , they have more power , and are acting accordingly .
Representative Roscoe Bartlett ( R - MD ) reports that based on his meetings in China , Chinese leaders are very peak oil aware .
He reports that they have a five point plan for dealing with peak oil and are buying up all of the oil assets they can .
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney do not talk about peak oil , but there are many governmental reports relating to peak oil .
Some of these include
• Uncertainty About Future Supply Makes it Important to Develop a Strategy for a Peak and Decline in Oil Production .
US Government Accountability Office , February 2007 .
• Energy Trends and Implications for U. S. Army Installations E. T. Westervelt and D. F. Fournier , September 2005 .
• Peaking of World Oil Production , Impacts , Mitigation , and Risk Management R. L. Hirsch , R. Bezdek , and R. Wending , February 2005 .
For US Department of Energy .
A number of people have noted that both Iraq and Iran report significant oil reserves .
The question has been raised whether the US involvement in these countries is more than coincidence , given peak oil concerns .

By Kambiz Fattahi
BBC News , Washington
Georgetown University prides itself on its international student body
The BBC Persian Service 's Kambiz Fattahi recounts his own experience of being singled out on the basis of his appearance and asks whether fears of terrorism are undermining America 's traditional values .
People often ask if I have ever experienced prejudice in the US because of my Iranian background .
Up to now , I have always replied in the negative .
The last place I ever expected to encounter ignorance and apparent discrimination was at my university , a place renowned for international studies .
But last week , at Georgetown University 's graduation ceremony , I found myself in shock and awe .
In awe at the inspiring keynote speech about America 's tradition of freedom made by Harvard historian Dr Bernard Bailyn .
In shock at one particular display of America 's post - 9/11 insecurities and hyper-vigilance .
Back to reality
The university is located in the well - to - do Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC .
It was disturbing to think that nothing more than my Middle Eastern appearance had aroused someone 's suspicion
I was there to support a graduating classmate .
Sitting in the front row among proud parents , family and friends of graduating students , I was captivated by the speaker 's words .
" Nations and people do have dominant characteristics , and it's a good time , a necessary time , to think briefly about our own essential characteristics .
What others think about us , how we see ourselves , and how we actually are , matters . "
But , the sense of awe did not last long .
Two portly university security guards brought me back to reality .
" Please come with us , " one of them ordered .
He caught me off guard .
When I asked why , he told me , " You 're making some people here nervous . "
It was disturbing to think that nothing more than my Middle Eastern appearance had aroused someone 's suspicion .
More shocking was the blunt inquiry of one of the guards about my national origin .
I told him I was a US citizen .
After showing forms of identification , including my card from the BBC Persian Service , he commented : " So , you 're from Persia .
Are n't Babylon and the Tigris River in Persia ? "
Officials at Georgetown say they have strict policies prohibiting racial and ethnic profiling , and have begun an investigation into the matter .
" Pluralism in Action "
This prominent university boasts on its website of a student body representing over 130 countries , and requires its first - year students to complete a " Pluralism in Action " programme even before beginning their studies .
Given this , the guard 's cultural insensitivity took me by surprise .
But observers note that this kind of singling out has become pervasive in the US since the terror attacks of 9/11 .
A quarter of Muslim Americans say that , in the past year , " people have acted as if they were suspicious " of them , according to a new Pew Research Center study .
But , as my case demonstrates , this phenomenon is by no means limited to the Muslim community .
" People who are perceived to be Muslims , that are Middle Eastern , are being disparately treated , " says Arsalan Iftikhar , the legal director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations .
" A Sikh , who is not a Muslim , gets attacked and gets told , ' terrorist go home ' . "
Arshiyar Ali Shirazi , a Christian Iranian - American who has lived in the US since the age of two , recognises this trend .
Most people see names like Ali , Mohammad , Abdul , Reza and automatically associate them with the Middle East and terrorism
Arshiyar Ali Shirazi
Having graduated from university and dreaming of landing a job with the government , he goes by a more " American " name , Al . " I figured since the ' from ' line in a recruiter 's inbox is the first thing they see from you , why risk associating a strong resume and solid qualifications with a Middle Eastern - sounding name ?
" Most people see names like Ali , Mohammad , Abdul , Reza and automatically associate them with the Middle East and terrorism . "
The guards at Georgetown eventually let me go , too late to see my friend walk across the stage to collect her degree .
As I left the building - which nine months earlier had housed the Pluralism in Action programme - Georgetown 's President John J DeGioia 's remarks to the graduating class resonated in my head .
" You will face challenges - and enjoy opportunities - that previous generations of citizens and leaders , scientists and scholars could not even have imagined . "
Apparently , one of these challenges will be how America can address its insecurities , compounded by 9/11 and the immigration debate , all the while preserving its ideals of " liberty and justice for all " .

Setting the record straight ( Publ .
05/04/07 )
An article about the tanker truck that
crashed and burned a section of the MacArthur Maze suggested a California
Highway Patrol officer had direct knowledge about repairs to the truck .
CHP
Officer Dave Casey was speaking in general about how trucks address safety
violations .
The article also misstated that officers at CHP inspection stations
inspect trucks randomly .
All trucks that enter stations are fully inspected .
The tanker truck that erupted into a fireball and melted an Oakland freeway was one of the most trouble - prone in its company fleet , having been cited 27 times in the past 2 1/2 years .
In the past 15 months alone , the California Highway Patrol ordered the truck off the road for carrying too large a load , for driving on balding tires or for having a problem with the exhaust system , according to federal truck safety records obtained by MediaNews .
The truck was also cited , but not sidelined , for problems with its braking system .
“ It just raises a flag for all of us , ” said Richard Henderson , director of government affairs for the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance , an association of state and federal officials who promote motor vehicle safety in the United States , Canada and Mexico .
Whether these problems had anything to do with Sunday ’s crash is uncertain .
Officials at the scene of the crash on the MacArthur Maze – a web of elevated connector ramps near the Bay Bridge – have said only that it appears from skid marks that the driver was speeding .
Speeding drivers , however , are one of the biggest factors in truck crashes , according to a 2005 Department of Transportation study .
And if a vehicle malfunction is to blame – which is not often – bad brakes are responsible 30 percent of the time .
Tanker trucks are also among the most prone to rolling over due to excessive speed .
Tanker No. 94 ’s recent safety problems contributed to a sudden rise in serious safety violations for Sabek Transportation , a South San Francisco company that owns a fleet of eight trucks that haul gasoline from a refinery in Vallejo to the company ’s 20 or more Gas and Shop stations through the Bay Area every day .
In addition to brake problems , the wrecked tanker ’s citations included problems with lights and improper placarding of its hazardous materials certification .
Overall , the CHP issued 60 violations over the past three years to the company ’s eight trucks .
Sabek , which has received a satisfactory safety rating from the state over the years , did not return phone calls Wednesday .
The firm ’s trucks went from being ordered out of service once out of every four inspections in the 2004 - 2006 period , to three times out of every four , or 75 percent of the time over the past year .
That ’s three times the national average .
“ We ’ve just got to look more into what ’s behind that 75 percent rate because that ’s way above the norm , ” Henderson said .
Problems with brakes are the most common cause for inspectors ’ citations to trucking companies .
A MediaNews review of data on nearly 500,000 truck inspections in California during 2005 found that many other trucks from numerous companies were also penalized for brake problems several times in that year .
CHP commercial officer Dave Casey , who is posted at the Interstate 880 truck inspection site near Fremont , said most , if not all , of the truck ’s violations were probably corrected shortly after they were cited .
Trucks are required to stop at CHP inspection stations , where they are weighed and inspected randomly .
Minor violations are common and most citations are issued at these stations .
“ On most violations , truck drivers are supposed to finish their destinations and then take care of the problems before reloading and going back out on the road , ” according to CHP officer Rod Rodriguez .
CHP has a strict monitoring system of checks and balances , he said , including sending warning notices to trucking companies and making random checks of inspection records , Casey said .
Traffic has been diverted since the crash Sunday when driver James Mosqueda , 51 , lost control of his truck , which was hauling 8,600 gallons of gasoline on the overpass connecting I - 80 east to I - 880 south around 3:40 a.m .
The truck dragged along the guardrail , sparking an explosion and 2,000 - degree fire that melted the connector between I - 580 and I - 80 , just above where he crashed .
State officials said Wednesday they hope to have the 80 - to - 880 ramp fixed within 10 days .
While it will take time for investigators to sift through the debris , CHP officials have said they believe Mosqueda drove faster than the ramp ’s 50 mph speed limit at the time of the crash .
Mosqueda had a clean driving record for the past decade , according to CHP records .
What every entrepreneur , geek , brand manager and marketer needs to know about trademarks …
If you Google “ generic trademarks ” , you ’ll find a list on Wikipedia that includes , “ aspirin , bikini , brassiere , cola , crock pot , dry ice , escalator , granola , heroin , hula hoop , jungle gym , kiwi fruit , pilates exercise system , trampoline , videotape , Webster ’s dictionary , yo - yo , and zipper ” .
Each of these trademarks was worth many millions of dollars , and then , poof , it belonged to everyone .
Some people are worried about this .
Jeroen send me a note and asked me to riff about it … it even has a name : genericide .
In 1999 , I invented a trademark and wrote a book about it .
Yahoo still owns the trademark in Permission Marketing® , but a quick search will show you more than a million matches for the expression .
What ’s going on ?
I had to make a decision .
I could have pushed the world to call the ideas I wrote about , “ Permission - based Marketing ” .
Or , I could have been really flexible and encouraged people to call the approach the same thing I did .
I figured it was better to be the coiner of a phrase used by millions than to have a little corner of the world all to myself .
And that ’s part of the paradox of a trademark .
The purpose of a trademark is to help consumers by allowing them to be certain of the source of a good or service .
When you go to the store and buy some Mentos , you know you ’re getting real Mentos , the kind that fizz really well with Coke , not some sort of inferior of mento with a small ‘ m ’ .
The trademark does n’t just help the Perfetti Van Melle company in Kentucky , it helps you too .
If everyone knows your trademark , it means that your idea has spread .
It means that people are interested in what you sell and may very well decide to buy it from you .
In order to make it a trademark , most lawyers agree you need to follow a few superstitions ( superstitions because there ’s no official manual with definitive answers ) .
The first is that you ought to make it clear to the world that you know it ’s a trademark , that it indicates your product comes from a specific source .
So , putting ™ after your mark helps … and once per page / interaction is generally considered to be enough .
So you do n’t have to repeat the ™ over and over and over again in your copy or brochure .
It ’s tacky .
Adding ( c ) after your name is just dumb .
It does n’t mean a thing .
You can trademark just about any word or phrase , but that does n’t mean it will hold up .
The best trademarks are ‘ fanciful ’ , words like Yahoo ! or Verizon .
Next down the list are words that a bit descriptive , like Woopie Cushion , Wikipedia or JetBlue .
The worst kind of words are descriptive .
Yes , you can trademark the brand American Motors , but do n’t expect it to be particularly valuable or long lasting .
Some lawyers will get all excited and encourage ( demand ! ) that you register your trademark .
This involves paying a bunch of money , filing a bunch of forms and earning an ® after your name instead of the ™ .
While the ® does give you some benefits by the time you get to court , it does n’t actually increase the value of your trademark .
And you can wait .
So , when you come up with a great name , just ™ it .
One thing that has changed dramatically about trademarks is the world of domains .
If you own heroin.com , the brand becoming generic does n’t hurt you so much , because you ’re the only one who gets the traffic from the domain .
But now we get to the juicy part .
Let ’s say you ’ve invented a trademark and you fear it will become generic .
What now ?
My first advice is not to worry .
By the time aspirin became generic , the guys who developed it were super rich .
If actively protecting your trademark is going to get in the way of making your idea spread , the choice is obvious –spread the idea .
Every trademark that turns generic does so for the same reason : because it ’s the easiest way to describe something .
People did n’t say , “ That ’s a sexy Bikini® brand bathing suit . ”
Because the idea itself was bigger ( or smaller ) than a bathing suit , the new thing needed a name .
And the name we picked was bikini .
An iPod is an iPod , not an iPod brand mp3 player .
This is a long - term problem for Apple , and suing people who use the word ‘ pod ’ to describe other devices is n’t realy going to help them .
The challenge they have is that they invented a brand name for an item that needed a word .
Of course , it ’s not just a problem , it ’s a huge advantage .
If you had the chance to work at Apple five years ago , knowing what you know now , what would you do ?
Pick a name like “ The Deluxe Apple Brand MP3 player ? ”
Would you hassle the folks who coined the term “ podcast ” ?
Not me .
Yes , it ’s a great idea to think big , to ensure that you do n’t make mistakes early on that haunt you later .
But no , I do n’t think you should spend a lot of time imagining the bad things that will happen if you succeed and your idea and your name become intertwined .
You can Digg this article if you click here .
Notice that Digg is a verb , because there ’s really no easy way to say , “ You can recommend this article in a branded social news service like Digg™ by clicking here . ”
So Digg gets the power of spreading their idea .
Nobody says , “ Reddit this article by clicking here . ”
Back to the paradox .
Would you rather be Digg or Reddit ?
Is it better to have Google ’s problem ( notice I used “ Google ” as a verb in the second paragraph ? ) or to be ask.com and never get talked about ?
The best thing you can invent , as far as I can tell , is an idea that needs a name .
When they invented the Jeep® , there was no such thing as the SUV .
The Jeep became the name for that idea .
The lawyers at Chrysler worked superhard to keep the brand from becoming generic .
When the engineers cooked up the Xerox® , they had the same problem .
Now , people are happy to call it a copier .
You can recover from impending genericide .
What you ca n’t recover from is a clumsy name , or hindering your idea so it does n’t spread or coming up with a slightly better idea for something that already has a quite good enough name and idea .
Disclaimers : I ’m not a lawyer .
I do n’t even play one on TV .
If you rely on my legal advice , you ’re getting exactly what you paid for .
I called this post “ Godin on Trademark ” as a riff on Nimmer on Copyright .
The irony , of course , is that “ Nimmer ” became the almost generic phrase for expertise on the topic … you can look it up in Nimmer .

FREE Publications And Resources For Marketers
Recently I submitted a link to an article on Trinifar to Reddit , one of the most active in a category loosely known as “ social bookmarking ” sites .
These are sites where you can share with others links to websites or articles of interest .
On Reddit , submissions are voted up or down .
If one gets enough up - votes it moves to their front page and can send a lot of traffic to the site . [ 1 ]
That happened with this one , driving a barrage of visits to Trinifar ’s post .
That was good as the article had a message concerning population and limits to growth which needs to be seen by as many people as possible .
But that ’s not the end of it .
On Reddit , users also comment on the links submitted .
This one triggered a large and divided discussion on the question of limits to growth .
Among the comments were some I found thoughtful and incisive .
But there was also a range of arguments representing the “ cornucopian ” view popularized by the late economist Julian Simon .
( Note : the Wikipedia entry is written , in large part , by devotees of Simon . )
Simon , an economist and libertarian icon , maintained the earth ’s resources were limitless , at least in the sense that through advances in technology we would always be able to find substitutes for those we deplete .
He insisted further , that the human population could and should continue growing indefinitely , again because technological innovation would always bail us out of any problems our growth might cause .
He said , in fact , “ We have in our hands now–actually , in our libraries –the technology to feed , clothe , and supply energy to an ever - growing population for the next 7 billion years . ”
Today Simon ’s words are revered by far right libertarians [ 2 ] , free marketeers and übercapitalists , mostly in the US , opposing any whiff of government intervention in … anything .
Address population growth ?
Could that mean government funded programs of any sort ?
Then they ’re against it .
Protect the environment ?
Could that mean any kind of government regulation ?
They oppose it .
To oppose it as forcefully as possible , moreover , they even deny we ’re at or approaching any limits to growth .
It ’s as if their underlying thought process were , “ If we acknowledge population or environmental problems , then we have to argue over how to solve them .
If we lose there , it ’s over .
Instead , let ’s give ourselves two chances to win by refusing to acknowledge such problems in the first place .
Then , if we lose on that , we have another chance on the ‘ solutions ’ question . ”
( If you ’re familiar with the climate change debate , this strategy may sound familiar . )
This group tends to put their ideal of minimal government ahead even of the integrity of the ecosystem or the survival of most of its species .
They are heavily represented by young males , active on the Web .
Hence , Simon ’s views , unknown to most , do get a good deal of play on the Internet .
I participated in the Reddit discussion under the name , “ JFeeney . ” I ’d like to respond a bit further here .
Let ’s look at some representative comments from the discussion , starting with a couple which I believe demonstrate an accurate understanding of the limits to growth .
Recognizing finitude
From Ksero :
The earth ca n’t sustain infinitely many people .
Therefore , zero- population growth will eventually happen .
The only questions are when and why .
If we ’re smart and act in time , we can move to zero - population growth on our own terms .
If we do n’t , then nature will choose for us .
Wars .
Famines .
Pestilence .
The works .
From happyjuggler0 , in response to commenters who sarcastically suggested the only solution to population growth was to kill people :
There are three tried and true methods for reducing population growth : increasing the amount of general education , reducing deaths from disease and viruses , and increasing wealth .
Both are good summaries , the first of the limits - to - growth issue itself , the second demonstrating that draconian measures have nothing to do with solutions to population growth .
For more on possible solutions try these GIM posts .
And see the discussion on Reddit for additional comments from those aware the earth is indeed finite .
Simon says
What of the cornucopian Redditers ?
I ’ve been involved in other Web - based debates with cornucopians on this topic , but this one stood out in offering a particularly wide range of cornucopian variations on the theme that human growth has no limits .
First , degustibus said : “ Ehrlich already lost the bet . ”
The reference is to a 1980 bet on future commodity prices between Simon and Paul Ehrlich .
( It ’s mentioned in the Wikipedia article above . )
As a reference , degustibus linked to the site of a young male libertarian and population ( and climate change ) denier .
🙄
I pointed out on Reddit , and in more detail in the ensuing thread on Trinifar , that such bets mean little unless there are enough of them to have some statistical significance , and that Ehrlich ’s general point that population is a serious problem which is causing profound ecological damage has obviously been confirmed .
That Simon lost a subsequent , similar bet with David South and turned down an offer from Ehrlich and colleagues to bet on 15 additional future events , is only worth mentioning as a point of balance .
From kokey :
Many do n’t take into account how easily we ’ve been adapting .
At the moment even with many more people on earth than during Ehrlich ’s alamism food has been easier to produce and distribute since ever before . [ sic ]
Have we been adapting so easily ?
Today we have accelerating climate change , dwindling fish populations , massive deforestation , species loss at rates not seen since the extinction of the dinosaurs , and a miles long list of other tragic ecological problems .
We ’ve done so much damage to ecosystems worldwide that we ’re looking at a changed world for centuries to come .
We have , in fact , little idea what problems the future holds as cascade effects are likely to occur at points we ca n’t predict .
We might ask , “ Have we adapted at all ? ”
But , just below that , kokey concedes population could become a problem ( no concession it already is ) , saying :
As long as governments do n’t limit the natural movement of markets , resources will naturally become expensive as they become scarce , which will bring us the necessary solutions .
These solutions may include limiting birth rates , or other advancements in efficiency to reduce the particular scarcity .
This is an argument that we can approach or exceed limits to growth and the markets will take care of things for us as prices adjust and influence consumption trends .
One problem with this notion is that , by then , the damage done may be irreversible or nearly so .
Some of this has already occurred .
( Consider species extinction and the time required to recover from climate change . )
The second problem with the idea is its reliance on ideal conditions , which never exist in the real world , for its neoclassical - economics - based free market capitalism .
Given the capitalist system in place in much of the world today , and its far reaching impacts as a result of globalization , how well has it worked to protect the environment ?
Well , just look at the list of ecological catastrophes I began above .
Our current economic system has failed miserably to prevent serious environmental degradation .
And any thought that it might work better if only the markets were freer is not worth arguing about as we have only the real world in which to pursue our economic activity .
As Molly Scott Cato observes , “ Perfect competition is the central myth of the market system — Maria Mies called it capitalism ’s ‘ creation myth . ’ ” ( p. 33 )
Ground control to major Tom
Perhaps the most common theme among these cornucopians , though , was the belief that limits to growth on earth do n’t matter , as we will just leave earth to colonize other planets .
( This is what Simon was getting at in his comment above . )
I suppose it ’s natural for a lot of tech - oriented Reddit users to enjoy thinking about space colonization , but it ’s striking how quickly they jumped to this as a solution to population growth without , it seems , thinking the issue through in any depth .
Here ’s a comment from JulianMorrison :
[ I ] f we can keep running with one planet for another century , we ’ll have several .
Earth may be finite , but up in space it ’s raining energy and snowing resources .
And one from Randallsquared :
It ’s a choice between a future for humanity that ’s stagnant and about decline , and a future where humanity ( and humanity ’s descendants ) spreads off this planet and across the… universe , bringing life and intelligence to places that are now dead rock and ice .
As I said in the Reddit thread , both these commenters are saying , in essence , “ No problem if we trash this planet and eliminate half or more of the other species on it as well as a large percentage of our own kind ; eventually we can just move to another planet . ”
Moreover , as Trinifar asked in the thread , “ What evidence does anyone have to support humanity moving into space as anything but a dream ? ”
( The reply he got is obviously based either on misinterpretation of his question or on a debate tactic of answering a question he did n’t ask . )
But what if we did continue pressing the limits to growth on the assumption that we could move into space ?
We ’re at the limits right now .
How close are we to space colonization ?
And as Trinifar implied , is n’t it also risky to count on such an option when we have no clear evidence it will materialize in the foreseeable future ?
Randallsquared should realize that if humanity ’s future “ is stagnant and about to decline , ” perhaps that ’s because of our inability to live in harmony with the earth .
Why not rectify that rather than fantasize about running away from it ?
I ’ll post a link to this article on Reddit .
Perhaps some of the commenters from the thread there will stop by GIM to have another go .
If the submission “ hits ” at all there will no doubt be another discussion there as well .
Oh , where oh where will the levels of Redditness end ? 😯

In fairness , libertarians are a diverse group , and Simon ’s status would logically be greatest among those with the most antipathy toward environmental regulation .
There are no doubt some less committed libertarians who have never heard of him .

Might even a limits - to - growth approach be insufficient to secure a sound ecological future ?

Police Report Details Craig Arrest on Lewd Conduct Charge
Tuesday , August 28 , 2007
ADVERTISEMENT
According to a Hennepin County , Minn. , court docket , Idaho Sen .
Larry Craig pleaded guilty to a disorderly conduct charge on Aug. 8 , with the court dismissing a charge of gross misdemeanor interference to privacy .
The court docket said Craig paid $ 575 in fines and fees and was put on unsupervised probation for a year .
A sentence of 10 days in the county workhouse was stayed .
According to the prosecutor 's complaint , airport police Sgt. Dave Karsnia , who was investigating allegations of sexual conduct in airport restrooms , went into a stall shortly after noon on June 11 and closed the door .
• Click here to read the police report for Sen. Larry Craig .( pdf )
Minutes later , the officer saw Craig gazing into his stall through the crack between the stall door and the frame , fidgeted with his fingers and returned to gazing through the stall for about another two minutes .
After a man in the adjacent stall flushed the toilet and left , Craig entered it and put his roller bag against the front of the stall door , " which Sgt.
Karsnia 's experience has indicated is used to attempt to conceal sexual conduct by blocking the view from the front of the stall , " said the complaint , which was dated June 25 .
The complaint said Craig then tapped his right foot several times and moved it closer to Karsnia 's stall and then moved it into the area of the officer 's stall to where it touched Karsnia 's foot .
Karsnia recognized that " as a signal often used by persons communicating a desire to engage in sexual conduct , " the complaint said .
Craig then passed his left hand under the stall divider into Karsnia 's stall with his palms up and guided it along the divider toward the front of the stall three times , the complaint said .
The officer then showed his police identification under the divider and pointed toward the exit " at which time the defendant exclaimed ` No ! , ' " the complaint said .
The Aug. 8 police report says that Craig had handed the arresting officer a business card that identified him as a member of the Senate .
" What do you think about that ? "
Craig is alleged to have said , according to the report .
Internal AMD Memo Encourages Rapid Company - Wide Vista Adoption
Today , Intel 's Paul Otellini said that they are n't moving to Windows Vista until SP1 .
ZDNet 's Larry Dignan has the details :
Speaking at the Bank of America Technology conference in San Francisco , Otellini was asked about his take on Vista and whether it could drive demand .
For corporations , Otellini said Vista upgrades will be slow .
" I know of no organization doing an upgrade before SP1 , " said Otellini .
" Intel is n't upgrading either ( until SP1 ) . "
Otellini , however , noted corporate uptake wo n't hurt Microsoft because most enterprises have commercial licenses that are " all you can drink . "
Oh , but wait a second , so lemme get this straight .
Intel has taken the same position on Vista as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation ?
Since when did the world 's largest processor manufacturer decide to take the same upgrade cycle as the Federal Government ?
Holy crap man , my Grandma's on a quicker upgrade cycle than the government is !
Personally , I think that 's completely irresponsible .
Intel is the worlds largest processor company .
How can they optimize their experience for Vista if they 're not going through the same pains we are ?
It 's no wonder Intel STILL does n't have Viiv drivers for x64 , and why we 're still waiting for other Vista drivers from their teams .
Why is Viiv taking so long ?
Half the Viiv technology is built in .NET , which we already know runs on x64 ?
They 're setting a terrible example for the industry .
Intel said they " know of no other company doing an upgrade before SP1 " , which means they probably do n't know their competition very well .
As you 're about to see , AMD is acutely aware of theirs .
I 've obtained an internal AMD memo from a source inside the company on this very topic .
It 's from Chief Marketing Officer Henri Richard ( he 's the # 2 guy , BTW ) which paints a completely different tone .
I thought about only posting excerpts , but it 's important to see the overall tone and context vs .
Intel , so I 'm publishing the whole thing .
INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
Date : January 4 , 2007
To : All AMDers
From : Henri Richard , Executive Vice President , Chief Sales and Marketing Officer
Subject : Once - in- a- Lifetime Opportunity My Fellow AMDers ,
We are at the start of 2007 and already a momentous change is underway .
The global IT industry is preparing for one of the most dramatic technological shifts in its history :
The launch of Microsoft Windows Vista™ .
This powerful and innovative new operating system will arrive in just a few weeks and will bring with it a new computing revolution that will forever alter the way people and organizations around the world think about , use and interact with PCs .
Make no mistake , Windows Vista represents one of the most important technology milestones of this decade and the benefits it offers will reverberate for years to come .
The global business community – including AMD – is already moving swiftly to adopt Windows Vista because of the many advanced security , performance , productivity and user experience features it offers .
Analysis compiled by several financial institutions and industry analyst firms shows that enterprise customers are planning to deploy Windows Vista across their organizations far more quickly than they did Windows XP .
The same holds true in varying degrees for small business users and , of course , consumers , who will lead the charge .
Windows Vista also promises to redefine mobile computing and is expected to become the OS of choice for the vast majority of mobile business users in the next 12 - 18 months .
By all accounts , Windows Vista is poised to become the most widely used and most rapidly adopted operating system in Microsoft ’s history .
When Windows Vista launches on January 30th , AMD will immediately occupy some of the most valuable real - estate on the technology landscape and we must act swiftly and smartly to ensure we reap our rightful reward .
No other company in our industry – not even our most aggressive competitors – can offer the complete , customer - centric Windows Vista experience , as intended by Microsoft , the way the new AMD can .
We are a global leader in both discrete and integrated graphics , we offer a full range of powerful and power - efficient x86 microprocessors , and we provide advanced chipsets that support the majority of x86 and PC graphics processors available today , regardless of manufacturer or brand .
Unlike our competitors , AMD is not constrained by any limitations when it comes to offering the ultimate Windows Vista experience .
We have no agenda or internal mandate to push one technology over another at the expense of customer value or to the detriment of Windows Vista ’s potential .
The fact is , AMD is the quintessential Windows Vista partner simply because no other IT company 's mission and product offering aligns so thoroughly with Microsoft 's vision .
The more successful Windows Vista is , the more successful AMD can be , pure and simple .
The only way we can fail is if we choose to let this opportunity slip away .
So I am calling on all AMD employees to recognize and embrace everything Windows Vista represents and make it part of our DNA , to understand that we hold the keys to the kingdom in ways no one else does .
[ Emphasis mine ]
We can become the semiconductor platform of choice for every company in Microsoft ’s ecosystem that touches Windows Vista in any way .
And the first expression of this vision will be unveiled at CES next week with the launch of our “ Better By Design ” campaign .
Let ’s start 2007 at a new pace that will leave our competition behind .
Now is the time .
Let ’s make the most of it .
I mean , it 's a position that is light - years apart from Intel .
My source tells me that AMD had a groups of Microsoft consultants come in and advise them about a rollout plan that would make the most sense to them , and they 're in the middle of executing that plan .
Vista is being deployed at AMD from the top - down , with about 100 users ( most of the AMD executives , plus others ) using it right now , with many others coming online soon .
He said that those people have been running Vista & Office 2007 since September , and that " satisfaction has been high while reported issues have been very low " .
Maybe Intel was too busy joining in on the Steve Jobs Circle Jerk to realize that Vista is a game that Intel should be on top of , and that thousands of people tested the hell out of it .
Just one more reason that I think AMD will be gaining some pretty significant ground over the next few years .

Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , annually voted one of the 2 or 3 smartest men in Congress in thepoll of Capitol Hill aides , was on FIRE on Bill Maher 's TV show the other day .
Bill asked his guests what 's up with all these gay Republican officials being dragged out of their closets .
He aimed his barb particularly at Idaho right - wing extremist and arch - homophobe Larry Craig , a Bush rubber stamp senator who was recently outed .
Barney kind of passed on that one -- although with great aplomb -- and then went on to the heart of the problem .
" The right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy and people who want to demonize other people should n't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves . "
But he was just getting warmed up .

18/10/2006 Bionade : the triumph of a guiltless pleasure The Bionade story is the David and Goliath story of the soft - drink industry .
Cornelius and Fabian Lange travel to Ostheim vor der Rhön to meet the people who brought lemonade home .
Ostheim vor der Rhön in northern Bavaria is a pretty place but the Peter brewery does n't do it any favours .
The neon sign flashing on the roof is missing a " p " and the second " e " , the plaster on the facade is coming away and the leaves on the yucca tree inside the brewery hang limp .
It 's a typical family brewery : the weak buckle first .
For years vultures circled overhead , as the brewery teetered on the edge of bankruptcy and everyone prepared themselves for the worst .
With the exeption of one man – the master brewer and inventor , Dieter Leipold .
He was dreaming the dream of all inventors – to come up with a groundbreaking new product .
And to get rich , very rich .
Whenever Leipold withdrew to push on with his research , he was fleeing the depressing reality of the brewery and the hops and malt which were n't bringing in any money .
When the situation reached crisis point in the eighties , the family opened a disco on their factory premises .
From nine at night till five in the morning Leipold was chained to the beer tap ; " Fill yourself with Peter beer " went the motto , aimed at drawing in young people from the area around Schweinfurt , Fulda and Erfurt , who wanted to get drunk and have a dance .
That kept their heads above water .
But what was Leipold looking for ?
" I brew beer so I know about biotechnology and understand microorganisms .
I wanted to develop an alcohol - free soft drink . "
It took him 8 years to perfect the technique of brewing an organic barley drink .
" But no gentlemen , you do n't brew it !
It ferments " .
Excuse me .
Alcohol is produced by brewing .
With microorganisms Leipold produces gluconic acid , which you can find in honey .
Bionade shot like a meteorite though Germany 's soft drink industry .
Peter Leipold owns the patent as well as the name , Bionade , and he invites me to lunch .
His wife Sigrid serves up a dish of rabbit provençale with roast dumplings .
Naturally it 's all washed down with Peter pils .
Sigrid Peter - Leipold is the grey eminence at Bionade .
She stays behind the scenes but evidently knows the ropes and has something to say .
" We offered the Bionade license to other breweries so that they could also develop a soft drink on the market that was somehow linked to their brewery skills .
But they were n't the slightest bit interested .
So we decided to make Bionade ourselves . "
Leipold no longer gets involved in the day - to - day business .
" I 've fully provided for myself , " he says .
His step - son Peter Kowalsky has now taken over the reins .
The 38 - year - old 's aqua blue eyes are serene as he rattles off his figures .
" In 2004 we filled 7 million bottles of Bionade , in 2005 , 22 million .
In 2006 we 'll easily reach 66 million – the summer is n't over yet . "
The walls may be peeling but at Bionade everyone 's happy , particularly the hordes of new employees who were on social benefits until recently .
" No one believed in them , " says Kowalsky , " just like no one believed in our brewery " .
Now they do shifts day and night , 22 thousand bottles an hour , four hundred thousand a day .
Germany is thirsty , thirsty for Bionade .
It 's even surprised Kowalsky .
" We 've got technicians just building fermentation tanks .
They 've been here for a year .
Incredible ! "
The concentrate for Bionade needs to ferment in the tanks for five days .
The mixture of water and the organic barley malt produce the gluconic acid and carbon dioxide .
That is then diluted with water ( one part concentrate to five parts water ) and organic sugar , juice concentrates and carbonic acid are added .
Although production is non-stop , it 's still no way near enough .
" We are always having to ask the outlets to be patient , " says Kowalsky .
He tries to squeeze as many extra bottles out of the current production as possible .
" Soon we 'll be setting up at the end of Füll street . "
And then he starts doing his sums aloud .
" That 's another one thousand bottles per hour .
We 're filling bottles 18 hours a day and 220 days a year , which makes , " he trails off , his lips search for a number that his brain has n't figured out yet .
" Well , it definitely adds up to a hefty sum ! "
Rewe , Edeka , Tegut , Metro , Ikea – all these shops have fallen for Bionade overnight and in such a big way that they 're even doing away with the listing fees that are normally required when they introduce something new into their product line .
" One wanted 1,5 million euros from us just for the honour of being on their shelves , " says Kowalsky .
" In the end we still got in for free . "
There 's a loud boom in the yard as yet another lorry swallows twenty pallets of the wonder drink .
The storage supplies only last up to 2 hours .
One small glitch sends the whole distribution chain into disarray .
" We 've been careering along a knife - edge at 200 mph for the last 2 years . "
Kowalsky looks like the cat that got the cream , but you can sense his fear that he wo n't be able to keep pace with demand .
He 's not putting a penny more into the old dump of a factory .
" In the autumn we 'll have a new production facility on the other side of the road . "
At the moment it 's just a car park .
What triggered the success of Bionade ?
The big bang was in 1998 in the Gloria bar in Hamburg .
The bar 's owner , Falco Wambold , had discovered Bionade at Internorga , a restaurant and catering trade fair .
No one had heard of it before – he put it on his menu .
And then Bionade conquered the republic .
What is it about this drink which originally only appealed to the fringes of society ?
There 's no colouring , not too many bubbles and little sugar – only half the amount found in similar drinks .
The palate gets a refreshing but restrained kick from the acids , mixed with the utmost care .
With the second mouthful the drink unfolds its secret and breaks all the soft drink rules .
There are 4 different flavours – elderflower , herb , lychee and ginger - orange .
The thirsty customer has a choice and not just between these four , but between good and bad ; between the sticky soft - drink empire of Coke , Pepsi , etc. which has taken on such mammoth dimensions that it virtually squashes all other alternatives , or the little , innocent lemonade from the franconian Rhön district .
It stands for guiltless pleasure .
Lemonade is coming home : this is what home tastes like !
" We decided not to play games , " says Kowalsky as he talks about their marketing concept which steers clear of flashy images .
And that 's why people do n't just drink it , they empathise with it .
You 're not just quenching their thirst .
You 're making a statement by taking a swig from a Bionade bottle .
With coke you 're a consumer , putty in the hands of globalisation .
With Bionade , you 've got personality .
And it 's exactly this group that the drinks industry had failed to reach .
It took them a while to notice the little meteorite from Rhön , silently growing until it hit the jackpot .
When the Cola company descends , not even their all - purpose weapon – lots of money – can keep Bionade in check .
" So you do n't want to be rich ? " was the reply that came from the Coke bosses from Atlanta during a meeting with the brewers from Ostheim at the Adlon hotel in Berlin .
Bionade had just fended off a very generous bid .
That was in 2004 and the family already knew how much the company was worth .
And for them it 's not just about money .
It 's about honour , about Ostheim , about the Rhön district and Hartz IV ( social benefits ) .
" What would we have done with all the money ?
Bought an island ? " asks Kowalsky .
How much did they offer ?
" We can't tell you that , but Bionade is currently worth about 100 million euros , " says Sigrid Peter - Leipold in the dining room before taking the plates back into the kitchen .
Meanwhile Peter Kowalsky has big plans up his sleeve .
" At the moment we need 100 tonnes of organic elderflower concentrate per year .
In the future I want to buy this from the farmers in the Rhön district .
The first 50 acres of elderflower have already been sown . "
And this is where his dream really takes root .
" Soon the farmers in Ostheim could be solely producing Bionade .
The organic barley could soon be coming directly out of the Rhön district .
From the Bionade valley ! "

Lesson 1 . Doing something is better than doing nothing .
" You should go to the studio everyday , " a University of Michigan art professor named Richard Sears told his students .
" There 's no guarantee that you 'll make something good -- but if you do n't go , you 're guaranteed to make nothing . "
The same is true of science .
Every research plan has flaws , often big , obvious ones -- but if you do n't do anything , you wo n't learn anything .
I have been asked to write six columns for the journal Nutrition about common scientific mistakes .
The mistakes I see are mostly mistakes of omission .
A few years ago I visited a pediatrician in Stockholm .
She was interested in the connection between sunlight and illness ( children are much healthier in the summer ) and had been considering doing a simple correlational study .
When she told her colleagues about it , they said : Your study does n't control for X .
You should a more difficult study .
It was awful advice .
In the end , she did nothing .
Science is all about learning from experience .
It is a kind of fancy trial and error .
But this modest description is not enough for some scientists , who create rules about proper behavior .
Rule 1 .
You must do X ( e.g. , double - blind placebo - controlled experiments ) .
Rule 2 .
You must not do Y ( e.g. , " uncontrolled " experiments ) .
Such ritualistic thinking is common in scientific discussions , hurting not only the discussants -- it makes them dismissive -- but also those they might help .
Sure , some experimental designs are better than others .
It 's the overstatement , the notion that experiments in a certain group are not worth doing , that is the problem .
It is likely that the forbidden experiments , whatever their flaws , are better than nothing .
One group that has suffered from this way of thinking is persons with bipolar disorder .
Over the last thirty years , few new treatments for this problem have been developed .
According to two researchers in the area , " many of us in the academic community have inadvertently participated in the limitation of a generation of research on bipolar illness . . . by demands for methodological purity or study comprehensiveness that can rarely be achieved " [ 1 , p. 71 ] .
A variation of this problem is to ignore evidence that does not meet some level of rigor .
An example is a recent panel report [ 2 ] on the value of multivitamin / mineral supplements .
“ We strongly criticize the panel ’s decision , ” wrote Ames , McCann , Stampfer , and Willett [ 3 ] , “ to base policy recommendations only on evidence from RCTs [ randomized clinical trials ] . . .
The panel proudly points to the fact that , even though folate was well known to decrease the risk of neural tube defects in animal studies , policy recommendations for folate supplementation to prevent neural tube defects were delayed while authorities waited some years for confirmation from RCTs .
One can only wonder how many infants were born with neural tube defects while authorities waited . ”
Rituals have right and wrong .
Science is – or should be -- more practical .
The statistician John Tukey wrote about ritualistic thinking among psychologists in an article called " Analyzing data : Sanctification or detective work ? " [ 4 ] .
One of his examples involved measurement typology .
The philosopher of science N. R. Campbell had come up with the notion , popularized by Stevens [ 5 ] , that scales of measurement could be divided into four types : ratio , interval , ordinal , and nominal .
Weight and age are ratio scales , for example ; rating how hungry you are is an ordinal measure .
The problem , said Tukey , were the accompanying prohibitions .
Campbell said you can add two measurements ( e.g. , two heights ) only if the scale is ratio or interval ; if you are dealing with ordinal or nominal measures , you cannot .
The effect of such prohibitions , said Tukey , is to make it less likely that you will learn something you could have learned .
( For more about the trouble with this typology , see [ 5 ] . )
I fell victim to right - and - wrong thinking as a graduate student .
I had started to use a new way to study timing and had collected data from ten rats .
I plotted the data from each rat separately and looked at the ten graphs .
I did not plot the average of the rats because I had read an article about how , with data like mine , averages can be misleading -- they can show something not in any of the data being averaged .
For example , if you average bimodal distributions you may get a unimodal distribution and vice - versa .
After several months , however , I averaged my data anyway ; I can't remember why .
Looking at the average , I immediately noticed a feature of the data ( symmetry ) that I had n't noticed when looking at each rat separately .
The symmetry was important [ 6 ] .
A corollary is this :
If someone ( else ) did something , they probably learned something .
And you can probably learn something from what they did .
For a few years , I attended a meeting called Animal Behavior Lunch where we discussed new animal behavior articles .
All of the meetings consisted of graduate students talking at great length about the flaws of that week 's paper .
The professors in attendance knew better but somehow we did not manage to teach this .
The students seemed to have a very strong bias to criticize .
Perhaps they had been told that " critical thinking " is good .
They may have never been told that appreciation should come first .
I suspect failure to teach graduate students to see clearly the virtues of flawed research is the beginning of the problem I discuss here :
Mature researchers who do n't do this or that because they have been told not to do it ( it has obvious flaws ) and as a result do nothing .
Leonardo da Vinci put it nicely : “ If they are unable to see what is divine in Nature , which is all around them , how will they be able to see their own divinity , which is sometimes hidden ? ”

It 's easy to fall into the trap : A workout buddy passes along an exercise tip , and then you pass it on to several folks you know .
Your kid ’s coach gives you advice , and sure enough you hear the same thing from several other parents .
So you figure it must be true .
But experts say that in the world of fitness , myths and half - truths abound – and some of them may be keeping you and your family from getting the best and safest workout .
" Some myths are just harmless half - truths , but many others can actually be harmful , " says professional triathlete and personal coach Eric Harr , author of The Portable Personal Trainer .
" They can cause frustration in working out and sometimes even lead to injury , " he notes .
One reason myths get started , says Harr , is that we all react to exercise a little differently .
So what 's true for one person may not be true for another .
" In this sense you sometimes have to find your own ' exercise truths ' – the things that are true for you , " says Harr .
That said , experts say there are also some fitness myths that just need busting , and the sooner the better !
To help put you and your family on the path to a healthier , safer , and more enjoyable workout , WebMD got the lowdown from several top experts on what 's true and what 's not when it comes to exercise tips .
WASHINGTON -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said yesterday that the United States should consider a military strike against Iran because of Tehran 's alleged involvement in Iraq .
" I think we 've got to be prepared to take aggressive military action against the Iranians to stop them from killing Americans in Iraq , " Lieberman said .
" And to me , that would include a strike over the border into Iran , where we have good evidence that they have a base at which they are training these people coming back into Iraq to kill our soldiers . "
The United States accuses Iran of fostering terrorism and Tehran 's nuclear ambitions have brought about international reproach .
Lieberman , the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 who now represents Connecticut as an independent , spoke of Iranians ' role in the continued violence in Iraq .
" We 've said so publicly that the Iranians have a base in Iran at which they are training Iraqis who are coming in and killing Americans .
By some estimates , they have killed as many as 200 American soldiers , " Lieberman said on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
" Well , we can tell them we want them to stop that , " Lieberman said .
" But if there 's any hope of the Iranians living according to the international rule of law and stopping , for instance , their nuclear weapons development , we can't just talk to them . "
" If they do n't play by the rules , we 've got to use our force , and to me , that would include taking military action to stop them from doing what they 're doing , " he added .
Lieberman said much of the action could probably be done by air , although he would leave the strategy to the generals in charge .
" I want to make clear I 'm not talking about a massive ground invasion of Iran , " Lieberman said .
To deal with Iran 's nuclear ambitions , Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson said tough negotiation is called for .
" I would talk to them , but I would build an international coalition that would promote and push economic sanctions on them , " Richardson said on CNN's " Late Edition . "
" Sanctions would work on Iran .
They are susceptible to disinvestment policy .
They are susceptible to cuts , economic sanctions in commodities . "
On Friday , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that Iran 's detention of at least four Americans is unwarranted but that it would not stop Washington from trying to engage Iran on other matters , including its disputed nuclear program and alleged support of insurgents in Iraq .
Iran yesterday confirmed that it has detained a fourth Iranian - American , a peace activist from California .
The statement seems certain to further rile relations between the two countries .
Mohammad Ali Hosseini , the spokesman for Iran 's foreign ministry , confirmed at his weekly briefing in Tehran that Iranian - American Ali Shakeri is being held .

558 : The dome of the Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople collapses following an earthquake .
Built by the decree of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian , the Hagia Sophia was completed in 537 , only five years after construction began .
Given the scope of the ambitious project , it turned out to be something of a rush job , a fact that has plagued the building over the centuries .
Justinian intended the cathedral to stand as the ultimate symbol of his empire ’s Byzantine Christian faith , and its design , both in concept and scale , was unprecedented .
The massive dome rises 210 feet above the floor and has a diameter of 110 feet .
The original architecture proved unstable for handling so large a structure .
Following two other partial collapses of the dome , the Hagia Sophia was reinforced with four large buttresses to provide better stability .
The dome and the buttresses remain the building ’s outstanding characteristics to this day .
The Hagia Sophia remained a jewel in the crown of Eastern Christendom and the see of the Patriarch until 1453 , when Mehmet the Conqueror , the Ottoman sultan , took Constantinople and converted the cathedral into a mosque .
It would remain an Islamic holy place until 1935 when it was converted again , this time into a museum , by the secular Turkish state .
Evidence of both its Christian and Muslim past resonate in the building to this day .
In a city of landmarks , the Hagia Sophia , or Ayasofya , is perhaps modern Istanbul ’s most famous .

Europe 's Coolest Cities Tallinn , Estonia 's Wired Capital

A South Carolina inmate notorious for filing frivolous and fanciful lawsuits against public figures has used his latest complaint to accuse Apple chief executive Steve Jobs of employing O.J. Simpson as a " hitman " for the past two decades , in addition to a litany of other outlandish offenses .
Filed September 21 in the United States District Court Middle District of Florida , the 3 - page handwritten complaint alleges that Simpson has been Jobsâs " hitman " since the " 1985 MOVE house bombing in Philadelphia , which Jobs started with borrowed pyrotechnics from Great White . "
The plaintiff is none other than 30 year old Jonathan Lee Riches , who in 2004 earned himself an 8 - year sentence in a South Carolina corrections facility for his involvement in an identity theft ring .
Over the past 18 months he has filed dozens of similar lawsuits accusing celebrities and organizations of wildly improbable offenses , presumably to help pass his time behind bars . Â
Riches ' latest rambling , which has since been dismissed , goes on to allege that " O.J. has been providing Jobs with food blenders since the midwest flood of 1993 " and that O.J. also " paid Jobs to clone Dolly the sheep on April 20 , 1998 . " Â
As for his other roles in the legal escapade , Jobs is charged with aiming nuclear missiles at Riches ' brain and Lance Armstrong 's bicycle , as well as price gouging iPhone customers .
" On May 10th , 2007 , I bought an Apple iPhone for $ 922.01 at the FCI Williamsburg commissary , " Riches wrote .
" Now Jobs sells that same iPod for $ 199 . "
The remainder of the complaint continues in the same outlandish vein , with Princess Diana , the United Auto Workers , and Cinderella 's Castle each making appearances , among others .
" A cursory review of the complaint is sufficient to establish that it is nothing more than fanciful nonsense , " US District Judge Gregory Presnell wrote in his order for dismissal .
" The whole thing reads like a cross between Billy Joelâs ' We Didnât Start the Fire ' and a Dr. Bronnerâs soap label , if Dr. Bronner had been a first - year law student with untreated paranoid schizophrenia . "
Judge Presnell went on to say that this was not Riches 's first appearance before him , and pointed out that Riches even has his own Wikipedia entry chronicling some of the dozens ofÂ similar suits he has filed in federal courts across the country . Â
" Several weeks ago , he filed suit against Elvis Presley and Neverland Ranch for , inter alia , ' WAR CRIMES Rock N Rollin My Brain ' , " the Judge wrote . Â
While it 's unclear whether Riches ' cockamamy pleadings are products of actual mental illness or simply a hobby akin to short story writing , all complaints filed with the US court system have to be processed , filed and dismissed . Â
" Whatever their origin , and though they are amusing to the average reader , they do nothing more than clog the machinery of justice , interfering with the courtâs ability to address the needs of the genuinely aggrieved , " the Judge wrote .
" It is time for them to stop . "
Rather than impose sanctions on Riches , the Court will simply require that he pay the filing fee with any future complaints , which he has failed to do in the past .
Should those requirement fail to dissuade him from further meritless filings , the Court plans to impose stiffer requirements or sanctions until he " finds another way to occupy his time . "
In almost 20 years of research , it has been the home of some of the most daring ideas to aid exploration : space elevators , crops that could grow on Mars and a shield to protect our planet from global warming .
But now Nasa 's Institute for Advanced Concepts ( Niac ) has fallen victim to a very down - to - earth problem - a lack of money .
The US space agency is set to close its futuristic ideas factory as part of a cost - cutting exercise which it hopes will help pay for ambitious plans to explore the moon and Mars .
Bobby Mitchell , who works at Niac 's headquarters in Atlanta , told the Guardian : " From what I understand , Nasa are out of money .
We have n't got an official notice yet but we have heard from Nasa that they are going to discontinue funding . "
Former Nasa scientist Keith Cowing said the decision to close Niac was " just plain stupid " .
Writing on his Nasa Watch website , he directed comments to Nasa 's administrator , Mike Griffin : " Advanced spacesuits ... will open the surface of the moon - and then Mars - to meaningful and productive human exploration .
Where are you going to get all of the things you need to put on those Ares rockets so as to allow their crews to carry out their missions , Mike ?
Or do you ' just need a good map ' ?
Explorers without the right tools die - or turn around - and head back home .
Wrong answer , Mike . "
Niac was set up in 1988 as a way to brainstorm revolutionary ideas that go beyond anything Nasa does today .
It draws $ 4 m ( £ 2.04 m ) every year from the agency 's $ 16bn budget and funds about a dozen projects every year for long - term ideas , things that could come to fruition within 10 to 40 years .
The institute is most interested in grand visions and big ideas that might inspire new technologies - and scientists have traditionally been told they should not feel encumbered by what is possible today .
Ideas where the technology to make something work has not yet been developed or the science is not entirely understood are welcomed .
Despite this wide remit , Niac has kickstarted several ideas that have subsequently been picked up for further development by Nasa .
Most recently , Nasa got interested in a Niac project called the New Worlds Imager , a space probe designed to take pictures of planets outside our solar system .
Taking such pictures is difficult because light coming from the planets is obscured by stars .
To get around this , Webster Cash , of the University of Colorado at Boulder , planned a pair of spacecraft - a starshade ( the astronomical equivalent of sunglasses ) and a collector - that works as a giant pinhole camera .
The starshade would be half a mile in diameter with a 10 - metre hole at its centre and would sit more than 124,000 miles ( 200,000 km ) from the collector , blocking the stars ' dazzling light .
Wendy Boss and Amy Grunden , microbiologists at North Carolina State University , worked on Niac - funded projects that looked at ways of growing food on other planets .
Taking her inspiration from organisms that live in the most extreme environments on Earth , Prof Grunden genetically modified plants such as rye .
In theory , astronauts on long missions could take the GM seeds with them , saving on the cost of taking food supplies into space .
Many of Niac 's projects fall into the realm of science fiction .
The institute is famously home to the space elevator , an idea first proposed by Arthur C Clarke in his 1978 novel Fountains of Paradise , to transport people and equipment cheaply into space .
In the Niac proposal , a cable would be attached from the ground to a satellite in geostationary orbit around the Earth .
Vehicles could then climb the tether and escape gravity without the need for rockets .
But no one has yet designed materials that would be strong enough for the elevator to work .
Roger Angel of the University of Arizona was recently funded to look into creating a 1,243 - mile - wide shield to protect the Earth from the sun 's rays and counteract global warming .
" Such a space - based solution might become an urgent priority , worth trillions of dollars if abrupt climate failures appear otherwise inevitable , " he wrote in the outline for this project .
" We propose to identify near - term research and space missions needed to understand whether a shield could be completed within a few decades at an affordable cost . "
Martin Barstow , head of physics and astronomy at Leicester University , said it was important to have a mechanism for scientists to think about radical ideas .
" It 's important that people have the freedom to be able to do this [ but ]
I do n't think you need a separate entity .
You just need the mental framework , the capacity for people to have time made available . "
Nasa has been reorganising its activities since 2004 , to pay for the technology it needs to meet its goal of getting humans back to the moon and then on to Mars .
The plans include developing the new Orion exploration vehicle , shaped like the Apollo space capsules last used in 1972 but three times bigger , to replace the space shuttle , and two new Ares I rockets that will blast the astronauts and equipment separately into space .
Nasa has slashed more than $ 300 m from the International Space Station 's science budget and many robotic exploration missions have been either cancelled or put on indefinite hold .

No one looked comfortable at the sentencing hearing .
Not family and friends who packed the US military courtroom 's straight - backed benches .
Not the rookie Army prosecutor in stiff dress greens who flushed with every " Your Honor . "
Not Judge R. Peter Masterton , whose usually animated face was now grave .
And not the convicted deserter – Army medic Agustín Aguayo – on the stand in a US military court in central Germany last March , pleading for understanding .
" I 'm sorry for the trouble my conscience has caused my unit , " Private 1st Class Aguayo said , his voice thick with emotion .
" I tried to obey the rules , but in the end [ the problem ] was at the very core of my being . "
Colonel Masterton , a veteran military judge , stared down at his bench .
The defense wanted him to free this man of conscience .
The prosecution asked that he put the coward away for two years to show other soldiers that " they are not fools for fulfilling their obligation . "
Aguayo craned to face the judge .
" When I hear my sergeants talking about slashing people 's throats , " he said , crying openly , " if I 'm not a conscientious objector , what am I when I 'm feeling all this pain when people talk about violence ? "
Next door in the press room , where reporters crowded to watch the proceedings on bleached , closed - circuit TVs , a soldier guarding the door wiped tears from his face .

Every war has its deserters , troops who abandon their posts .
And every war has its converts to pacifism .
The Defense Department reports that 5,361 active - duty service members deserted the US Armed Forces last year ; nearly 37,000 since October 2001 .
In today 's all - volunteer force , that means a desertion rate of less than half a percent – much lower than the Vietnam War draft era , when it reached a 1971 high of 7.4 percent .
In the past six years , 325 Army soldiers have applied to be recognized as conscientious objectors ( COs ) , soldiers who no longer believe in war ; 58 percent were accepted .
Still , Aguayo's story is revealing of the mental battles of these thousands who change their minds during a bloody war – and , arguably , of many who do n't .
Struggling to support a young family in the patriotic months after 9/11 , Aguayo chose to serve a nation heading into a long fight .
War made a man of the naive private – but not in the way his officers intended .
While his struggle to believe in his mission probably resembled that of many young recruits , no one imagined how it would end .
• • •
Aguayo is a small , soft - spoken man , tentative but quick to smile .
Born in Guadalajara , Mexico , he immigrated legally to Los Angeles with his parents when he was 4 .
At 19 , he became a citizen and married a girl he'd met at church , the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants .
He worked a dead - end bank job ; for his twin daughters ' sake , he wanted more .
So he got second and third jobs and enrolled in community college .
At Home Depot , where he worked in the fall of 2002 , the radio blared through his shift with Army Reserve ads promising he could stay with his family and get a four - year degree .
On the way to renew his driver 's license , Aguayo saw a recruiting station and stopped in .
" No , you do n't want the Army Reserve , " he recalls the recruiter saying , " have a seat . "
Two weeks later , Aguayo joined the active - duty Army .
His wife did n't want him to – the Afghan war had subsided and the Iraq invasion was imminent .
" But he was so excited and so sure that the future would hold great things , " Helga Aguayo says , that she supported his decision .
She recalls asking him what he'd do if he had to go to war .
" He kind of laughed and said , ' They train you for that .
I 'll be a different person . ' "
But in basic training at Fort Benning , Ga. , Aguayo could n't adjust like other recruits did .
It pained him to march to " Left , right , kill ! " and to chant " We are not men .
We are beasts . "
He stumbled out of gas - mask training crying , and wrote to Helga that the sting of the gas made him think of Nazi gas chambers .
" The point is for you to learn how to use the mask , " he says , " but [ the gas ] hurts , and I 'd never want to hurt anyone like that . "
He hoped his qualms were normal , that he 'd master them .
In August 2003 , five months after the US invaded Iraq , Aguayo's unit was sent to a base in Schweinfurt , Germany .
There they received orders to deploy to Iraq in the new year .
His roommate assured Aguayo that the war was over and they would be peacekeepers .
Aguayo , who rarely followed the news , felt better .
Then their training changed .
" It was n't targets anymore .
It was n't about me getting a badge .
It was n't about me getting a pat on the back , " he says , " It was about me getting ready to take someone down . "
In February 2004 , on the eve of his Iraq deployment , Aguayo confided to Helga , who had joined him in Germany with their 8 - year - old daughters , that he was n't willing to kill , even in self - defense .
She was alarmed .
She searched for help online , and found a story about a marine who had refused to serve in Iraq .
They read it together ; some of the words were new to them .
" I had never heard the term ' conscientious objector , ' which is embarrassing , " she says .
They Googled it , and called the hot - line number that came up .
Volunteers explained the application process , and Aguayo , deploying in two days , hurried one together .
In Iraq a week later , he woke to the sound of shouting .
Near his Tikrit aid station , a US military truck with five passengers had hit a roadside bomb .
Aguayo zipped two officers up in body bags .
His horrified expression caught the attention of a physician 's assistant who took him aside .
" You have to understand , there is a bigger picture , " Aguayo remembers him saying , " God has a bigger plan . "
" I could n't reason like that , " Aguayo says .
" I thought , ' How can God have anything to do with this ? '
To me it was ignorance : on our side and on the guys that put the bomb out there . "
Aguayo never got used to the routine cruelties of war :
The men in US uniform he heard speak lewdly to veiled women , the American squads that cut clotheslines on Fridays while families were at prayer .
" When someone sees me on a corner , then sees this guy next to me , " he says of these soldiers , " he thinks we 're the same . "
Despite his misgivings , Aguayo developed a reputation in his unit as a mature presence and a diligent worker .
He was promoted to the rank of specialist and recommended for another promotion to noncommissioned officer status , which he refused .
Friends who served with him say that although they did n't share his beliefs , they respected his growing pacifism .
For his 12 - month tour , Aguayo refused to carry a loaded weapon .
His medical duties did n't require one , but dangerous patrols in Saddam Hussein 's hometown did .
Out of consideration for his beliefs , superiors looked the other way as he hoisted an empty rifle .
When he told Helga , she was appalled at the danger he was putting himself – and others – in .
" I said : You can't do this .
You have a family .
You have to come back , " she says .
In August 2004 , Aguayo's CO application was denied .
The decision was divided : Aguayo's company commander and investigating officer called him " absolutely sincere " and said he had a " legitimate concern with being a soldier . "
The next four levels of command recommended rejection ; one called Aguayo's application " an attempt to remedy [ the ] anxiety all soldiers face during an extended deployment in a combat theater . "
Aguayo knew there were other ways out : A friend used illegal drugs to get discharged ; others went AWOL .
But he hated the idea of breaking the law .
So the Aguayos threw themselves into challenging the decision when he returned to Germany in February 2005 .
Superiors decided that whatever the result , he did n't belong in the Army .
A sergeant took him aside and promised to " paper " him out : charge him with enough small defiances to disqualify him from service .
But with only one infraction on record – failing to raise his M - 16 in a training exercise – and another pending , his unit got word .
They were going back to Iraq .

AP : Military is running out of troops to maintain Iraq surge Nick Juliano

As predictions intensify that next month 's White House - produced progress report on Iraq could push for a continuation to President Bush 's troop surge , the Associated Press reports the military simply does not have enough troops to maintain its current levels in Iraq much longer .
" The Army 's 38 available combat units are deployed , just returning home or already tapped to go to Iraq , Afghanistan or elsewhere , leaving no fresh troops to replace five extra brigades that President Bush sent to Baghdad this year , " Lolita C. Baldor reports for AP , based on interviews and military documents .
Without enough troops to sustain current troop levels , the Pentagon will face some painful decisions if President Bush argues for a continuation of the surge .
It can accelerate deployments of National Guard units , break the military 's pledge to keep soldiers in Iraq for 15 months or less or reverse its commitment to give troops a year at home with their families before returning them to a war zone .
" For a war - fatigued nation and a Congress bent on bringing troops home , none of those is desirable , " the AP reports .
Army Gen. David Petraeus , the top US commander in Iraq , will report to Congress next month on whether the surge has sufficiently reduced violence in the country and whether the increased security is fomenting political progress .
America 's ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , will appear with Petraeus for testimony Sept. 10 - 11 , but the report the two officials are to deliver is being written by the White House .
Petraeus is expected to recommend removing some troops from parts of Iraq where violence has decreased , but some warn such a strategy will just lead to a reversal of any progress that has been made .
" The longer that you keep American forces there , the longer you give this process to solidify and to make sure that it's not going to slide back , " Frederick Kagan , an American Enterprise Institute analyst who recently returned from an eight - day visit to Iraq , told the AP .
" The sooner you take them out , the more you run the risk that enemies will come in and try to disrupt . "
The number of US troops in Iraq is at its highest level since the war 's start in 2003 , with 162,00 there now .
As more troops rotate into the country this fall , that number is expected to rise to 171,000 .
Speaking to reporters on Friday , the No. 2 commander in Iraq , Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno , said he favored continuing the troop buildup as long as possible , and predicted it could last until this time next year without a change in strategy .
Before Bush announced his surge strategy in January , Odierno said it could be another " two or three years " until American and Iraqi troops took the upper hand in their battle with militant insurgents and foreign terrorists .
The AP notes that Petraeus and other military commanders have said the security situation is improving in Iraq , and that will allow for troop reductions by next summer .
" Still , Petraeus and other military leaders have warned against drawing down too quickly , " the AP reports .
" In fact , an upbeat progress report in September may solidify arguments that additional troops should stay longer to ensure that positive changes stick . "
If President Bush decides to maintain troop levels , he may have to modify current military policies by extending deployments or calling up National Guard troops quicker .
" According to military officials , some soldiers in Iraq are hearing that it may not be wise to pack their bags to come home when their 15 - month tour is up .
But to date , Pentagon officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , have said they have no plans to extend those tours , " according to AP .
" National Guard officials are bracing for a new round of Guard deployments and a move to decrease their time at home between tours despite announced plans to give the citizen soldiers five years off for every one year served . "
Over the next five years , the Army is adding 65,000 active - duty soldiers with the goal of increasing its strength to 547,000 members by 2012 .
The extra troops will comprise 10 extra combat brigades , bringing the number to 48 .
Barack Obama , a Democratic presidential candidate , said the AP article shows the US never should have invaded Iraq and called for an end to the war .
 The Associated Press story today confirms what has long been clear  the catastrophic decision to wage war in Iraq has finally stretched our troops to the breaking point .
It 's a shameful disservice to them and a serious threat to our national security , " the Illinois senator said in a parepared statement released by his campaign .
" We know our troops will always answer the call to service , but we must issue that call responsibly .
We need predictable rotations , we need to deploy troops at an appropriate state of readiness , and we must only send them to battle if we define their mission and define success .
We must end this war in Iraq and begin bringing our troops home so that we can rebuild our militarys strength and confront the very real threats to our security that still exist . 

" Mr. Leatherman , homesteader , coming out of his dugout home at Pie Town , New Mexico . "
View full size .
4x5 Kodachrome transparency by Russell Lee . Another example of the dugout - style structure used for the homesteader dwellings and church in the Dead Ox Flat photos .
Before industry and technology gave us sawmills and frame houses , this is how the average person lived in much of the world .
The dugout or pit house , with sod roof , log walls and earthen floor , is among the most ancient of human dwellings -- at some point in history your ancestors lived in one .
Especially popular among 19th - century settlers in the Great Plains and deserts of the West and Southwest , where trees and other building materials were scarce , dugouts were warmer in winter and cooler in summer than above - ground structures ; just about anywhere in North America the ground temperature three feet down is 55 degrees regardless of the season .

Click to viewBlockbuster 's decision to support Blu-ray in all of its 1,450 stores is having a bigger impact than it seems .
A tipster at an unnamed retailer tells us they 've had more HD DVD player orders canceled over the last few days than they 've seen over the entire life cycle .
The kicker ?
All of them were canceled because of the Blockbuster announcement .

Not only that , new sales of HD DVD players are nonexistent , with Blu-ray being the only things moving now .
The more tech savvy of us rent our stuff on Netflix or Blockbuster Online ( which is still supporting both formats for now ) , but this announcement — covered in many mainstream media sources — had a big impact on people who actually rent at Blockbuster .

Any of you tipsters working at other retail outlets see something similar ?

Thanks tipster !
The bill , which would carry out many recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences , is likely to become law .
It appears broadly acceptable to the House , which is working on its own version of the legislation , and is unlikely to be vetoed by President Bush .
The administration has not actively opposed the measure , although it says the F.D.A. already has all the regulatory authority it needs .
Within the agency itself , officials have been divided about whether they have the power needed to do their job .
The bill is widely seen as “ must pass ” legislation because it renews authority for the government to collect fees from drug companies to speed the review of their products .
Without action by Congress , the authority would expire Sept. 30 .
Billy Tauzin , president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , the main trade group for brand - name drug companies , applauded passage of the bill , saying it “ will preserve and even strengthen the F.D.A. ’s ability to do its job . ”
Drug company executives succeeded in their efforts to block a provision of the bill that would have legalized imports of lower - priced medicines from Canada .
And they were happy that the final Senate version of the measure sidestepped a multibillion - dollar question : how to give consumers access to lower - cost copies of biotechnology drugs that now cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year .
But lawmakers from both parties said they intended to create a procedure for federal approval of such copycat drugs , sometimes called generic biologics .
Work on the bill began long before Democrats took control of Congress .
At a time when bills often pass or fail on party - line votes , the Senate drug bill was a triumph of bipartisan cooperation .
Republicans were full partners in drafting it .
My columns have n’t been very funny recently .
This one is n’t going to be any funnier .
Sorry .
Fascism makes me cranky .
I do n’t mean the kind of fascism the corporate media and the fake Resistance have been desperately hyping for the last four years .
God help me , but I ’m not terribly worried about a few hundred white - supremacist morons marching around with tiki torches hollering Nazi slogans at each other , or Jewish - Mexican - American law clerks flashing “ OK ” signs on TV , or smirking schoolkids in MAGA hats .
I ’m talking about actual , bona fide fascism , or totalitarianism , if you want to get technical .
The kind where governments declare a global “ state of emergency ” on account of a virus with a 0.2 % to 0.6 % lethality ( and that causes mild , flu - like symptoms , or absolutely no symptoms whatsoever , in over 97 % of those infected ) , locks everyone down inside their homes , suspends their constitutional rights , terrorizes them with propaganda , and unleashes uniformed goon squads on anyone who does n’t comply with their despotic decrees .
I ’m talking about the kind of totalitarianism where the police track you down with your smartphone data and then come to your house to personally harass you for attending a political protest , or attack you for challenging their illegitimate authority , and then charge you with “ assault ” for fighting back , and then get the media to publish a story accusing you of having “ set up ” the cops .
I ’m talking about the kind of totalitarianism where the secret police are given carte blanche to monitor everyone ’s Internet activity , and to scan you with their “ surveillance helmets , ” and dictate how close you can sit to your friends , and menace you with drones and robot dogs , and violently pry your kids out of your arms and arrest you if you dare to protest .
I ’m talking about the kind of totalitarianism that psychologically tortures children with authoritarian loyalty rituals designed to condition them to live in fear , and respond to absurd Pavlovian stimuli , and that encourages the masses to turn off their brains and mechanically repeat propaganda slogans , like “ wear a mask ” and “ flatten the curve , ” and to report their neighbors to the police for having an “ illegal ” private party … and to otherwise reify the manufactured mass hysteria the authorities need to “ justify ” their totalitarianism .
Yeah , that kind of stuff makes me cranky .
And you know what makes me really cranky ?
I ’ll tell you what makes me really cranky .
It is people who publicly project themselves as “ anti-authoritarians ” and “ anti-fascists , ” or who have established their “ anti-establishment ” brands and “ dissident ” personas on social media , or even in the corporate media , either zealously cheerleading this totalitarianism or looking away and saying nothing as it is rolled out by the very authorities and media propagandists they pretend to oppose .
I do n’t know exactly why , but that stuff makes me particularly cranky .
I ’ll provide you with a few examples .
The militant “ Portland anti-fascists ” who the corporate media fell in love with and made famous for bravely fighting off the Trump - loving Putin - Nazi Menace over the course of the last four years , as soon as the Corona - Totalitarianism began , did what all true anti-fascists do when the state goes full - blown fascist … no , they did not “ smash the state , ” or “ occupy the streets , ” or anything like that .
They masked - up and started making vegan hand sanitizer .
Popular Internet “ anti-imperialists ” started accusing everyone opposing the lockdown of being part of some far - right Republican plot to “ promote mass death under the banner of freedom ” or to “ normalize death ” to benefit rich people , or being members of a “ death cult , ” or something .
Celebrity socialists took to Twitter to warn that we would “ shortly have the blood of thousands of people on our hands , ” and call us “ anti-vaxxers ” and “ flat earth fucks . ”
Indie political and military analysts patiently explained why governments needed to be able to pull people out of their homes against their will and quarantine them .
Anarchist anthropologists averred that the lockdown was n’t damaging the productive economy ; it was only damaging the “ bullshit economy , ” and those complaining about being out of work were people whose work is “ largely useless . ”
Others simply looked away or sat there in silence as we were confined to our homes , and made to carry “ permission papers ” to walk to work or the corner grocery store , and were beaten and arrested for not “ social - distancing , ” and were otherwise bullied and humiliated for no justifiable reason whatsoever .
( We are talking about a virus , after all , that even the official medical experts , e.g. , the U.K. ’s Chief Medic , admit is more or less harmless to the vast majority of us , not the Bubonic Fucking Plague or some sort of Alien - Terrorist - Death - Flu … so spare me the “ we - had - no - choice - but - to - go - totalitarian ” rationalization . )
My intent is not merely to mock these people ( i.e. , these “ radical , ” “ anti-establishment ” types who fell into formation and started goose - stepping because the media told them we were all going to die ) , but also to use them as a clear example of how official narratives are born and take hold .
That ’s somewhat pertinent at the moment , because the “ Brave New Normal ” official narrative has been born , but it has not yet taken hold .
What happens next will determine whether it does .
In order to understand how this works , imagine for a moment that you ’re one of these people who are normally skeptical of the government and the media , and that you consider yourself an anti-authoritarian , or at least a friend of the working classes , and now you are beginning to realize that there is no Alien - Terrorist - Death - Flu ( just as there were no “ WMDs , ” no “ Russian hackers , ” no “ pee-tape , ” etc. ) , and so it dawns on you that you ’ve been behaving like a hysterical , brainwashed , fascist minion of the very establishment you supposedly oppose … or at the very least like an abject coward .
Imagine how you might feel right now .
You would probably feel pretty foolish , right ?
And more than a little ashamed of yourself .
So … OK , what would do about that ?
Well , you would have a couple of options .
Option Number
One would be admit what you did , apologize to whomever you have to , and try like hell not to do it again .
Not many people are going to choose this option .
Most people are going to choose Option Number Two , which is to desperately try to deny what they did , or to desperately rationalize what they did ( and in many cases are still actively doing ) .
Now , this is not as easy at it sounds , because doing that means they will have to continue to believe ( or at least pretend to believe ) that there is an Alien - Terrorist - Death - Flu which is going to kill hundreds of millions of people the moment we stop locking everyone down , and forcing them to “ social distance , ” and so on .
They will have to continue to pretend to believe that this Alien - Terrorist - Death - Flu exists , even though they know it does n’t .
And this is where that Orwellian “ doublethink ” comes in .
People ( i.e. , these “ anti-authoritarians , ” not to mention the majority of the “ normal ” public ) are not going to want to face the fact that they ’ve been behaving like a bunch of fascists ( or cowards ) for no justifiable reason whatsoever .
So , what they are going to do instead is desperately pretend that their behavior was justified and that the propaganda they have been swallowing , and regurgitating , was not propaganda , but rather , “ the Truth . ”
In other words , in order to avoid their shame , they are going to do everything in their power to reify the official narrative and delegitimize anyone attempting to expose it as the fiction that it is .
They are going to join in with the corporate media that are calling us “ extremists , ” “ conspiracy theorists , ” “ anti-vaxxers , ” and other such epithets .
They ’re going to accuse those of us on the Left of aligning with “ far - Right Republican militias , ” and “ Boogaloo accelerationists , ” and of being members of the Russian - backed “ Querfront , ” and assorted other horrible things meant to scare errant leftists into line .
Above all , they are going to continue to insist , despite all the evidence to the contrary , that we are “ under attack ” by a “ killer virus ” which could “ strike again at any time , ” and so we have to maintain at least some level of totalitarianism and paranoia , or else … well , you know , the terrorists win .
It is this reification of the official narrative by those too ashamed to admit what they did ( and try to determine why they did it ) , and not the narrative or the propaganda itself , that will eventually establish the “ Brave New Normal ” as “ reality ” ( assuming the process works as smoothly as it did with the “ War on Terror , ” the “ War on Populism , ” and the “ Cold War ” narratives ) .
The facts , the data , the “ science ” wo n’t matter .
Reality is consensus reality … and a new consensus is being formed at the moment .
There is still a chance ( right now , not months from now ) for these people ( some of whom are rather influential ) to stand up and say , “ Whoops !
I screwed up and went all Nazi there for a bit . ”
But I seriously doubt that is going to happen .
It ’s much more likely that the Brave New Normal ( or some intermittent , scaled - down version of it ) will gradually become our new reality .
People will get used to being occasionally “ locked down , ” and being ordered to wear masks , and not to touch each other , and to standing in designated circles and boxes , like they got used to the “ anti-Terrorism measures , ” and believing that Trump is a “ Russian asset . ”
The coming economic depression will be blamed on the Alien - Terrorist - Death - Flu , rather than on the lockdown that caused it .
Millions of people will be condemned to extreme poverty , or debt - enslaved for the rest of their lives , but they ’ll be too busy trying to survive to mount any kind of broad resistance .
The children , of course , wo n’t know any better .
They will grow up with their “ isolation boxes , ” and “ protective barriers , ” and “ contact tracing , ” and they will live in constant low - grade fear of another killer virus , or terrorist attack , or Russian - backed white supremacist uprising , or whatever boogeyman might next appear to menace the global capitalist empire , which , it goes without saying , will be just fine .
Me , I ’ll probably remain kind of cranky , but I will try to find the humor in it all .
Bear with me … that might take a while .

Investigators believe the third suspect helped the father and uncle kill Hina Saleem , 21 .
The woman 's body was found buried in the family 's garden in Sarezzo on Saturday .
Her father and uncle were taken into custody on Monday .
Investigators said they were looking into the theory that the grave was dug before the woman was killed .
It is thought a long kitchen knife was used to slit her throat .
The Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported that the victim's father had applied for Italian citizenship two months ago .
Applicants must convince authorities that they also embrace " fundamental " rights , including the right of a woman " to choose her own life " , said the interior minister , Giuliano Amato .
News reports said the victim 's family had been insisting on an arranged marriage with a cousin in Pakistan .

Sunday 's protest sparked the arrest of at least 13 activists
Htin Kyaw , 44 , who has been detained three times this year for protesting over living standards , was beaten as he was seized on Saturday , witnesses said .
Mr Kyaw had apparently been planning another protest before his arrest .
Two rare protests were held in Burma 's capital Rangoon last week .
Sunday 's rally was the biggest in a decade .
The authorities in Burma have been rigorously checking cars , buses and transport terminals to find those they held responsible for the demonstrations .
Another man was arrested with Mr Kyaw and both shouted anti-government slogans as they were arrested .
Open trials
Other activists who were arrested earlier this week face up to 20 years in jail , official papers revealed .
Some of them are among the country 's most prominent dissidents .
Many of these leading campaigners are members of the pro-democracy 88 Generation Students group which was at the forefront of a failed uprising in 1988 .
Nyan Win , spokesman for the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , said : " They have made the strongest possible allegations against these activists .
" Their trials must be open .
These activists should be heard in open court . "
Last week 's fuel price rises left many people struggling to find the money to travel to work .
Other arrested activists include Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi - some of Burma 's most well - known dissidents after Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
The NLD 's leader , 62 - year - old Ms Suu Kyi , has spent most of the past 17 years under house arrest .
The NLD won landmark elections in 1990 but the junta never recognised the result .

I 've just released templatemaker , which is something I 've been hacking on and off ( mostly off ) the past couple of months .
It 's a Python library for extracting data from similarly formatted text strings .
What the heck does that mean ?
Well , say you want to get the raw data from a bunch of Web pages that use the same template -- like restaurant reviews on Yelp.com , for instance .
You can give templatemaker an arbitrary number of HTML files , and it will create the " template " that was used to create those files .
( " Template , " in this case , means a string with a number of " holes " in it , where the holes represent the parts of the page that change . )
Once you 've got the template , you can then give it any HTML file that uses that same template , and it will give you the raw data : " The value for hole 1 is ' July 6 , 2007 ' , the value for hole 2 is ' blue ' , " etc .
If this still does n't make sense , have a look at the example usage and documentation .
I searched but could n't find anything else that did this .
I heard from a few folks that Google and Yahoo have internal tools that do this sort of thing , probably in a much more robust fashion , but I 'm unaware of any open - source code that does this .
( Disclaimer : I have not checked CPAN .
CPAN probably has five implementations of this functionality . )
The library uses a longest - common substring algorithm , which is implemented in C , via Python 's C interface , for performance .
( My original implementation was in Python , and it was noticeably slow in that area . )
This means you need to compile it in order to use it , but it has no dependencies , so it should be quick and easy .
You can get templatemaker via its Subversion repository on Google Code .
I 'm releasing it under the New BSD License .
There 's also a mailing list , for the fun of it .
I 'm interested in seeing what uses people have for this , and I 'm also planning on adding a ton more features .
And I 'd love it if a competent C programmer could take a look at the C bits to make sure everything is kosher -- it 's been a while since I 've written C code . :-)
Let me know if you have any use for this , and may the suggestions and patches flow freely !

Ben Parkinson volunteered to serve his country on the Afghan front line - and paid a terrible price .
The young paratrooper suffered a total of 37 terrible injuries when he was blown up by a landmine .
He lost both his legs and sustained grievous damage to his spine , skull , pelvis , hands , spleen and ribcage , leaving him in a coma for months .
Incredibly , 23 - year - old Ben is still alive almost a year later - according to his doctors the most badly - injured soldier ever to survive .
All his mother wants is to buy a bungalow so she can care for him there .
Yet as recompense for his ruined life , Ben has been offered only £ 152,150 - little more than half the maximum award for maimed military personnel and less than a third of the £ 484,000 doled out to an RAF typist who claimed she had suffered repetitive strain injury to her thumb .
Yesterday Ben 's mother Diane Dernie told how she plans to challenge the award in the High Court , and spoke of her disgust at this " insult " to her brave son .
" We wo n't let him lose his chance to come home , " she said .
" It is iniquitous the way his injuries have been dismissed as nothing .
He deserves better . "
Mrs Dernie has been told that Ben 's case does not qualify for legal aid .
So she is appealing for help to raise £ 50,000 to fund the first High Court challenge against the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme , arguing that its rules are patently unfair in the most severe cases .
A successful judicial review would ensure that several other soldiers maimed in Iraq and Afghanistan will receive financial security .
Ben 's case exemplifies the mounting concern about the Government 's treatment of the Armed Forces .
Scroll down for more
Opposition MPs , veterans ' organisations and even some commanders are arguing that the military covenant - which guarantees personnel fair treatment in return for risking their lives - is being broken .
Ben is expected to spend a year or more in a military rehabilitation centre , but will then need a specially - adapted home and specialist daily care .
He has been told that red tape surrounding the Government 's compensation scheme means only three of his injuries can be taken into account .
The rest count for nothing .
In a civil claim involving similar injuries , an individual could expect compensation of upwards of a million pounds .
Mrs Dernie , 49 , from Doncaster , said : " The MoD 's offer is just ludicrous .
It 's an insult .
The way the scheme works is terribly unfair to people in Ben 's position , because it does n't take consider the effects of all his injuries . "
Lance Bombardier Parkinson was maimed in September last year near Musa Qaleh in Helmand Province , while serving with the 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery .
He was flown to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham , where doctors told his family to expect the worst .

After three months in a coma - during which he contracted MRSA during one of many operations - he gradually regained consciousness .
He could not speak and remembered nothing of the past three years .
Today he is making progress but with no legs , a badly disabled left arm and a severely damaged spine , he faces a long and arduous battle .
He is struggling to learn to speak again and cannot take in liquids by mouth .
He faces a year or more in the military rehabilitation centre at Headley Court in Surrey .
The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme was set up in 2005 to cover payments to men and women injured on duty , replacing the old system of war pensions .
Losing all four limbs is a Category 1 injury , earning a £ 285,000 lump sum .
But having both legs amputated is in Category 3 , worth only £ 115,000 .
His brain injury is also in Category 3 , but for his second injury he receives only 30 per cent of the maximum - an additional £ 34,500 .
Finally he receives a meagre £ 2,650 for severe fractures which rendered his left arm almost useless .
None of his other injuries is worth a penny .
In addition to his lump sum , Ben will receive a pension of around £ 19,000 a year .
But his family believe a far bigger award is crucial to enable him to rebuild a life with some dignity .
Andrew Buckham , of the law firm Irwin Mitchell , which is representing him , said : " This scheme does not adequately cover the kind of multiple , severe injuries happening to a small number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
The legal team will seek to persuade High Court judges that the scheme 's rules are unfair in the most severe cases , that the " arbitrary " £ 285,000 upper limit for payouts should be scrapped , and that the scale of compensation should take into account the overall effect of a soldier 's wounds , rather than only the three worst injuries .
Mrs Dernie has so far shunned publicity but she is so angry at the treatment of her son that she has decided to spearhead the campaign and speak publicly .
" Ben 's personality is unchanged and he 's still amazingly positive , " she said .
" He is not bitter towards the Army , which he loves .
He even hopes to get back into uniform and serve alongside his " airborne brothers " .
It was all he ever wanted to do .
He lived for it .
" But he is angry at the Government .
When we explained the compensation offer he laughed in despair , pointed at his back and made a questioning gesture - " what about my back ? " . "
An MoD spokesman said : " The Armed Forced Compensation Scheme scheme is based on modern best practice .
But we are keeping it under review in light of experience , particularly the complex injuries currently being sustained on operations , to ensure that it remains focused on the most severely injured . "

Steve Souders , performance architect at Yahoo , announced today the public release of YSlow .
What 's YSlow ?
It 's an extension to Firebug ( yes , correct , Firebug , not Firefox ) that helps with performance optimization efforts .
It scores your page on the scale A to F , based on compliance with Yahoo's performance rules .
It 's a tool that has been used internally at Yahoo and is now released to the world .
The score
Here 's how YSlow scores Yahoo's homepage , gives it an A with 93 points out of 100
You can see on the screenshot how YSlow is just another panel within Firebug , and when you select the panel it gives you a few features .
The main one is Performance ( shown on the screenshot ) .
You get a list of 13 things YSlow has evaluated ( they are based on the performance rule ) and if you do n't get an A , there is an arrow that gives you more explanations why .
Every one of the 13 items on the list is linked to online documentation of the rule so you can figure out right then what could be improved .
Other features
Besides Performance , there 's also the Stats tab which gives you comparison of how your page size for visitors coming with an empty cache vs the ones that have previously visited the page .
The other tab is Components which lists every component on the page along with some information , relevant to performance , such as if the component as gzipped , what was the ETag if any , component size and expiration date .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Magnificently sophisticated geometric patterns in medieval Islamic architecture indicate their designers achieved a mathematical breakthrough 500 years earlier than Western scholars , scientists said on Thursday .
Medieval Islamic artisans developed a pattern - making process for designing ornate tiled surfaces that allowed them to produce sophisticated patterns not seen in the West until centuries later , a new study suggests .
Many walls of medieval Islamic buildings have ornate geometric star - and - polygon , or “ girih , ” patterns , often overlaid with a zig - zagging network of lines .
This undated picture shows an archway from the Darb- i Imam shrine , Isfahan , Iran ( built in 1453 ) with two overlapping girih patterns .

By the 15th century , decorative tile patterns on these masterpieces of Islamic architecture reached such complexity that a small number boasted what seem to be “ quasicrystalline ” designs , Harvard University ’s Peter Lu and Princeton University ’s Paul Steinhardt wrote in the journal Science .
Only in the 1970s did British mathematician and cosmologist Roger Penrose become the first to describe these geometric designs in the West .
Quasicrystalline patterns comprise a set of interlocking units whose pattern never repeats , even when extended infinitely in all directions , and possess a special form of symmetry .
“ Oh , it ’s absolutely stunning , ” Lu said in an interview .
“ They made tilings that reflect mathematics that were so sophisticated that we did n’t figure it out until the last 20 or 30 years . ”
Lu and Steinhardt in particular cite designs on the Darb- i Imam shrine in Isfahan , Iran , built in 1453 .
Islamic tradition has frowned upon pictorial representations in artwork .
Mosques and other grand buildings erected by Islamic architects throughout the Middle East , Central Asia and elsewhere often are wrapped in rich , intricate tile designs setting out elaborate geometric patterns .
The walls of many medieval Islamic structures display sumptuous geometric star - and - polygon patterns .
The research indicated that by 1200 an important breakthrough had occurred in Islamic mathematics and design , as illustrated by these geometric designs .
“ You can go through and see the evolution of increasing geometric sophistication .
So they start out with simple patterns , and they get more complex ” over time , Lu added .
ISLAMIC ACHIEVEMENTS
While Europe was mired in the Dark Ages , Islamic culture flourished beginning in the 7th century , with achievements over numerous centuries in mathematics , medicine , engineering , ceramics , art , textiles , architecture and other areas .
Lu said the new revelations suggest Islamic culture was even more advanced than previously thought .
While traveling in Uzbekistan , Lu said , he noticed a 16th century Islamic building with decagonal motif tiling , arousing his curiosity as to the existence of quasicrystalline Islamic tilings .
The sophistication of the patterns used in Islamic architecture has intrigued scholars worldwide .
Emil Makovicky of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark in the 1990s noticed the relationship between these designs and a form of quasicrystalline designs .
Makovicky was interested in particular in an 1197 tomb in Maragha , Iran .
Joshua Socolar , a Duke university physicist , said it is unclear whether the medieval Islamic artisans fully understood the mathematical properties of the patterns they were making .
“ It leads you to wonder whether they kind of got lucky , ” Socolar said in an interview .
“ But the fact remains that the patterns are tantalizingly close to having the structure that Penrose discovered in the mid-70s . ”
“ And it will be a lot of fun if somebody turns up bigger tilings that sort of make a more convincing case that they understood even more of the geometry than the present examples show , ” Socolar said .

When failure to police yourself against crimes you have n't committed becomes a crime I 'm sure it 's just a coincidence that this would be unveiled on the same day that a college dean was charged with a felony for failure to police student drinking , but MADD is postively crowing about Nissan 's new car design , which they clearly link to their much - touted " Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving " : Nissan Motor Co. , Ltd. has revealed a new concept car featuring multiple preventative features designed to help reduce drunk driving .
Presently integrated on - board a production model Fuga sedan , the various technologies are designed to detect the driver 's state of sobriety and to activate a range of preventive measures including immobilization of the vehicle .
Alcohol Odor Sensors 1 . A hi-sensitivity alcohol odor sensor is built into the transmission shift knob , which is able to detect the presence of alcohol in the perspiration of the driver 's palm as he or she attempts to start driving .
When the alcohol - level detected is above the pre-determined threshold , the system automatically locks the transmission , immobilizing the car .
A " drunk driving " voice alert is also issued via the car navigation system .
2. Additional alcohol odor sensors are also incorporated into the driver 's and passenger seats to detect the presence of alcohol in the air inside the vehicle cabin .
When alcohol is detected , the system issues both a voice alert and a message alert on the navigation system monitor .
Passenger seats ?
Even assuming that I wanted my car to police my drinking , why would I want the passengers policed ?
Is the goal here to discourage designated drivers from driving people who are too drunk to drive ?
You 'd think MADD would want to encourage sober designated drivers .
Or is that just another step in the " process " ?

Or is that just another step in the " process " ?
" Sorry , but this is an alcohol free car !
You 're either part of the problem or part of the solution .
Besides , I get a lower insurance rate ! "
There 's a lot more in Nissan 's description ( which includes a " Facial Recognition System " to monitor the driver 's state of consciousness through the blinking of the eyes , " and a general Driving Behavior monitor :
By constantly monitoring the operational behavior of the vehicle ( e.g. sensing if the vehicle is veering out of its driving lane ) , the system can identify signs of inattentiveness or distraction in the driver .
When the system detects such behavior , voice and message alerts are issued via the navigation system .
The seat - belt alert mechanism is also activated , tightening around the driver to gain immediate attention .
And you thought your
And you thought your dishwasher was acting like a fascist control freak !
Sigh .
I guess if people want to buy these things , they can .
What I 'm worried about is the long - term , Orwellian goal of making mandatory .
Last November the New York Times reported that this was precisely MADD 's goal : Many states already require the devices , known as ignition interlocks , for people who have been convicted several times .
Last year New Mexico became the first to make them mandatory after a first offense .
With that tactic and others , the state saw an 11.3 percent drop in alcohol - related fatalities last year .
Officials say interlocks for first offenders are not a panacea but will reduce repeat offenses .
They say the next step will be a program to develop devices to unobtrusively test every driver for alcohol and disable the vehicle .
Statistics show that about 13,000 people die each year in car crashes in which a driver was legally drunk . "
MADD is making no secret of it at their " The Campaign calls for ... exploration and development of emerging technologies that will one day make it impossible for a vehicle to be driven by someone who is drunk and public support for all of these efforts . "
Eliminating drunk driving is certainly a laudable goal .
No one is " for " drunk driving .
But are n't there a lot of other crimes which occur in society which could be deterred my monitoring ?
For example , parents who are concerned about the quality of the baby sitters who stay with their kids might want to install hidden cameras , and they might want to monitor their children in various ways .
But is n't that the business of the parent ?
How does it become the business of the state ?

How does it become the business of the state ?
I have no objection to anyone buying a car with alcohol sensors , marijuana sensors , tobacco sensors , or sensors to detect sexual arousal ( which has been shown to be a distraction ) .
It is one thing to prosecute and punish crime , and when someone has been convicted , I can understand the logic of requiring him to be monitored .
But what gives the government the right to step in and require citizens to monitor themselves ?
What 's being discussed here is making it a crime not to use crime prevention devices .
Where does it end ?
Installing monitoring collars and ankle bracelets to keep track of all of us ?
Oh , silly me .
Technology is constantly improving .
Monitoring collars and ankle bracelets will soon be as outmoded as vacuum tubes ( if they are n't already ) .
Microchips and tiny sensors are poised to replace them .
And activist groups who are no longer content to punish crime will want to make it a new crime not to deter yourself in advance of committing a crime !
Notice that the language " make it impossible for a vehicle to be driven by someone who is drunk , " does not mean what it appears to imply -- that the crime of drunk driving would become impossible .
What it would mean is that there would have to be a new category of crime -- the affirmative failure to have crime - prevention devices installed .
From a constitutional perspective , these devices might be an invasion of privacy , as well as inherently self - incriminating .
But I just do n't like the idea of criminalizing an individual 's failure to pre-empt a crime he never committed .
Might as well stop rape by outlawing penises .
Yeah , I know that 's ridiculous .
Besides , the modern and more civilized approach would be to prevent sex crimes by criminalizing the failure to prevent erect penises under certain circumstances .
( Do n't laugh !
Such a device could probably be designed .
And " if we could save just one ... "
You know the routine . )
UPDATE : It 's been so long that I almost forgot these words from one of our founding bloggers : Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty -- even liberty from meddling machines .
When non-meddling machines are outlawed , only outlaws will have non-meddling machines !
When non-meddling machines are outlawed , only outlaws will have non-meddling machines !
I suppose the rest of us can engage in ancestor envy .

Well , a similar feeling is often what motivates these posts , and a primary goal is often to determine whether my feelings are right , or whether things are not as bad as they seem .

I also write in the hope of getting the feelings out of my system , and it grieves me to think that by getting these feelings out of my system , I might be implanting them in other people 's systems .
The irony on top of ironies is that I imagine myself trying to police my own feelings -- only to be told that I am spreading them like a virus !

UPDATE : My thanks to Glenn Reynolds for the link , and a warm welcome to all !
I noticed Glenn 's link to the story about MADD complaining about Amtrak 's free drink promotional offer .
Hmmm ...
The president of the group is now a man ( and unless he 's changed his sex , that means he's not a mother , right ? ) and they 've gone from opposing drunk driving to basically opposing alcohol .
I have to admit , there 's a certain consistency in promoting cars wired to go after passengers , and opposing drinking by train riders .
I think it 's clearly become a professional anti-alcohol , neo -Prohibitionist lobbying group .
Perhaps the name should be changed from " Mothers Against Drunk Driving " to " Activists Against All Alcohol Anywhere . "
Nah , the AAAA acronym does n't have meaning , and sounds like they 're just trying to get the first listing in the phone book .
Perhaps " Neoprohibitionists Against Drinking Anywhere " would be better .
A little multicultural nihilistic inclusionism ?

Someone rather more partial to Ron Paul 's arguments in favor of the gold standard than I am asks me to write a post outlining my objections to it .
All right , here goes .
Money is a mysterious thing .
It is a store of value , it is a medium of exchange .
It is , in a fiat currency economy , worth only what people think it is worth , and what they think it is worth can be oddly affected by what they think it may be worth in the future , resulting in self - fulfilling feedback loops ( at least in the short term ) .
Even in non-fiat currencies , such as the gold standard , the value of the underlying asset can be changed by rising ( or shrinking ) demand for money .
Economists studying this fascinating topic tend to suffer from migraines as they suffer from all the mysterious -- hell , nearly mystical -- attributes of money .
However , over the last fifty years , economists have settled on some very broad areas of consensus .
The first is , as famous libertarian monetary economist Milton Friedman wrote , " inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon " .
When the supply of money outstrips the demand , prices rise .
And this is by no means limited to fiat currencies ; see the great Spanish inflation of the 16th & 17th centuries , thanks to the steady influx of gold from the New World .
Or check out the price of basic commodities in mining towns during the Gold Rush , when all anyone had was gold .
The second is that a little bit of inflation is okay - - possibly even beneficial , since it helps the economy to overcome the problem of sticky wages when the relative value of labour has fallen .
But a lot of inflation is very , very bad .
Exhibit A is Zimbabwe ; Exhibits B -∞ are every other economy that has had inflation near or above the double - digit mark ; the higher the inflation , the worse the economy did .
The feeling that the currency will experience an unpredictable amount of inflation dampens the willingness of the citizens to save and invest , which is why so many third - world loans are denominated in dollars .
The third is that deflation is also bad , and at the lower percentage values , often even worse than inflation .
This surprises / offends / meets with the frank disbelief of many " sound money " types , who think that , barring local shortage , in an ideal world everything ought to cost the same or less than it did when Grandpa was a boy .
( These sorts of opinions are cemented further by the fact that Grandpa , who is often the source of them , is usually living on a fixed income , and therefore feels that he would make out better in a deflationary economy . )
The problem is , deflation does rather devastating things to anyone who has debt , since they now have to repay what they borrowed in more expensive dollars .
Deflation means that , thanks to the abovementioned sticky wages , the economy has to deal with demand shocks by lowering output .
Deflation can result in what 's known as a liquidity trap , a concept pioneered by liberal economist John Maynard Keynes and best elucidated by liberal economist Paul Krugman back before he left economics writing to focus on his hatred of George W. Bush .
Deflation is what made the Great Depression so memorable .
Deflation is so bad that almost everyone agrees that moderate inflation , in the range of 1 - 2 % , is better than risking even a small amount of deflation .
Advocates of a gold standard dispute this .
They argue that America experienced a long , slow deflation throughout most of the 19th century , without anyone getting hurt .
What they neglect to mention is that people did get hurt , repeatedly , in the period 's awful financial contractions .
Though we do n't have modern economic statistics for the period , it 's pretty clear that recessions were longer and deeper than they are now .
This is not only due to the gold standard ; the era 's primitive financial system and its approach to financial regulation , which often ranged between lighthearted and foolhardy , also played substantial roles .
But the gold standard also has to stand up and take a bow .
There 's a strong correlation , for example , between how long a country hewed to the gold standard , and how badly it suffered from the Great Depression .
The gold standard cannot do what a well - run fiat currency can do , which is tailor the money supply to the economy 's demand for money .
The supply of gold grows -- or not -- depending on how much of the stuff is mined .
Demand also fluctuates for non-economic reasons ; gold has uses besides being money , like industrial components and jewelry .
The lone advantage of a gold standard -- and it is a real advantage -- is that it prevents governments from inflating the currency .
The problem is , this is only moderately true .
The government , after all , can always modify its gold standard .
Yes , you say , but it will pay a price in the markets , and this is true , but this is the same price it pays when it prints more fiat currency .
Such practices do not go unnoticed for long .
As James Hamilton has pointed out , gold - backed currencies , like all money with a fixed exchange rate , are subject to speculative attacks whenever the government 's financial position looks weak .
Such speculative attacks often require punitive economic measures to fight off , which is one of the reasons that America suffered so nastily from the Great Depression -- it raised interest rates in the middle of a recession in order to defend the credibility of its currency .
Also , since devaluations tend to produce sharp changes in the values of currencies , rather than smooth appreciations or declines , the economic dislocations are magnified .
Imagine you 're a company with a contract denominated in dollars .
If the value of the dollar gradually declines , you lose a little , but not too much , since you periodically renew the contract , giving you time to adjust the amounts .
If , on the other hand , the devaluation pressure builds up over a period of years , and then all at once the government has to devalue by 20 % , you end up badly hurt .
You might go out of business .
Now multiply that all across the country , and you can see why recessions used to last for years .
In short , you do n't get anything out of a gold standard that you did n't bring with you .
If your government is a credible steward of the money supply , you do n't need it ; and if it is n't , it wo n't be able to stay on it long anyway .
( See Argentina 's dollar peg ) .
Meanwhile , the limitations on the government 's ability to respond to fiscal crises , the necessity of defending against speculative attacks in times of crises , and the possibility of independent changes in the relative price of gold , make your economy more unstable .
It 's a terrible idea , which is why there are so few economists willing to raise their voices in support of it .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Russians have psychotronic weapon to zombie people
Major - general of the reserve of the Russian Federal Custodial Service Boris Ratnikov tells that Russia and other countries work on making special devices that turn humans into zombies .
Russians have psychotronic weapon to zombie people
It was already twenty years ago that mass media first mentioned the strange word combination ‘ psychotronic weapon ’ .
All information about such weapons arrived from military men transferred to the reserve and from researchers that were not officially recognized by the Russian Academy of Sciences .
They usually told about some generators that could make people muddleheaded even when they were distanced at hundreds of kilometers .
Such devices were said to be able to control people ’s behavior , seriously impair psyche and even drive people to death .
As soon as information of the kind was published some people immediately claimed themselves as victims of impact of such psychotronic weapons .
They stormed editorial offices of newspapers and magazines that reported about the psychotronic weapons and complained that some strange voices dictated orders to them .
Journalists in their turn recommended such people visiting psychiatrists .
By the year of 2000 the amount of publications about psychotronic weapons reduced to nothing and the impact of psychotronic weapons was no longer mentioned .
These days , the issue of psychotronic weapons seems to be reviving .
Boris Ratnikov says that Russia has been working on the psychotronic impact upon humans since the 1920s .
Until the mid-1980s secret centers for investigation of psychic impact upon humans were working in large cities of the country under the KGB ’s patronage .
Thousands of brilliant researchers were working on the problem in the twenty secret centers .
After the break - up of the USSR the centers were closed and the researchers either left abroad or currently work in various parts of Russia .
Now that new technologies and the Internet are widely spreading people must realize that the menace of psychic impact upon humans is really immense .
At the same time , the official science still insists that psychotronic is mere charlatanry .
Boris Ratnikov is sure however that in less than ten years psychotronic weapons will grow more dangerous than nuclear and atomic weapons .
It is known that several researchers are still investigating the problem in Russia .
Academician Viktor Kandyba and his son continue the researches in St. Petersburg , academician Vlail Kaznacheyev works on the problem in Novosibirsk .
And it is highly likely that the magic of human brain is still the issue of great interest for Academician Natalya Bekhtereva whose father was working on the problem in the past century .
In the USA researchers work on psychotronic effect and employ oriental psychophysical systems , hypnosis , neurolinguistic programming , computer psychotechnologies and bio-resonance stimulation in their studies .
They seek every opportunity of manipulating human behavior .
Israeli researchers conduct similar studies to help people reveal their new potential through self - regulation , changing their consciousness and improving the psychical body potential for athletes .
What is more , they also make secret technologies for programming human behavior that are based on mathematical simulation of the Kabbala symbolism .
The Academy of National Self - Defense Forces in Japan studies the use of parapsychological phenomena that may be employed by the intelligence .
The Institute of Religious Psychology is also working on the problem there .
In North Korea , the Service for Security and Control of Foreign Policy conducts experiments with special oscillators that can modify functions of human organs .
In Pakistan , special services can use a special device that can cause dysfunctions of human organs and physiological systems and even cause people ’s death .
The Spanish intelligence finances studies of the effect of physical factors on human organs and human brain with the view of making devices to cause dysfunctions of organs and mental transformations .
Main goal of all these studies is to find new methods and forms of impact upon human psyche , to manipulate large groups of people and to enlarge the resources of human consciousness , Boris Ratnikov says .
Many countries posses information about secret use of a distance impact upon individuals and large groups of people .
And these are not at all mere experiments but also practical application of technologies for various political and military purposes .
Such technologies grow more perfect thanks to scientific and technological innovations .
Boris Ratnikov says that he once saw a KGB ’s classified document about potential threats and a psychotronic generator .
The document said that the mechanism of a psychotronic generator is based upon the resonance of response functions of human organs , the heart , liver , kidneys and brain .
Every human organ has its individual frequency response .
When this frequency is used to affect the organ with E - field radiation this may cause acute cardiac decompensation , renal failure or inadequate behavior .
Such attacks are usually targeted at unhealthy organs and may in some cases be lethal .
It is said that the KGB spent millions of rubles during the Soviet era to conduct studies on a distanced medical and biological action of special radiation on troops and population .
However , today the Internet provides a wide range of publications that deny the very existence of such a psychotronic weapon .
Boris Ratnikov says that he has never had a chance to hold such a weapon and has no idea how it may look at all .
But he supposes that modern technical resources allow making this weapon these days as all theoretic materials necessary for the production have been completely developed .
How did people first estimate that human brain can be affected from outside ?
In 1853 , famous chemist Alexander Butlerov was the first in the world to originate a scientific hypothesis to explain the phenomenon of hypnosis .
Butlerov assumed that human brain and nervous system are emitting sources and that movements of nervous currents in the organism are identical to the interaction of the electric current in conductors .
The scientist said that the electroinduction effect explained how signals going from the brain of one person to other man ’s brain emerged .
Physiologist Ivan Sechenov also supported Butlerov ’s hypothesis .
He added that emotions and close relations between people , especially between twins , intensified the effect of mental force interaction .
Academician Vladimir Bekhterev set up the world ’s first Institute of Brain and Mental Activity .
In the late 19th - early 20th centuries Bekhterev conducted experiments on electromagnetic justification of hypnosis applied to animals and humans .
In his works Bekhterev wrote that he discovered a mental mechanism of super - sensitive contact that emerges on special terms between a human and an animal and allows to mentally operate the animal ’s behavior with the help of movements and emotions .
In 1924 , chairman of the academician council of the Animal Psychology Laboratory , brilliant animal trainer Vladimir Durov wrote a book on animal training and told about his experiments on hypnosis applied to animals
In 1932 , the Bekhterev Institute of Brain named after the scientist was officially charged to conduct experiments on distant interaction .
In 1965 - 1968 , the Institute of Automatics and Electroenergetics based in Novosibirsk studied mental communication between humans and animals .
The materials of the study were classified and were never published officially .

At noon on the dot , punctuality will make its debut in Peru .
Lateness will be a thing of the past , or so its government hopes .
Sirens will blare and church bells will ring to remind 27 million Peruvians to synchronise their clocks with time set by the Peruvian Navy .
Is that really the time ?
Businesses , government institutions and schools will be urged to stop tolerating " hora peruana " - which usually means about an hour late .
President Alan Garcia is renowned for his good timekeeping , and he believes that the laissez - faire attitude of his countrymen harms national productivity and deters foreign investors .
The concept of " manana , " literally " tomorrow " in Spanish but usually meaning some indefinite time in the future , is common to Latin America .
Its nations often score badly in global surveys on punctuality .
Time is seen in a much less rigid way than in for example North America and more industrialised countries .
Sticklers
In the US , being on time is generally the rule .
George W Bush is a stickler for time - keeping , and the whole administration is reported to run punctually .
Former US ambassador John Bolton took this attitude to the UN with him .
When he held the presidency of the Security Council , he started meetings promptly , even if some seats were empty , and kept a list of latecomers .
He is still admired for making the 15 - member council more punctual .
Germans have long fretted about timekeeping and their punctuality is no stereotype .
" We are much stricter than people in , say , Mediterranean countries , " says Stefan Klein , author of a bestseller about time .
" On the other hand , and from my experience , we might be more relaxed about time than Americans , " he told the BBC News website .
" I think the common denominator is Protestantism , which imposes very strict ethics on time .
It makes people believe that it 's almost a sin to waste time . "
Mr Klein says this view holds pretty much for all Protestant countries .
Technology
" What is particularly special about Germany , is that it has been an industrialised system for a very long time , " says Mr Klein .
" Industry implies that people have very strict schedules . "
Has the mobile phone compounded the problem with lateness ?
" You can't really call someone and say , ' Let 's go for a coffee . '
Many Germans will want that date in their diaries for at least a week , " he says .
But , he believes , this will undoubtedly change , because of technological advances , such as the internet and mobile phones .
Many people argue that the phenomenal global penetration of the mobile phone has compounded the problem of lax timekeeping .
Back in the technological dark ages , they say , you could n't contact people so easily , so you made an effort to meet them on time .
In China , too , being on time is the rule .
But this is also one area , where the idea of " face " - or pride - comes into play .
Keeping someone waiting is one way to express your seniority and the more senior you are , the more likely you are to keep someone waiting for a long time , says the BBC's Quentin Somerville in Beijing .
Siesta time
Foreigners still think of Spain as the land of the siesta , which could imply a huge problem with punctuality - especially when it comes to turning up for afternoon meetings , says Danny Wood , BBC correspondent in Madrid .
But , he says , while many Spaniards still have a big break in the middle of the day , usually between 2 pm and 4 pm , they actually work very long , inflexible and structured hours .
Many office workers start before 9 am and do n't finish until well after 8 pm .
Spaniards generally stick to this schedule and are usually punctual .
But business and work meetings are another matter , according to Miguel Angel Fraile , of the Secretary General of the Catalonian Commercial Confederation .
" It 's true that Spain is behind the rest of Europe when it comes to punctuality at work meetings , " says Mr Fraile .
" If I have a meeting in Brussels at 4 pm , it starts at 4 pm .
Here in Spain we have what we see as 10 minutes of courtesy - so at a 4 pm meeting here you can be 10 minutes late .
That 's a problem , because we see this 10 minutes grace as being polite . "
' Why bother ? '
Punctuality is not rigidly observed in many Middle Eastern and North African countries .
Most events in the Egyptian capital Cairo start late
" If you invite people for dinner they turn up at 11 pm , " she says .
" The big disaster is weddings , which are normally held in the evening .
Very often they do n't start the buffet before midnight - even if you were invited for 9 pm . "
This appears to be the same story in other parts of Africa .
In Kenya for example , everyone from the president down is late for functions .
" Kenyans are notoriously late - apart from for work , because that might cost them their jobs , " says the BBC's Noel Mwakugu in Nairobi .
" There is an idea that all functions , official or social , wo n't start on time , so why bother turning up on time ? "
On the same day Gen. David H. Petraeus delivered to Congress his much - anticipated progress report on the U.S. military ’s " surge strategy " in Iraq , neoconservative ideologues associated with the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) took aim at another one of the reputed foes of " freedom "  the Islamic Republic of Iran .
During a panel discussion Monday aimed at promoting his new book , The Iranian Time Bomb , Michael Ledeen , a resident scholar at AEI , criticized the " evil " nature of the country ’s clerical regime and its support for international terrorism and proclaimed the need to back Iranian dissidents and activists in a soft revolution to dislodge the mullahs from power .
Along with the broad  and at times mocking  generalizations about Iran ’s attempts to foment " Islamic totalitarianism " throughout the world , Ledeen , accompanied by former Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey and Clifford D. May , president of the hawkish Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , appeared dead - set against any diplomatic engagement with Iran .
" The [ Iranian ] leadership constantly tells its people ‘ the Iranian people must prepare to rule the world , ’ " said Ledeen .
" Everybody has convinced themselves that they can make a deal with Iran .
We have been negotiating for 27 years , as if there have been no negotiations there is no escape , " he said .
" The only question is how best to defeat them . "
Citing a memorable scene in the James Bond film Goldfinger , in which the eponymous villain straps the fictional British secret agent to a gurney and aims a laser toward his genitals , Ledeen quoted German - born actor Gert Frobe ’s famous line : " I expect you to die . "
" And that ’s Iran .
They want us to die .
They want to destroy us , " said Ledeen .
He went on to describe the Islamist sentiment in Iran as a " political death wish , a political necrophilia . "
With strong links to Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office and the White House , Washington - based AEI has , since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , enjoyed unparalleled influence in shaping U.S. interventionist policy in the Middle East .
The think - tank helped lead the drive to war in Iraq in 2002 and more recently has assumed a prominent role in rallying for regime change in Iran
While no longer under the illusion of the type of large - scale " democratic " intervention that precipitated the current Iraq war , neoconservatives still appear to be pumping up a confrontational attitude between the U.S. and Iran , painting the regime as an existential enemy with whom one cannot negotiate , a fanatical yet militarily weak reactionary government that desires the destruction of the world .
Speaking wistfully about the Cold War , Woolsey compared the Islamist political resurgence in the Middle East with the then - Communist government in Moscow , describing the latter as the " ideal enemy . "
" I have a certain bizarre nostalgia for the Soviet Union , " said Woolsey .
" It is our misfortune that today we have to live with Sunni and Shi’ite totalitarianism . "
However , the panel ’s unanimous and confrontational sentiment did not translate into a coherent foreign policy toward the Iranian regime , which ultimately leads to what the panelists described as two equally disturbing options : Iran with a bomb or bomb Iran .
" If our survival is at stake and they [ Iranians ] are readying themselves to attack us , we will bomb them , " said Woolsey .
Iran ’s uranium - enrichment program is operating well below capacity and is far from producing nuclear fuel in significant amounts , according to a confidential International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report obtained by Reuters .
For Ledeen , it seems the problem is not a nuclear armed Iran as much as it is an Islamist government in Tehran , and his ultimate goal is the removal of the clerical establishment from power .
The panelists did not advocate military action , instead choosing to promote an aggressive but nonviolent soft revolution that would ostensibly be led by Iran ’s " moderate " political actors : intellectuals , students , women , former " reformists , " and members of Iran ’s once - burgeoning civil society .
Yet they omit they idea that , for all the resentment harbored against the regime , frustrated dissidents may not want U.S. help to change the political landscape in Iran .
At worst , aggressive U.S. support  most notably $ 75 million for " pro-democracy " activities  has engendered the belief among regime insiders that the Washington intends to foment a revolution .
In a 2006 visit to the U.S. , Iranian dissident journalist Akbar Ganji declined an invitation to meet with White House officials , citing his belief that Washington ’s current policies were hurting , not helping , promote democracy in Iran .
Ganji , who was imprisoned in 2000 after writing a series of articles accusing Intelligence Ministry agents of killing dissidents , said he was tortured repeatedly during six years in prison .
" Any intervention by any foreign power would bring charges of conspiracy against us , " he told the Associated Press .
And they already have .
Most recently , the regime put Haleh Esfandiari , a U.S. - Iranian and Middle East expert at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington , and Kian Tajbakhsh , an urban planner who has worked with Soros Foundation and the Iranian government , in jail for inciting a revolution .
Esfandiari was released from Evin prison earlier this month , but Tajbakhsh continues to be held without charge .
It appears Iran will remain a target for AEI ideologues and their associates in the months to come .
The question remains as to whether this aggressive pseudo - policy will yield productive results , or if it will end , as many in the international community fear , in military confrontation .
The panelists at Monday ’s discussion left little room for compromise , and their generalizations about Iran as an irrational actor support a very clear and consistent neoconservative message : there can be no negotiation with Iran .
In the final analysis , military confrontation with Iran becomes a forgone conclusion .
Home Garbage Collection Without Paging Garbage Collection without Paging , Matthew Hertz , Yi Feng , Emery D. Berger .
PLDI 2005 Garbage collection offers numerous software engineering advantages , but interacts poorly with virtual memory managers .
Existing garbage collectors require far more pages than the applicationâ€™s working set and touch pages without regard to which ones are in memory , especially during full - heap garbage collection .
The resulting paging can cause throughput to plummet and pause times to spike up to seconds or even minutes .
We present a garbage collector that avoids paging .
This bookmarking collector cooperates with the virtual memory manager to guide its eviction decisions .
Using summary information ( â€œbookmarksâ€ ) recorded from evicted pages , the collector can perform in - memory full - heap collections .
In the absence of memory pressure , the bookmarking collector matches the throughput of the best collector we tested while running in smaller heaps .
In the face of memory pressure , it improves throughput by up to a factor of five and reduces pause times by up to a factor of 45 over the next best collector .
Compared to a collector that consistently provides high throughput ( generational mark - sweep ) , the bookmarking collector reduces pause times by up to 218x and improves throughput by up to 41x .
Bookmarking collection thus provides greater utilization of available physical memory than other collectors while matching or exceeding their throughput .

The divide between Democratic leaders contemplating their re-election prospects in 2008 and rank - and - file Democrats is becoming a chasm -- one so wide that Congressional Democrats may soon find it hard to straddle it .
The issue is impeachment .
So far , Democrats in Congress and at the top of the party hierarchy , out of touch with public sentiment and worried that impeachment could hurt them with " independents " -- whom they mistakenly consider to stand somehow " in between " Democrats and Republicans -- have been following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's vow that for the 110th Congress , " impeachment is off the table . "
They 've been doing more than that : they have been actively working to tamp down , and even to crush , impeachment campaigns in the states .
For example , in the state of Washington , an effort to get the state to pass a joint legislative resolution which would have compelled the Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings was derailed after the Democratic leadership dispatched two of the state 's leading federal elected officials , Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Jay Inslee , to press legislative leaders to block a floor vote .
Similar pressure doomed efforts that might have passed in the legislatures of New Mexico and Vermont ( The Vermont Senate did pass the resolution ) .
Meanwhile , down at the state and local level , Democratic Party committee after Democratic Party committee is voting out resolutions calling for impeachment .
The latest Democratic Party organization to call for impeachment of both Bush and Cheney is the Massachusetts Democratic Party , which at its state convention on Saturday , May 19 , voted out a strong measure calling on the stateâ€™s elected representatives in Washington to investigate Bush and Cheney for misleading the nation into war , for authorizing torture , and for warrantless wiretapping .
The message concludes : " If the investigation supports the charges , vote to impeach both Bush and Cheney as provided in the Constitution . "
Massachusetts Democrats thus join California 's huge Democratic Party , which passed a similar resolution less than a month ago at its annual convention , in what was widely perceived as a slap at Pelosi , who represents a district in San Francisco .
To date , 14 state Democratic Parties have now called for impeachment .
But that 's only part of the story .
Vermont 's state senate has overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for impeachment .
Similar resolutions are being considered in the legislatures of 17 states .
Over 80 cities , towns and counties have passed impeachment resolutions , as have at least that many town and county Democratic Party organizations , even in conservative areas such as Berkes and Chester County in Pennsylvania .
Many of these resolutions have been the work of the Progressive Democrats of America organization .
Others have been promoted by ad hoc groups .
The impeachment resolutions , which have also been passed by Democratic Parties in so - called " red " states like Nevada and North Carolina , are a clear sign that impeachment is the will of the party 's rank and file .
Polls have consistently shown that the broader public also wants the president and vice president impeached .
In October 2006 , Newsweek published a scientific poll disclosing that 51 percent of Americans favored impeachment , half of them as a top priority .
That poll , of course , was taken before Democrats had gained control of the House and Senate , and also before Bush , ignoring the anti-war message of voters in November , decided to increase the number of US troops in his misbegotten and calamitous war in Iraq .
Another more recent poll , taken by a right - wing organization called InsiderAdvantage / Majority Opinion , found that 39 percent of respondents favored impeachment of both President Bush and Vice President Cheney together .
The percentage for impeachment would almost certainly have been significantly higher if impeaching the two men had been offered as separate options in the poll .
Recent news developments are only making impeachment more popular with the public at large .
The worsening Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts , and the Presidentâ€™s intransigence and obsession with continuing the slaughter of innocents and the sacrifice of Americans , has driven his popularity down to 28 percent , and the vice presidentâ€™s to below 9 percent .
The prosecutors firing scandal is taking down the attorney general , while exposing the outlines of one aspect of a six - year - long White House - orchestrated campaign to undermine the democratic election process using control of the justice system .
And it is now becoming clear that the president 's illegal National Security Agency spying program has been so outrageous an assault on Americansâ€™ civil liberties that even then Attorney General John Ashcroft , himself a walking threat to the Bill of Rights , refused to sign on , despite his being pressed to do so from a hospital bed .
At this point , the Congressional leadership , including Pelosi and Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , really need to start worrying that they may start looking ridiculous .
Indeed , the Detroit City Council a few days ago passed a resolution calling on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings , and one of those voting for the resolution was Conyersâ€™ own wife , herself a Detroit alderwoman !
Clearly the president has authorized an illegal spying campaign , and has already been declared to have committed a felony by a Detroit federal judge who tried the issue last summer .
Clearly too , he has grossly abused his power by claiming to have â€œunitary executive powerâ€ as commander in chief in the war on terror , and that this power , nowhere mentioned in the Constitution , gives him the authority to ignore and invalidate laws duly passed by the Congress .
Finally , he clearly misled the Congress about the war , and clearly authorized the practice of torture against American captives .
Equally clearly , if the president is not impeached , Congress will be telegraphing that the next president , whomever that may be , can feel free to abuse the law and the Constitution in the same manner as the current president has been doing .
How can there not be impeachment proceedings !
None of Bush 's and Cheney 's grave crimes and abuses of power even require anything significant in the way of hearings .
They could be submitted as bills of impeachment and voted on by the House Judiciary Committee and by the full Congress tomorrow , if there was the will to do so .
Instead , the Democratic leadership continues to dither , continues to permit the president to ignore subpoenas , continues to interfere with grassroots efforts to pass impeachment resolutions , and continues to ignore even the bill of impeachment against the vice president , House Resolution 333 , submitted a month ago by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , even as it has now gained three co-sponsors .
The chasm is clearly widening between the leadership of the Democratic Party and the voters .
It may end up swallowing them up , come November 2008 .

It 's been such a difficult summer to dress for - teeming down one minute , blowing a gale the next , and then - occasionally - an all - too - fleeting blast of sun .
Yet , with a designer outfit for every eventuality , Ed has managed to take it all in his stride - despite being a terrier .
Five - year - old Ed's impressive wardrobe of gear is worth more than £ 1,000 .
Scroll down for more
It includes a fetching £ 30 green waterproof jacket , a jaunty tailor - made coat to guard against the wind , T - shirts and caps to protect him from the sun , costing up to £ 20 a time , and an array of hooded jumpsuits .
Of course , no outfit is complete without a carefully selected accessory - and Ed has a number of swish bandanas to choose from .
He even has his own £ 30 lifejacket for when he goes sailing .
His owner Harriet Athay , 37 , is unapologetic about splashing out so much on his clothes .

She said : " I do n't think he looks ridiculous .
He looks cool .
If it is raining he does n't leave the house without a jacket and if it's hot he always wears a T - shirt to protect him from sunburn .
" Strictly speaking , if it gets too hot I should keep him in the shade , but a T - shirt allows him to enjoy himself on the beach in the sun without me worrying about him . "
The most expensive items in Ed's wardrobe are a £ 60 gem - encrusted leather lead with a stainless - steel clasp and an £ 80 Aquascutum jacket .

Graphic designer Harriet added : " To other dog owners , who do n't dress up their dogs , I would say their pets do n't look as stylish as Ed.
I have no problem with spending money on him .
" It does n't hurt him .
He 's not in any pain .
He is a very amiable dog , very patient .
He does n't mind at all . "
Harriet is a keen sailor and now Ed is fully equipped to join her .
She explained : " He enjoys it when I put his yachting jacket on as he knows it 's time to go out on the boat .

" He loves sailing with me and I would n't dream of having him on the boat without putting a lifejacket on him .
It 's the same when we go surfing .
I like him looking stylish and I feel happier knowing he is safe . "
But she admitted : " A lot of Ed's clothes , such as his special collars and leads , are just for high days and holidays .
He does n't wear an outfit every time he goes out . "
Ed was a stray before he was rescued by the RSPCA and taken on by Harriet two years ago .
She said : " When I first brought him home , he was understandably very unsure of himself , but two years of love and attention have changed all that .
" Before he got his new lifejacket he used to have just a bland , orange buoyancy jacket - very boring .
As his wardrobe has grown he has blossomed into a confident little dog . "
Most of Ed's clothing comes from the online dog designer company Barker & Ball , who donate a percentage of their profits to the RSPCA .
Harriet , of Christchurch , Dorset , has also spent £ 1,000 on clothes for her other dog , Humbug , a four - year - old whippet .
And not to be left out , she owns £ 10,000 of clothes for herself .
Well , it 's so important to be well groomed .
Michelangelo Antonioni and Chung Kuo
The Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni has just passed away .
The following post originally appeared on December 4 , 2004 in the original version of EastSouthWestNorth , and it is being brought back as a review of the director 's work .
The Globe & Mail article below reports that Michelangelo Antonioni's Chung Kuo was finally shown in China .
This is enough to make me nostalgic for the days when I actually studied the official articles of condemnation .
Here is the principal article :
A Vicious Motive , Despicable Tricks -- A Criticism of Antonioni's Anti-China Film " China " ( Peking : Foreign Languages Press , 1974 ) , an eighteen - page pamphlet ( unsigned ) which reproduces an article that appeared in Renming Ribao on January 30 , 1970 .
Unfortunately , I did not keep a copy of this masterpiece , which was a delight for me to read ( but for all the ' wrong ' reasons ) at the time .
But unless the reader is of a certain age , this irony of the above comment will probably elude him / her .
You will have to imagine how 800 million Chinese people were mobilized into a mass criticism campaign for a movie that none of them had seen , and that all of what they subsequently said was based upon fanciful imagination and internal projection while trying to guess what the higher - up authorities wanted them to say ( as well as not say ) .
Umberto Eco's explanation for the Chinese reception of the Antonioni move was based upon connotative conventions .
An example taken from an Antonioni movie can clarify the difference between denotative and connotative conventions .
You probably know that Antonioni's China - Chung Kuo , a movie the artist directed in a genuinely sympathetic mood , has been interpreted by Chinese critics as an unbearably denigratory pamphlet directed against the Chinese people .
Now if one analyzes frame by frame and sequence by sequence all the cases in which Chinese critics and authorities charge Antonioni with unfriendly attitudes , one realizes that they are all cases in which Chinese addressees have superimposed different connotative subcodes on the ones foreseen by the author .
Among the sequences which have most offended Chinese audiences is one in which the camera shows the Nanking Bridge .
The Chinese say that Antonioni has tried to give the impression that the bridge is unstable and on the verge of collapsing .
If you look at the movie you can see that the director has shown the bridge , by passing underneath it moving the camera in a circular manner , from a sort of " expressionistic " point of view .
This has the effect of privileging oblique angles , transverse perspectives , and asymmetric frames , as any western movie - maker does when he wants to suggest power and architectural impact .
But present Chinese iconographic subcodes are obviously different , as anybody can see when looking at a Chinese movie like The Girl of the Red Guards Detachment , or a propaganda mural painting : Chinese iconography is based on symmetrical and frontal frames with a sort of neoclassical mood and they express power , stability , monumentality only by frontal and symmetric shots .
The denotation was the same ( it was for the Nanking Bridge ) but the connotations were based on different subcodes .
Now I do n't find that convincing at all .
The much better explanation is given in Susan Sontag comments on Chung Kuo from the book On Photography .
As usual with Sontag , this is hardly about this particular movie but extends to the rest of life :
Nothing could be more instructive about the meaning of photography for us -- as , among other things , a method of hyping up the real -- than the attacks on Antonioni's film in the Chinese press in early 1974 .
They make a negative catalogue of all the devices of modern photography , still and film .
While for us photography is intimately connected with discontinuous ways of seeing ( the point is precisely to see the whole by means of a part -- an arresting detail is a striking way of cropping ) , in China it is connected only with continuity .
Not only are there proper subjects for the camera , those which are positive , inspirational ( exemplary activities , smiling people , bright weather ) , and orderly , but there are proper ways of photographing , which derive from notions about the moral order of space that preclude the very idea of photographic seeing .
Thus Antonioni was reproached for photographing things that were old , or old - fashioned -- " he sought out and took dilapidated walls and blackboard newspapers discarded long ago " ; paying " no attention to big and small tractors working in the fields , [ he ] chose only a donkey pulling a stone roller " -- and for showing undecorous moments -- " he disgustingly filmed people blowing their noses and going to the latrine " -- and undisciplined movement -- " instead of taking shots of pupils in the classroom in our factory - run primary school , he filmed the children running out of the classroom after a class . "
And he was accused of denigrating the right subjects by his way of photographing them : by using " dim and dreary colors " and hiding people in " dark shadows " ; by treating the same subject with a variety of shots -- " there are sometimes long - shots , sometimes close - ups , sometimes from the front , and sometimes from behind " -- that is , for not showing things from the point of view of a single , ideally placed observer ; by using high and low angles --
" The camera was intentionally turned on this magnificent modern bridge from very bad angles in order to make it appear crooked and tottering " ; and by not taking enough full shots --
" He racked his brain to get such close - ups in an attempt to distort the people 's image and uglify their spiritual outlook . "
Besides the mass - produced photographic iconography of revered leaders , revolutionary kitsch , and cultural treasures , one often sees photographs of a private sort in China .
Many people possess pictures of their loved ones , tacked to the wall or stuck under the glass on top of the dresser or office desk .
A large number of these are the sort of snapshots taken here at family gatherings and on trips ; but none is a candid photograph , not even the kind that the most unsophisticated camera user in this society finds normal -- a baby crawling on the floor , someone in mid-gesture .
Sports photographs show the team as a group , or only the most stylized balletic movements of play : generally , what people do with the camera is assemble for it , then line up in a row or two .
There is no interest in catching a subject in movement .
This is , one supposes , partly because of certain old conventions of decorum in conduct and imagery .
And it is a characteristic visual taste of those at the first stage of camera culture , when the image is defined as something that can be stolen from its owner ; thus Antonioni was reproached for " forcibly taking shots against people 's wishes , " like " a thief . "
Possession of a camera does not license intrusion , as it does in this society whether people like it or not .
( The good manners of a camera culture dictate that one is supposed to pretend not to notice when one is being photographed by a stranger in a public place as long as the photographer stays at a discreet distance -- that is , one is supposed neither to forbid the picture - taking nor to start posing . )
Unlike here , where we pose where we can and yield when we must , in China taking pictures is always a ritual ; it always involves posing and , necessarily , consent .
Someone who " deliberately stalked people who were unaware of his intention to film them " was depriving people and things of their right to pose , in order to look their best .
Antonioni devoted nearly all of the sequence in Chung Kuo about Peking 's Tien An Men Square , the country 's foremost goal of political pilgrimage , to the pilgrims waiting to be photographed .
The interest to Antonioni of showing Chinese performing that elementary rite , having a trip documented by the camera , is evident : the photograph and being photographed are favorite contemporary subjects for the camera .
To his critics , the desire of visitors to Tien An Men Square for a photographic souvenir : is a reflection of their deep revolutionary feelings .
But with bad intentions , Antonioni , instead of showing this reality , took shots only of people 's clothing , movement , and expressions : here , someone 's ruffled hair ; there , people peering , their eyes dazzled by the sun ; one moment , their sleeves ; another , their trousers .
...
The Chinese resist the photographic dismemberment of reality .
Close - ups are not used .
Even the postcards of antiquities and works of art sold in museums do not show part of something ; the object is always photographed straight on , centered , evenly lit , and in its entirety .
We find the Chinese naïve for not perceiving the beauty of the cracked peeling door , the picturesqueness of disorder , the force of the odd angle and the significant detail , the poetry of the turned back .
We have a modern notion of embellishment -- beauty is not inherent in anything ; it is to be found , by another way of seeing -- as well as a wider notion of meaning , which photography 's many uses illustrate and powerfully reinforce .
The more numerous the variations of something , the richer its possibilities of meaning : thus , more is said with photographs in the West than in China today .
Apart from whatever is true about Chung Kuo as an item of ideological merchandise ( and the Chinese are not wrong in finding the film condescending ) , Antonioni 's images simply mean more than any images the Chinese release of themselves .
The Chinese do n't want photographs to mean very much or to be very interesting .
They do not want to see the world from an unusual angle , to discover new subjects .
Photographs are supposed to display what has already been described .
Photography for us is a double - edged instrument for producing clichés ( the French word that means both trite expression and photographic negative ) and for serving up " fresh " views .
For the Chinese authorities , there are only clichés -- which they consider not to be clichés but " correct " views .
In China today , only two realities are acknowledged .
We see reality as hopelessly and interestingly plural .
In China , what is defined as an issue for debate is one about which there are " two lines , " a right one and a wrong one .
Our society proposes a spectrum of discontinuous choices and perceptions .
Theirs is a constructed around a single , ideal observer ; and photographs contribute their bit to the Great Monologue .
For us , there are dispersed , interchangeable " points of view " ; photography is a polylogue .
The current Chinese ideology defines reality as a historical process structured by recurrent dualisms with clearly outlined , morally colored meanings ; the past , for the most part , is simply judged as bad .
For us , there are historical processes with awesomely complex and sometimes contradictory meanings ; and arts which draw much of their value from our consciousness of time as history , like photography .
( This is why the passing of time adds to the aesthetic value of photographs , and the scars of time make objects more rather than less enticing to photographers . )
With the idea of history , we certify our interest in knowing the greatest number of things .
The only use the Chinese are allowed to make of their history is didactic : their interest in history is narrow , moralistic , deforming uncurious .
Hence , photography in our sense has no place in their society .
The limits placed on photography in China only reflect the character of their society , a society unified by an ideology of stark , unremitting conflict .
Our unlimited used of photographic images not only reflects but gives shapes to this society , one unified by the denial of conflict .
Our very notion of the world -- the capitalist twentieth century 's " one world " -- is like a photographic overview .
The world is " one " not because it is united but because a tour of its diverse contents does not reveal conflict but only an even more astounding diversity .
This spurious unity of the world is affected by translating its contents into images .
Images are always compatible , or can be made compatible , even when the realities they depict are not .
Photography does not simply reproduce the real , it recycles it -- a key procedure of a modern society .
In the form of photographic images , things and events are put into new users , assigned new meanings , which go beyond the distinctions between the beautiful and the ugly , the true and the false , the useful and the useless , good taste and bad .
Photography is one of the chief means for producing that quality ascribed to things and situations which erases these distinctions : " the interesting . "
What makes someting interesting is that it can be seen to be like , or analogous to , something else .
There is an art and there are fashions of seeing things in order to make them interesting ; and to supply this art , these fashions , there is a steady recycling of the artifacts and tastes of the past .
Clichés , recycled , become meta-clichés .
The photographic recycling makes clichés out of unique objects , distinctive and vivid artifacts out of clichés .
Images of real things are interlayered with images of images .
The Chinese circumscribe the uses of photography so that thee are no layers or strata of images , and all images reinforce and reiterate each other . *
We make of photography a means by which , precisely , anything can be said , any purpose served .
What in reality is discrete , images join .
In the form of a photography , the explosion of an A - bomb can be used to advertise a safe .
* The Chinese concern for the reiterative function of images ( and of words ) inspires the distributing of additional images , photographs that depict scenes in which , clearly , no photograph could have been present ; and the continuing use of such photographs suggests how slender is the population 's understanding of what photographic images and picture - taking imply .
In his book Chinese Shadows , Simon Leys give an example from the " Movement to Emulate Lei Feng , " a mass campaign of the mid-1960s to inculcate the ideals of Maoist citizenship built around the apotheosis of an Unknown Citizen , a conscript named Lei Feng who died at twenty in a banal accident .
Lei Feng Exhibitions organized in the large citizens included " photographic documents , such as ' Fei Feng helping an old woman to cross the street , ' ' Lei Feng secretly [ sic ] doing his comrade 's washing , ' ' Lei Feng giving his lunch to a comrade who forgot his lunch box , ' and so forth , " with , apparently , nobody questioning " the providential presence of a photographer during the various incidents in the life of that humble , hitherto unknown soldier . "
In China , what makes an image true is that it is good for people to see it .
( Globe and Mail ) China lifts ban on film icon .
By Geoffrey York .
November 2 , 2004 .
The great Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni was at the height of his fame and his creative powers when he came to China in 1972 to document the revolution .
He had the blessing of Communist authorities and was an intellectual left - winger who sympathized with China 's new society .
When he completed his cinematic portrait of workers and farmers in China 's cities and villages a few months later , he could never have guessed that it would be 32 years before the documentary would be shown freely to a Chinese audience .
To Mr. Antonioni's shock and confusion , his film was vilified by the Communists , who denounced him as anti-Chinese and " a worm who speaks for the Russians . "
His films were banned by the hard - liners who had seized control of China at the peak of the Cultural Revolution , and he became the target of relentless , vitriolic attacks in the state news media .
Under pressure from Beijing , several foreign screenings of the film were cancelled , and Italy 's Communists picketed his appearance at a Venice film festival .
Three decades later , still alive but in poor health , the filmmaker has at last achieved victory over his persecutors .
When his four - hour documentary was screened to 800 people at the Beijing Film Academy as part of an Antonioni retrospective last weekend , it marked a moment of vindication for the 92 - year - old director — and a significant shift in China 's cultural policies .
It was the first public screening in China of the film , entitled Chung Kuo ( the Chinese name for the country ) .
Indeed , it was the first time any film by Mr. Antonioni had been shown in China ; they were all banned after the documentary controversy .
The director , celebrated in the West for enigmatic art - house favourites such as L'Avventura and Blow - Up , has been unable to speak more than brief syllables since suffering a near - fatal stroke in 1985 .
He was too ill to fulfill his long - held dream of seeing his film shown in China , but his wife , Enrica , sent a letter to the Beijing audience on his behalf .
" The idea that Chung Kuo can now be publicly seen in Beijing gives him enormous satisfaction and totally vindicates his efforts , " she wrote .
" Michelangelo regards this as a sign of great opening - up and change on the part of the Chinese side . "
The documentary was proposed by Italian officials in 1971 , shortly after Italy ( and Canada ) established diplomatic relations with Communist China for the first time .
The idea was approved by Beijing , and Mr. Antonioni spent five weeks filming in 1972 , shooting 80 hours of footage of a country that was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution and that foreigners rarely visited .
In its first screening in Rome in early 1973 , Chinese diplomats praised the film .
But soon it was caught up in a Beijing power struggle .
Hard - line zealots from the " Gang of Four , " led by Mao Zedong 's wife , Jiang Qing , used the film as a hammer against their rival , Premier Zhou Enlai , who was seen as an architect of the opening to the outside world .
The hard - liners complained that a foreign " imperialist " had been allowed to " defame the revolution and insult our people . "
In an editorial in the People 's Daily in 1974 , Mr. Antonioni was denounced for showing " unfruitful lands , lonely old people , tired animals and ugly houses . "
The director was deeply hurt by the attacks and by the Italian government 's failure to defend him .
His bitterness continued for many years .
After the economic changes that followed Mao's death , Chinese officials approached the filmmaker in the early 1980s to see whether he might be willing to visit China again .
He demanded an apology for the attacks , but the Chinese refused and the visit never was made .
In 2002 , both sides talked of screening the film in China , but the idea was scuttled at the last minute when Beijing changed its mind .
Despite the vast changes in China in recent years , it took courage for Beijing to allow the film to be screened today , Italian officials said .
The Cultural Revolution remains a sensitive and ambiguous subject for Chinese authorities , who have never apologized for the millions of lives it shattered .
In Mr. Antonioni 's case , the decision to screen his films is as close to an apology he is likely to get .
" It 's a small , hesitant change , but a change , " an Italian diplomat said .
" It 's a way for the new leadership to show the changes without much risk to themselves . "
Chung Kuo bears all the marks of Mr. Antonioni 's distinctively oblique style , the same enigmatic approach that caused such controversy in the cinema world when L'Avventura was released in 1960 .
The film contains not a single interview and not a single sentence of political analysis .
The filmmaker deliberately rejected the conventions of script or story .
" I went to China not in order to know it but to have a look and to record what was passing in front of my eyes , " he said later .
The film succeeds as an artistic work and as a portrait of ordinary life in an isolated country .
With his customary detached tone and extremely long takes , the camera gazes at the Chinese people , their faces and movements .
Long scenes pass without a word beyond the hubbub of background conversation and the sound of bicycle bells and street noise .
" Even today , the film is still fresh and natural and modern , " said Mr. Antonioni 's long - time collaborator , Italian director Carlo di Carlo , who helped edit the documentary in 1972 .
" What 's very important is the slowness and reflectiveness of it , which is very Chinese , in a way .
Antonioni's film language , in its understanding of time and space , is very close to the Chinese aesthetic . "
The film 's narrator makes it clear that the authorities had tried to control Mr. Antonioni 's camera , forcing him to shoot some street scenes secretly .
But the film remains sympathetic to the Communist regime , praising it for reducing malnutrition and even expressing envy for the leisurely pace of life in Chinese cities .
" There seems to be neither anxiety nor hurry , " the narrator says .
For the audience in Beijing , the film was a journey to a land long ago and far away , as alien as any distant galaxy .
Most of the audience members were young people who knew little of the Cultural Revolution beyond the stories they might have heard from their parents .
They gazed in fascination at the women in pigtails and drab clothing , the men in Mao suits and badges , the mud streets lacking any billboards , souvenir stands or glitzy trappings of today 's capitalist economy .
Many of the Chinese audience members could not help laughing at the Maoist songs and revolutionary posters that the film captured .
They giggled when an elderly woman explained that she had few grandchildren because " to build a socialist society , small families are better . "
They chuckled at the scenes of kindergarten children marching like Chinese soldiers , singing songs of praise to the People 's Liberation Army .
" The people in those times were affected too much by propaganda , " said Zheng Tianxin , a 19 - year - old university student who attended the film .
" They had even lost the ability to revolt . "
Xu Qi , a 26 - year - old bank clerk , said she was glad the film was no longer banned .
" Certainly it was not a propaganda film , " she said .
" If anyone held such a view , it 's a big insult to a real artist like Antonioni .
A true artist will never obey the requirements of others . "
We are fast approaching Father ’s Day , the festive occasion on which we plague Dad with yet another necktie or collect phone call and just generally strive to remind the big guy of the central verity of paternity — that it ’s a lot more fun to become a father than to be one .
“ I wo n’t lie to you , ” said the great Homer Simpson .
“ Fatherhood is n’t easy like motherhood . ”
Yet in our insistence that men are more than elaborately engineered gamete vectors , we neglect the marvels of their elaborately engineered gametes .
As the scientists who study male germ cells will readily attest , sperm are some of the most extraordinary cells of the body , a triumph of efficient packaging , sleek design and superspecialization .
Human sperm are extremely compact , and they ’ve been stripped of a normal cell ’s protein - making machinery ; but when cast into the forbidding environment of the female reproductive tract , they will learn on the job and change their search strategies and swim strokes as needed .
Sperm are also fast and as cute as tadpoles .
They have chubby teardrop heads and stylish , tapering tails , and they glide , slither , bumble and do figure - eights .
So while a father may not be entitled to take the same pride in his sperm as he does in his kids , it ’s fair to celebrate the single - minded cellular commas that helped give those children their start .
Sperm are pretty much the tiniest cells in the human body .
The head of a mature , semen - ready sperm cell spans about 5 microns , or two ten - thousandths of an inch , less than half the width of a white blood cell or a skin cell .
And a sperm cell is absurdly dwarfed by its female counterpart , the egg , which , fittingly or not , is among the biggest cells in the body .
At 30 times the width of a sperm , the egg is massive enough to be seen with the naked eye .
But men have the overwhelming quantitative edge in the gamete games .
Whereas current evidence suggests that a human female is born with all the eggs she will have , and that only about 500 of her natal stock of one million will ever ripen and have a shot at fertilization , a male from puberty onward is pretty much a nonstop sperm bakery .
Each testicle generates more than 4 million new sperm per hour , for a lifetime total of maybe 12 trillion sperm per man ( although the numbers vary with the day and generally slope downward with age ) .
Last year , I was interviewing Tim Blixseth for Richistan and asked him what it feels like to be a billionaire .
" It 's an abstract word , " he says .
" When people say that , it 's like they 're talking about someone else . "
But clearly , I said , you have to know that you 're rich .
Right ?
Again , ...
The other day I posted an article on leadership to programming.reddit.com .
Within minutes it had been voted down .
The article was popular elsewhere so it was n’t the article .
Apparently the consensus is that leadership does n’t fit with programming .
I disagree .
Here ’s why leaderships * IS * a programming skill :
1 ) The Trend Towards Integration
The days of isolated systems that do n’t communicate with other systems disappeared years ago .
We are often called upon to write code that forms the glue between various systems — and various groups of people .
In my own job I often find myself working directly or indirectly with dozens of people .
The social integration task may be as much of a challenge as the technical task .
Programmers must be able to effectively work with different people in different roles .
2 ) Projects are Bigger than One Person – And Include non IT members
One day I learned of a system problem and went to talk to with the clerk who reported the problem to get more information .
To my surprise the problem had started days before , but it was n’t a big enough to bother his boss about .
I did n’t hear about it until it had reached the minor crisis level .
I immediately made a mental note to add this clerk to my “ team ” .
From then on I regularly checked back to find out if any new issues had come up .
It did n’t take long for him to learn the scenarios that indicated potential problems and he would report anything strange that came his way .
The result of this team : timely first - hand information and some good PR for IT .
Programmers tend to see their team as only fellow coders .
The many programs that poorly fill user needs are evidence enough of the harm this causes .
Effective programmers draw the user community into the “ team ” and together work towards common goals .
Tactfully overcoming geographic and organizational hurtles are as much a part of a programmer ’s job as design patterns and class hierarchies .
3 ) Effective Leaders Know How to be Good Followers
Good leaders know how to organize and focus efforts on the task at hand .
Those skills make it easier to contribute to any project — regardless of who is leading .
If you do n’t have the humility to be a good follower , you wo n’t be a good leader .
People do n’t voluntarily choose to follow someone on an ego trip !
4 ) The Ego Problem
Let ’s face it — a large percentage of the people in IT are in it to feed oversized egos .
( From time to time that has included me ! )
The results are devastating .
Leadership contrasts self absorption by focusing energies on improving the community .
Over the last few years I ’ve seen a lot of positive growth in this area .
The growing strength of the open source movement is a powerful testimony to great attitudes of so many programmers .
Summary
In university I decided not to be a programmer because I enjoy people too much to stand the idea of spending 100 % of my time staring at a computer screen .
Thankfully , that detour did n’t last too long .
How misinformed I was — I ca n’t remember the last time I spent 100 % of my day starting at the computer screen without some break to work with a colleague , answer a question , discuss a design , etc .
Computers were built by people and for people .
The human factor can never ( and should never ) be removed from that equation .
Jeff Staddon is a full time software developer living near Chattanooga , TN .

Jeff ’s Book Recommendations :
Probably due to it ’s title , The Effective Executive , this book is amost unknown inside of IT .
However , I found it to be very useful .
( It ’s really about being a effective knowledge worker . )
While aimed at management most of the content is applicable to any IT role .

I always found Java boring , .. never really understood how people could get all fired up about it 🙂
When it comes to programming , however , Java is the undisputed present day “ king of the hill ” .
It has a huge community and a lot of cool tools ( e.g. Lucene and ANTLR just to mention a few ) that I would love to use in my own projects .
Problem is : I do n’t fancy the prospect of writing Java code .
Having used Python almost exclusively for the last two years I came to appreciate dynamic languages and loathe going back to statically typed programming .
Maybe Groovy can fill the gap : it appears to be dynamic in nature while allowing easy access to all the Java goodies .
It has some potential and I am still exploring it .
All things considered Jython would clearly be the best contender if it were not for the fact that it is quite outdated ( when compared to CPython ) .
My sense is that a lot of developers and companies would embrace Jython ( and thus Python ) without any hesitation if provided with a modern and more up to date implementation .
The Jython renovation effort is thus a no-brainer and a strategic imperative for the entire Python community .
We should not allow others to outrun us in this important “ market segment ” .
Let ’s get our act together and lend the Jython folks a helping hand !
いいアジャイルと悪いアジャイル
Steve Yegge / 青木靖 訳
2006年9月27 日 水曜
私が子供の頃には、コレステロールは体に悪いものだった。これは覚えやすかった。脂肪は悪い。コレステロールは悪い。塩分は悪い。みんな悪い。しかし近頃では、コレステロールが「いい」コレステロールと「悪い」コレステロールに分かれている。私たちがこの2つをどうにかして見分けられるとでもいうように。そしてその切り替わりは奇妙なものだった。FDAが突然プレスリリースを発表して、殺鼠剤には2種類、いい殺鼠剤と悪い殺鼠剤があり、いい方はたくさん摂って悪い方は摂ってはならず、そして決して2つを混ぜたりしてはいけないのだと言ったかのようだった。
一年くらい前まで、私はいわゆる 「アジャイル」プログラミングに対して、ごく一次元的な見方をしていた。すなわち、それはマーケティングのペテン師によるばかげた一時的ダイエットであり、「銀の弾丸はない」を読んだことのないうぶなプログラマや、延長保証や自己啓発本を買ってボスは自分のことを人として心から気にかけてくれると信じているようなプログラマや、友達を作ろうとカンファレンスに参加し、空港でチラシを配っている狂信者とアイコンタクトを避ける方法を知らず、インデックスカードに書き散らすことでソフトウェア開発が突如として易しくなると信じているようなプログラマに、また新たなテクノロジーウィルスを植え付けているのだと思っていた。
ああ、間抜け。それが私が探している言葉だ。私の悪いコレステロール観は、アジャイル方法論は間抜けのためのものというものだった。
しかし私は最近、実践されているアジャイル主義の様々な変種を観察する機会があり、今では自分は90%くらいしか正しくなかったと思うようになった。いい種類のアジャイルもあるということが分ったのだ。
スクラムやそのほかのものをめぐるあらゆるハイプとへつらいと熱にうかされた呻きにまぎれ、はっきりと見極められるようになるのにずいぶんと時間がかかった。しかし今ではすごくはっきりとわかるようになった。
そしてあなたは私のセミナーに大特価の499.95ドルで参加できる!
ハッハッハッ。間抜け!
冗談だよ。見つかるのは悪い種類のアジャイルのセミナーばかりだ。もし私がいつかアジャイルコンサルタントとして講演してまわって、私のアジャイル開発に対する深い知恵と洞察を聞こうという聴衆からお金を取っているのを見かけたら、私のタマを切り落としていい。あれは冗談だったと私が言ったなら、私がそう言うだろうと言ったと言えばいい。それに対して私が自分はタイラー・ダーデンで、私のタマを切り落とすなと命ずると言ったなら、私がそう言うだろうと私が確かに言ったと言って、即座に切り落としてかまわない。
私はすぐに話を進めて、いい方についての話をタダで教えてあげる。
いいアジャイルと悪いアジャイルを切り離して話すのはちょっと難しい。だから一緒に話すことにしよう。いい方には幸せなネズミ、悪い方には惨めな死んだようなネズミで印をつけておくので、いつでもどちらの話をしているのかわかるはずだ。
悪い方の 話
かつては、ほとんどの会社がソフトウェア開発に次のようなアプローチを取っていた。
- たくさんのエンジニアを雇い、それからさらに雇う。
- プロジェクトを考えつく。
- リリースしたい日を設定する。
- エンジニアをそのプロジェクトに割り当てる。
- 彼らが死ぬか、プロジェクトが完成するか、あるいはその両方となるまで、彼らをむち打つ。
- ちゃちでつまらない打ち上げをする( かもしれない)。このステップは省略可能だ。
- 最初に戻る。
そういうのがあなたの会社で、今起きていないなら感謝することだ。やれやれ!
面白いことに、これは非技術系の会社(たとえば、クライスラーとか)がソフトウェア開発を処理していた方法でもある。違うのは、彼らはエンジニアを雇わなかったということだ。かわりにソフトウェアコンサルタントと契約し、そのコンサルタントに2年間のプロジェクトの仕様書を渡し、すべてを期限までに終わらせ、かつ、顧客が投げ込んできたクズと、契約後にした変更をすべてやることを要求した。それからプロジェクトは破綻し、請け負った人たちは支払ってもらえず、みんな本当に腹を立てることになった。
そのためコンサルタントたちはこんな風に考え始めた。「なあ、企業が子供みたいに振舞い続けるというのなら、連中を子供として扱おうじゃないか」。そしてそれを実行した。企業が「機能AからZまでがほしい」と言うと、コンサルタントたちは例の大きなインデックスカードを取り出し、最初の1枚にAと書き、2枚目にはBと書き、と言う具合に、機能を見積もり付きで書き込んでいく。そうしてそれを壁に貼り出す。そうすると顧客が何か追加したいと言ったときに、コンサルタントは壁を指差して、「OK、じゃあどのカードと交換しようかな、僕?」と言うことができる。
クライスラーがプロジェクトをキャンセルしたのも無理はない。
それでコンサルタントたちは、今度は主要な顧客を失うことになってしまい、バーでくだを巻いていたら、あるとき、彼らの1人( L・ロン・ハバードという名前の男)がこう言った のだ 。 「 この1行いくらという仕事は割に合わないよ。本当の金がどこにあるのか知っているだろう?
自分の宗教をはじめなきゃ」。そんなふうにしてエクストリームプログラミングとサイエントロジーは始まった。
人々はほどなくXPがごみの山であることを示すことになった。たとえばペアプログラミングだ。これはXPの中でも特にひどく失敗したもののひとつだ。アジャイル主義者もこれについてはあまり話したがらない。それを誰もやってないという事実から目をそむけないことだ。ペアプログラミングの論拠はこういうことだった。「端末の前に座る1人のプログラマが良いなら、10人はもっといいはずだ。多い方がいいに決まっている!
しかし端末の前には2人のプログラマしか座れないから、これをペアプログラミングと呼ぶことにしよう!」
彼らを少し大目に見てやらなきゃいけない。彼らは幼稚園児同様の企業をずっと相手にしていたのであり、それは本当にわずらわしいことなのだ。
しかしそいつは、ウィルスというやつは殺すのが本当に難しく、ミームのたぐいは特にそうだ。みんながこのアジャイルというのに夢中になり(みんな間違いなく、より生産的になりたい
と思っている)、失敗を認めることで面子を失う人がたくさん出た。それで別な種類のアジャイル「メソドロジー」が現れ、他のが全部駄目でも自分の方法はうまくいくのだとみんな主張していた。
そういう人たちのサイトを覗いてみるといい。インフォマーシャルじゃないのがあれば教えて欲しいものだ。ほら、試してごらん。見るのさえ気恥ずかしいよ。
そう、確かに彼らは大もうけしているが、それはちょうどサイエントロジーと同じことで、P・T・バーナムの法則のためなのだ。彼らを批判することはできない。ある人たちは、お金も尊厳も投げ出してどうしても入りたいと思う。
そういう人たちを別にすれば、アジャイル方法論がばかみたいだというのはみんな知っており、それは次の良く知られたマーケティングの法則を適用すればわかることだからだ。
- 一般論として、自ら 「方法論」と称するものはすべて間抜けだ。
- 「 エバンジェリスト」を必要とし、セミナーを提供しているものはすべて、もっぱら金儲けのために存在している。
- 競合や代替となるものについて決して触れることのないものは、私利的である疑いがある。
- 一般論として、ダイアグラムとお手軽な計算式を使うものは間抜けだ。
ここで 「間抜け」と言っているのは、「間抜けな人たちをターゲットとする極めて優れたマーケティング」という意味だ。
いずれにせよコンサルタントたちはつやつやしたパンフレットを作って巡業し続けた。最初私は、彼らが企業を追いかけているのだと思っていた。「何でもいい」から「2週間」で作ればいい、というような融通の効く契約の兆候を探し、クライアントが破産するまでそれを繰り返すのだと。しかしそんな契約にサインするほどばかなクライアントは、そうたくさんは見つからないだろうとも思っていた。
そしてその時こそ、コンサルタントがその巡業先を開発者たち変える時だ。企業の中に入って行って開発者に売り込んだらどうだろう?
前に述べた鞭打ちサイクルで開発している企業はたくさんあり、ミドルマネージャやテクニカルリードの中には、その地獄のような境遇から抜け出せる安上がりな方法があるという話を素直に聞いてくれる人
もいる可能性は十分にある。
そしてこれが、まさに彼らが 「 害のない馬鹿」から「潜在的な危険性」に変わった瞬間だ。以前は彼らは頭が悪くて自分のソフトウェアを開発できない企業から金を騙し取っていただけだが、今では廊下で私とすれ違うマネージャが影響を受けるかもしれないからだ。そして多くの場所では、この厄介な状況を隔離できるあまりいいメカニズムが
存在しない。本来は頭のいいマネージャが「病気にかかり」、XPの本とインデックスカードを振り回し、この新発見になる余計な官僚主義で自分のチームがいかに生産的になったかとまくし立てるのだ。
より生産的になってはいないと、どうして言えるだろう?
そう、これは扱いにくい問題なのだ。扱いにくい問題に違いなく、そうでなければ今頃はすっかり暴露されていたはずだ。しかしよく知られている様々な理由により、ソフトウェア開発の生産性の測定というのはきわめて難しい。ソフトウェア開発に対して有効な科学実験みたいなことをするのは、さらに難しい。同じプロジェクトを同じチームで2回行うことはできない。2回目のときには多くのことが変わってしまうからだ。2つのチームに同じプロジェクトをさせることもできない。あらゆる変数をコントロールするのはあまりに難しく、またそのような試みはどのような場合であれ高く付きすぎるからだ。同じチームが2つの異なるプロジェクトを続けて行う場合というのも、やはり実験にはならない。
できることと言えば、たくさんのプロジェクトをやっているたくさんのチームについて統計的なデータを集め、類似性の同定を試み、ある種の回帰分析を行って、何らかの意味のある相関関係が見出されることを期待するくらいのものだ。しかしデータはどこから持ってくるのか?
企業は、仮にそのようなデータを持っていたとしても、内部データを提供しようとはしない。およそありそうにないことだ。彼らはスケジュールの失敗を隠し、どこまでも楽観的に進み続ける。
実験することができず、証明することもできないなら、あまり科学的とは言えない。それが扱いにくい問題だという理由だ。一時的なダイエットにすごく人気があるのも同じ理由だ。人々は一時的なダイエットに効果があることを期待する。そのはずで、私だって効果があって欲しいと思う。そしてあの統計的に意味のない
「 ジョーはこの方法で35ポンド痩せました」という事例を取り上げることができ、どうしても痩せたいと思っている人たちは、「なに、別に害があるわけじゃなし、ちょっとやってみよう」と思うのだ。
これはまさに開発チームがアジャイル方法論を試してみようという話をするときにみんなの言っていることだ。別に偶然ではないのだ。
しかし悪いアジャイルについてばかり書いているのは効果的ではないだろう。サイエントロジーがいかに説得力がないかとか、一時的なダイエットがいかに効果がないかと書いたところで、それで誰かの気持ちを変えられるかはわからない。バイラルミームをやめるのは、タバコをやめるのより難しいのだ。私はどちらもやり遂げたが。適切なインパクトを与えるためには代替案を示す必要がある。しかし私ははっきりと示せるようなものを、以前には持っていなかった。
悪いアジャイルの( たくさんある ) 問題の1つは、彼らが非アジャイル開発をすべて見下して、ウォーターフォールとカウボーイの2種類に分類していることだ。ウォーターフォールが悪いことはよく知られている。このことは今日では自明の理と認めてもらえることを期待したい。しかし、いわゆるカウボーイプログラミングについてはどうだろう?
アジャイルの人たちはこれを「チームのメンバがそれぞれ自分で一番良いと思うやり方でやること」と定義している。
他に開発プロセスはこれしかないというのは本当なのだろうか?
そしてカウボーイプログラミングは実際悪いものなのだろうか?
アジャイルの人たちは明らかに悪いかのように言っているが、それがなぜ、どのように悪いのかははっきりとは説明しておらず、ただそれは「カオス」なのだと決めつけている。
前に言ったように、この一年私は悪いアジャイルといいアジャイルの両方について、実践されているところを観察し、チームやテクニカルリードから(いい方法と悪い方法のどちらも使い)いろいろ聞く機会に恵まれた。どんな風にやっているのか、どんな風に感じているのか、プロセスはどう機能しているのか。私は本当に興味を持っていたのだが、それはある部分では、去年のクリスマスにそれを試してみることに同意し(「別に害はないって!」)、インデックスカードに書くメタデータが正確に何であるべきかチームメートと議論になり、うんざりしてやめてしまったという経験をしたためだ。これはまた、デスマーチと見えるプロジェクトで憔悴しているチームに友達がいたためでもある。そのようなことはGoogleではあまり起こらないように見える。
だから猛烈に勉強し始め、この一年の間に観察し、学んできた。
いい方の 話
( ヒント : 幸せなねずみ )
Googleのソフトウェア開発プロセスについて少し話そうと思う。これはもちろん全体像というわけではないが、今日のところはこれで十分だと思う。私はGoogleに来てほぼ1年半になり、少し時間がかかったが、今では分かるようになった気がする。だいたいのところは。私はまだ学んでいる最中だ。しかしこれまでにわかったところをお教えしよう。
高いレベルでは、Googleのプロセスは、もっと伝統的なソフトウェア開発会社の人から見ると、たぶんカオスのように見えるだろう。新しく入ってきた人には、次のようなことが目に付く。
- 一種のマネージャはいるが、彼らのほとんどは少なくとも時間の半分はコードを書くのに使っており、テクニカルリードに近い。
- 開発者は、自分のチームやプロジェクトを、いつでも好きなときに、何も聞かれることなく変えることができる。ただそうすると言えば、運送屋がやってきて翌日には新しいオフィスで新しいチームと働くことになる。
- Googleには開発者に何をやれと言わない哲学があり、開発者たちはそのことをとても重く受け止めている。
- 開発者は20%の時間(これは週末や個人の時間にということではなく、月-金、8-5時の間でということだ)を、自分のメインのプロジェクト以外でやりたいことに使うよう強く促されている。
- ミーティングがあまりない。平均的な開発者はたぶん週に3回くらいのミーティングに参加し、これには自分のチームのリーダーとの1対1のものも含まれる。
- 静かである。エンジニアは1人で、あるいは2-5人の小さなグループで、静かに自分の仕事に集中している。
- ガントチャートや、日/タスク/担当者が書かれたスプレッドシートや、そのほか何であれ、目に見えるプロジェクト管理を示すものは見たことがない。
- 比較的まれなクランチ期間においてさえ、みんなランチとディナーは食べにいき、それは(良く知られている通り)いつも無料で美味だ。そして自分でそうしたいというのでない限り、ばかげたくらい長時間働くようなことはない。
これはもちろん一般化している。長くいる人は若干違った見方をしているだろう。私のAmazonに対する見方が、それがまったく狂った場所であった1998年にそこにいたということによって若干バイアスがかかっているのと同じことだ。しかしGooglerたちの多くは、私の一般化がごく正確なものだと認めてくれると思う。
どうしてこんなのが機能しうるのか?
私は何度もそう聞かれた。私自身聞いてみた。エンジニアがみんなトラブルプロジェクトやバグだらけのシステムの運用の悪夢から逃げ出すのを止めるのは何か?
何でも好きなことをやれるというときに、会社のゴールに向かってエンジニアを働き続けさせるものは何なのか?
どうやって最重要プロジェクトが適切に人員を確保できるようにしているのか?
エンジニアが太りすぎて戸口に引っかかり、消防隊に救出してもらう羽目にならないのはなぜか?
最後の疑問に簡単に答え、それから他の疑問に答えることにしよう。簡単に言うと、私たちにはNoogler*1 Fifteenと呼ばれるものがあり、これはFrosh*2 Fifteenをもじったものだ。多くの大学一年生は、ストレスとピザの国に降り立つと15ポンド太る。Googleは戸口に油を塗ることでこの問題を解決している。
* 1 Noogler : Goole新入社員のこと 。
* 2 Frosh : 大学の新入 生
そのほかの疑問については、少数の同じことが答えになっていると思う。
最初に、そしておそらく最も重要なのは、Googleがインセンティブで行動を促しているということだ。重要なプロジェクトで働くエンジニアは、平均では、重要性の低いプロジェクトで働くエンジニアよりも多くの報酬をもらう。誰のためにも実用となりそうにない突飛で研究的な類のプロジェクトで働くことを選ぶこともできるが、その場合仕事は
自分で報酬を生み出す必要がある。あなたが正しくて他のみんなが間違っていたことが分ったなら(これはスタートアップの夢だ)、あなたの小さなプロジェクトはすごく大きなインパクトを持つようになり、あなたはそのことで報われることになるだろう。間違いなく。
報酬とインセンティブは、ここで話すにはあまりにたくさんあるが、金銭的なインセンティブということで言うと、商品券やマッサージクーポンから巨大なボーナスと無償増資まであって、「巨大」を正確には定義しないが、Googleのスケールを考えれて、想像を少たくましくしてみれば、それほど大きくはずすことにはならないだろう。
他の種類のインセンティブもある。1つはGoogleがピアレビュー指向の文化であり、ここでは同僚の尊敬が大きな意味を持っているということがある。他のどこよりもそうだと思う。これはある部分では単にそういう文化だからとしか説明できない。早い時期に生まれ、根付いたのだ。それにまた同僚たちがまったくもって頭のいい連中なので、彼らの尊敬を勝ち得るというのはすごく大きなことなのだ。そして勤務評定もほとんどピアレビューに基づいてなされるため、間接的な金銭上のインパクトがあるのも事実だ。
もうひとつのインセンティブとして、四半期ごとに欠かすことなく行われている全員参加のイベントがあり、そこではローンチされたプロジェクトの1つひとつが全員に紹介され、そのローンチを行った(常に小さい)チームのメンバの顔と名前が映し出されて、みんなから喝采を受けることになっている。私は考えただけでもぞくぞくする。Googleはローンチを重要なものと考えており、何かクールなものをローンチしたと認められることは、この会社で最も強いインセンティブなのではないかと思う。少なくとも私はそう感じている。
さらに他のインセンティブもある。このリストはどこまでも続いていく。臨時手当は過度であり、報酬は過度であり、そこにあるすべてがおかしなくらい過度で、部外者にはリクルーターの言うことが真っ赤な嘘にしか聞こえず、それは一個の会社がすべての社員に対してそんなに気前よくできる方法があるとは思えないからだ。すべての社員というのは、
マイクロキッチンの掃除をする契約社員まで含めてということで、彼らはすごくかっこいい「Googleマイクロキッチンスタッフ」シャツとフリースをもらえる。
そんな場所はこの地上に他にない。Googleで働くことがどれほど驚くべきことか話し出したら、何時間、何日話し続けても止まらないだろう。そして彼らも止まることがない。毎週のように、新しい手当や、特典や、改善や、それにGoogleでの生活をよりよくできる方法が何かないかと全員に聞くアンケートがある。
私は実のところ間違っていたかもしれない。四半期の終わりに大きなスクリーンに自分の名前と写真が表示されるのは最大のインセンティブでないかもしれない。Googleで適切な行動を駆り立てるのは、他の何よりも、他のすべてを組み合わせたよりも大きいのは、感謝の念だ。Googleのために最善を尽くそうとせずにはいられない。それほどまでに気遣ってくれる相手に対し、借りがあるように感じるのだ。
インセンティブについてはいいだろう。どんなものか分ったと思う。いくらかは。つまり、その概観はつかめただろうということだ。Googleで働いていない友人にGoogleで働くのはどんなかと聞かれたなら —— これは私が働いたことのある会社に限らず、Google以外の会社にいるすべての友人たちにも同じように当てはまるのだが —— 私はこんな風に感じる。刑務所からちょうど出所したところで、刑務所の中で友達になった、10代のはじめから服役している人たちが手紙をくれて、彼らは「外の生活」はどんなかと聞いている。あなたなら、そういうときに何と答える だろう ?
私ならこんな風に言うだろう。そんなに悪くないよ。まあ文句は言えない。全体としてすごくまともだと思う。
インセンティブに基づく文化というのが、Googleを動かす上で大きな要因となっているのは確かだが、それはどうやってエンジニアに「適切」なことをさせるかということに関わっているだけだ。いかにしてそれを効率的に、効果的に行うかというのは別な話だ。だから彼らのプロジェクトへのアプローチの仕方について少し話すことにしよう。
創発性 対 ムチ
プロジェクト管理の基本的なアイデアは、プロジェクトを完結に向けて推し進めるということだ。これは顕在的なプロセスであり指導ということだ。リーダーシップの力と、組織力と、全くの意志の力によって、自然には起らない何かを起こすということだ。
プロジェクト管理には、軽量のものから重量のものまで、様々な趣のものがあるが、共通しているのは、組織に対して働く外部的な力だということだ。
Googleでプロジェクトが立ち上がるのは、それがシステムにとってもっとも低いエネルギー状態だからだ。
先に進む前に、これが甚だ大胆な主張で、完全に正しいわけではないことを認めておこう。私たちのところにもプロジェクトマネージャや、プロダクトマネージャや、人事マネージャや、テクニカルリードそのほかの人たちはいる。しかし彼らがシステムに与えなければならないエネルギー量は、私たちの業界で通常必要とされるものよりはるかに少ない。継続的に全力で押し続けるというよりは、ときたま突っついて合図するというのに近い。時にはチームにもっと大きな突っつきが必要になり、そういうときは、他の組織と同様、上級のマネジメントがやってきて突っついてやることになる。しかし押されたりすることはない。
ついでながら、Googleは礼儀正しい会社で、怒鳴ることはなく、泣き叫んで歯ぎしりすることもなく、エスカレートして指さし合うこともなく、上級マネジメントがよく怒鳴っているような会社に見られるものは何もない。ホッブスが組織はリーダーを反映すると言っている。私たちは皆そのことを知っている。Googleのトップにいる人たちは礼儀正しく、だから他のみんなもそうなるのだ。
ともかく、プロジェクトを立ち上げることはGoogleの内部的なエコシステムにおいては自然な状態なのであり、それはプロジェクトが1つの方向を示して多くのエネルギーがそこに注ぎ込まれるようにするからだ。開発者に必要なのは、プロジェクトに集中できるように面倒を見てやることだけであり、前に言ったように、Googleが気に入ることに集中することへのインセンティブはたくさんあるからだ。
だからこのシステムではプロジェクトは自然に発生するようになる。
このことにより、標準的なプロジェクト管理におけるアイデアや方法の多くは必要でなくなる。怠け者の扱いとか、はったりの見積りの実行を迫るとか、共有デザイン上の問題にコンセンサスを求めるとかいったことは必要なくなるのだ。「戦争チームミーティング」は必要なくなり、状況報告も必要なくなる。それが必要ないのは、彼らがすでに適切なことをし、共同して働くことに対するインセンティブを持っているためだ。
Googleのやっているプロジェクト管理のテクニックは、燃料よりはオイルに近い。プロジェクトを前に推し進めるための強制力ではなく、プロジェクトがスムーズに動き続けられるようにするものということだ。ミーティングルームはたくさんあり、おしゃべりができるオープンスペースもたくさんある。チームは金魚鉢スタイルの自由席で集まって作業しており、ペアプログラミングはまさに必要なとき(5%くらいの時間)に行われ、必要がなければ行われない。
Googleでは、静かな会社であっても1日の真ん中あたりの時間帯には邪魔が入りがちなものであると一般に認識されていて、多くのエンジニアは稼働時間をずらし、とても早く来るか、あるいは遅くまでいることで、プログラミングに本当に集中できる時間を確保できるようにしている。だからミーティングは1日の中間の時間帯にしか行われない。午前10時前に始まるミーティングや、午後4時半以降に始まるミーティングというのは滅多にない。この時間帯の外にミーティングをスケジュールすると、そのミーティングの対象となっているものをエンジニアが実際に作る時間に食い込んでしまうので、そうしないのだ。
Googleがプロジェクトをこのような仕方で運営している唯一の場所というわけではない。Googleのアプローチを考えるとき、私の頭に浮かぶ他の組織が2種類ある。スタートアップと大学院だ。Googleはスタートアップと大学院のメンタリティを融合したものと思っていい。一方には、さあ急ごう、何かを世に出そう、できるだけシンプルに動くものを作り、後で成長させよう、というスタートアップスタイルがある。もう一方には、我々は誰も解いたことのない難しい問題に取り組んでおり、それは短距離走よりもマラソンに近く、激したミーティングではなく深い集中が必要になるという、比較的リラックスして抑えた雰囲気がある。そしてこれら2つに共通しているのは、スタートアップも大学院も豊かなイノベーションの下地を持っており、参加者が結果に対して大きな個人的責任を負っているということだ。
そういったことは今までにもなされてきたことだが、Googleの本当に驚くべきところは、それをスケールさせているということだ。
このスケールしているということは偶然ではない。Googleはこの問題に実に熱心に取り組んでおり、ここまでスケールしてこられたということが、この先もスケールし続けられることを保証しないのをわかっている。だから彼らは用心深い。これは褒め言葉だ。彼らは自分たちの成長とともに、社内の生活のあり方や、全体の生産性のレベルが保たれているか(あるいはいっそう向上しているか)、常に目を配っている。
Googleは、ソフトウェアエンジニアの視点から見たとき、際立って統制のとれた会社だ。彼らはユニットテストや設計ドキュメントやコードレビューといったことを、私が聞いたことのあるどの会社よりも真剣にやっている。彼らは自分たちの環境が常に整理されているよう熱心に働いており、どこかのエンジニアやチームが自分勝手な方法でやらないようにする厳格なルールやガイドラインが実施されている。結果として、コードベース全体が同じように書かれ、チームを変えたりコードを共有したりすることが、他の会社でよりもずっと簡単なことになっている。
エンジニアはもちろん優れたツールを必要とするので、Googleは自分で使うツールを作るために優れた人々を雇っている。彼らはエンジニアたちに、その方面への興味があればツール作りに協力するように(インセンティブを使って)奨めている。結果として、Googleは世界でもトップクラスの優れたツールを手にしており、それは改善されつづけている。
このリストはどこまでもつづく。Googleのソフトウェアエンジニアリングへのアプローチの背後にある驚くほどの厳しさについてなら何日でも話せる。しかし一番言いたいのは、彼らが(技術的にも組織的にも)スケールしているのは偶然でないということだ。そしてひとたびGoogleのやり方に慣れたなら、すべて苦もなく進めていけるようになる——再び、平均として、他の多くの会社におけるソフトウェア開発と比べればということだ。
カレンダーの専 横
話はほとんど済んだ。最後に話しておきたいと思うのは日程についてだ。伝統的なソフトウェア開発は、ほとんど例外なく、日程指向プログラミングと呼べるだろう。
スタートアップには投資家と予算によって定められる時計がある。大きな顧客企業はコンサルタントに目標とする日を設定する。セールスの人たちとプロダクトマネージャはマーケットの状況の評価に基づいて定めた目標日を設定する。エンジニアは以前にやった似た作業から導いた見積によって日程を設定する。見積りはすべてバラ色の眼鏡を通して行われ、前にやったときどれくらい苦労したかをみんな忘れている。
みんな日程を何もないところから持ってくる。「これは3週間くらいであるべきだという気がする」「第4四半期の始めまでに顧客に届けられれば都合がいい」「がんばって明日までにやろう」
私たちの業界ではほとんどの人が日程ドリブンで動いている。常に次のマイルストーンがあり、常に締め切りがあり、常に日程ベースのゴールがある。
唯一このルールの例外として思いつくのは
1 ) オープンソースソフトウェアプロジェクト
2)大学院のプロジェクト
3 ) Google
日程を決めるのは当たり前のことだとほとんどの人は思っている。私のお気に入りのソフトウェアプロジェクトマネジメントの本である「人月の神話」でさえ、スケジュールの見積りが必要であることを前提としている。
作っているソフトウェアについて前もってアナウンスする習慣があるなら、一般の人々はそれがいつ頃になるのかを知りたいと思い、それは日付ということになる。私の考えでは、これがGoogleが前もってアナウンスをしないことが多い理由なのだ。いい料理を手早く作ることはできず、赤ちゃんを手早く産むことはできず、そしてソフトウェア開発を手早くやることはできないということを彼らは知っているのだ。
これらの3つの例外が日程によって駆動されているのでないなら、何が彼らを駆動しているのか?
ある部分では、それは創造への欲求であり、何かを作りたいという欲求だ。すぐれたエンジニアがみんな持っているものだ。(私たちの業界には、この仕事を「生活のため」にやっており、家に帰ったら次の日まで考えもしないという人たちが多い。オープンソースソフトウェアは、それよりましな人たちがいるからこそ存在している。)
しかし注意しよう。創造への欲求がすべてではない。それは必ずしも十分な方向付けがなく、必ずしも十分なインセンティブとならない。Googleも間違いなく時間によって駆動されているが、それは彼らが「可能な限り早く」ものごとを成し遂げたいと思っているという意味でだ。彼らにはたくさんの恐ろしい、頭の切れる競合がおり、成長を求める投資家たちの渇きをいやす必要もある。そして私たちの1人ひとりにも、人生の時間の中で達成したいと思っている長期的なプランや成果がある。
違うのは 、Googleは物事にどれくらいかかるか分っていると主張するほどばかでも傲慢でもないということだ。会社全体にかかわる日程として私が気付くものとしては、四半期の終わりがあるだけだ。あの大きな画面に出て、喝采と贈物とボーナスとチーム旅行そのほか、Googleにとって大きなインパクトのある何かをローンチすることに伴ういいものを手に入れようと、みんなが先を争う。
間にあるのは、ただ日々の連続だ。その間みんな、それぞれにとっての最適な生産性で働いている。私たちは仕事と生活のバランスを自分で選択することができる。Googleは理にかなった選択は受け入れられ、報いられるような場所なのだ。最適な生産性はまた
、トレーニングの賜でもある。Googleはトレーニングを山ほど提供しており、毎週内外の講演者によるテクニカルトークが何ダースも行われている。それらはすべて恒久的にアーカイブされており、いつでも好きなときに見られるようになっている。Googleでは仕事を成し遂げたり、仕事の仕方を学ぶために必要なリソースは何にでもアクセスできる。それから最適な生産性は作業するマシンやコンテキストにも依存する。コードベース、ツール、ドキュメンテーション、コンピューティングプラットフォーム、チームメートのクオリティ、それに1日に過ごす時間のクオリティさえ、生産性に影響する。そのために食事の提供や多くの時間を邪魔されずにいられることが必要になる。
あとあなたに必要なのは作業キューだけということになる。それで全部だ。何か気の利いた計算式が欲しい?
私は以前待ち行列理論でモデル化されたソフトウェア開発というのを勉強したことがある。そんなに的はずれでもなかったが。私たちの業界の人の多くは、組織モデルがソフトウェアモデルに似ていることに気付いている。
作業キュー( もちろん優先度つきだ ) さえあれば、アジャイル方法論の魔法の利点だとされていることの多くは即座に達成できる。そして間違わないで欲しいのは、それはインデックスカードの山ではなく、ソフトウェアに入れた方がいいということだ。納得できないというなら、あなたのインデックスカードを取ってしまうから。
優先度つきキューは、プロジェクトが進むにつれて人々から出てくるあらゆるアイデア(それにバグ)を投げ込むゴミ捨て場のような場所だ。このキューが空(これは定義により、プロジェクトが完了されたことを意味する)にならない限り、どのエンジニアもアイドル状態になることはない。タスクを保留したり再開したりするには、単に適当なメモやドキュメントをつけてキューに戻すだけだ。どれだけの作業が残っているのかいつでも分かり、望むなら残っているタスクに基づいて時間を見積ることもできる。クローズされた作業アイテムを調べてバグの回帰率から(望むなら)個々人の生産性まで、様々なことを推定できる。何のタスクがよく見送られるかわかり、これは組織における苦痛の原因を見つける役に立つ。作業キューは完全に透明なものであり、作業がだぶって行われるリスクはほとんどない。
そのほか。このリストはどこまでも続く。
残念ながら、作業キューはセミナーやカンファレンスで人を呼べるいいマーケティングツールにはならない。あんまり見栄えがしない。それは作業の山のようにしか見えないのだが、それは実際その通りだからだ。
悪いアジャイルについてもっと詳しい話
私は高いレベルでの概要について説明した。ある会社のソフトウェア開発へのアプローチは、アジャイル方法論でもウォーターフォールサイクルでもなく、カウボーイプログラミングでもない。それは小文字のaではじまるアジャイル(agile : 素早い)だ。Googleは早く動き、早く反応する。
私が言ってなかったのは、良いソフトウェア開発プロセスの上に大文字のアジャイル方法論を被せたらどうなるかということだ。あなたはこう考えるかもしれない。「まあ、別に害はないだろう!」
私自身、去年ちょっと試してみたくらいだ。
手短に言うと、それは害になる。もっとも苦痛な部分は、自分のチームにアジャイルを選ぶテクニカルリードやマネージャが、状況の現実に盲目になるということだ。悪いアジャイルはいくつかの仕方でチームに害を与える。
第一に、悪いアジャイルは最悪な仕方で日程に集中するものだ。短いサイクル、短期の成果物、頻繁な見積りと再見積り。サイクルの間隔はひと月( これはまだ許容範囲だ)から、最悪の場合1日にまでになりうる。そういうのは理想主義的な世界の見方だ。
現実世界においては、プロジェクト関係者の1人ひとりが人間であるということがわかる。私たちには調子のいい日も悪い日もある。ときにはエネルギーが満ちあふれ、18時間ぶっ通しでコードを書けると感じる。ある日には、エネルギーはあるが、コーディングに集中する気にならないということもある。ある日にはすっかり疲れ切っている。みんな生物時計とバイオリズムを持っており、それについて自分ではほとんどコントロールすることができない。そしてその時計は、チームの時計が日とか1週間の半分といった単位で動いている場合には、チームの時計とずれがちなものなのだ。
個人的な時計については言うまでもない。仕事以外の生活でも様々な出来事が起り、仕事時間中に注意を向ける必要が出ることもある。
これらはどれも悪いアジャイルでは問題とされない。大きな納品のあと、気持ちが高揚していても、狂ったようにコーディングしようとはしないだろう。次の大きな全力疾走に備えてエネルギーを貯めておく必要があるので、少し安静にしていようと思うのだ。このインピーダンスミスマッチにより、優れたエンジニアが並の働きしかできなくなる。
課外活動時計というのもある。それは自分のメインプロジェクトとは別に成し遂げたいと思うことで、たとえばソースのクリーンアップやその他のことだ。これは最終的にはチーム全体の生産性を向上させる。悪いアジャイルはこれの扱いがはなはだまずく、大きなマイルストーンの後にみんながサイドプロジェクトの作業ができるように時間を取
るのをやめてしまう。彼らがクリエイティブに感じるか感じないかにお構いなしに。悪いアジャイルの連中はいつもゴールを見続けており、それはイノベーションを損なうことになる。確かに、彼らも各自が自分のコードベースをクリーンアップするための時間は取っておくかもしれないが、みんな会社の他の人を助けようと思うほど利他的ではない。
実質的に日々遅れている状況が永続するというときに、どうして他の人を助けるなんてことができるだろう。
悪いアジャイルは、何かの理由で早起きの人に歓迎されるようだ。「夜明け前に起きる」「静的型付けは好きだが、型推論は嫌い」「偏執的なほどに系統立っている」「チームミーティングが好き」といった性格傾向と、「悪いアジャイルが好き」だということの間には、何か神秘的な関連があるように思える。それが何なのかはっきり分らないが、そういうのを多く目にする気がする。
エンジニアのほとんどは早起きではない。週に少なくとも一度(通常数回)朝8時のミーティングに出なければならないチームというのを知っている。そのあと彼らは昼までメールを開いたままゾンビのように座っている。それから家に戻って居眠りをする。夜になって働きに出てくるのだが、充血した目をしており、いつも疲れ切っているように見える。彼らに話しかけると、通常十分に陽気なのだが、しかしいつも言葉を最後まで言い終わらない。
彼らに(個々に)、アジャイルアプローチが好きかと聞いてみると、彼らはこんな風に答える。「うまく行くように思えるけど、ある種のしきたりが破られているような気がする・・・」。「よくわからない。何かを試みようとしているんだとは思うけど、何の意味があるのかよく分らない」。すべて新しいものであり、はっきり意見を言うことを恐れており、問題を起こしているのがアジャイルなのか、あるいは会社のあり方なのかさえ、誰も確信を持っていない。
これは(小文字の ) 「アジャイル」ではない。ばかげているものの山にすぎない。そしてこれは、いつであれ、どこであれ、誰かマネージャが間抜けになろうと決めたときに手にするものなのだ。
いいアジャイルは、その名前を捨てるべきだ
次 の2種類の主張には疑問を持つよう気をつけることだ。
- 「 彼が説明したいい部分は、本当にアジャイルだ」
- 「彼が説明した悪い部分は、チームがプロセスの実施に失敗したのだ」
こういうのをよく耳にするだろう。私はアジャイルに関する本をたくさん読んでおり(自分が扱っているものが何なのかはっきり分るのに十分なだけ読んだ。それはウィルスだ)、そして他の人々のアジャイルに対する批判もたくさん読んだ。アジャイルが批判をかわすときには、上に挙げた2つのようなスタンダードな戦術を使う。何であれいいものは手柄にし、何であれ悪いものは認めないのだ。
あるプロセスに良いものである可能性があったとしても、90+%の場合に頭のいい善意を持った人たちが失敗するなら、それは悪いプロセスなのだ。本当はチームのミスではないのに、チームのミスなのだと言っているだけだ。
私は 「アジャイル」という用語に懸念を感じるようになった。今や過剰に使われ過ぎている。いい開発者はこの言葉とその含むところをすっかり避けるようにした方がいいと思う。「アジャイルプログラミング」の2つの形態について話したが、(まったくちゃんとした)第三のものがあり、それはテクノロジーを使って生産性の向上(つまり「 アジャイル性」)を達成しようとするものだ。「
Ruby on Railsによるアジャイル開発」とか、「 アジャイ ルAJAX 」 とか、あるいは 「 アジャイルC++」というのまである。これらは私の持っている本の中でもごくしっかりしたものなのだが、「アジャイル」という言葉の乱用に拍車をかけている。
そして巷にあふれるアジャイルの多くは、率直にいって悪いアジャイルだ。
だから私がもしあなただったら、履歴書からアジャイルという言葉は取るだろう。スクラムやXPの本は静かに閉じ、どこかにしまい込む。タスクはバグデータベースか、そのほかの作業キューソフトに入れて、インデックスカードはゴミ箱に捨てる。自分の組織からアジャイルを消すべく可能な限り速やかに動く。
そし て( 小文字の ) アジャイルとなることに集中する。
しかしこれは単に私の意見だ。それにもう朝の4時になる。好きなように結論を引き出すといい。どちらにせよ、私は明日早起きはできそうにない。
そうだ、私は注意書きを書き忘れるところだった。私はGoogleを代表して話しているわけではない。これらの意見は私個人のもので、彼らが私のブログを見たら、あなた方同様に驚くことになると思う。それが「誕生日のサプライズ」のような驚きであって、「野生のサイがびっくりさせられた」というようなのではないことを願っている。ではまた!
Two mites , frozen in amber in the act of mating .
The female is on the left and the male is on the right .
Talk about coitus interruptus :
A pair of mites preserved in amber during the act of mating reveals that the female took the reins during sex .
The mites , an extinct species called Glaesacarus rhombeus , were getting busy 40 million years ago when they became trapped in sticky tree sap .
The sap eventually hardened into amber , preserving the mite tableau inside .
Compared with modern mites , a new study finds , G. rhombeus was sexually progressive .
" In this species , it is the female who has partial or complete control of mating , " study researcher Pavel Klimov , of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology , said in a statement .
" This is in contrast to the present - day reproductive behavior of many mite species where almost all aspects of copulation are controlled by males . "
All species undergo an evolutionary battle of the sexes , vying for the ability to choose their mates and thus maximize the potential for their genes to survive over time .
In the case of the itsy - bitsy arthropods called mites , males take charge of mating , coercing females and guarding them from mating with others .
Modern male mites have specialized organs made to cling to reluctant females .
That 's not a great arrangement for female mites , who do n't get to pick superior males to mate with ( weaker males may still be able to coerce the females to mate ) .
The females also have to put up with harassment by and frequent matings with pushy male mites , which can cause injury .
The ancient mites did n't have this problem , Klimov and his colleague Ekaterina Sidorchuk of the Russian Academy of Sciences found .
The extinct male preserved in amber lacked specialized grasping organs .
Instead , the female had a projection on her rear end that allowed her to control the male 's clinging .
The researchers reported their results March 1 in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society .

On June 18 , seven children were killed during a U.S. - led air strike against a suspected al - Qaeda sanctuary in eastern Afghanistan .
Three days later , at least 25 civilians died during a similar " incident " in Helmand province in the south of the country .
The same day , a U.S. air strike aimed at a house in the Iraqi town of Baquba accidentally hit a different structure , wounding 11 civilians .
The Pentagon is currently investigating the errant strike .
The above " incidents " are part and parcel of warfare , initially denied , later called " accidents , " rationalized as " collateral damage , " regularly " under investigation , " and always " regrettable . "
Yet as U.S. President George W. Bush ’s " surge " policy ebbs in the quagmire of Iraq , and the U.S. - led NATO force struggles to maintain order in Afghanistan , increasing calls in Congress and among the U.S. public for a gradual withdrawal of combat troops may result in an escalation of the use of air power .
As Tom Engelhardt of TomDispatch.com writes , " Barring an unexpected change of policy , some version of this list of ‘ errant ’ incidents , multiplied many times over , is likely to represent the future of both Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Compared to the sensational suicide attacks that lead the nightly news  a truck bombing in Amerli , north of Baghdad , killed more than 150 civilians over the weekend , making it one of the deadliest single bombings since the 2003 invasion  air strikes remain a rudimentary aspect of war and rarely make the headlines .
When they do , they are often buried deep in the story .
Aerial warfare is euphemistically referred to as " surgical " or " precise " so as to diminish the awesome and devastating power of 2,000 - pound bombs being dropped from the sky .
It was implemented decisively during the early stages of the 2001 war in Afghanistan , when the U.S. provided air support for the Northern Alliance as it routed the Taliban from power .
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq , U.S. military commanders incorporated a " shock and awe " strategy , designed to bombard the Iraqi military with such immense force it would quickly submit and bring about a swift defeat .
But as the U.S. - led coalition struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq , aerial bombardments have received increasing attention , not for their pinpoint accuracy so much as for the number of civilians killed during the expanding bombing sorties .
The Afghan government , human rights groups , and humanitarian aid organizations say that more than 300 civilians have died this year as a result of Western operations , mostly when air power was called in to help allied troops in trouble , according to a recent report from Reuters .
" We are looking closely at our air operations , but it would not be something we would be looking to change at this point , " International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) spokeswoman Lt. Col.
Maria Carl told reporters in Kabul in late June .
This was " mostly from the standpoint that air offers us the opportunity to cover a lot more [ of ] that ground that we ca n’t do with a limited number of troops at that moment , " she said .
Almost six years after the U.S. - led invasion , frequent troop shortages , as well as an aversion to allied troop casualties , have forced military commanders to increase their dependence on air power to defeat insurgents .
Yet the Afghan death toll as a result of air strikes continues to rise .
On July 2 , 45 civilians were killed during a NATO - led air assault in Hydererbad , in the south of Afghanistan , compelling President Hamid Karzai to publicly call for an investigation into the incident .
While Karzai has condemned the Taliban for using human shields , he has also said the foreign soldiers consider Afghan lives " cheap . "
Four years after the Bush administration ’s " shock and awe " campaign that was supposed to kill Saddam Hussein and bring peace to Iraq failed to accomplish what was intended , U.S. warplanes have increased attacks again , dropping bombs at more than twice the rate as the previous year , according to a recent report by the Associated Press .
So far this year , U.S. warplanes have dropped 237 bombs and missiles in support of Coalition ground troops in Iraq , exceeding the 229 dropped in all of 2006 , according to U.S. Air Force figures obtained by the AP in the same report .
If the bombing trend is any indication , a U.S. troop withdrawal or " drawdown " will most likely be accompanied by an even greater reliance on air power , a precedent that was set during the Vietnam War , when then - President Richard Nixon announced his " Vietnamization " policy .
Under the plan , South Vietnam was to be supplied with arms , equipment , and military advisers while the U.S. force withdrew .
During the same period , Nixon authorized mass bombing runs into Laos and Cambodia , as well as the war ’s largest bombing campaign , Operation Proud Deep , in which U.S. B - 52 bombers and other jet bombers flew more than 1,000 sorties into North Vietnam .
Even before Nixon came to office , prominent Lyndon Johnson administration adviser Samuel Huntington  who is most famous for his controversial " Clash of Civilizations " thesis  justified the heavy bombardment of the South Vietnam countryside as a way to drive the peasants who supported the Viet Cong into urban areas .
By directly applying " mechanical and conventional power " on a massive scale so as to compel a massive migration from the countryside to cities , Huntington theorized that the Vietnamese would be less likely to support a Communist agrarian revolution .
In the changing landscape of 21st - century warfare , a technologically superior U.S. military has been forced to adapt its strategy to combat counter - insurgency tactics .
Guerilla warfare is waged on city streets , often amid civilian populations .
Hence , air power can never be an effective substitute for ground fighting .
This was witnessed during the 2006 war between Israel and the Islamist resistance group Hezbollah .
During a four - week period , the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) relentlessly bombed Lebanon , destroying much of the country ’s infrastructure in the process .
But the objective of the IDF ’s massive use of air power  to permanently eliminate the threat of Hezbollah  was never accomplished .
" Military historians have a name for the logic behind Israel ’s military campaign in Lebanon .
It ’s called ‘ strategic bombing fallacy , ’ " wrote Brookings Institution fellow Philip H. Gordon in an op -ed in the Washington Post during the 2006 war .
" Far from bringing about the intended softening of the opposition , bombing tends to rally people behind their own leaders and cause them to dig in against outsiders who , whatever the justification , are destroying their homeland , " he wrote .
As the U.S. public ’s tolerance for troop casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan steadily shrinks , the Bush administration finds itself in a precarious situation .
Reliance on air power and the cumulative effect of errant bombs portend an ominous future for U.S. political goals in the region .

1. Alessandro Moreschi ( the only recorded true castrato ) [ Wikipedia ]
The Castrati were men who were forcibly castrated at an early age in order to ensure that they would not experience the hormonal changes of puberty that lead to the lowering of the male voice .
This meant that as adult men they sang like a modern soprano ( they retained their boy soprano voices ) .
After the Catholic Church ensured that all nations banned the practise , Pope Leo XIII took the remaining Castrati into the care of the Sistine Chapel Choir to guarantee them a quiet life ( at the time they had become the subject of ridicule ) .
Moreschi is the only castrato to be recorded solo .
In this recording he is over 50 years old and had lost much of the quality of his voice - nevertheless the resulting recording is incredibly eerie .

5. Lord Hawhaw ( William Joyce ) - executed for treason [ Wikipedia ]
William Joyce ( or Lord Hawhaw has he more well known ) was a fascist politician who worked for the Nazi ’s during the war as a propagandist .
His distinctly “ posh ” English accent is the cause of him receiving his mocking nickname .
Joyce broadcast propaganda from radio stations in Berlin , Hamburg , and Luxembourg .
Whilst it was not illegal to listen to his broadcasts in England , it was frowned upon .
Nevertheless his recordings were very popular with the public as a source of amusement .
He became a hated and ridiculed figure .
He escaped after the war but an English soldier overheard him talking at a cafe and recognised his voice .
He was arrested and executed for treason .
This recording is a snippet of one of his propaganda broadcasts and it begins with his signature “ Germany calling , Germany calling ” .

Number Stations ( shortwave radio stations of unknown origin ) have been reported since World War I and continue to this day .
No one knows what their reason is though many people suspect they are coded messages used for espionage ( though no country has admitted this ) .
The broadcasts are usually a female voice ( though male voices have been heard ) and they generally broadcast streams of numbers , words , or letters .
They are sometimes apparently random , and other times organised .
In the 90’s , amateur radio enthusiasts tracked the source of one number station to a US military base .

Nine - hundred - and - nine people drank cyanide after Jim Jones ordered his men to kill visiting Congressman Leo Ryan and numerous members of his entourage .
In this horrifying recording you hear the last 30 - 45 minutes of Jones directing his followers to poison their children and then themselves .
At one point one of the female voices on the tape is heard to say “ It ’s okay - they are n’t crying because of pain - it is just because of the bitter taste ) .
Some of the bodies found had died of forced cyanide injection or gunshots .
Jones was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head .

Okay , I know this is a top ten list , but there has been so much demand from reddit to add the Sounds of Hell recording that I have added it .
The background is that a group of Russian scientists were digging in Siberia when their drill started spinning wildly ( usually indicative of hitting a pocket of air ) .
They lowered microphones into the hole ( apparently this is normal as the sounds can help to determine what the physiological makeup is of the area they have drilled to ) .
When they listened to the resulting recording , it appeared to be sounds coming straight from Hell .
This is , in fact , a hoax .
It has gained great popularity on the internet and does have some basis in fact - but the bit about hell is , well , not true .

In early August , NASA internally released its latest marketing campaign , designed to show its relevance and value to the American people .
Its new slogan ?
“ NASA explores for answers that power our future . ”
The campaign now seems to be aborted , but it did get me thinking , could we do any better ?
I am no marketing genius , but I think that we could .
I mean North Face ’s has much more zing , " Never Stop Exploring ; " Even Dow Chemicals did better , " The Human Element . "
Now , I know that NASA does not have the massive budget that these companies do to hire super star advertising execs .
I also know that a lot of people at NASA put a lot of time and thought into this new campaign and so I do n’t want to criticize it without offering up some constructive alternatives .
Therefore , I am turning to cyberspace and the power of crowdsourcing to come up with some alternatives to offer them .
One of the issues they cite in their market research is a challenge being relevant to people 18 - 24 .
Maybe we could help .
I will even throw in prizes .
The writer of the best slogan will get a DVD of the space movie of their choice , From the Earth to the Moon , Star Wars , Battlestar Galactica , etc. and will be interviewed for a follow up posting on what it takes to engage the public with space .
Other noteworthy submissions will get other small space swag .
For reference , the previous NASA slogan , under the previous Administrator ( new Administrator , new slogan ) was “ Explore , Discover , Understand . ”
Although it seemed a little dry at the time , it now seems light years ahead .
It at least it honored the ‘ under four words ’ rule ( ok there is not really an under four words rule ) .
The NASA plan is more then just a slogan however , it also includes a blue triangle and the equation " Innovation + Inspiration + Discovery = Future . "
I am not interested in mocking what was done , I am actually interested to see if in three weeks time , the collective power of the Wired set can create something that actually moves , touches and inspires people .
To see if we can craft something that appeals to the public , that speaks to them and has them want to make sure that we Never Stop Exploring .
If you are on board say aye !
Submissions should be posted as comments here in the NASA Slogan Reddit tool ( link fixed ! ) by Sept 28th .
Please do not comment on each others submissions until after the winner is announced on October 1st .
If you do n’t like someone ’s suggestion make your own !
It is easier to destroy than to create .

The lists tell passengers which airlines are banned in France and Belgium
The lists were posted on the websites of the French civil aviation authority ( DGAC ) and Belgium 's Transport Ministry on Monday .
Switzerland has also promised to provide its own list on Thursday .
The moves follow a plane crash in Venezuela on 16 August , in which 152 French passengers died on their way home to the island of Martinique .
Meanwhile on Saturday , at a meeting of the European Civil Aviation Conference in Bucharest , experts called for a Europe - wide definition of common criteria for blacklists .
The European Commission reached a deal in February to allow the creation of EU - wide blacklists of unsafe airlines by the end of the year .
But correspondents say it is unclear whether agreement on the blacklists is possible , with Italy calling for just a list of safe companies .
Charter transparency
The two countries ' lists were mutually exclusive , though several names of airlines coincided with those on a list published in the UK .
AIRLINE BLACKLISTS
French list Air Koryo , North Korea Air Saint - Thomas , US Virgin Islands International Air Service , Liberia Air Mozambique ( LAM ) , including its subsidiary Transairways Phuket Airlines , Thailand Belgian list Africa Lines , Central African Republic Air Van Airlines , Armenia Central Air Express , Democratic Republic of Congo ICTTPW , Libya International Air Tours Ltd. , Nigeria Johnsons Air Ltd. , Ghana Silverback Cargo Freighters , Rwanda South Airlines , Ukraine
In addition to the list of banned airlines , the DGAC site also published a list of authorised companies including charter airlines .
French Transport Minister Dominique Perben said last week that by the end of the year passengers taking charter or tour group flights would have the right to be told which company was operating the flight .
Checks on aircraft making stopovers at French airports will also be stepped up .
Switzerland has already revealed the names of some banned airlines , but said it would publish a full list on 1 September .
Passenger revolt
On Wednesday night , 235 passengers of a Tunisian charter plane flying from Paris to the Tunisian island of Djerba refused to re-board a plane which was forced to return to Orly airport for checks shortly after take - off .
That incident came a week after the Venezuela crash , which involved a Colombian - owned plane .
August 2005 has been marked by a string of major plane disasters .
In less then two weeks , three planes have crashed in Greece , Venezuela and Peru - all three of them operated by minor airlines .
More than 300 people have lost their lives in the three accidents .
The issue of blacklisting came to prominence when 148 people - most of them French - died in January 2004 in a crash involving an airline which had been banned from Swiss airspace , a fact which the passengers had no way of knowing .
Mr Carter , 81 , who negotiated the 1978 Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt , wrote in the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz yesterday that Israel 's actions doom any Palestinian state to a " dismal " future and will perpetuate violence across the Middle East .
" The pre-eminent obstacle to peace is Israel 's colonisation of Palestine , " he wrote .
" Israel 's occupation of Palestine has obstructed a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land , regardless of whether Palestinians had no formalised government , one headed by Yasser Arafat or Mahmoud Abbas , or with Abbas as president and Hamas controlling the parliament and cabinet . "
Mr Carter also questioned Israel 's commitment to the US - led " road map " peace process .
" Israel has officially rejected its basic premises with patently unacceptable caveats and prerequisites , " he said .
He said Israel was insincere at peace negotiations during the 1990s when it offered to withdraw only a small proportion of the 225,000 settlers living in the West Bank .
" Their best official offer to the Palestinians was to withdraw 20 % of them , leaving 180,000 [ Israelis ] in 209 settlements , covering about 5 % of the occupied land , " he said .
" The 5 % figure is grossly misleading , with surrounding areas taken or earmarked for expansion , roadways joining settlements with each other and to Jerusalem , and wide arterial swaths providing water , sewage , electricity and communications .
This intricate honeycomb divides the entire West Bank into multiple fragments , often uninhabitable or even unreachable . "
This week the acting Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , said that if he wins this month 's general election , as expected , he will annex the main settlement blocks that are home to about 80 % of settlers . |
Mr Carter said Israel 's unilateral pullout from the Gaza Strip had left it as a " non-viable economic and political entity " and that the future of the West Bank is " equally dismal " .
" Especially troublesome is Israel 's construction of huge concrete dividing walls in populated areas and high fences in rural areas - located entirely on Palestinian territory and often with deep intrusions to encompass more land and settlements ...
" This will never be acceptable either to Palestinians or to the international community , and will inevitably precipitate increased tension and violence within Palestine , and stronger resentment and animosity from the Arab world against America , which will be held accountable for the plight of the Palestinians . "
Hamas is expected to deliver a list of proposed cabinet ministers to the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , today after the once - dominant Fatah party said it would not join the new government .
The prime minister designate , Ismail Haniyeh , told CBS television that he hoped one day to sign a peace agreement with Israel .
But he said Hamas would renounce violence and recognise the Jewish state only when Israel recognised " a Palestinian state within the boundaries of Gaza , the West Bank and East Jerusalem " .
Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disease that involves the loss of a specific group of neurons in the substantia nigra that produce dopamine .
Sufferers experience a range of symptoms , including a tremor , other motor problems , depression , and cognitive disturbance .
The disease itself is not fatal , but involves severe reduction in quality of life and the symptoms can often cause complications such as choking or pneumonia in advanced PD patients .
As an undergraduate sitting in neuropharmacology lectures , I was interested to hear that smoking was inversely correlated with PD ; that is , people who smoked were less likely to develop the disease .
Whether that link was causative , in that nicotine was neuroprotective for PD , or correlative , in that PD - prone patients had an aversion to nicotine , was not clear .
Other research has identified caffeine and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as ibuprofen as possibly having a protective effect .
A new case study published tomorrow in the Archives of Neurology has examined the prevalence of PD , smoking , caffeine , and NSAID usage in 356 patients and 317 of their family members .
The study , conducted by a team at Duke University Medical Center , found that although there was no link between PD and NSAID usage , both smoking and caffeine intake were inversely related to PD .
Now , I do n't want this to sound like an advert to start smoking ; not contracting PD is a little pointless when you drop dead from lung disease or a heart attack , and any neuropharmacological reason for nicotine or caffeine protecting the dopaminergic neurons remains unknown .
It is possible that these drugs suppress some genetic component of the disease , but only a great deal of further research will answer that question .
Bloomberg News Article Written by Andrew Fixmer 6-13-2007
Link to Bloomberg News Reporter Bob Hoenig Audio Interview with Club 33 Manager , Gary Maggetti Club 33 Is Disneyland 's Haven for Johnny Depp , Chevron , Booze June 13 ( Bloomberg ) --
The hottest attraction at Disneyland may be the biggest secret .
It 's not plotted on any official Disneyland maps .
Thousands of tourists pass by every day , oblivious .
Only a number discreetly posted next to an unmarked door indicates where the exclusive Club 33 sits .
That 's the way the club likes it .
The low profile is n't hurting the members - only restaurant :
The wait to join stretches out nine years .
Even for members , it 's necessary to call months in advance to book a table for the peak summer months or holidays .
Most of the members are corporations , including San Ramon , California - based Chevron Corp. and San Antonio - based AT&T Inc .
Both are original members of the club founded 40 years ago by Walt Disney himself .
A visit to the club and park in Anaheim , California , is often used to reward employees or treat favored clients .
`` It 's a unique facility , '' said Alex Yelland , a Chevron spokesman .
`` It 's a once - in - a - lifetime , priceless experience .
It has that cachet . ''
Now Walt Disney Co. , based in Burbank , California , is opening the door a crack .
It plans to increase the 487 - member roster , said Gary Maggetti , who oversees Club 33 as head of Disneyland 's food and beverage services .
He said the total probably wo n't be raised much above 500 .
The challenge is figuring out how to allocate the new memberships .
`` The number of memberships is one thing , but the ratio of corporate memberships to individuals is more important because of how they use it differently , '' Maggetti said .
`` We have to find the right balance . ''
Fees and Meals Corporate memberships , which cost $ 20,000 plus $ 5,825 in annual fees and $ 4,375 a year for extra members , rarely turn over and are used more frequently , he said .
Individual memberships run $ 7,500 plus $ 3,025 in annual dues .
On top of that , members must pay for their meals , prepared by a chef who graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park , New York .
A recent lunch for four , without alcohol , came to $ 257 before tip .
It 's the only place in the park where alcohol is served , and the wine list offers $ 200 vintages .
Diners are more likely to be executives from AT&T , Boeing Co. , Chevron or Coca - Cola Co. than occasional celebrity guests such as actor Johnny Depp or musician Elton John , who has played the antique harpsichord in the hallway , said Michael Bracco , Club 33 's manager .
`` It 's similar to buying a stadium suite or courtside seats at Lakers games , '' said Randall Hiatt , president of Costa Mesa , California - based restaurant consultancy Fessell International Inc. , which has advised Disneyland on Club 33 .
`` It 's all about taking care of your very best customers . ''
Fascinated Fans
The secretiveness inspires a cult - like fascination among some Disneyland fans .
They post elaborate reports about their visits to Club 33 , fret about the lengthy waiting list , and sell Club 33 trinkets on EBay .
A page on the Mouse Planet Web site , http://www.mouseplanet.com , is devoted to Club 33's restrooms , including photos of the women 's toilets and men's urinals .
``A lot of the reason people want to go to Club 33 is the exclusivity and the location , '' said Tony Phoenix of Lakewood , California , a co-founder and chief technical officer of Mouse Planet .
``For many years , it was shrouded as a mystery and Disney did n't really acknowledge it even existed . ''
For many fans , the main attraction is the direct link to founder Walt Disney .
He came up with the idea of a club to entertain dignitaries , hired Hollywood set director Emil Kuri , and traveled to New Orleans to handpick much of the Victorian bric - a - brac , Bracco said .
Disney died at age 65 , five months before the club 's opening in May 1967 .
Disney 's Genius `` The exclusivity attracts people , but the real draw runs much deeper , '' said Dale , who runs an unofficial Club 33 Web site , http://www.disneylandclub33.com .
``Within the club , the genius of Walt Disney is felt throughout . ''
Access to the club is restricted to members with reservations , and their parties .
Even a Disneyland spokesman giving a tour was n't allowed inside on one occasion .
To enter , guests lift a hidden panel in the doorway , push a buzzer on an intercom and provide a name to the receptionist .
Only then will the door open to a small lobby designed like an old - fashioned French hotel , complete with a spiral staircase that wraps around a reproduction of an antique lift .
The upstairs is split between two dining rooms : one light - filled and formal , the other with dark wood paneling and an animatronic California turkey vulture .
The restaurant is decorated with props from Disney films , including a table from ``Mary Poppins ' ' and the wooden telephone booth used in `` The Happiest Millionaire . ''
Even with membership dues and meal charges , Club 33 does n't provide a windfall for Disneyland , said Hiatt , the restaurant consultant .
The restaurant 's annual revenue is probably about $ 25 million , based on an average $ 65 check , 80 percent occupancy and membership dues , he said .
The theme park does n't break out the club 's sales , said Robert Tucker , a Disneyland spokesman .
`` It 's not a huge money maker , '' Hiatt said .
`` But they get a lot of mileage and benefit out of it . ''

Introduction
If you read our Radeon 9800 SE to Radeon 9800 Pro Mod Guide , you should have known ATI 's R350 and R360 cores are used in the Radeon 9800 series of graphics cards .
In fact , ATI used the same cores in their FireGL X2 workstation graphics card as well !
Yes !
The GPUs ATI used in their desktop graphics cards are the same GPUs they use in their FireGL series of workstation graphics cards !
They only make some minor changes to the PCB of the FireGL cards .
In some cases , it looks like they even use the same PCB used in the desktop cards !
ATI has been using this trick since the release of their Radeon 9500 series , which uses the R300 core .
Even NVIDIA did the same thing with their GeForce series , which they turned into Quadro cards with some minor modifications on the PCB board .
What this means is these workstation cards are essentially the same as their desktop counterparts .
Why did ATI and NVIDIA choose to do this ?
Well , as usual , it 's all about the money .
Designing a different GPU for workstation cards requires a lot of money .
And since the market for such cards is relatively small , the cost will cut too deeply into their profits .
By using a desktop GPU in their workstation cards , the cost of workstation cards becomes virtually the same as that of desktop cards .
This greatly increases their profit margin and makes workstation cards a very lucrative market .
In addition , using desktop GPUs allow great flexibility when it comes to supplying a fickle market .
Now , why should anyone bother to purchase a " real " FireGL card with its premium price when it is exactly the same as the cheaper Radeon card ?
Luckily , the similarity between the FireGL and Radeon cards also works to our advantage .
This similarity actually allows us to mod a Radeon desktop card into a FireGL workstation - grade card !
The ATI FireGL cards are essentially identical to the Radeon cards , except their display output capabilities .
Without making any actual modifications on the card , you can actually mod a Radeon into a FireGL card .
The only disadvantage is the modded FireGL card will not have the additional display output capabilities found in some FireGL cards .
Of course , this depends on the Radeon card you own .
BRITISH intelligence officials believe rogue elements in the Russian secret service may have murdered former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko , it has been reported .
But as he lay dying in agony , poisoned by a radioactive material , Mr Litvinenko insisted he was an " active case " for Russian intelligence and named a senior Kremlin agent as responsible for targeting him .
As British police prepared to fly to Moscow to interview two Russians who spoke to Mr Litvinenko on the day he was poisoned , a senior figure at the International Atomic Energy Agency told The Observer the murder was an organised operation .
The ability to obtain the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 — most likely from a nuclear facility — and the knowledge needed to use it meant that a lone assassin could not have killed Mr Litvinenko , the IAEA figure said .
McClatchy Via Yahoo :
Volney Warner thinks big .
A retired Army four - star general who helped craft counterinsurgency doctrine during the Vietnam War , he 's made a career out of thinking about how U.S. military strategy should advance America 's global interests .
How does domestic politics shape military tactics ?
How and why did U.S. civilian and military leaders fail in Vietnam and Iraq ?
What has Iraq taught the U.S. military about unconventional war ?
A highly regarded expert on counterinsurgency who enjoys a reputation among his peers as a sharp thinker who pulls no punches , Warner asks why the U.S. military — with all its tradition , training , equipment and support — has failed to learn the lessons of Vietnam and apply them to Iraq .
He gave his answers in a series of interviews with a McClatchy Newspapers reporter .
" If the strategy is wrong and the policy is wrong , you can't blame the people implementing it .
They are trying to implement a political strategy that wo n't work .
It 's very difficult to turn the train around , " said Warner , who at 81 heads a defense consulting firm in McLean , VA . .
" I have to believe that military leaders in positions of trust and confidence may have made stupid decisions ( in the course of fighting an insurgency ) , but never with malice aforethought towards the country that spawned them and certainly not with intent to destroy the lives of those soldiers who believed in them , trusted their decisions and carried out their orders to their deaths .

Civilization II
Time for a game of really high quality .
In my opinion , this is one of the best games ever made .
If you have played Civilization ( or Colonization ) , you 'll know the layout .
For the rest of you , here goes :
You start out in 4,000 BC with a small group of settlers and a covered map .
The first thing you need to do is to find a good location to build your first city .
Then you have to develop the land and research new technologies .
As the game progresses , you also have to start building an army to defend yourself from any neighbors with hostile intentions .
You can face up to six computer - controlled civilizations during the game , and each of them has its own unique behavior .
Any actions you take towards one of them might give you a bad reputation , making the others less friendly towards you , and if you are really careless , they will start forming alliances against you .
You have several levels of difficulty , ranging from very easy to one in which the computer actually cheats .
What distinguishes this version from the other Civilization 2 is that this one has multiplayer support .
As usual , Kosta and I have done some " beta - testing " and found it to be a lot of fun .
The multiplayer function works like a dream over the net , and it supports up to seven players .
The game has three different endings :
Either you are the first nation to send a spacecraft to another star , or you simply kill everyone else .
Or , if you fail to do any of this before a certain year ...
I 'd better not give any more away , but I 'm telling you it 's much more fun when playing against another human being .
Now go and form your own opinion !
Whether you ’re finally ready to go back to school to become a nurse or you ’re looking into what it will take to go into business for yourself , you need to have a solid financial plan in place so you ’re more likely to succeed than fail .
One of the most important features of such a plan should be freeing yourself up from costly debt .
Nothing can derail plans that cost money as fast as already being stressed out about money when you take the second career plunge .
From creating a realistic budget to transferring credit card debt , here are five tips that will get you out of debt faster , so you can start the next phase of your life sooner .
1. Transfer Credit Card Debt
The average household in the United States with credit card debt is carrying over $ 16,000 of it .
Since most cards have unreasonably high interest rates , this type of debt threatens to hamstring anyone who wants to transition into a different career .
Start with transferring your credit card debt onto cards with 0 percent annual fees and lower interest rates than the ones that currently hold your debt .
While you will have to pay a fee on the transfer , the lowered rate will help you establish a payment plan that can actually start to cut into the debt , instead of just paying toward the interest .
Be sure to read the fine print of any card you choose , however , as some will increase interest rates after a certain amount of time has passed .
2. Create a Realistic Budget
According to recent Freedom Debt Relief reviews , too few people in debt have a realistic budget , and if you ’re one of them , it ’s time to make one .
What makes a budget “ realistic ” ?
Well , for starters , it takes into account the real amount of money you make and the real amount of money you have to spend to live each month .
Start with your income , and , then , make a list of the expenses that are non-negotiable .
Non-negotiable expenses include your mortgage or rent , truly basic utilities like water and electricity ( not cable ) , car and health insurance , gas or subway fare to get to and from work , groceries , and your minimum debt payments .
From there , apply more money than you usually do toward debt , but , in order to keep things realistic , start small .
Rome was n’t built in a day , and the budget you ’re trying to set should n’t require too drastic change of lifestyle — at least initially .
Go too hard on yourself , and you might give up sticking to a budget altogether .
As you adapt to keeping a budget , you can start to tighten the screws to pay down your debt more quickly .
3. Organize Your Debts
While it ’s true that not all debt is create equal , it ’s also true that not everyone can think about their debt in exactly the same way .
Because of these realities , organizing your debt is helpful .
Know everything about the debts you owe from interest rates to overall amount .
Some people will fare best tackling high - interest debt first , but some wo n’t .
Especially if you feel overwhelmed by the debt you owe , paying off small debts first — even if they are n’t costing you as much in terms of interest — can be a boon to your confidence .
4. Get a Second Job
No one wants to work a second job , but if you ’re serious about starting out on a new career path , and you ’re swimming in debt , it may be a good decision .
Whether you take on freelance work as a graphic designer or wait tables on the weekend , be sure to put all the money you earn from your second job toward your debt .
It can be a tough row to hoe , but you ’ll pay down debt faster if you have more money to put toward it , and it wo n’t have to last forever .
5. Entertain Yourself for Free
Few people take advantage of the many types of free entertainment readily available both at home and in their surrounding neighborhoods and towns .
From putting puzzles together and playing board games to taking advantage of free concerts , movies , and the like that are available in your town , once you commit to free entertainment instead of the kind you pay for , you ’ll be amazed at what ’s available .
Play tag in your local park .
Check out books , DVDs , and CDs from your local library .
Put on a family play .
Learn to play every version of euchre there is .
Before there was Netflix , cable , and eating out five days a week , people entertained themselves just fine .
To get out of debt faster , flex your creativity muscles , and put the money you ’re saving on entertainment toward your debt .
Get out of debt faster with these five tips , so you can start your path toward a new career without the excess stress and impeded cash flow of being in the red .
That pesky liberally - biased truth keeps rearing its ugly head on the White House 's attempts to scare you about the looming threat of al Qaeda in Iraq .
Download Download
Fran Townsend made quick work of dismissing the words of Gen. Ray Odierno , Commanding Gen. of Multinational Troops in Iraq , who said ( and is backed up by the latest NIE report ) that al Qaeda in Iraq does not have the institutional capability to export violence outside of Iraq .
TOWNSEND : ... General Odierno's remarks suggest that they do n't have the capability .
I respect that - he's on the ground , he's in the best position to make that judgment , but we 've seen al Qaeda in Iraq export violence before , like the wedding reception in Amman , Jordan .
So we 've got to presume they 've got the capability and the potential to act on it .
Al Qaeda in Iraq in Iraq is not a distraction .
We 've heard from bin Laden 's own words that he views it as World War III , a war of destiny for al Qaeda that they must win .
So it is in no way a distraction , it 's actually a critical enabler and capability for al Qaeda Central .
And we see them extending their influence , not only in Iraq , but in North Africa , for example , where they now have al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .
This is part of bin Laden 's plan , trying to extend the influence of al Qaeda .
So they listen to the generals on the ground unless they contradict their pre-conceived fear mongering ?
Note how Townsend conflates al Qaeda in Iraq with al Qaeda Central , who is actually in North Africa .
And the World War III quote attributed to bin Laden ?
Guess who did the attributing ?
LAFFING IT UP … .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page is really getting desperate .
Even for them .
In an editorial today they present data on corporate tax rates around the world and , like those people who find an outline of the Virgin Mary in a potato chip , they discover a Laffer Curve !
It ’s a miracle !
This comes via Mark Thoma , who draws a more plausible straight line through the data over at his site and finds that as tax rates go up , so does tax revenue .
Shocking , I know .
That is , it would be shocking unless you knew that the effective corporate tax rate in America is n’t 35 % , it ’s about 26 % , and there ’s not an economist on the planet who thinks the Laffer effect kicks in at anywhere near that rate .
But we all knew that , right ?
And one more thing .
Just for laughs , take a look at what the Journal ’s barmy graph drawing implies : Norway , with a corporate tax rate of about 29 % , generates enormous amounts of corporate tax revenue .
But then , since it ’s the only way to get an upside - down U out of the data , the graph goes nearly vertical .
Even the Journal ’s editorial writers , normally a pretty barefaced bunch , were apparently too embarrassed about this economic singularity to follow the right side of their graph to its logical conclusion , but we can : at a rate of about 33 % corporate taxes produce no revenue at all .
An increase of a mere four percentage points destroys tax revenue entirely !
Mirabile dictu !
A junior high school geometry student would be embarrassed to produce work like this .
But not the Wall Street Journal editorial page .
Or the American Enterprise Institute , which created it in the first place .
They apparently think their readers are too dumb to see what they ’re doing .
Why their readership puts up with this obvious contempt for their intelligence is a question for another day .
ON its way to becoming the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , the Countrywide Financial Corporation encouraged its sales force to court customers over the telephone with a seductive pitch that seldom varied .
“ I want to be sure you are getting the best loan possible , ” the sales representatives would say .
But providing “ the best loan possible ” to customers was n’t always the bank ’s main goal , say some former employees .
Instead , potential borrowers were often led to high - cost and sometimes unfavorable loans that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide ’s smooth - talking sales force , outsize fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans , and a roaring stock price that made Countrywide executives among the highest paid in America .
Countrywide ’s entire operation , from its computer system to its incentive pay structure and financing arrangements , is intended to wring maximum profits out of the mortgage lending boom no matter what it costs borrowers , according to interviews with former employees and brokers who worked in different units of the company and internal documents they provided .
One document , for instance , shows that until last September the computer system in the company ’s subprime unit excluded borrowers ’ cash reserves , which had the effect of steering them away from lower - cost loans to those that were more expensive to homeowners and more profitable to Countrywide .
Now , with the entire mortgage business on tenterhooks and industry practices under scrutiny by securities regulators and banking industry overseers , Countrywide ’s money machine is sputtering .
So far this year , fearful investors have cut its stock in half .
About two weeks ago , the company was forced to draw down its entire $ 11.5 billion credit line from a consortium of banks because it could no longer sell or borrow against home loans it has made .
And last week , Bank of America invested $ 2 billion for a 16 percent stake in Countrywide , a move that came amid speculation that Countrywide ’s survival was in question and that it had become a takeover target — notions that Countrywide publicly disputed .
Startup Primed To Challenge Google CPC Ad Model
Jellyfish.com will offer an alternative to cost - per - click advertising by opening an online marketplace where advertisers can bid directly to customers for their attention and patronage .
Google 's bubble may be about to burst .
Though search engines continue to make a tidy sum selling clicks , the advertisers buying those clicks have no choice but to gamble :
Only a small portion of online ad click - throughs result in sales and about 14 % of clicks on average aim to defraud the advertiser .
On Monday , shopping search engine Jellyfish.com will begin to woo advertisers with what it claims is a better mousetrap :
It will offer an alternative to cost - per - click ( CPC ) advertising by opening an online marketplace for advertisers to bid directly to customers for their attention and patronage .
The company , which closed initial seed funding from undisclosed investors earlier this year , plans to give the customer half the ad revenue it collects from the advertiser upon making a sale .
The result is that Jellyfish users can get products for less because half the marketing dollars spent by advertisers go directly their customers instead of to a third party .
At the time of this article , the cash returned can result in discounts of up to 24 % , according to the company .
This number will rise and fall daily as merchants bid for consumers ' business .
Users can collect their cash once products can no longer be returned , in order to prevent abuse of the system .
The name " Jellyfish , " says president Mark McGuire , reflects the company 's intent to bring transparency to the ad market .
Google 's recent actions suggest that it's aware of the problems posed by the CPC model : Google recently acknowledged that it 's testing cost - per-action ads ( CPA ) .
CPA advertising pioneers like Snap.com have long touted the advantages of the CPA model , such as the elimination of click fraud .
But adoption has been slow .
EBay 's recent move into CPA advertising with its AdContext system should make CPA ads more popular , luring publishers with the prospect of collecting a cut from auction sales made as a result of an ad .
But Jellyfish 's patent - pending plan to kick CPA fees back to consumers seems certain to pique user interest .
The company calls its approach value - per-action advertising .
Merchants are already lining up to bid for shoppers ' attention with low prices and high cash - back payments .
Jellyfish has more than 1,000 advertisers signed up so far , with more than 5 million listed products .
" ShoeMall.com is all about making shoe shopping fun and fast , and using a partner like Jellyfish helps us give back to the customers , " says Adrienne Hartman , Internet and new business manager at Internet retailer ShoeMall .
Hartman notes that Jellyfish 's model lets her company offer a lower price than would be possible with CPC advertising .
" Since Jellyfish only gets paid when I make a sale , I get a better return on my marketing dollars , " she says .
