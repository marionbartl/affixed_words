Arizona ’s new immigration law may have been aimed at deporting as many illegal immigrants as possible , but an ironic side effect will allow more undocumented residents to apply for temporary work visas and permanent U.S. citizenship , according to research by the Arizona Capitol Times .
The new law will add to a processing backlog that already has caused federal authorities to release an increasing number of illegal immigrants back into the U.S. to await deportation hearings .
And if nationwide figures can be applied to Arizona , one in four of those who are released from federal custody fail to appear in court .
The arrest - and - release policy is a little - known part of federal immigration law that allows illegal immigrants to challenge deportation and obtain legal residency , and a driver ’s license , as long as they meet certain conditions .
If more illegal immigrants are apprehended and processed through the federal system – which is expected to happen after Arizona ’s immigration law takes effect on July 29 – then an even greater number would qualify for legal status .
“ In a sense , it ’s like there ’s some incentive to get caught , ” said Tucson immigration attorney Maurice Goldman .
“ Theoretically , more people would end up in front of immigration judges , which means more would get released . ”
Right now , federal immigration courts are backed up so severely that it can take as many as five years to schedule trials for illegal immigrants who challenge deportation , and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) facilities are so overloaded that thousands of illegal immigrants are released back into Arizona each year to live and work while waiting for a deportation hearing .
More than 5,100 illegal immigrants who were processed through federal immigration courts in Arizona were released from custody on bond in 2009 , and the vast majority were eligible for work authorization documents , although precise figures were not available .
In some cases , illegal immigrants may be granted some form of relief , including permanent citizenship , after they ’ve been turned over to ICE .
Last year , federal judges granted legal residency to 29,000 illegal immigrants nationwide .
In Arizona , more than 3,600 immigration hearings were initiated by an application for relief , and more than 900 illegal immigrants were granted temporary residency or permanent citizenship .
The ~ Arizona Capitol Times ~ research for this special report included dozens of interviews with immigration attorneys , state lawmakers and officials at several federal immigration agencies , as well as documents obtained through public records requests to ICE and the Executive Office for Immigration Review , the official name of the federal immigration court system .
Several important immigration statistics were not available because ICE and the federal courts said they do n’t keep track of the number of illegal immigrants apprehended each year in Arizona by federal , state or local law enforcement agencies .
Nor do they track the number of illegal immigrants who accept “ voluntary departure ” and agree to forego an immigration hearing .
Gaps in federal records and the unknown effects of the state ’s immigration law make it impossible to pinpoint how many more illegal immigrants will be granted relief or released on bond as a result of the passage of Sen.
Russell Pearce ’s S1070 , which was signed into law on April 23 .
But several immigration attorneys who practice in Arizona said both figures likely will skyrocket .
“ I call SB1070 , ‘ Russell Pearce ’s guest - worker program . ’
You ’ll have so many people who will be eligible ( for release ) and employment authorization documents , ” said Kevin Gibbons , an immigration attorney who ran unsuccessfully against Pearce for the District 18 Senate seat in 2008 .
Pearce said the law he drafted is a good one , even though it will result in legal residency for more illegal immigrants .
Most illegal immigrants will leave the state without further provocation for fear of being arrested , he said .
“ It will save us hundreds of millions of dollars .
That ’s good for the taxpayer , ” he said .
“ The benefits so outweigh ( the work permits ) . ”
Federal immigration proceedings often do not happen quickly .
When an illegal immigrant is picked up and ICE takes custody of the person , a background check determines whether the immigrant will be deported or sent to court for a deportation hearing .
Deportation occurs quickly – usually within 24 hours – if the person had been deported previously , or if he or she has committed an aggravated felony , such as rape or drug trafficking .
Illegal immigrants with clean records are usually transported to one of the two ICE facilities in central Arizona – a federal detention center is in Florence , and a private facility is in Eloy – to await a hearing before an immigration judge .
Once removal proceedings begin , illegal immigrants can petition for relief and become eligible for a release from detention , work documents and even a driver ’s license .
Federal judges then determine whether to hold illegal immigrants in ICE custody or release them , either with a bond or on their own recognizance .
Bond amounts typically range between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000 , though it can be higher if the immigrant has a criminal record .
However , because of overcrowding at the federal facilities in Arizona , which combine to hold only about 1,900 people , ICE often releases immigrants on bond without waiting for a judge .
“ Up until four or five months ago , what ( ICE ) was doing was sending ( immigrants ) to Florence or Eloy and they would get put in front of a judge , ” Goldman , the Tucson immigration attorney , said .
“ Recently , ICE has been releasing people on bond without sending them up there . ”
ICE spokesman Vincent Picard confirmed that his agency has been releasing more illegal immigrants on bond to avoid adding to the backlog in federal court and the overcrowding at ICE facilities .
He said the ICE facilities in Arizona also hold illegal immigrants apprehended in California , Utah , Nevada and other nearby states with overcrowded federal facilities .
According to federal court records , 4,610 illegal immigrants who were released from federal custody failed to appear in court in 2009 .
That number represents 22 percent of all illegal immigrants who were released on bond and were expected to appear in court last year .
Figures for those released by federal courts in Arizona were not available .
Many of the illegal immigrants who are given temporary residency while awaiting a hearing also qualify to apply for permanent residency .
Often , that is done by applying for one of the forms of relief outlined in federal law , the most common of which is called “ cancellation of removal . ”
The standard for cancellation of removal is high , Goldman said .
Immigrants must prove they have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 consecutive years , demonstrate “ good moral character , ” pass a criminal background check showing no felony convictions , and establish that deportation would result in an “ exceptional and extremely unusual hardship ” to a spouse , parent or child who is a citizen or legal permanent resident .
Phoenix immigration attorney David Asser said he believes many of the illegal immigrants who live in the state would qualify for cancellation of removal .
“ There are a lot of people , I think , who would qualify for this form of relief , but they have n’t been picked up ( by ICE ) yet , ” he said .
“ People who come through my door have been here a long time and have U.S. - citizen kids , or even grandkids .
They qualify to at least apply for this category of relief . ”
Illegal immigrants who are released on bond may receive temporary work visas that are valid for one year .
In many cases , the one - year visas are extended several times due to the backlog in federal immigration courts , which have been overcrowded for years because there are only five immigration judges in the state – three in Phoenix and two in Tucson .
Already , final hearings in cases are being scheduled for 2013 and beyond .
During that time , the immigrants released from custody are able to stay in the country and work legally .
Gibbons , the immigration attorney from Mesa , said he has a case already scheduled for February 2014 .
But that ’s only for a final determination hearing , and does n’t account for the time it takes to present evidence to the judge and conduct initial hearings .
“ I’m ( scheduled ) out four years , but I did n’t tell you how long that case has been going to that point .
I may have a year , year - and - a - half in ( the case ) already , ” he said .
The delays in the system will only get worse if local law enforcement officers begin rounding up illegal immigrants and turning them over to ICE to begin deportation proceedings , said Asser , the attorney from Phoenix .
“ If you ’re putting in an extra 1,000 people , it may take five years , ” he said .
“ If you ’re talking about the entire illegal population of Phoenix , it may be 2035 .
Who knows ? ”
Pearce said the log jam in the immigration courts is the fault of immigration attorneys .
“ They tie up the system and play games .
They fabricate issues or exaggerate issues , ” he said .
“ It ’s a system designed by attorneys to benefit the system , and they clog the system . ”
But Gibbons defended the system , saying Pearce and other politicians concerned about the court backlog should fight for more money for the courts .
“ They do n’t take the money into account .
They do n’t realize that funding drives everything , ” he said .
As it stands now , the system will continue to be slow - moving .
The federal government has given no indication so far that it plans to spend more money on immigration courts or enforcement efforts along Arizona ’s border with Mexico .
All the while , many of those detained under the nation ’s toughest illegal - immigration - enforcement law would be living with their families and working in the state just as legally as those who crafted the law .
CHICOPEE , Mass .
—Chicopee police say a man faces a child endangerment charge after allegedly offering to swap his 3 - month - old daughter for a pair of 40 - ounce beers .
Police say 24 - year - old Matthew Brace of Northampton made the offer to a maintenance man outside a gas station convenience store on Monday .
The maintenance man called police , who say they found Brace hiding with the girl behind a trash container .
State child welfare officials took the baby into custody .
Police say Brace was not arrested but will be summoned to court to face a charge of reckless endangerment of a child .
The child 's mother was in the store at the time buying cigarettes .
She has not been charged .
A phone number for Brace could not immediately be located .

Abstract
We show that any objective risk measurement algorithm mandated by central banks for regulated financial entities will result in more risk being taken on by those financial entities than would otherwise be the case .
Furthermore , the risks taken on by the regulated financial entities are far more systemically concentrated than they would have been otherwise , making the entire financial system more fragile .
This result leaves three directions for the future of financial regulation : continue regulating by enforcing risk measurement algorithms at the cost of occasional severe crises , regulate more severely and subjectively by fully nationalizing all financial entities , or abolish all central banking regulations including deposit insurance to let risk be determined by the entities themselves and , ultimately , by their depositors through voluntary market transactions rather than by the taxpayers through enforced government participation .

Lasers that stimulate condensation may help to induce rain artificially .
Make rain while the laser shines .
J - P. Wolf / University of Geneva
The rain dance is getting a twenty - first - century revamp using laser technology .
Optical physicists have demonstrated that shooting lasers into the air can trigger the formation of water droplets , a technique that could one day help to stimulate rainfall .
For more than 50 years , efforts to try to artificially induce rain have concentrated on ' cloud seeding ' — scattering small particles of silver iodide into the air to act as ' condensation nuclei ' , or centres around which rain droplets can grow .
" The problem is , it 's still not clear that cloud seeding works efficiently , " says optical physicist Jérôme Kasparian at the University of Geneva , Switzerland .
" There are also worries about how safe adding silver iodide particles into the air is for the environment . "
Kasparian and his colleagues realized that there might be a more environmentally friendly alternative .
Firing a laser beam made up of short pulses into the air ionizes nitrogen and oxygen molecules around the beam to create a plasma , resulting in a ' plasma channel ' of ionized molecules .
These ionized molecules could act as natural condensation nuclei , Kasparian explains .
To test whether this technique could induce droplets , the researchers fired a high - powered laser through an atmospheric cloud chamber in the lab containing saturated air ( see video ) .
They illuminated the chamber using a second , standard low - power laser , enabling them to see and measure any droplets produced .
Immediately after the laser was fired , drops measuring about 50 micrometres wide formed along the plasma channel .
Over the next three seconds , the droplets grew in size to 80 micrometres as the smaller droplets coalesced .
The team 's results are published online in Nature Photonics1 .
Rainmaker
The next step for Kasparian and his team was to take the technique outside .
The researchers already have experience using plasma channels to modify the weather : in 2008 , they demonstrated that a beam from their high - powered portable ' Teramobile laser ' could be fired into thunder clouds , triggering an electric discharge2 .
The beam was able to reach its target without being deflected because the generated plasma channel modifies the speed at which light travels through air — slowing it down in the centre of the beam and speeding it up at the sides .
This causes the beam to continually self - focus , helping it to maintain a high intensity across large distances ( see ' Bendy laser beam fired through the air ' ) .
This time , Kasparian and his colleagues tested the Teramobile laser over a number of different nights and in various humidity conditions .
Once again , they detected the amount of condensation induced by monitoring how much the light from a second laser was back - scattered by any droplets .
In low humidity conditions , the Teramobile laser did not induce droplets .
But when the humidity was high , the team measured up to 20 times more back - scattering after the Teramobile laser was fired than before , says Kasparian , suggesting that condensation droplets were forming .
ADVERTISEMENT
Roland Sauerbrey , an expert on laser physics at the FZD Dresden–Rossendorf Research Centre in Dresden , Germany , says that the team has the potential to create a " breakthrough technology " .
" This is the first time that a laser has been used to cause condensation outdoors , " he says .
However , the technique is still in its early stages .
" We can only create condensation along the laser channel , so we wo n't be going out and making rain tomorrow , " Kasparian notes .
He and his team are now investigating whether they can create condensation over a wider area , by sweeping their laser across the sky .
Thomas Leisner , an atmospheric physicist at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology , Germany , remains cautious about the feasibility of scaling up the technique in this way .
" I am sceptical that this could be used to trigger rain on demand , " he says .
But he adds that the technology will have other uses .
The researchers should now calibrate the relationship between the amount of condensation produced by the laser and the prevailing atmospheric conditions , he says .
" They could use the amount of condensation produced by their laser as a measure of water saturation to help forecast the chance of rain , " he says .
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) , the top congressional recipient of BP - related campaign cash during the last election cycle , has no plans to return contributions from the company responsible for one of the worst environmental disasters to beset her state , her office tells OpenSecrets Blog .
Individuals and employees associated with oil giant BP gave nearly $ 17,000 to Landrieu ’s campaign committee during the 2008 election cycle , according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis .
The funds were enough to make her the top recipient to raise money from BP that cycle among candidates running for the U.S. House or U.S. Senate .
Only then - Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain , both presidential candidates , raised more from BP .
“ Senator Landrieu has no plans to return donations from BP ’s PAC or BP employees ” Landrieu ’s communications director Aaron Saunders said in an e-mail message to OpenSecrets Blog .
“ Campaign contributions , from energy companies or from environmental groups , have absolutely no impact on Sen.
Landrieu ’s policy agenda or her response to this unprecedented disaster in the Gulf , ” Saunders wrote .
“ The Senator is proud of the broad coalition she ’s built since her first day in the Senate to address the energy and environmental challenges in Louisiana and in the nation .
This disaster only makes the effort to promote and save Louisiana ’s coast all that more important . ”
The environmental disaster off the coast of Louisiana continues to grab headlines almost two weeks after the initial explosion at an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana is presumed to have killed 11 workers before unleashing an underwater oil gusher so massive that officials estimate up to 200,000 gallons a day are leaking out into the Gulf of Mexico .
The leak has created an oil slick more than 30 miles in diameter , and is currently threatening the length of the gulf coast , from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle .
Officials from BP have acknowledged it is unclear how or when the leak will be fixed , but they ’ve said it could take months .
BP is no stranger to the political process .
The company regularly spends millions of dollars on federal lobbying efforts , including $ 16 million in 2009 .
It continued that seven - figure spending into the first quarter of 2010 , racking up a $ 3.53 million lobbying tab .
A roster of BP executives contributed to Landrieu ’s campaign in recent years , including the current president of BP ’s U.S. operations , Lamar McKay .
According to campaign finance reports , McKay donated $ 1,000 to the senator ’s 2008 re-election in a single donation given in November 2007 .
McKay ’s predecessor is also on record for contributing to Landrieu ’s re-election .
Robert A. Malone , who stepped as president in early 2009 to make way for McKay , gave $ 2,300 to Landrieu in a single donation that was filed just three days before McKay’s .
Other BP executives to donate to Landrieu ’s campaign include Margaret Hudson , a BP America vice president ( $ 1,100 ) ; and Benjamin Cannon , BP America ’s federal affairs director ( $ 2,300 ) .

The details of the plan have been settled in negotiations here with officials of the European Union , the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank .
Greek officials close to the discussions said the deal would include as much as 130 billion euros in aid over the next three years at reasonable interest rates .
In return , the I.M.F. asked Greece to cut public sector spending by 8 billion euros in the 14 months after the plan was adopted .
Economists called that provision crucial because past reform programs by the government have relied too much on overly optimistic assumptions about the collection of unpaid taxes .
Union and government officials said Greece had also pledged to raise its value - added tax to 25 percent , to freeze civil servants ’ wages and to eliminate public sector bonuses amounting to two months ’ pay .
They said the government intended to increase taxes on fuel , tobacco and alcohol .
Among the most significant features of the plan , a Greek government official said , would be a measure making it easier for the government to lay off some of the many thousands of public sector workers , whose low levels of productivity and high wages are a big contributor to Greece ’s debt problem .
Until now , the government has not been able to lay off civil servants , whose employment rights are in effect constitutionally guaranteed .
Another reform high on the list is removing the state from the marketplace in crucial sectors like health care , transportation and energy and allowing private investment .
Economists say that the liberalization of trucking routes — where a trucking license can cost up to $ 90,000 — and the health care industry would help bring down prices in these areas , which are among the highest in Europe .
Some analysts fear the austerity measures could push Greece into a deeper and prolonged recession and spur widespread social unrest .
Imagine the national uproar if 200 Tea Partiers had gone on a rampage with burning torches
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , May 3 , 2010
Imagine the uproar if 200 Tea Party members had gone on a rampage through a downtown city , smashing windows , starting fires , and spraying graffiti everywhere , the corporate media would be all over it , and yet gangs of pro-illegal immigration demonstrators do this and much worse on a regular basis , with no national news coverage whatsoever .
“ A large group of protesters demonstrating at a May Day rally for worker ’s and immigrant rights downtown broke off into a riot vandalizing about a dozen businesses around 10:30 p.m.
Saturday , police said , ” reports The Santa Cruz Sentinel .
An Associated Press report states that eighteen businesses were damaged as pro-immigrants rights activists engaged in violent riots , spraying graffiti , smashing windows , setting fire to shop fronts , and causing damage to a cost of up to $ 100,000 dollars .
“ The damage that was caused was without purpose , ” Capt .
Steve Clark said .
“ It was senseless violence that victimized a community who cannot afford to be victimized in this manner .
This did nothing to add credit to whatever they believed their cause was . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The riot followed the announcement that pro-amnesty demonstrators would march across the country on May 1st , which is also a date on which socialists rally worldwide to celebrate Communism , euphemistically labeled “ International Workers Day ” by the media .
In addition , during a pro-amnesty rally in San Francisco , 40 Golden Gate Minutemen , who were staging a peaceful counter - protest , were chased , beaten and injured by the pro-immigration thugs .
If Tea Partiers so much as dare to carry a vaguely inflammatory sign or shout at a lawmaker , they are nationally demonized by the corporate media as dangerous racist extremists and even domestic terrorists .
And yet anarchists and pro-illegal immigrant demonstrators can run riot , engage in violence and cause monumental damage to private property and it barely even makes the news .
Watch the clip below .
Despite the best efforts of ABC News to characterize the culprits solely as “ anarchists ” and not pro-illegal demonstrators , at the end of the clip , people in the background can be heard shouting “ deport illegal immigrants , ” making it clear who the business owners and residents held responsible for the damage .
As we have previously highlighted , despite media characterizations of anyone who opposes big government or illegal immigration as violent extremists , by far the most dangerous and violent individuals have proven to be pro-Obama goons as well as radical racist La Raza groups .
During an August 2009 demonstration in Mehville , Missouri , Obamacare opponents were locked out of a town hall meeting before Union thugs viciously attacked patriot and Tea Party activist Kenneth Gladney , who was handing out Gadsden flags outside the stage - managed event , while hurling racist insults .
During a November 2009 immigration enforcement rally , A.N.S.W.E.R.-hired pro-illegal thugs attacked 62 - year - old Dave Caulkett of Floridians for Immigration Enforcement , pummeling him with their signs and kicking him in the face as other A.N.S.W.E.R. goons cheered .
But you wo n’t see hide nor hair of Chris Matthews , Keith Olbermann or Bill Maher attacking racist pro-illegal hate groups who threaten to murder Americans with axes , because it simply does n’t fit into their or the federal government ’s primary mission , which is to smear peaceful Americans angry at how big government and huge corporations are manipulating and siding with millions of illegal aliens to crush the middle class , as violent racist extremists who need to be silenced .
Alex Jones ’ Battle For
The Republic exposes how the elite are using illegal immigration and pushing amnesty as a means of pulverizing the American middle class and ensuring that U.S. citizens , black , white and hispanic alike , are forced to sacrifice their freedom and sovereignty as America is sunk into a third world cesspool .

Researchers say they 've devised a way to bypass protections built in to dozens of the most popular desktop anti-virus products , including those offered by McAfee , Trend Micro , AVG , and BitDefender .
The method , developed by software security researchers at matousec.com , works by exploiting the driver hooks the anti-virus programs bury deep inside the Windows operating system .
In essence , it works by sending them a sample of benign code that passes their security checks and then , before it 's executed , swaps it out with a malicious payload .
The exploit has to be timed just right so the benign code is n't switched too soon or too late .
But for systems running on multicore processors , matousec 's " argument - switch " attack is fairly reliable because one thread is often unable to keep track of other simultaneously running threads .
As a result , the vast majority of malware protection offered for Windows PCs can be tricked into allowing malicious code that under normal conditions would be blocked .
All that 's required is that the AV software use SSDT , or System Service Descriptor Table , hooks to modify parts of the OS kernel .
" We have performed tests with [ most of ] today 's Windows desktop security products , " the researchers wrote .
" The results can be summarized in one sentence :
If a product uses SSDT hooks or other kind of kernel mode hooks on similar level to implement security features it is vulnerable .
In other words , 100 % of the tested products were found vulnerable . "
The researchers listed 34 products that they said were susceptible to the attack , but the list was limited by the amount of time they had for testing .
" Otherwise , the list would be endless , " they said .
The technique works even when Windows is running under an account with limited privileges .
Still , the exploit has its limitations .
It requires a large amount of code to be loaded onto the targeted machine , making it impractical for shellcode - based attacks or attacks that rely on speed and stealth .
It can also be carried out only when an attacker already has the ability to run a binary on the targeted PC .
Still , the technique might be combined with an exploit of another piece of software , say , a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader or Oracle 's Java Virtual Machine to install malware without arousing the suspicion of the any AV software the victim was using .
" Realistic scenario : someone uses McAfee or another affected product to secure their desktops , " H D Moore , CSO and Chief Architect of the Metasploit project , told The Register in an instant message .
" A malware developer abuses this race condition to bypass the system call hooks , allowing the malware to install itself and remove McAfee .
In that case , all of the ' protection ' offered by the product is basically moot . "
A user without administrative rights could also use the attack to kill an installed and running AV , even though only admin accounts should be able to do this , Charlie Miller , principal security analyst at Independent Security Evaluators , said .

A former Anaheim police officer was convicted Monday of victimizing three women while on duty , including forcing one to engage in a sexual act under the threat of deportation , authorities said .
Bradley Stewart Wagner , 62 , of Perris , pleaded guilty to one felony count each of forcible oral copulation and oral copulation under the color of authority , one felony count of sexual battery by restraint and one felony count of false imprisonment by violence or deceit , the Orange County district attorney 's office said .
Prosecutors said that Wanger pulled over one of the women in November 2005 on Kramer Boulevard while he was in his patrol car and asked her if she had papers .
When the woman said she did not , he fondled her , exposed himself and forced her to engage in oral sex , according to prosecutors .
He relented after the woman began to vomit and then left , prosecutors said .
The woman reported the incident the next day .
As a result of media coverage , the two other victims came forward .
Wagner was accused of fondling one of the women and asking her for sex .
He pulled over the other woman on four separate occasions and repeatedly asked her for personal information , according to prosecutors .

The US Supreme Court has ruled that a law which makes it illegal to sell videos of animals being tortured , violates the right to free speech .
Chief Justice John Roberts said the law was too broad and invalid under the First Amendment , Reuters reports .
The ruling is a victory for Robert Stevens , who was sentenced to three years in prison in 2005 for making and selling videos of dog fights .
The 1999 law was intended to prevent depictions of animal cruelty .
It was adopted by the US Congress and originally aimed at limiting internet sales of " crush " videos which show women crushing small animals with high - heeled shoes
Mr Stevens has argued that the videos were intended to educate people about the pit bull breed and that he was not trying to promote illegal dog-fighting .
His conviction was the first in the US under the law .
Justice Samuel Alito , who dissented , said the harm animals suffered in dogfights was enough to sustain the law .
US Justice department lawyers have said that animal cruelty videos should not be entitled to any constitutional protection , but treated like child pornography , Reuters notes .
Chief Justice Roberts added that the law goes too far and suggested a measure limited to " crush " videos instead , AP reports .
Update : I should have said Rails IDE – but I ’m sure similar plugins are available for other languages
I fired up NetBeans at work today , tried to open a Rails project and – inexplicably , it crashed .
All is well at home , so I ’m blaming work machine setup issues as - yet unknown ( but I suspect , involving the letters “ ATI ” ) .
It got me thinking that , as much as I like NetBeans , it is still just a memory - eating , CPU - hogging , bloated Java - based GUI .
For some time I ’ve wanted to convert my favourite editor , Emacs , to something more like an IDE .
The WyeWorks Blog to the rescue .
Install emacs - 23 and a couple of Ruby gems , clone their github repository of Emacs plugins , copy to your ~/.emacs.d / and voilà – marvel at your new , shiny editing environment .
I also replaced my ~/.emacs with their init.el file .
The key plugins include ECB , textmate.el , Rinari and yasnippet , plus a bunch of modes for syntax highlighting .
If you ’ve only tried cursory Emacs customisation in the past the results are a little alarming at first , but you ’ll be back to coding ( and saying “ Ooh ! Aah ! ” ) in no time at all .

Over the coming months and years , German utility giants plan to build massive offshore wind farms that are expected to produce huge amounts of green energy .
The first such wind farm went online this week .
In the past few years , performance research has become more prevalent thanks to research by the Yahoo !
Exceptional Performance Team and Google ’s Steve Souders .
Most of that research studies not the individual HTML page , but the resources the page requires to display or behave correctly .
Article Continues Below
Although both CSS and JavaScript may be included within an HTML page , best practices encourage storing CSS and JavaScript in external files that can be downloaded and cached separately .
Performance research asks :
How can these external resources be downloaded and applied most efficiently ?
The first approach is to limit the number of external requests since the overhead of each HTTP request is high .
The second approach ?
Make your code as small as possible .
The history of JavaScript byte savings #section2
Douglas Crockford introduced JSMin in 2004 as a way to shrink JavaScript files before placing them into a production environment .
His simple tool removed spaces , tabs , and comments from JavaScript files , effectively decreasing the size compared to the original source file .
His rationale was sound : decreasing the size of JavaScript code results in faster downloads and a better user experience .
Three years later , Yahoo !
engineer Julien Lecomte introduced the YUI Compressor .
The YUI Compressor ’s goal was to shrink JavaScript files even further than JSMin by applying smart optimizations to the source code .
In addition to removing comments , spaces , and tabs , the YUI Compressor also safely removes line breaks , further decreasing the overall file size .
The biggest byte savings , though , come from replacing local variable names with one - or two - character names .
For example , suppose you have the following function :
function sum ( num1 , num2 ) { return num1 + num2 ; }
YUI Compressor changes this to :
function sum( A , B) {return A+B;}
Note that the two local variables , num1 and num2 , were replaced by A and B , respectively .
Since YUI Compressor actually parses the entire JavaScript input , it can safely replace local variable names without introducing code errors .
The overall function continues to work as it did originally since the variable names are irrelevant to the functionality .
On average , the YUI Compressor can compress files up to 18 % more than JSMin .
These days , it ’s common to use a minification tool plus HTTP compression to further reduce JavaScript file size .
This results in even greater savings than using either method alone .
Boosting minification #section3
A couple of years ago , as I started debugging large amounts of production code , I realized that the YUI Compressor did n’t apply variable replacement to a fairly significant portion of my code .
Bothered by what I considered a lot of wasted bytes , I explored coding patterns to boost the YUI Compressor ’s minification powers .
I presented my results , Extreme JavaScript Compression with YUI Compressor , internally at Yahoo !.
In my investigation , I discovered coding patterns that prevented YUI Compressor from performing variable name replacement .
By modifying or avoiding these coding patterns , you can improve the YUI Compressor ’s performance .
JavaScript ’s evil features #section4
Anyone who has followed Douglas Crockford ’s writing or lectures knows about the “ evil ” parts of JavaScript :
The parts that are confusing and / or that prevent us from writing clean code that performs well .
The eval ( ) function and the with statement are the two most egregious examples of evil JavaScript .
Though there are other considerations , both of these features force YUI Compressor to stop replacing variables .
To understand why , we need to understand the intricacies of how each works .
Working with eval ( ) #section5
The eval ( ) statement ’s job is to take a string and interpret it as JavaScript code .
For example :
eval ( " alert ( ' Hello world ! ' ) ; " ) ;
The tricky part of eval ( ) is that it has access to all of the variables and functions that exist around it .
Here ’s a more complex example :
var message = " Hello world ! " ; function doSomething ( ) { eval ( " alert ( message ) " ) ; }
When you call doSomething ( ) , an alert is displayed with the message , “ Hello world ! ” .
That ’s because the string passed into eval ( ) accesses the global variable message and displays it .
Now consider what would happen if you automatically replaced the variable name message :
var A = " Hello world ! " ; function doSomething ( ) { eval ( " alert ( message ) " ) ; }
Note that changing the variable name to A results in an error when doSomething ( ) executes ( since message is undefined ) .
YUI Compressor ’s first job is to preserve the functionality of your script , and so when it sees eval ( ) , it stops replacing variables .
This might not sound like such a bad idea until you realize the full implications : Variable name replacement is prevented not only in the local context where eval ( ) is called , but in all containing contexts as well .
In the previous example , this means that both the context inside of doSomething ( ) and the global context cannot have variable names replaced .
Using eval ( ) anywhere in your code means that global variable names will never be changed .
Consider the following example :
function handleJSONP ( object ) { return object ; }function interpretJSONP ( code ) { var data = eval ( code ) ; // process data }
In this code , pretend that handleJSONP ( ) and interpretJSONP ( ) are defined in the midst of other functions .
JSONP is a widely used Ajax communication format that requires the response to be interpreted by the JavaScript engine .
For this example , a sample JSONP response might look like this :
handleJSONP ( {message :" Hello world ! " } ) ;
If you received this code back from the server via an XMLHttpRequest call , the next step is to evaluate it , at which point eval ( ) becomes very useful .
But just having eval ( ) in the code means that none of the global identifiers can have their names replaced .
The best option is to limit the number of global variables you introduce .
You can often get away with this by creating a self - executing anonymous function , such as :
( function ( ) { function handleJSONP ( object ) { return object ; } function interpretJSONP ( code ) { var data = eval ( code ) ; // process data } } ) ( ) ;
This code introduces no new global variables , but since eval ( ) is used , none of the variable names will be replaced .
The actual result ( 110 bytes ) is :
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
( function ( ) {function handleJSONP ( object ) {return object}function » interpretJSONP ( code ) {var data=eval ( code ) }} ) ( ) ;
The nice thing about JSONP is that it relies on the existence of just one global identifier , the function to which the result must be passed ( in this case , handleJSONP ( ) ) .
This means that it does n’t need access to any local variables or functions and gives you the opportunity to sequester the eval ( ) function in its own global function .
Note that you also must move handleJSONP ( ) outside to be global as well so its name does n’t get replaced :
// my own eval function myEval ( code ) { return eval ( code ) ; }function handleJSONP ( object ) { return object ; }( function ( ) { function interpretJSONP ( code ) { var data = myEval ( code ) ; // process data } } ) ( ) ;
The function myEval ( ) now acts like eval ( ) except that it cannot access local variables .
It can , however , access all global variables and functions .
If the code being executed by eval ( ) will never need access to local variables , then this approach is the best .
By keeping the only reference to eval ( ) outside of the anonymous function , you allow every variable name inside of that function to be replaced .
Here ’s the output :
function myEval ( code ) {return eval ( code ) }function handleJSONP » ( a ) {return a} ( function ( ) {function a ( b ) {var c=myEval ( b ) }} ) ( ) ;
You can see that both interpretJSON ( ) , code , and data were replaced ( with a , b , and c , respectively ) .
The result is 120 bytes , which you ’ll note is larger than the example without eval ( ) sequestered .
That does n’t mean the approach is faulty , it ’s just that this example code is far too small to see an impact .
If you were to apply this change on 100KB of JavaScript code , you would see that the resulting code is much smaller than leaving eval ( ) in place .
Of course , the best option is not to use eval ( ) at all , as you ’ll avoid a lot of hoop - jumping to make the YUI Compressor happy .
However , if you must , then sequestering the eval ( ) function is your best bet for optimal minification .
The with statement #section6
The with statement is the second evil feature that interferes with the YUI Compressor ’s variable replacement technique .
For those unfamiliar , the with statement is designed ( in theory ) to reduce the size of code by eliminating the need to write the same variable names over and over again .
Consider the following :
var object = { message : " Hello , " , messageSuffix : " , and welcome . " } ; object .
message += " world " + object.messageSuffix ; alert ( object.message ) ;
The with statement allows you to rewrite this code as :
var object = { message : " Hello , " , messageSuffix : " , and welcome . " } ; with ( object ) { message += " world " + messageSuffix ; alert ( message ) ; }
Effectively , the with statement avoids the need to repeat “ object ” multiple times within the code .
But these savings come at a cost .
First , there are performance implications from using the with statement , as local variables become slower to access .
This happens because variables inside of a with statement are ambiguous until execution time :
They may be properties of the with statement ’s context object or they may be variables from the function or another execution context .
To understand this ambiguity better , take a look at the code when the local variable message is added and the definition of object is removed :
var message =
" Yo , " ; with ( object ) { message += " world " + messageSuffix ; alert ( message ) ; }
When the identifier message is used inside of the with statement , it could be referencing the local variable message or it could be referencing a property named message on object .
Since JavaScript is a late binding language , there is no way to know the true reference for message without completely executing the code and determining if object has a property named message .
Witness how late binding affects this code :
function displayMessage ( object ) { var message =
" Yo , " ; with ( object ) { message += " world " + messageSuffix ; alert ( message ) ; } }displayMessage ( { message : " Hello , " , messageSuffix : " , and welcome . " } ) ; displayMessage ( { messageSuffix : " , and welcome . " } ) ;
The first time that displayMessage ( ) is called , the object passed in has a property named message .
When the with statement executes , the reference to message is mapped to the object property and so the displayed message is , “ Hello , world , and welcome . ”
The second time , the object passed in has only the messageSuffix property , meaning the reference to message inside of the with statement refers to the local variable and the message displayed is therefore , “ Yo , world , and welcome . ”
Since the YUI Compressor does n’t actually execute the JavaScript code , it has no way of knowing whether identifiers in a with statement are object properties ( in which case , it is not safe to replace them ) or local variable references ( in which case , it is safe to replace them ) .
The YUI Compressor treats the with statement the same as eval ( ) : when present , it will not perform variable replacement on the function or any containing execution contexts .
Unlike eval ( ) , there is no way to sequester the with statement in such a way that it does n’t affect most of the code .
The recommendation is to avoid using the with statement at all .
Even though it appears to save bytes at the time of code writing , you actually end up losing bytes by forfeiting YUI Compressor ’s variable replacement feature .
The displayMessage ( ) function gets minified like this :
function displayMessage ( object ) {var message =
" Yo , " ; with ( object ) » {message + =" world " +messageSuffix;alert( message )}} ;
This result is 112 bytes .
If the function is rewritten to avoid the with statement , displayMessage ( ) looks like this :
function displayMessage ( object ) { var message =
" Yo , " ; object .
message += " world " + object.messageSuffix ; alert ( object.message ) ; }
When minified , this new version of the function becomes :
function displayMessage ( a ) {var b= " Yo , " ; a.message + = " world " + » a.messageSuffix;alert(a.message ) } ;
The size of this result is 93 bytes , so even though the original source code is larger .
The minified source code becomes smaller because we used variable replacement .
YUI Compressor ’s variable replacement functionality can give big byte savings while minifying your JavaScript .
Since the YUI Compressor tries to avoid breaking your code by incorrectly replacing variable names , it will turn off variable replacement when the eval ( ) function or with statement is used .
These “ evil ” features alter how JavaScript code is interpreted and prevent the YUI Compressor from safely replacing variable names , which costs you a large amount of byte savings .
Avoid this penalty by steering clear of eval ( ) or sequester it away from the rest of your code .
Also , avoid the with statement .
These steps will ensure that your code does n’t get in the way of optimal minification .
CRAFT -WORK : A homemade flying hovercraft that can travel on water , land and air has been listed for sale on TradeMe and is attracting plenty of attention .
The ultimate in big boys ' toys is leaving adrenalin junkies salivating in its wake .
A homemade flying hovercraft that can travel on water , land and air has been listed for sale on TradeMe and is attracting plenty of attention .
The machine was designed and built by Nelson 's Rudy Heeman and with more than 5000 hits , has reached its reserve price of $ 20,000 .
Mr Heeman , a mechanic , has been making hovercraft in his spare time for more than 13 years but says this is his first attempt at a flying version .
He said he has spent 75 hours flying his hovercraft , and the thrill is unreal .
" It 's like a bungy jump , however the thrill lasts as long as the ride , " he said .
" This machine is fast and furious , it roars like a lion , and is not for the ' faint hearted ' .
It is adrenalin pumping and exciting . "
With a 1.8 - litre engine and a range of over 225 km , the flying hovercraft cruises at 90 kmh when flying , and has a smooth ride above the waves , he said .
" The fuel economy is far better than a boat of the same size and speed . "
He said he attracts plenty of spectators while out on test flights , and admits he refused to let his two daughters watch when he took it for its first flight just before Christmas .
That test flight ended in a crash landing , but a single bruise to his leg meant he knew exactly what adjustments he needed to make .
Mr Heeman said the project had cost tens of thousands of dollars and he had built a new workshop , learnt how to become a fibreglass laminator and modified a Subaru car engine to power the vehicle in the process .
Heeman said he is selling his flying hovercraft because he needs the funds to get started on more " secret " projects .
" It 's got the potential to go into production .
I 've got all the moulds and patterns and am selling to fund more development . "
He only knew of one other person in the country who has built a flying hovercraft , but said many had been made in America and Russia .
The flying hovercraft listing expires on March 13 .
Feedback on the listing so far includes :
" I just have to say this is the most awesome thing I have ever seen .
I wish I had the cash to buy it .
Good luck with the sale . "
" This would be mean for Auckland traffic !
All the best with the auction . "
" That is soooooooooooooo cool ! "
Mr Heeman said he has no " ultimate price " in mind for the flying hovercraft sale .

If you 're one of those people who uses headphones to keep awkward conversations at bay while stuck in public situations , you 're probably going to want to say away from Marvel 's new earbuds .
After all , the colorful licensed products begs for attention .
Produced by Zeikos , the earbuds sport the comic book likeness of Spider - Man , Iron Man , the Hulk and the Punisher 's skull logo .
About half of the earbud varieties come in colorful plastic , while the others seem to be constructed from die - cast metal ( or simply painted to look metallic ) .

Warstories : Worst .
Playing Environment .
Ever .
I ’m a firm believer in that where you play , is as important as what you play , when you are looking to have a good time .
I ’ll be the first to admit that in the case of our gaming group , we have probably the worst playing environment ever .
We play in my dining room , and off the top , the lighting is really bad .
Really , really bad .
Also , people usually start trickling in around 7:30 - ish , which is fairly close to the time I get home from work .
In it of itself , that ’s not a bad thing , but I have two little ones ( 5 , and 2 ) and they get pretty hyperactive when daddy gets home .
This , combined with the arrival of “ the nerds ” as my kid calls my friends , along with my kids ’ fascination with dice and minis make for a rowdy start to the session .
My wife , bless he heart , tries her hardest to give me my space , but I know it is n’t easy .
So sometimes in the middle of a narration or a PC ’s turn at combat , I get called to help with something usually dealing with the kids .
That ’s fine , I get it , parenting does n’t stop for D&D , nor does it happen in a vacuum , so I have little choice but to stop the game for a bit and go help .
Are you asking yourself why we only play here ?
Well , most of the group is probably in the same spot as I am in life , while the other few that are n’t do n’t really have the space to accommodate our larger group .
Plus , for me it ’s easier to be home than to travel with the maps , minis , and tiles that I use .
Is there a solution ?
Not likely .
I ’m in a situation that involves a hectic work schedule , a busy family life , and gaming somewhere in between .
At this point , I take what I can get when it comes to D&D .
If it involves playing in a less than ideal environment , so be it .
I can only imagine that as my kids get older , my schedule will free up a bit , and perhaps alternatives will open up .
So what do you say ?
How ’s your gaming environment ?
Are you like me , or have you found gaming nirvana ?
Thinking about Ed Roberts , who died last week , reminded me of the best story he ever told me about Bill Gates and Paul Allen , explaining why Gates was always richer than Allen and why that differential may not have been fair .
Here ’s the short version :
There was a time when Paul Allen , not Bill Gates , was the boss at Microsoft .
When it came time to visit Albuquerque to demonstrate that first BASIC interpreter to the folks at MiTS , Allen made the trip , not Gates .
It was Paul Allen , not Gates , who was later offered the job as head of software for MiTS — a job I have in the past characterized as the single most expensive position in the history of employment because accepting that job meant that Allen got only 36 percent of Microsoft ’s founder shares , compared to Bill Gates ’ 64 percent .
There ’s an irony in that stock differential , and it is that Gates argued he was working 100 percent for Microsoft while Allen was working for both Microsoft and MiTS , Microsoft ’s only customer , and therefore deserved less stock because of his divided duties .
The irony is that shortly after they divided the shares , Gates went to MiTS founder Ed Roberts asking for a job , too , which Roberts gave him , paying $ 10 per hour .
A more aggressive Paul Allen would have demanded a share adjustment at that point , but the real Paul Allen let it slide .
“ I made out okay , ” he told me when I asked about it , years later .
And while I have you on the line , if you are into Open Source software and live in the southeast or will be passing - through , please meet me at POSSCON 2010 , the Palmetto Open Source Software Conference April 15 - 17 in Columbia , SC .
I ’ll be the keynote speaker on April 15th and promise to shock and awe you with my amazing insight and bad grammar .
Here 's a summary of what the film Burning Bright is , based on what I 've gathered from the trailer :
Back - of - his - Truck Tiger Salesman ( ? ) : " You know , guy , on second thought , I 'm having some misgivings about selling you , just a dude , an angry , bloodthirsty tiger . "
Soon after ...
Just a Dude : " Hey ! Girl , Autistic Boy , I bought a tiger !
Now I 'm boarding everyone inside the home in preparation for this terrible hurricane ! "
Soon after ...
Girl : " Ut oh , he also boarded that tiger in here with us . "
Tiger : " BOOOOSH !
I just exploded through the motherfuckin ' wall , you chumps ! "
Then the rest is like Panic Room meets Jumanji .

Enacting Wall Street reform is something President Obama has worked on since long before he took office , and he is committed to signing a bill that holds Wall Street accountable , protects and empowers American consumers with the strongest consumer protections ever , and ends taxpayer bailouts once and for all .
Since the legislation making its way through Congress includes these major reforms , we 're of course seeing special interests and their lobbyists working furiously to weaken or kill it in order to maintain a status quo that benefits them and their bottom line .
Just today , we learned that payday lenders have spent over $ 2 million on lobbying efforts in an attempt to exclude themselves and their practices from some of the reforms contained within this bill .
This is an industry where some companies offer struggling families a loan to get through to their next paycheck , only to charge enormous interest rates over 400 percent .
And they do this without any oversight for American consumers .
We cannot accept loopholes or carve outs for payday lenders .
The President will not allow for these kinds of loopholes .
Passing this legislation means enacting the strongest consumer financial protections ever and forcing payday lenders -- just like credit card companies and banks with overdraft plans -- to provide clear , understandable information so that Americans can make financial decisions that work best for them .
At the end of the day , every American consumer should have the peace of mind of knowing that they are going to be treated fairly and that they ’re not going to be hit with surprise terms , fees or charges by companies that extend them credit .
The President is willing to have this fight , because he believes there 's a clear choice in this debate , and that 's whether to be on the side of the American people or on the side of the status quo .
If some in this industry want to spend their money trying to preserve deceptive and predatory lending practices , that ’s their choice .
But the President will not accept these efforts to water down this legislation , and he will continue to do everything he can to hold these industries accountable and empower and protect American consumers .

McAfee's " DAT " file version 5958 is causing widespread problems with Windows XP SP3 .
The affected systems will enter a reboot loop and loose all network access .
We have individual reports of other versions of Windows being affected as well .
However , only particular configurations of these versions appear affected .
The bad DAT file may infect individual workstations as well as workstations connected to a domain .
The use of " ePolicyOrchestrator " , which is used to update virus definitions across a network , appears to have lead to a faster spread of the bad DAT file .
The ePolicyOrchestrator is used to update " DAT " files throughout enterprises .
It can not be used to undo this bad signature because affected system will lose network connectivity .
The problem is a false positive which identifies a regular Windows binary , " svchost.exe " , as " W32/ Wecorl.a " , a virus .
If you are affected , you will see a message like :
The file C:WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe contains the W32 / Wecorl .a Virus .
Undetermined clean error , OAS denied access and continued .
Detected using Scan engine version 5400 .
1158 DAT version 5958.0000 .
McAfee released an updated DAT file , and an " EXTRA.DAT " file to fix the problem .
An EXTRA.DAT file is a patch to just fix the bad signature .
McAfee 's support web sites currently respond slowly and are down at times , likely due to the increased load caused by this issue .
Several readers reported that this procedure worked to recover :
1 - Boot the system in " Safe Mode "
2 - copy extra.dat in c:/ program files / common files/mcafee/engine
3 - reboot .
If you lost " svchost.exe " , then you need to copy it back to c:/ Windows / system32/svchost.exe while in safe mode .
This fix has to be applied locally at the workstation .
However , it may be possible to do this remotely if your workstations support Intel 's " vPro " technology .
We should have a link to instructions shortly .
Our reader Jim wrote in about how he managed to get some systems back remotely , as long as svchost .
exe was not deleted or moved .
In this case , the computer will be in a reboot loop .
Here is what Jim wrote :
I created a batch file to run the following command : echo f | xcopy.exe { server}netlogonextra.dat " c:program files\common files\mcafeeengine\extra.dat " /R /Y I put this batch file and the extra.dat in the netlogon folder .
I then set the computer configuration > windows settings > scripts > startup to run this command in a GPO that gets applied to all computers .
Then link the GPO to the domain root , or wherever is appropriate .
Upon reboot the computers process this command and so far we seem to be good to go , " mostly " .
There have been a few cases where the files end up missing .
ISC reader Linnie wrote in and indicated this method works as well :
- Copy the EXTRA .dat file to c:program files \common files \mcafeeengine
- copy the svchost.exe to c:windows\system32
- Reboot , everything is back to normal .

It has the potential to become Barack Obama ’s Vietnam .
Not the Gulf oil spill , serious though that is .
Nor Afghanistan .
Other people ’s mistakes are one thing .
The ones that haunt forever are the ones you make yourself .
I mean the system of public education .
Remember the recipe for a policy disaster ?
Start with a handful of policy intellectuals confronting a stubborn problem , in love with a Big Idea .
Fold in a bunch of ambitious Ivy League kids who do n’t speak the local language .
Churn up enthusiasm for the program in the gullible national press – and get ready for a decade of really bad news .
Take a look at David Halberstam ’s Vietnam classic The Best and the Brightest , if you need to refresh your memory .
Or just think back on the run-up to the war in Iraq .
My jaw dropped last week when I picked up The New York Times Magazine and turned to its cover story “ The Teachers ’ Unions ’ Last Stand : How Obama ’s Race to the Top could revolutionize Public Education , ” by Steven Brill .
In 8,000 breathless words , Brill described “ a movement spreading across the country to hold public school teachers accountable by compensating , promoting , and even removing them according to the results they produce in class , as measured in part by student test scores . ”
That means getting rid of pay and job protection based on seniority , breaking up the teachers ’ unions , and starting a lot of new charter schools .
True , Brill notes , these are initiatives historically associated with the Republican Party , but Obama “ really does seem to be a new kind of Democrat . ”
By adopting a “ Nixon - to - China approach , ” the president and his lieutenants can hope to get “ some , probably many ” Democratic votes , “ while winning support from Republicans on an issue they have championed so strongly in the past that taking a flat - out anti-Obama approach would be especially awkward . ”
Making it happen , says Brill , “ is a network of reformers dedicated to overhauling public education in the United States . ”
They are working in key positions in school districts and charter - school networks , legislating in state capitals , staffing city halls and statehouses for reform - minded mayors and governors , writing papers for policy groups and dispensing grants from billion - dollar philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
Bill Gates , along with Education Secretary Arne Duncan ; Teach for America ’s founder , Wendy Kopp ; and the New York City schools chancellor Joel Klein could be considered the patron saints of the network .
Teach for America ?
Kopp broached the idea of a privately - funded “ domestic Peace Corps ” for recent college grads in her senior thesis at Princeton in 1989 .
She founded the organization the next year with $ 2.5 million of foundation backing .
More than 24,000 college graduates have done a stint of teaching in low - income communities since then .
“ Race to the Top ” ?
That ’s the brainchild of Jon Schnur , Kopp ’s college classmate , who had education policy jobs in the Clinton administration before going to work on Obama ’s presidential campaign .
Some $ 4.3 billion of new federal aid to education was tucked away in last year ’s stimulus bill , to be awarded states based on their promise to implement various measures , including increased testing , opening more charter schools and eliminating “ last - in / first - out ” provisions in teachers ’ union contracts .
Education secretary Arne Duncan devised the 500 - point scale by which various “ peer reviewers , ” none of them directly involved in K - 12 education , will evaluate the states ’ competing bids .
Duncan , a charter school entrepreneur ( his 1987 Harvard College senior thesis dealt with education reform ) , served for eight years as chief executive officer of Chicago ’s public schools before joining Obama ’s cabinet .
Brill enthuses that by turning a grant program into a contest , “ thousands of local news stories across the country speculated about how particular states were faring , some of them breathlessly referring to ‘ March madness ’ as governors , state legislators and bureaucrats rushed to consider reforms that might improve their chances . ”
The competition comes to a head on June 1 , when states must submit a second round of proposals .
Last week , for instance , New York City officials and the State Assembly in Albany agreed to double the number of charter schools in the city to 200 , and license another 260 around the state as part of its bid for some $ 700 million in federal money .
Brill wrote , “ Before Duncan had dispensed a nickel , the country had seen more school reform than it had in decades . ”
As I read along in the Times Magazine , I wondered what Brill was doing writing about efforts to reform the public schools .
A serial entrepreneur , he founded the monthly American Lawyer in 1979 , the much less successful Brill ’s Content in 1998 ( the self - styled media watchdog folded in 2001 ) , and has been involved in a variety of publishing ventures since .
Deerfield Academy , Yale College , Yale Law : he has no background in public education .
Indeed it was clear from the article that he did n’t know much about the classroom .
The key difference between public schools and charter schools – the latter can exclude or fire troublesome kids – goes altogether unmentioned .
Then , as I read these particular sentences , it dawned on me :
[ A]t about midnight on Saturday , January 16 [ Merryl ]
Tisch answered the phone in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and let out an ear - splitting shriek .
She recalls that her husband , James Tisch , who is the chief executive of Loews Corp. , thought someone must have died .
I realized that Brill goes to parties with the people he was writing about – with Michael Bloomberg , New York City ’s billionaire mayor , with Joel Klein , the former antitrust chief at the Justice Department whom Bloomberg appointed to run the city ’s schools , and with Mrs. Tisch , the chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents , who was upset that night that the State Assembly , in its negotiations with the teachers ’ unions , might be backing away from the terms of its subsequent Race to the Top .
Brill ’s Times Magazine story is an anomaly , interesting mainly for its cheerleading being so completely over the top .
Not since Judith Miller built her case for Saddam Hussein ’s weapons of mass destruction has there been anything like it in the Times .
( But then the Sunday magazine often seems to operate in a world of its own . )
It will be interesting to see if Clark Hoyt , the newspaper ’s public editor , takes a look .
Meanwhile , though , Arne Duncan ’s “ Race to the Top ” is for real .
And so is the well - funded army of policy entrepreneurs he describes .
I ’m no expert on public education either , but I know an expert when I see one .
Diane Ravitch has been the nation ’s preeminent historian of education since her book The Troubled Crusade : American Education 1945 - 1980 appeared in 1983 .
She served as assistant secretary of education under George H. W. Bush .
For forty years she has pondered each new proposal for restructuring schools as it has come along , often with considerable sympathy : vouchers , charter schools , curriculum reform , standardized testing , punitive teacher accountability .
In her new book , The Death and Life of the Great American School System : How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education , Ravitch describes the evidence that has changed her views of strategies that once seemed promising to her .
( Her title ’s echo of Jane Jacobs ’ great 1961 book on urban life is intentional : she began her career in Manhattan in 1968 , at a time when Jacobs was leading her epic battle against highway - planner Robert Moses . )
The nostrums that school districts , Congress , and federal officials are pursuing , that mega - rich foundations are supporting , that editorial boards are applauding , are mistaken , she says , fundamentally flawed because they are built on a market metaphor .
Schools do n’t work like businesses , she says Public education should be preserved “ because it is so intimately connected to our concepts of citizenship and democracy and to the promise of American life . ”
To that end she offers a series of prescriptions :
■ Leave decisions about schools to educators , not politicians or businessmen ;
■ Devise a truly national curriculum that sets out what children in every grade should be learning ;
■ Expect charter schools to educate the kids who need help the most , not to compete with public schools ;
■ Pay teachers a fair wage for their work , not “ merit pay ” based on deeply flawed and unreliable test scores ;
■ Encourage family involvement in education from an early age
Ravitch is especially good on the influence of what she calls the “ Billionaire Boy ’s Club ” – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( the Microsoft fortune ) , the Walton Family Foundation ( Wal - Mart ) , and the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation ( home - building and finance ) – that have eclipsed the older foundations long associated with education policy ( Ford , Rockefeller , Carnegie and Annenberg ) as the powerful big givers .
Sometimes described as “ venture philanthropies ” or exponents of “ philanthrocapitalism , ” meaning their methods are borrowed from start - up finance and management , the Gates , Walton and Broad foundations see their grants as investments , designed to produce measurable results .
And though they preach accountability to teachers , they receive relatively little scrutiny themselves – or even much dissent , given the power of their interlocking grants to exclude critics .
All that money buys a lot of silence , Ravitch says , not to mention admiring friends .
The Teach for America program , with its youthful cadre of 24,000 veterans , in one of the fruits of philanthrocapitalism ; the Race to the Top is another .
The situation is alarming .
Not only is the federal government about to administer a hammer - blow to the basic principles of public education through its competitive grant program ; over the next few months , hundreds of thousands of public school teachers are scheduled to be laid off , as well , thanks to state and local budgets that have been stretched to the breaking point by falling tax revenue and rising unemployment claims .
Christina Romer , chair of the Council of Economic Advisers , last week estimated that perhaps as many as one out fifteen teachers would receive a pink slip unless Congress extended the emergency aid that so far has saved more than 400,000 teaching positions .
No soap , apparently .
House leaders , worried about soaring levels of public debt , instead cut back sharply on the extension .
It is not too late for the administration to gradually change its stance on public education .
Obama and David Axelrod should take out some old Time and Life magazines , compare them to Brill ’s Times Magazine article , and reflect on how the media pranced as Presidents Kennedy and Johnson blundered into Vietnam .
They should read and discuss Diane Ravitch ’s book .
They should think long and hard about whether they are going to let Arne Duncan and his whiz kids put Obama ’s presidency in greater peril than the Deepwater Horizon ever could .
Greetings to the New Season : NBC
When the season finales begin to air , then you know that it ’s only a matter of time before the network upfront presentations begin .
If you ’re not familiar with the concept of the upfront , it ’s when the networks formally roll out their fall schedules , providing advance warning about the slate of new programming for the next season , thereby allowing for several months of snarky comments about series which no one has even seen yet .
Give credit to NBC , though : they ’ve actually offered up clips for virtually every one of their new shows in order to get the buzz going as quickly as possible … be it positive or negative .
Check out what they ’ve got to offer , then let us know what you think !

[ Haskell - cafe ] Interest in a Mathematics & AI strike force ?
Hello - cafe ,
When I started learning Haskell , I saw the AI page [ 1 ] which aimed at creating a sound , uniform and handy framework for AI programming in Haskell .
I added my name on it and thought a bit about it .
I even wrote a first version of HNN [ 2 ] , a neural network library , quite early in my Haskell days .
I found that idea to be great but did not see any actual effort around this .
So , I 'm now thinking again about that and even enlarging it to mathematics & AI .
Thus , I would like to have an idea of the number of people interested in being involved in such an effort .
There are several tools out there on hackage but they are n't that much uniform and neither play nicely together .
I 'm pretty convinced this could be improved and as a Mathematics student I 'm highly interested in that .
If enough people are interested , we could for example set up a mailing list and a trac to organize the effort and then people could just discuss and write Haskell modules when time permits .
Any comment , idea , reaction , interest ? [ 1 ]

Why with the Eye ?
The idea of tapping into vision for computation is not new .
Mathematical notation itself is a visualization technique and aid to cognition .
The invention of writing , more generally , moved language from the auditory modality to a visual one , and enhanced our reasoning capabilities .
Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex .
In spite of this , it does not “ feel ” like work to see .
Our cognitive powers are , in stark contrast , “ slow and painful , ” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks .
Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks , perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult ?
I have recently begun such a research program with the goal of devising ways of converting digital logic circuits into visual stimuli – “ visual circuits ” – which , when presented to the eye , “ tricks ” the visual system into carrying out the digital logic computation and generating a perception that amounts to the “ output ” of the computation .
That is , the technique amounts to turning our visual system into a programmable computer .
This is not the first time scientists have attempted to make use of biological computation ; this was first tried with DNA , tapping into the computational prowess inside cells .
My research is the second kind of biological harnessing that has been attempted for computation , aiming to commandeer our very brains .
Because this new kind of computation – “ visual computation , ” or “ eye computation ” – is carried out in people ’s brains , its outputs can be directly and immediately fed into humans , making for true human - computer interaction , all in one head !
People are notoriously poor reasoners , whether in the probabilistic domain or logical domain , something I have also personally witnessed when teaching logic and computer science .
That ’s one of the reasons we all appreciate computers .
Although our reasoning and logic powers are poor , we are all walking around with computers in our heads that are far more powerful in many respects to any computing device ever built , or likely to be built in the foreseeable future .
There are several reasons why the visual modality is a promising one for biological computation .
First , the computations underlying our elicited perceptions are extraordinarily powerful , our visual system taking up about half our cortex .
Second , our eyes and visual system are capable of inputting and processing large amounts of information in a short period of time .
Third , in spite of the billions of calculations carried out at each glance , it feels effortless to perceive .
Fourth , visual neuroscience is by far the most well understood subfield of neuroscience , both at the level of neurobiological mechanisms and perceptual phenomenology .
Finally , visual stimuli are a much easier modality for presenting stimuli – e.g. , on paper – whereas audition , say , requires a computer or play - back device .
Visualization within science in the form of graphs , charts , etc. has been crucial for understanding complex phenomena .
Visualization has also been employed for over two hundred years in logic .
For example , Leonhard Euler invented diagrams to visually represent the contingent relationships among concepts , John Venn utilized visual diagrams to show the logical structure relating concepts , and Charles Sanders Peirce invented existential graphs ( Figure 1a ) for depicting logical formulae .
For digital logic there has long been a standard visual notation scheme that depicts each logical formula as if it were a physical electrical circuit , as shown in Figure 1b .
Figure 1 c shows a preview of the kind of visual circuit I have been designing ; we ’ll see more of these later .
Vision has , then , long been harnessed for computation , in particular with the aim of facilitating human reasoning .
The “ visual computation ” technology I am designing is something altogether different .
The aim is not simply to use visual stimuli to aid one ’s cognitive computations .
Rather , the aim is to get our visual system itself to obediently carry out the computations .
The broad strategy is to visually represent a computer program in such a way that , when one looks at the visual representation , one ’s visual system naturally responds by carrying out the computation and generating a perception that encodes the appropriate output to the computation .
That is , there would be a special kind of image that amounts to “ visual software , ” software our “ visual hardware ” ( or brain ) computes , and computes in such a way that the output can be “ read off ” the elicited perception .
Ideally , we would be able to glance at a complex visual stimulus — the program with inputs — and our visual system would automatically and effortlessly generate a perception that would inform us of the ouput of the computation .
Visual stimuli like this would not only amount to a novel and useful visual notation , but would actually trick our visual systems into doing our work for us .
Other visual notation systems for logic and computation – such as Charles Peirce ’s “ existential logics ” or standard digital circuit notation ( see Figure 1a and 1b above ) – cannot do this .
Escher Circuits
In my attempt to hack into our visual system and program it as I wish , I have experimented with hundreds of varieties of visual circuit instantiations , for much of that time with little success .
Figure 2 illustrates some of the broad classes of visual circuit types that failed for any of a number of reasons .
Stimuli that were not successful include : ( i ) cases where the bistability was figure - ground ( and for these circuits a large problem was that the “ wire ” was not “ insulated , ” and would quickly leak and spread everywhere in the circuit ) , ( ii ) some stimuli looked like pipes and tubes ( but although NOT was easy to achieve , AND and OR were not even conceivably computed ) , ( iii ) some kinds of circuits tried to affect the probable illumination direction , thereby modulating the perceived convexity of a bump / crater , ( iv ) some utilized dynamic stimuli with dots alternating positions , with ambiguous motion signals , ( v ) others had a similar idea , but for grouping ambiguously grouped pairs of objects , and ( vi ) color spreading was utilized in some attempts .
Finally , though , I found a variety of visual circuit that ( kind of ) works .
The design relies on depth ambiguity , and was the first design that enabled perceptual AND and OR operations , as well as satisfying the other early constraints for the simplest digital visual circuits .
Because this variety of visual circuit can often look vaguely Escherian , I call them Escher circuits .
What ’s the Point ?
Just the Beginning
To understand Escher circuits , we must start with the most fundamental part in them : wire .
Wire : Circuits need wire in order to transmit signals to different parts of the circuit , and an example case of “ visual wire ” is shown on the left in Figure 3 .
It is bistable , and can be perceived either as tilted away ( 0 ) or tilted toward you ( 1 ) .
Stimuli of this sort serve as wire because your perception of its tilt at the top propagates all the way down it to the bottom .
This kind of stimulus also serves as insulated wire , because state changes tend to be confined to the wire itself .
Many circuit varieties I experimented with before the current variety suffered from leaky wires , where the state would spread across the page : for example , this was a key problem when trying to use figure - ground perceptual ambiguity for digital state .
In this style of Escher circuit , wire has a canonical form , directed down and to the left as in the orientation shown at the input and output of the wire on the left in Figure 3 .
Wire can also be bent as in the case shown , which – with the increased junction information – can make the perception of depth more pronounced and stable .
But these circuits are designed so that any such bends must eventually “ unbend ” when being input into another component of the circuit .
This feature of visual circuits is important in understanding the design difficulties in building a NOT gate , something I ’ll discuss in a moment .
Inputs :
An input to an Escher visual circuit is an unambiguous cue to the tilt at that part of the circuit .
Here I utilize simple unambiguous boxes as inputs , as shown in Figure 3 on the middle and right .
One advantage to inputs of this kind is that differential depth cues lead to pop out : in larger circuits there will be many inputs , and it will be crucial for the pattern of tilt - towards and tilt - aways – i.e. , the binary input – to stand out as a perceptible pattern so that it can induce the computations in the circuit .
Negation : NOT gates are crucial for digital circuit computations , inverting the signal from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa .
Figure 4a shows one kind of visual NOT gate for Escher circuits .
It begins as a special kind of wire — roughly a wire - frame box — which undergoes a “ break ” below it .
The portion of wire below the break tends to be perceived as having the opposite tilt to that above the “ break . ”
The curvy portion below it is required here in order to bring the wire back into the down - and - leftward canonical orientation for wire in these circuits .
Another variety of NOT gate is shown in Figure 4b , this one relying on an ambiguous prism - like shape to correct the circuit orientiation , or handedness .
A third type is inside the circuit shown in Figure 6 .
Disjunction and conjunction : Escher circuits allow ORs and ANDs as shown in Figure 5 .
The visual OR gate in Figure 5a is designed with transparency cues so that the tilted - toward - you , or 1 , interpretation is favored , and tends to be overridden only when both inputs are 0s .
A similar idea works for an AND gate , but with a distinct kind of transparency cue .
That is , the OR and AND gates are designed so that , without inputs , 1 and 0 output interpretations are favored , respectively .
These gates – NOT , AND , and OR – are sufficiently powerful that any digital circuit can , in principle , be built from them .
( In fact , { NOT , AND} and { NOT , OR} are each universal . )
In the circuit shown in Figure 7b are two NAND gates ( relying on similar transparency cue tricks as for OR and AND ) , and a NAND gate is , by itself , universal .
Figure 6 shows an example larger circuit , an exclusive - OR ( XOR ) .
Most of the interesting computations possible with digital circuits require feedback , and Figure 7 gives two examples , including a simple variety of flip - flop for memory storage .
Why do any of this ?
I can imagine a variety of possible long - term benefits ( some of them quite fantastic ) .
Enhanced computation :
One general potential payoff concerns the possibility that some programs could be run more quickly on an “ eye computer ” than on an electronic computer .
These would be programs that critically rely on the visual system ’s specialized “ GPU ” ( graphical processing units ) , something unparalleled by computational vision algorithms .
This is analogous to the original hopes for DNA computation .
Computation that interacts with the brain : DNA computation did not end up useful for carrying out computations faster than electronic circuits .
Instead , it was realized that the advantage of molecular computation was that it allowed the direct communication and interaction with the cell biology .
Analogously , whether or not eye computation can ever be employed to carry out computations more efficiently than on an electronic computer , the benefit may be that visual circuits can directly interact with the neural machinery – because the neural machinery is the computer here .
State - dependent perceptions in static stimuli :
One of the directions of interaction can be from brain to computation , where different observers – having different brain states – may react differently to a certain visual circuit .
For example , one can imagine a circuit component whose perceptual resolution is modulated by the observer ’s , say , thirst ( actually , there are such stimuli , something from 2001 research of mine ) .
The visual circuit would be designed to communicate ( via its perceptual resolution ) something relevant for thirsty observers when thirsty , and something else for non-thirsty observers .
Diagnostic Rorschach - like tests :
One of the hopes of molecular computation is to have molecular computers that can interact with cells , and whose output will depend upon the state of the cell .
In this way , molecular computation hopes to be a diagnostic tool .
Similarly , eye circuits may potentially have value as a diagnostic tool for neurology and psychiatry : the patient reports the perceptual output to the doctor , and this output is diagnostic about which condition the patient likely has .
Like a Rorschach inkblot test , eye computation relies upon ambiguity ; but unlike Rorschach tests , visual circuits carry out specific algorithms , and can be explicitly designed .
Treatment :
The other direction in the brain - computation interaction is from computation to brain .
For molecular computing , the idea would be that the molecular computer can selectively affect the cellular environment .
For eye computation , the goal would be to develop circuits that can leave a particular lasting impact on the visual system and brain .
Just as with flip - flop circuits it is possible to create and control a long - lasting state change ( used for memory storage ) , visual circuits can potentially induce perceptual states , and in such a way that even once the input stimulus inducer is removed , the perceptual state remains “ frozen in ” .
There may , then , someday be routes by which visual computation could not only diagnose psychiatric and neurological disorders , but also be involved in treatment .
Programmable perceptions : Visual computation could provide powerful tools for manipulating an observer ’s perception , despite much or all of the visual stimulus remaining identical .
For example , a three input visual circuit can have up to eight different perceptual states , and which perceptual state the observer is in can be controlled by modulating the three unambiguous input visual stimuli .
It is also possible to program for arbitrary kinds of perceptual ambiguity : for any visual circuit without inputs , one ’s perceptions will tend to settle only on the logically satisfiable solutions to the circuit , and so one can purposely engineer which of multiple perceptions are possible for a viewer .
Enhancement of human logical capabilities : Despite the presence of computers , people rely more and more on visual displays aimed at aiding our thinking .
For example , digital circuit notation is used more than ever among engineers , and visual notation for mathematicians and scientists is likely to always be with us .
Visual computation makes new inroads into visual displays , and radically extends its horizons so that the visual modality is not just a medium for the iteraction of vision and cognition , but lets loose the computational dynamics of the visual system .
For example , rather than an engineer programming digital circuits via thinking his or her way through traditional digital circuit notation , with visual circuits the engineer ’s visual system will be harnessed and allow him or her to much more quickly see – literally see – the computational steps .
Manipulation of perceptual memory : Manipulation of computer memory ( in RAM ) relies upon digital circuits like flip - flops , where a brief signal to one of the inputs leads to a state change ( a bit flip ) at one of the outputs , and this new state remains even after the brief input signal is removed .
Such digital memory circuits can be implemented via visual circuits as well , allowing a short presentation of an input stimulus to cause a long - term shift in the perceptual output .
Circuits like this rely upon feedback , which in the case of visual computation amounts to one ’s own perceptual state being fed back to earlier parts of the circuit , affecting the perceptual state there .
I foresee memory circuits such as these eventually being crucial building blocks for visual circuits , helping to maintain greater circuit perceptual stability .
In the long run one hope would be that visual circuits for bit storage could be utilized as an aid to working memory , allowing us to artificially enhance our working memory limits by tapping into visual working memory .
Mnemonic device :
One common technique for enhancing recall is to create imagery connected to the list of terms to be recalled .
The imagery is more easily recalled than the list all by itself , and the imagery then helps one recall each of the terms .
Visual computation allows something like this .
The list of terms to be recalled is now the input to a visual circuit , and the visual circuit is designed so that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the possible inputs and the resultant visual circuit perceptual state .
The list of terms now computationally induces a particular imagery , and the person just needs to remember the look of the induced imagery .
To recall the list , the visual circuit is presented without inputs , the observer recalls the imagery , the imagery helps induce the visual circuit into the earlier perceptuo - computational state , and this state leads to perceptual states at the inputs ( now empty ) , which can be read off one ’s perception to attain the original list .
Although the Escher visual circuits I just described are a great improvement over my many earlier attempts ( see Figure 2 ) , there are serious technical difficulties to overcome .
First , the larger circuits currently appear to require – at least without training -- “ perceptually walking through the circuit ” from the inputs downward toward the output .
One does not yet immediately and holistically perceive the output .
Second , the visual logic gates do not always faithfully transmit the appropriate signal at the output .
For example , although AND gates tend to elicit perceptions that are AND - like , it is a tendency only , not a sure - fire physical result as in real digital circuits .
Third , even if a logic gate works well , in the sense that it unambiguously and robustly cues the perception at the output , our perception can be somewhat volatile , capable of sudden Escher - like flips to the alternate state .
The result is that it can be difficult to perceive one ’s way through these visual circuits .
And , fourth , building larger and more functionally complex circuits will require smaller and / or more specialized visual circuit components in order to fit the circuit on an image ( analogous to the evolution of electronic circuits ) .
A major problem to overcome is how to do this while still ensuring that the visual system reacts to the circuit as intended .
The current visual circuit design is only the first step , demonstrating the basic concept .
It should be thought of as analogous to the early research stages in DNA computation , an idea that was “ miles away ” from the ideal promise at the inception … and still is .
The profession of IT The Resurgence of Parallelism
Credit : Digital Journal
Multi - core chips are a new paradigm ! "
" We are entering the age of parallelism ! "
These are today 's faddish rallying cries for new lines of research and commercial development .
Is this really the first time when computing professionals seriously engaged with parallel computation ?
Is parallelism new ?
Is parallelism a new paradigm ?

Déjà Vu All Over Again
Parallel computation has always been a means to satisfy our never - ending hunger for ever - faster and ever - cheaper computation .
4
In the 1960s and 1970s , parallel computation was extensively researched as a means to high - performance computing .
But the commercial world stuck with a quest for faster CPUs and , assisted by Moore 's Law , made it to the 2000s without having to seriously engage with parallel computation except for supercomputers .
The parallel architecture research of the 1960s and 1970s solved many problems that are being encountered today .
Our objective in this column is to recall the most important of these results and urge their resurrection .

Shared Memory Multiprocessing
The very first multiprocessor architecture was the Burroughs B5000 , designed beginning in 1961 by a team led by Robert Barton .
It was followed by the B5500 and B6700 , along with a defense version , the D850 .
The architecture survives today in the reverse polish notation HP calculators and in the Uni-Sys ClearPath MCP machines .
Those machines used shared memory multiprocessors in which a crossbar switch connected groups of four processors and memory boxes .
The operating system , known as Automatic Scheduling and Operating Program ( ASOP ) , included many innovations .
Its working storage was organized as a stack machine .
All its code was " reentrant , " meaning that multiple processors could execute the same code simultaneously while computing on separate stacks .
The instruction set , which was attuned to the Algol language , was very simple and efficient even by today 's RISC standards .
A newly spawned process 's stack was linked to its parent 's stack , giving rise to a runtime structure called " cactus stack . "
The data memory outside of the stacks was laid out in segments ; a segment was a contiguous sequence of locations with base and bound defined by a descriptor .
Segments were moved automatically up and down the memory hierarchy , an early form of virtual memory not based on paging .
Elliot Organick 's masterful descriptions of these machines make for refreshing and worthwhile reading today .
9,12
The Burroughs systems were an important influence on research seeking efficient and reliable parallel program structures .
A group of researchers at Brown University and General Electric Research Laboratories produced a set of reports on a " contour model " of nested multitask computations in 1971.
12
Those reports give a remarkably clear picture of a parallel programming runtime environment that would suit today 's languages well and would resolve many contemporary problems considered as " research challenges . "
It is a tragedy these ideas have disappeared from the curriculum .
The Burroughs machines disappeared not because of any defect in their architecture , but because of IBM 's massive success in marketing the 360 series systems .
Moreover , in a process reminiscent of Clayton Christensen 's Innovator 's Dilemma , the low - end assembler - language minicomputers , originally designed to run laboratory instruments , grew up into the minicomputer and then microcomputer market , untainted by any notions of parallel programming .
With the introduction of RISC architectures in the early 1980s , much of the research for high - performance computers was rechanneled toward exploiting RISC for fast chips .
It looked at the time that sophisticated compilers could make up for missing functions in the chips .
With two notable exceptions , most of the projects exploring alternatives to the " von Neumann architecture " expired and were not replaced with new projects or other initiatives .
One exception was Arvind 's Monsoon Project at MIT,10 which demonstrated that massive parallelism is readily identified in the functional programming language Haskell , and then readily mapped to a shared memory multiprocessor .
( Functional languages generate all their values by evaluating functions without side effects . )
The other project involved a group at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studying scientific codes in the functional language Sisal , a derivative of MIT 's Val language ; Sisal programs were as efficient as Fortran programs and could be readily compiled to massively parallel shared memory supercomputers .
1,2,11
The current generations of super - computers ( and data warehouses ) are based on thousands of CPU chips running in parallel .
Unlike the innovative designs of the Burroughs systems , their hardware architectures conform to the conventional von Neumann machine .
Their operating systems are little more than simple schedulers and message passing protocols , with complex functions relegated to applications running on separate host machines .
The point is clear : ideas for arranging multiple processors to work together in an integrated system have been with us for 50 years .
What 's new ?
The parallel architecture research of the 1960s and 1970s solved many problems that are being encountered today .

Determinate Computation
One of the holy grails of research in parallel computation in the 1960s and 1970s was called " determinacy . "
7
Determinacy requires that a network of parallel tasks in shared memory always produces the same output for given input regardless of the speeds of the tasks .
It should not be confused with a similar word , " deterministic , " which would require that the tasks be ordered in the same sequence every time the system runs .
A major result of this research was the " determinacy theorem . "
A task is a basic computation that implements a function from its inputs to outputs .
Two tasks are said to be in conflict if either of them writes into memory cells used by the other .
In a system of concurrent tasks , race conditions may be present that make the final output depend on the relative speeds or orders of task execution .
Determinacy is ensured if the system is constrained so that every pair of conflicting tasks is performed in the same order in every run of the system .
Then no data races are possible .
Note that atomicity and mutual exclusion are not sufficient for determinacy : they ensure only that conflicting tasks are not concurrent , but not that they always executed in the same order .
A corollary of the determinacy theorem is that the entire sequence of values written into each and every memory cell during any run of the system is the same for the given input .
This corollary also tells us that any system of blocking tasks that communicates by messages using FIFO queues ( instead of shared memory ) is automatically determinate because the message queues always present the data items in the same order to the tasks receiving them .
Another corollary is that an implementation of a functional programming language using concurrent tasks is determinate because the functions provide their data privately to their successors when they fire .
There is no interference among the memory cells used to transmit data between functions .
Determinacy is really important in parallel computation .
It tells us we can unleash the full parallelism of a computational method without worrying whether any timing errors or race conditions will negatively affect the results .
Back to Top
Functional Programming and Composability
Another holy grail for parallel system has been modular composability .
This would mean that any parallel program can be used , without change , as a component of a larger parallel program .
Three principles are needed to enable parallel program composability .
David Parnas wrote about two : information hiding and context independence .
Information hiding means a task 's internal memory cannot be read or written by any other task .
Context independence means no part of a task can depend on values outside the task 's internal memory or input - output memory .
The third principle is argument noninterference ; it says that a data object presented as input to two concurrent modules cannot be modified by either .
Functional programming languages automatically satisfy these three principles ; their modules are thus composable .
It is an open question how to structure composable parallel program modules from different frameworks when the modules implement non-determinate behavior .
Transaction systems are an extreme case .
Because their parallel tasks may interfere in the records they access , they use locking protocols to guarantee mutual exclusion .
Transaction tasks cannot be ordered by a fixed ordertheir nondeterminacy is integral to their function .
For example , an airplane seat goes to whichever task requested it first .
The problem is to find a way to reap the benefits of composability for systems that are necessarily nondeterminate .
Back to Top
Virtual Memory
There are obvious advantages if the shared memory of a parallel multi-processor could be a virtual memory .
Parameters can be passed as pointers ( virtual addresses ) without copying ( potentially large ) objects .
Compilation and programming are greatly simplified because neither compilers nor programmers need to manage the placement of shared objects in the memory hierarchy of the system ; that is done automatically by the virtual memory system .
Virtual memory is essential for modular composability when modules can share objects .
Any module that manages the placement of a shared object in memory violates the information hiding principle because other modules must consult it before using a shared object .
By hiding object locations from modules , virtual memory enables composability of parallel program modules .
There are two concerns about large virtual memory .
One is that the virtual addresses must be large so that they encompass the entire address space in which the large computations proceed .
The Multics system demonstrated that a very large virtual address spacecapable of encompassing the entire file systemcould be implemented efficiently .
8
Capability - based addressing5,6 can be used to implement a very large address space .
The other concern about large virtual memory pertains to performance .
The locality principle assures us that each task accesses a limited but dynamically evolving working set of data objects .
3
The working set is easily detectedit is the objects used in a recent backward - looking window and loaded into a processor 's cache .
There is no reason to be concerned about performance loss due to an inability to load every task 's working set into its cache .
Parallelism is not new ; the realization that it is essential for continued progress in high - performance computing is .
What about cache consistency ?
A copy of a shared object will be present in each sharing task 's cache .
How do changes made by one get transmitted to the other ?
It would seem that this problem is exacerbated in a highly parallel system because of the large number of processors and caches .
Here again , the research that was conducted during the 1970s provides an answer .
We can completely avoid the cache consistency problem by never writing to shared data .
That can be accomplished by building the memory as a write - once memory : when a process writes into a shared object , the system automatically creates a copy and tags it as the current version .
These value sequences are unique in a determinate system .
Determinate systems , therefore , give a means to completely avoid the cache consistency problem and successfully run a very large virtual memory .
Back to Top
Research Challenges
Functional programming languages ( such as Haskell and Sisal ) currently support the expression of large classes of application codes .
They guarantee determinacy and support composability .
Extending these languages to include stream data types would bring hazard - free expression to computations involving inter-module pipelines and signal processing .
We badly need a further extension to support programming in the popular object - oriented style while guaranteeing determinacy and composability .
We have means to express nondeterminate computation in self - contained environments such as interactive editors , version control systems , and transaction systems .
We sorely need approaches that can combine determinate and nondeterminate components into well - structured larger modules .
The full benefits of functional programming and composability cannot be fully realized unless memory management and thread scheduling are freely managed at runtime .
In the long run , this will require merging computational memory and file systems into a single , global virtual memory .
Back to Top
Conclusion
We can now answer our original questions .
Parallelism is not new ; the realization that it is essential for continued progress in high - performance computing is .
Parallelism is not yet a paradigm , but may become so if enough people adopt it as the standard practice and standard way of thinking about computation .
The new era of research in parallel processing can benefit from the results of the extensive research in the 1960s and 1970s , avoiding rediscovery of ideas already documented in the literature : shared memory multiprocessing , determinacy , functional programming , and virtual memory .

Interesting article .
We should definitely learn from the past .
But I also think there are some differences between older parallel systems and new ones .
I think this is a problem : " We can completely avoid the cache consistency problem by never writing to shared data . "
The problem is that , for many of the things we want to do with multicore processors ( like graphics , or games , which is my area ) we * do* need to write to shared data .
This is a problem with a lot of solutions : they require the use of write - only data .
This is sometimes possible , but sometimes not .
For the real - world applications that we work on , this is a restriction that is often unworkable .
The framebuffer in graphics , for example , is writeable shared memory .
So I think we still have a problem that we do n't have a consistent answer to : data that is shared and modified .
The other difference is to do with the lifetime of tasks .
In older systems , there were long - running tasks .
This is often true of HPC today .
But for the media - rich devices that use multicore , tasks are often much shorter - running .
This has the effect of increasing the relative cost of starting and stopping tasks .
We also have the problem of duplicating processor cores , but not necessarily being able to afford to duplicate the memory chips .
This increases problems of memory bandwidth .
So , there are some fundamental differences today , which mean some of the past solutions are n't always appropriate .
Peter Denning
Our comment about cache consistency was part of a discussion about designs that enable reproducible results of very large systems of partially ordered tasks operating in a common virtual memory .
Some types of cache , such as framebuffers as noted here , are not part of virtual address space .
We saw some very promising designs of virtual memory and database systems that used write - once memory to avoid consistency problems within the shared address space .
Some of these issues may be tough today because designers of multicore systems did not set an objective of reproducible results in large task systems .
I hate to see people overlooking the good results of past research just because it is " old " and did not anticipate today 's environment .
The question of designing large task systems for determinacy is separate from the question of whether we can afford large task systems .
When tasks cannot be started cheaply , we wo n't be able to afford large systems of those tasks .
That should motivate interest in how to reduce task startup costs .
There was a lot of research on that too , with many successful designs , that we did not cover in our article .

( NaturalNews ) Proposed updates to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) are prompting many to question whether or not the psychiatric profession itself has gone crazy .
The latest additions to the alleged " mentally ill " could include hoarders , people who get angry every now and again , lazy people , and even those who get outraged over things like sex and violence on television .
Since its first publication back in 1952 , the DSM has grown exponentially larger with each subsequent edition .
Many people are lambasting the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) for trying to establish virtually all behavior as some sort of mental disorder that should be treated with psychiatric drugs .
" For this latest revision they 've set up a special task force to decide if behaviors like bitterness , extreme shopping or overuse of the internet should be included , " explained Professor Christopher Lane to a reporter from the the U.K.'s .
" The science underlying all this is very shaky to non-existent . " Dr. David Kupfer , chairman of the APA 's special task force , has come out in defense of the additions .
He claims that each one is grounded in science , despite the fact that no biological markers can definitely identify any of the additions as actual disorders .
In order to identify things like excessive shopping and extreme laziness as mental disorders , the team will simply call them as such and provide a description of the each one 's symptoms .
If the additions themselves are not loony enough , the APA is actually recommending the inclusion of what it calls " risk syndromes " , or early warning signs thatlead to one of its supposed mental disorders .
By catching these " risk syndromes " early , doctors can begin prescribing medication for conditions that people do not even have .
The entire DSM charade is a ploy to characterize an ever - increasing segment of the population as being " sick " and in need of pharmaceutical drugs .
There can be no variations in personality and individual characteristics ; if a person does not live , think , and react in prescribed fashion , then he or she is sick and in need of treatment , according to the APA .
The latest DSM draft , which is set to be published in 2013 , has already been posted on the internet for public viewing .
Since being posted , there has been widespread outcry against many of the proposed additions .
It remains to be seen what will be included in the final edition and whether or not people will continue to take the DSM and the APA seriously .

The Navy plans to allow women to serve for the first time on submarines , the only class of ship from which they are barred , military and congressional officials said Tuesday .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates notified Congress on Monday that the Navy intended to change its policy .
Congress has 30 working days to object .
Unless the House or Senate moves to block the shift , the policy could go into effect as soon as mid-April .
Allowing women to serve as regular crew members would shatter a gender barrier that has stood since the U.S. submarine force was created in 1900 .
The new policy would allow women to serve in cramped quarters while at sea for months at time , a prospect that for years has managed to forestall consideration of such a change .
But lawmakers are unlikely to challenge the shift , congressional officials said .
Many Republicans , who would be the most likely opponents , are working to preserve the ban on gays serving openly in the military and would probably not expend time and effort on the issue of female service members in submarines .

Rep. Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , said in a statement that the House intended to conduct an assessment of the change “ following its implementation . ”
The Defense Department ’s “ decision to allow women to serve on submarines will present challenges , but these challenges should not be insurmountable for the Navy , ” Skelton said .
In the letter to Congress , Gates said the Navy would begin a “ phased approach ” to allowing women to serve on submarines .
Women will probably be allowed first on larger subs .
Women have been able to serve on the military ’s surface ships since 1993 .
The following year , the Navy cited high costs of accommodating women on submarines as the reason for not allowing them .
Advertisement
However , today ’s fleet includes larger vessels with diverse missions that could more easily accommodate women .
Larger subs have multiple bathrooms , allowing for gender - specific use , and sleeping areas that could be cordoned off for women .
Congressional officials said they had not been given cost estimates for the shift .
The policy change has been pushed by Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former Navy chief of operations .
As the Navy chief , Mullen oversaw research on whether women could be accommodated on subs .
Last fall , while up for a second term as chairman , Mullen told Congress he supported the change .
Few sailors have voiced objections to changing the rule .
Serving on nuclear submarines is considered especially demanding , and the Navy has struggled to attract qualified officers .
Many thought that barring women needlessly reduced the pool of qualified prospects .

On a related issue , top Army officials said Tuesday they might reevaluate combat roles for women .
Women are restricted from serving in infantry units , but belong to units that have regularly been involved in fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ I believe that it ’s time that we take a look at what women are actually doing in Iraq and Afghanistan , and look at our policies , ” said Gen. George W. Casey , the Army chief of staff , appearing before senators .

When some religiously devout people hear a charismatic healer speak the word of god , the regions of their brains involved in skeptical thinking and vigilance appear to shut down .
Uffe Schjødt of Aarhus University in Denmark and his colleagues scanned the brains of Pentecostalists while they listened to recorded prayers from non-Christians , " ordinary " Christians , and a healer .
The brain activity changed only in response to prayers they were told came from the healer .
According to Schjødt , the same deactivation may occur in response to the words of physicians , parents , politicians , and other charismatic leaders .
The researchers published their results in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience .
From New Scientist :
Parts of the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices , which play key roles in vigilance and scepticism when judging the truth and importance of what people say , were deactivated when the subjects listened to a supposed healer .
Activity diminished to a lesser extent when the speaker was supposedly a normal Christian .
Schjødt says that this explains why certain individuals can gain influence over others , and concludes that their ability to do so depends heavily on preconceived notions of their authority and trustworthiness .

Online poker players being penalized for winning .
Is this a blackjack syndrome - " winners will be banned " - or a way for poker networks to control the fish - to - shark ratio ?
Numbers of online poker players have been blocked from their favorite cash games at iPoker skins .
The reason : they were winning players .
Behind this surprising ( and illegal ? ) action from some sites in the iPoker network lies a desperate need to deal with the " rakeback problem " .
The rakeback problem
The financial margins of many online poker rooms have been under attack in the last years , all because of illegal rakeback deals .
Even though the poker networks prohibit rakeback ( Party Poker , PokerStars , Microgaming , Everest Poker , Ongame ) , many skins have continued to offer their players generous rakeback deals under the table .
After all , rakeback is a very effective marketing channel .
Many pros and semi - pro grinders have made a living off this kind of deals .
Anything less generous would imply a big cut in their income .
The problem is that the rakeback reduces the margins for both skins and networks .
This has even made it hard for some of them to survive the harsh times of financial crisis .
Downward spiral of illegal rakeback
Sites that do n't offer illegal rakeback deals have lost their customers to those that do .
Money that could have been spent on regular marketing to attract casual ( losing ) players has been spent on attracting sharks - players who withdraw more than they deposit and thereby shrinks the poker economy .
All in all , the " rakeback problem " has been a real headache for the poker industry .
A couple of months ago , newly started Bodog Network announced a solution to the rakeback problem , a way to calculate rake that rewards the skins in the network for recruiting losing players rather than winners .
" Winning players ... will be worth so little that there is no point competing for them " , says Jonas Ödman at Bodog Network .
" This will create a much better poker economy for all : operators , affiliates and poker players . "
We have n't seen this solution in action yet , as the network is still under construction , but what 's been happening over at iPoker might just be a way of following the lead of Bodog Network .
" We will not block winning players "
But whatever lies hidden in the new Bodog formula , blocking individual players from playing is n't part of it according to Bodog Network CEO , Patrik Selin :
" The operators that appear to be trying to copy our model have missed the point .
We will not be blocking winning players from our network - in fact we will be very attractive to them and will welcome them with open arms . "
Reduced rake an alternative solution
We 'll see what comes out of all this .
But at Poker Junkie we feel that one way to attract casual players would be to decrease the rake at lower stakes .
In this way , bad players would last longer , have more fun , be less frustrated and in the long run lose all their money to the poker economy anyway .
Exposing new players to the most brutal rake cannot be the best way to make casual players stay in the fish tank .

PS Also , if you manage to bring in only losing players to the network - who will they lose to ?

It 's 7:30 pm and I 'm sitting nervously at a Lower East Side bar , waiting for my wife to show up so we can head to dinner .
I 'm gulping my IPA , hoping the bitter hops will cover up the salty aroma of deceit and disloyalty that lingers on my breath .
Of course , I have no appetite , but I 'll order my food and eat with relish to throw her off the trail .
She arrives and I quickly push a pre-ordered beer towards her , hoping it'll obfuscate her powers of detection , which — to her credit and my frustration — are formidable .
What did I do today , she asks .
" Nothing much .
The usual .
Writing , bath , writing while bathing , the occasional cat stroke .
You know . "
Her eyes darken with a flash of suspicion .
Does she know ?
I hold my breath as she leans in to give me a quick kiss , knowing full well that it 's just a test .
A quick biological breathalyzer hidden within a loving gesture .
The slightest exhale will give me away .
Too late .
She 's caught a whiff of that unmistakable perfume — she knows .
The gig is up .
I look towards the ground , prepared to take full responsibility for what I 've done , for my repeated indiscretions .
" Were you cooking burgers again ? "
I love my wife , but burgers are my mistress .
Life Under Ground
I 've calculated it , and in the past two - and - a - half years , I 've cooked well over 1,100 burgers .
That 's an average of 1.2 burgers a day .
Fat burgers , thin burgers .
Burgers stuffed with burger juice .
Smashed burgers .
Sliders .
Fancy - pants burgers .
Cheese - stuffed burgers .
Burgers that rip off other burgers .
It got to the point where my wife forced us to move apartments because the smell of burgers permeated the walls , the sofa , the furniture ( OK , more space and lower rent probably also factored into our move ) .
She simply can't stomach them anymore .
I 've promised repeatedly not to cook them until she 's gone for at least a day .
I 've promised to brush my teeth and shower before meeting her to get rid of the lingering odor of sizzling ground meat .
For a little while I was doing well .
Until I discovered her .
The one burger that I can't resist .
I 'm a sucker for crisp , brown , salty crust , and up until recently , I thought the burger at the Shake Shack was about as crispety - crunchety as they come — but then I discovered this one .
It was n't an organized discovery like most of my recipes are .
It was a happy coincidence of inspiration , circumstance , and sizzling beef fat .
It was instant , powerful , and unshakable infatuation at first bite .
Today , I 'm going to share the recipe and technique with you .
This is the ultimate burger for single men .
It 's not a big , fat backyard behemoth whose real goal is to prove your manhood to fellow backyard grillers .
It 's more like a thin , small ( four ounces ) , classic diner - style burger on crack .
Do n't cook it for company ( the recipe only works for one burger at a time anyway ) .
Do n't cook it unless you are prepared to have your apartment smelling like a burger joint for days .
Do n't cook it if you want anything less than the crispiest , beefiest , saltiest , greasiest , gooiest burger experience you 've ever had .
This is a burger can make you , like me , break your vows .
The Grind
Like most of my favorite burgers , the grind here is of utmost importance .
For the ultimate experience , go with the oxtail and brisket - enhanced Blue Label Burger Blend .
When feeling lazy , I sometimes use 100 % short rib or 100 % well - marbled ground chuck , but having at least 25 % fat content is essential , for reasons that will soon become apparent .
Forming the patties is the most crucial step in the whole process .
Using a thoroughly - chilled meat grinder or food processor and cubes of beef that have been placed in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to grinding , grind the meat directly onto a parchment paper or foil - lined baking sheet .
Then — and this is key — form the beef into four - ounce patties without picking it up .
That 's right .
Just push the beef together until it forms ragged piles that barely cling together .
Why would you want to do a thing like that ?
Well , it 's got to do with the structure of meat .
When ground , beef proteins are very sticky — particularly to each other .
Given the chance , they 'll cling to each other like Japanese school girls to Hello Kitty bento boxes , and the more you work them , the tighter they cling .
Take a look at the photo below :
The burger on the left was formed by gently coaxing the meat into a pile .
The patty on the right was formed by lifting the meat in my hands and gently shaping it into a patty .
As gently as I could , really .
Despite the gentle touch , the difference is readily apparent .
The goal here is to keep the meat as loose as possible .
This offers a myriad of benefits , which will make themselves clearer as we work our way through the technique .
Salt and pepper the patties generously on one side , then carefully flip with a wide spatula ( remember , do n't ever pick up the patties with your bare hands ! ) , and season the second side before slipping it ( via a spatula ) into a ripping - hot small skillet .
N.B . This is the main reason that this recipe absolutely cannot be made with store - bought ground beef .
Store - bought ground beef is ground too finely and already pressed together before you take it out of the package .
You 've shot yourself in the foot before you 've even started .
Burgers and Fractals
Have you ever seen that neat trick with Mandelbrot fractals ?
The one where you look at a coastline from far away and measure it , which gives you a certain perimeter .
As you zoom closer and closer , you realize there are tiny inlets or curves in the beach that were n't visible from far away .
When measured again , these bumps actually add length to the total perimeter .
This is a phenomenon known as the Richardson Effect , and basically states that the more precisely you measure a coastline , the longer the measurement gets .
And the more bumpy or irregular the surface is , the more this effect is pronounced .
Well , the same applies to hamburgers .
While at first it may seem the two burgers above have the exact same mass , pretty much the same volume , and must therefore have the same surface area , because of the highly bumpy and irregular surface of the loose - packed patty , it 's surface area is actually much much greater than the hand - formed patty .
But there 's a problem !
In order to brown and crisp properly , those raged bits need to be exposed to temperatures well in excess of 400 °F .
And what 's more , they need to be evenly exposed to that heat , lest the outermost raged edges burn before the rest can follow suit .
On a normal griddle or large saute pan , this is an impossible task .
The rendering beef fat leaks out of the patties and drains away .
Only the bits in direct contact with the surface will crisp up properly .
That 's why smashed - style burger joints like the Shake Shack do what they do :
Even though smashing the bottom of the patty into a flat plane reduces surface area for crisping , they need to do it in order maximize griddle contact .
At home , we fortunately have more options .
One of the side effects of cooking burgers for myself is that I often want to cook just one , so I whip out the small , eight - inch skillet .
It was a happy discovery one day when I noticed that when cooking a burger with a high fat content , a good 1/8th to 1/ 4 inch of rendered beef fat collects at the bottom of the pan , essentially deep - frying the entire lower half of the patty in its own fat .
Couple this with the super - loosely - packed ground beef , and you 've got prime breeding grounds for crispy , crunchy , deep brown beef bits — the best parts of the burger .
The Cheese and the Bun
Classic yellow American is the way to go here .
It 's custom - made for dripping and oozing into the nooks and crannies formed by this patty .
Even before the burger comes out of the pan , you can see the magic of the cheese at work :
Like liquid hot magma , it finds every possible crack and crevice in the burger 's surface , coating it in a layer of gooey , salty cheesiness .
As for the bun , you can go with a Martin 's potato roll , but in this case I actually prefer the innocuous squishiness of a regular soft white burger bun from Arnold .
Pickles and onions are fine but completely unnecessary .
Skip the ketchup , mustard , or mayo entirely .
With beef this crispy and beefy , you do n't need anything to get in the way of the flavor .
Final Analysis
Just to drive home the point about loosely packing the meat , take a look at this cross-section comparison :
The burger on the bottom was hand - pattied before cooking , and is by no means bad .
The meat is cooked well with a little hint of pink , has plenty of fat and flavor ( the meat blend ensures that ) , and the balance of meat - to - bun - to - bread is good .
The only problem ?
The meat has a smooth surface .
It 's brown , all right , but there 's not too much of it .
You can tell by the way the cheese forms a single solid sheet , even though it 's fully melted .
This burger on the top was formed and cooked by the surely - patentable method outlined in this article , and has subsequently reaped the benefits .
Its loose texture retains juices better ( even at medium - well to well done it 's insanely , chin- drippingly juicy ) , it 's got far more surface area for browning , and as you can tell , it 's got plenty of nooks and crannies brimming with melted cheese and juices .
Here 's a closeup of that action :
Surely , kind readers , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , you can understand and even forgive my disloyalty when faced with such a siren song of irresistible beauty ?
I 'd like to apologize once again to my lovely wife .
There will never be another woman in my life ( unless you invite her in yourself ) , but I will always have a mistress .
A mistress named burger .
What man could withstand her hypnotic wiles ?

The stakes are high for Californians when it comes to the health care overhaul , mainly because the coverage problems in this vast state are so large .
With a new UCLA study estimating that more than 8 million Californians , or nearly 25 percent of the population , lack health coverage , many health experts say California will be impacted more than other states by the reform legislation .
" When this is fully implemented in 2014 or beyond , we will see some two - thirds or more ( of the uninsured ) getting coverage and , with that , better access to care and more affordable coverage , " said Marian Mulkey , senior program officer for the California HealthCare Foundation , an independent philanthropy group based in Oakland .
But not everyone will benefit .
Medicare beneficiaries who have certain types of policies may experience disruptions and high - income earners will pay more in taxes .
And California will still be left with a large number of uninsured , including illegal immigrants , who either do n't qualify for the reforms or are exempted from them .
A last - minute change proposed in the health care bill would benefit Kaiser Permanente , based in Oakland , which covers more than 6 million Californians , and other large nonprofit health insurers .
Under the change , tax - exempt insurers would have to pay a new fee levied on insurers , but on only half of their premiums .
With key congressional leaders supporting the plan , California played an important role in moving it forward .
The state also helped reignite the stalled debate over the legislation after many of Anthem Blue Cross ' 800,000 California policyholders were hit with premium increases of as high as 39 percent .
Rate , cap rules
President Obama seized on the rate increases - which affected individual policyholders who buy coverage on their own rather than receiving it through an employer - in a bid to highlight the less savory practices of the health insurance industry .
The final package does not include the president 's proposal to provide federal oversight for unreasonable rate increases .
But it does contain a number of changes that will affect a state like California , where the market for individual health insurance operates largely unfettered by rules .
The legislation immediately forbids insurers from placing lifetime caps on how much they will spend on their members , and it prohibits insurers from unfairly canceling coverage .
In 2014 , when the mandate for Americans to have insurance goes into effect , insurers will be prohibited from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions .
For Medicare beneficiaries in California , the biggest changes will likely affect those in Medicare Advantage policies .
People with Medicare Advantage plans receive medical and other health benefits through private insurance , typically in the form of a managed care plan .
The health legislation is designed to reduce federal payments to Medicare Advantage plans , which the government has been overpaying by about 14 percent compared to traditional Medicare in an effort to steer more beneficiaries into private insurance .
Medicare Advantage cuts
A proposal accompanying a package of legislative fixes taken up by the House on Sunday would deepen planned cuts to Medicare Advantage - from $ 118 billion to $ 132 billion over 10 years .
With the reduction in payments , many health experts say insurers will probably increase premiums , reduce benefits or possibly drop out of the Medicare Advantage program .
" You 're just going to throw seniors out of Medicare Advantage and throw them onto traditional Medicare , " said John Graham , director of health care studies for the Pacific Research Institute , a free - market think tank based in San Francisco .
This will affect California more relative to other states because a greater percentage of Medicare recipients here - 34 percent compared to the national average of 22 percent , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation - have opted for Medicare Advantage policies .
That 's because of state residents ' long history and familiarity with health maintenance organizations , or HMOs , and other types of managed care .
A significant portion of California 's uninsured population will remain uncovered after the law goes into effect .
" We have a higher share of immigrants among the uninsured , and immigrants are not going be helped by this bill , particularly the undocumented who are not going to be allowed to buy into the purchasing pool , " said William Dow , associate professor of health economics at UC Berkeley .
He was referring to insurance marketplaces , called exchanges , that the law creates for people to buy health coverage - giving them potential economy - of - scale benefits .
The legislation prevents illegal immigrants from receiving federal subsidies to buy coverage , and goes a step further by prohibiting them from using their own money to purchase a policy from the exchange .
Benefits for Medi-Cal
Supporters of the overhaul said the state has a lot to be pleased about .
The legislation , for example , increases Medi-Cal payments for doctors and pays almost all of the costs for newly eligible Medi-Cal recipients through 2016 .
" California has traditionally gotten less of our fair share of federal funds , " said Anthony Wright , executive director of California Health Access .
" It 's not everything the state of California wanted , but it is an improvement .
At the end of the day , this is a bargain not a burden for the state of California . "
Traditionally , ever since the song Daisy Bell entered the public consciousness in the late - 1800s with its famous line , " But you 'd look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two " , the tandem bicycle has , amongst most , enjoyed a reputation as a romantic mode of transport .
Such is its charm , the tandem bicycle is even a great foundation for a unique date : who can argue with a couple - powered ride down leafy country roads to a secluded picnic site ?
However , the brains behind the following , bizarre examples of said pedal - driven vehicle clearly were n't looking to further that reputation .
Behold , the strangest , most dangerous , funniest , unromantic tandem bicycles ever created :
1. The Sociable
Image Source
Okay , so the sociable is n't technically a tandem bicycle as the seats are situated side - by - side rather than one - behind - the - other , but it 's a bicycle made for two nonetheless .
Presumably , balancing on such a bicycle is no easy feat , particularly if its riders are of wildly varying weights .
Below is a not -very graceful video of a sociable in action .
2. Tandem Unicycle
Image Source
In combining two vehicles - the tandem and the unicycle , both of which are already difficult to ride - the creator of the tandem unicyle has in effect given birth to what I can only assume is a mode of transport which is nearly impossible to control at all , let alone romantically with a loved one .
An attempt by its inventor to ride the thing can be watched below .
3. SeeSaw
Image Source
The mind boggles when attempting to come to terms with the design of the SeeSaw Bike .
As if riding a tandem bike face - to - face with your partner was n't off - putting enough , with the SeeSaw both of you are sitting at different angles .
Guaranteed carnage .
Unfortunately no video of the bike in action could be found ; maybe because such a thing is impossible , but hopefully not .
4. Back - 2- Back
Image Source
If you 've ever had to sit the wrong way round on a moving train , you 'll know just how odd and sometimes sickening that feeling is ; so imagine just how stomach - churning it must be to ride reverse on a back - to - back tandem bicycle .
The example in the photo above goes by the name of a ' Bi - Cycle ' , whilst the video below shows a different back - to - back tandem in action , and at quite a speed .
5. Face -2-Face
Image Source
Built in 2008 , Chen Yugang 's bizarre but technically impressive transforming tandem bicycle has the best / worst of all three worlds , in that you have the option of riding conventionally , face - to - face or back - to - back .
Due to its clever design , the bike 's frame can be shifted around to accomodate either set - up .

What do you get for a doctor that wants to help their patients and look trendy while doing it ?
How about an iPad.
Administrators at the Kaweah Delta Medical Center in Visalia , California have ordered 100 of the new Apple tablet computers to give their personnel the latest in digital accessibility , according to PCWorld .
The Citrix Receiver Application lets doctors run a virtual office through the iPad , giving them access to a patient ’s records and vital information as well as standard emails and office documents .
While still in the preliminary stages of releasing the devices for use in their facilities , the Kaweah staff already see distinct advantages over laptops and other touchscreen devices , none of which has the iPad ’s 10 hour battery life or its $ 500 price tag .
Could the iPad become the Doctor ’s pad of the future ?
Take a look at the Citrix App in the video below to see what the system can do .
Citrix is just one of the companies aiming at building synergy between Apple and health care .
AirStrip Technologies is developing a suite of applications that will let a doctor track patient vitals on their iPhone .
Similar software exists for Citrix , which also has developed a system for porting information easily from desktop to laptop to smart phone to iPad .
Either of these competing solutions ( and there are others as well ) may enable a doctor to easily track , update , and even diagnose patients all through a tablet computer they carry with them .
The experiment in Visalia is just now starting up .
Only three iPads have actually arrived , though individual doctors have purchased their own , and the rest will be rolled out in the next two months .
A related program with iPhones ( about 20 ) was launched a little earlier in April .
Why all this iFervor ?
I think it ’s much more of a digital than Apple revolution .
There is a cornucopia of new digital devices looking to augment the medical professional on the go .
A hand held ultrasound device from GE was recently unveiled , we ’ve seen stethoscopes with iPhone Apps , and there ’s even a hand held DNA tester coming soon .
Along with new databases of patients digital medical records , these devices give doctors real advantages in the field .
Of course hospital administrators and staff alike are going to want to use them .
Tablet computers could serve as a hub for this new cross roads of hand held data and system wide digital records .
Eventually , we may even see all the hardware be adapted to be included in the iPad itself .
There ’s no question that a lightweight , well connected , touchscreen tablet computer is going to be in high demand by doctors and nurses everywhere .
But will that computer be an iPad ?
Well it ’s certainly the front runner for now .
As long as its battery life , third party development , and relatively low costs are unmatched it ’s likely to stay in the lead .
So 100 points for Apple … does anybody actually know what the score is ?

Fake crops on Farmville - the " free " social game that 's become a huge hit on Facebook - cost a British mother some real cash after her 12 - year - old son racked up $ 1,400 in charges on the game .
The Guardian reports that the pre-teen needed only about two weeks to empty his own savings account then start using his mom 's credit card .
" When I asked him why he did it he said that they had brought out ' good stuff that I wanted , ' " the mother , who asked not to be named , told the newspaper .
Farmville , which last month reported having more than 75 million monthly players , is free to play .
But players can spend money on extras , like virtual crops , tools and barns .
Zynga , the company behind Farmville , Mafia Wars and other popular social games , says the games are designed to appeal to a wide cross-section of players , not just the typical young , male video game crowd .
The mother said the son's bills came to 905 British pounds - the equivalent of $ 1,373 .
The British mother , whose hometown was not listed in the story , said she does n't blame Zynga , Facebook or her credit card company , although she tried to get the money back .
But she said she wished there was extra security to prevent such spending .
" I do think they need to shoulder some responsibility in this business and put systems in place to stop this happening again , " she told The Guardian .
" The fact that he was using a card in a different name should bring up some sort of security and the online secure payment filter seems to be bypassed for Facebook payments . "
She said her son was unable to make mobile phone payments - because his older brother had lost credit buying a ringtone a couple of years earlier .
" We sound terribly technologically unaware do n't we ? " she said .

Girl , 14 , accused of murdering ' sex attacker ' days after charges against him were dropped
Robert Daley , 45 , was stabbed several times in the chest and was found in a pool of blood in the doorway of his flat in Stockwell , south London
A girl of 14 has been charged over the suspected ' vigilante ' murder of a man she had accused of a sex assault .
Robert Daley , 45 , was stabbed to death just days after the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him over an alleged attack on the teenager .
Neighbours found him sprawled in a pool of blood in the doorway of his flat in south London on Friday evening .
He was able to give his first name to police and paramedics , but died minutes later .
Police arrested an 18 - year - old man over the murder on Saturday before detaining the 14 - year - old girl late on Sunday .
She was still being held last night .
Sources confirmed that the female suspect is the same girl who had previously accused Daley of raping her .
Her allegations prompted an investigation by a Metropolitan Police child protection team but the CPS , which examined an evidence file , concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge him over the alleged attack .
The decision is said to have infuriated the girl , who insisted she was telling the truth and wanted him to face court .
Last night a neighbour of the victim described the horrifying moment when he saw Daley close to death .
Barry Boreland , who lived next door in the block of flats in Brixton , South London , said : ' The door was open and I saw lying on his back in the landing , his head furthest from the door .
' His legs were flopped out and there was blood everywhere .
He was still conscious and managed to tell the police his first name .
' His girlfriend was there and gave his surname .
It was a shocking sight and very upsetting .
' He was a decent neighbour who had never caused us any problems . '
Other friends were astonished to discover that he had been accused of rape .
Mr Daley , who is believed to have a daughter from a previous relationship , had worked as builder and plasterer , but had not been employed for several years because he suffered from epilepsy .
Nicholas Walker , who had known him for ten years from the popular Duke of Edinburgh pub near his home , described him as a ' gentle giant . '
He said : ' Robert was a quiet , polite man .
He is the last person I would ever thought that something like this would happen to .
' He never caused trouble .
I saw him riding his mountain bike near his home a couple of hours before his death and he did n't look like he had a care in the world .
It is all a terrible shock . '
Another friend , David Eden , 55 , said : ' He was a bit of a ladies man .
He and a friend would go to nightclubs together and fancied themselves a bit with women .
' But there was nothing malicious or nasty about him .
He was very genuine and good natured .
I can't believe there was anything in the allegations .
It was n't like him at all . '
The CPS confirmed that Mr Daley was investigated over rape allegations but a decision not to prosecute him because of insufficient evidence was made on April 13 .
A post -mortem examination held on Saturday ( 24 April ) gave cause of death as resulting from stab wounds to the chest .
Scotland Yard confirmed a teenage girl had been arrested in connection with the attack .
An 18 - year - old man who was initially arrested in connection with the death has bailed to return in May .

A link between low solar activity and jet streams over the Atlantic could explain why , despite global warming trends , people in regions North East of the Atlantic Ocean might need to brace themselves for more frequent cold winters in years to come .
A new report published today , Thursday 15 April , in IOP Publishing 's Environmental Research Letters describes how we are moving into an era of lower solar activity which is likely to result in UK winter temperatures more like those seen at the end of the seventeenth century .
Lead author Mike Lockwood of the University of Reading said : " This year 's winter in the UK has been the 14th coldest in the last 160 years and yet the global average temperature for the same period has been the 5th highest .
We have discovered that this kind of anomaly is significantly more common when solar activity is low . "
The new paper , ' Are cold winters in Europe associated with low solar activity ? ' , differs from previous efforts to explain the UK 's recent cold winters by comparing the most comprehensive , but regionally specific , temperature dataset available ( the Central England Temperature dataset ) to the long - term behaviour of the Sun 's magnetic field , and to trends across the entire Northern Hemisphere .
The paper is being published now as the researchers have just had the opportunity to put this year 's data to the test and found that this year 's results fit well with the trends they have discovered .
The researchers suggest that the anomaly in Northern Europe 's winter temperatures could be to do with a phenomenon called ' blocking ' .
' Blocking ' is related to the jet stream which brings winds from the west , over the Atlantic , and into Northern Europe but , over the past couple of winters , could have lost its way , for weeks at a time , in an ' anticyclone ' before it reaches Europe .
The researchers have found strong correlations between weak solar activity and the occurrences of ' blocking ' .
As the temperature is affected by a weak Sun so the wind 's patterns also change and , as the warmer westerly winds fail to arrive , the UK is hit by north - easterlies from the Arctic .
The researchers , from the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading , the Science and Technology Facilities Council Space Science and Technology Department , and the Max - Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Katlenburg - Lindau , Germany , are keen to stress the regional and seasonal ( European and winter ) nature of their research .
Professor Mike Lockwood has explained that the trends do not guarantee colder winters but they do suggest that colder winters will become more frequent .
He said : " If we look at the last period of very low solar activity at the end of the seventeenth century , we find the coldest winter on record in 1684 but , for example , the very next year , when solar activity was still low , saw the third warmest winter in the entire 350 - year record .
" The results do show however that there are a greater number of cold UK winters when solar activity is low . "

The ANZ Bank says it is " completely shocked " by a police investigation into an alleged drug trafficking network operating out of its Melbourne offices .
Australian Federal Police have launched a probe into the alleged narcotics syndicate running out of the bank ’s debt collection department .
Fourteen staff who worked in the bank ’s former city offices in Collins Street , and later when the department moved to Dorcas Street in South Melbourne , have reportedly been linked to the alleged syndicate .
ANZ spokesman Stephen Ries said a number of staff linked to the investigation had left the bank " some time ago " , but he would not elaborate on why they had left , or if they had been sacked .
" We have been completely shocked by this matter and everyone at ANZ is incredibly disappointed at the matters the police are looking into , " he said .

Among the smaller companies , Tomkins bounced 4.3 to 232.8 p following a strong trading update .
The company reported double - digit margin growth in the first quarter .
That was well ahead of Collins Stewart 's 8.8 pc forecast for the first half and 6.6 pc in 2009 .
Analysts at Collins Stewart said the shares are the cheapest in the sector and if they get to 290 p , the company could move into the FTSE 100 index .
" Normally inclusion in the FTSE 100 would n't have a significant impact on the shares , but with Tomkins still relatively under owned in the UK and many investors still struggling to even remember what Tomkins does , it could be a bigger driver than normal , " said Mark Wilson , an analyst at Collins Stewart .
Gone in 28 seconds : Rapid - fire sniper takes out five Taliban soldiers from more than a mile away to save British patrol
Feat of arms :
The Corporal , his face obscured , and his L115A3 rifle
A British sniper shot dead five Taliban gunmen in just 28 seconds to save the lives of comrades walking into an ambush .
The marksman felled the rebels from more than a mile away as they prepared to attack troops on foot patrol in Afghanistan .
The corporal - whose identity cannot be revealed for security reasons - has killed a record 37 enemy fighters during a four - month tour of duty .
But his most remarkable feat of arms came when he and the spotter who accompanies him saw the group of armed Taliban .
They were taking up positions to fire on a patrol that included the platoon commander in Helmand Province .
Hiding in an old fort , the sniper prepared his British - built L115A3 Long Range Rifle .
The firearm , which fires 8.59 mm bullets at three times the speed of sound and uses a state - of - the - art telescopic sight , is so effective that it has been nicknamed The Silent Assassin .
Requesting permission to shoot - needed because the British had not yet been attacked - the corporal made sure the rebel leader was in the crosshairs of his sights .
He would have had to make precise calculations in a split - second on wind speed and other weather conditions to compensate for the drift of the rounds in flight .
Moments later his commander gave him the go - ahead to fire and in less than half a minute the five Taliban gunmen lay dead .
He said : ' They gave me the " weapons free " .
I engaged with the first insurgent .
It took me nine rounds but I took him down with the ninth .
' Then the other four had moved closer , so I took them down as well . '
The sharp - shooter , a father of one who has been a sniper for nine years and serves with 4th Battalion The Rifles , added : ' My job is about taking care of the boys .
It is not about how many you kill , it 's about the team . '
Former SAS commander Andy McNab said : ' To bring down five targets in less than 30 seconds is a real achievement .
When shot at , humans react just like animals .
There are a couple of seconds where they will freeze , then they hit the ground or run .
' In this case the sniper would have had to hit , and kill , a moving target at a considerable distance . '
The corporal 's achievement in June last year in the Nad'e Ali district of Helmand , was revealed after the Mail told of how fellow sniper Craig Harrison broke all military records by killing two Taliban machine gunners from more than a mile and a half away .

Okay , let ’s get started with the savings …
104 Ways to Save Money
1. Get a Piggy Bank – Put up a piggy bank at your home .
This creates a visual reminder to capture those little handfuls of change you come home with .
At the end of the year , you ’ll have a nice little savings fund for a fun purchase , or even to fund a real savings account .
2. Use Open Source Software – Utilize free , open - source software like OpenOffice ( like MS Office ) and Firefox Internet browser .
3. Get Cash Back for Your Online Purchases – Use a website like Rakuten.com ( Formerly Ebates ) to shop online .
They will give you a percentage back on the money you spend online at hundreds of popular stores .
Combine that with one of the best cash back credit cards and you ’ll really be saving money .
Use Wikibuy to find the best prices on your online purchases , thus saving you money before you spend it .
4. Use CFL Bulbs – Compact fluorescent lamps ( CFLs ) cost more on the front - end , but they will save you money and energy in the long - run .
5. Combine Coupons with Local Sales – Save up coupons and use them in conjunction with sales at local markets .
You can end up with items either being free or at a greatly discounted price .
6. Drive Your Car Until it Dies –
No car payments or big cash outlays .
Lower car insurance .
Plus , you get the satisfaction of knowing you used this depreciating asset to it ’s fullest potential .
7. DIY Greeting Cards – Design and print your own greeting cards .
You can design and print a greeting card for around .50 / card , which is a good price compared to $ 3.99 cards .
8. Use Cash for Better Negotiations – Larger ticket items definitely benefit from you waving around cash .
You ’re able to negotiate great deals when they see you ’re a serious buyer .
My wife was able to knock $ 200 of her recent road bike purchase by showing the money and asking .
9. Consider the Reviews –
Do your research before you buy an expensive item ( or even a not so expensive item ) .
Check reviews on Amazon ( i.e. Amazon Kindle Reviews ) , look up reviews online , check a few forums , look up prices at different stores … you can easily save money and you might even find out the item you thought you wanted is n’t so great .
10 . Get Store Refunds – Paribus is a free service that can save you money on your online purchases even after you shop !

11 . Consider a Movie Subscription Service –
If you currently spend a lot of money on entertainment at the theater or at the movie rental store from month to month , consider saving time , gas , and money by subscribing to an online movie service like Netflix .
12 . Clip Coupons –
Find the best coupons in the Sunday paper every week for grocery and other household items .
13 . Monthly Spending Review – Write down all the expenses you make in a month .
Review the list and try to eliminate unnecessary expenditures .
Consider using a budgeting tool like You Need a Budget to take your review efforts to a new level .
14 . Avoid Financing at All Costs – Delaying instant gratification by saving for purchases before buying will hone patience and aid in bringing wealth and peace of mind to all who are exercised thereby .
This element of self - discipline may be one of the oldest , simplest , and most base elements of financial success … but regrettably , it has also become a lost art in our common culture .
Avoid financing and save for things before you buy them .
Period .
15 . No Restaurant Challenge –
Take a week out of the month , or better yet , a month out of the year and commit to dining inside your home only .
No dining out .
See how much you can save by following this .
16 . Do Free Activities –
This is one of my favorite ways to save money .
Find free stuff to do .
For example on Sunday mornings go to a big bookstore and read books in the store without having to pay for them .
17 . Keep Larger Bills – Never break down your large bills .
You ’ll be less likely to spend it .
Smaller bills get spent quicker .
18 . No Second Thoughts –
Only buy things that you really need .
Avoid buying things that you have second thoughts about or are n’t sure you ’ll need .
19 . Dine Out for Special Occasions Only – Only dine out for special occasions .
You could get a week ’s worth of food at the grocery store for the same amount that you pay for a single dinner out for one person .
When you do dine out , use a coupon from Restaurant.com or only go on holidays like Veterans Day or Memorial day where servicemembers usually eat for free .
20 . Consider Quality – Buy things of high quality even if it costs a bit more up front .
Look back at all of the things you skimped on over the years and ended up having to replace earlier than you expected .
Suddenly that big sale or off - brand item does n’t seem like such a good idea .
This does n’t mean everything that is more expensive is better , but use your smarts and know when to spend to find the best bang for your buck instead of looking for the absolute lowest price on something .
“ You get what you pay for ” still holds true for many things .
21 . No Credit Cards –
Cut up the credit cards and live only on what you make .
No interest .
No late fees .
No problems .
If you currently struggle with credit card debt , consider a tool like the Pay Off Debt app to help you .
22 . Pack Your Lunch – Do n’t go out for lunch everyday ; pack lunch instead .
This can easily save you $ 50 a week .
23 . Do n’t Pay for Your Kids –
If you do dine out during the week , make sure you visit one of the many places that offer “ kids eat free ” specials .
At least you wo n’t be paying for their meals .
24 . Do n’t Forget to Ask – Ask for a discount .
We always ask about discounts and have found that many places we would n’t have thought of give unadvertised discounts .
For example , our preschool offered a discount to pay in full .
And our plumber gave us a discount when we asked .
As it turns out , many things are negotiable if you ask !
25 . Savings Goal Reminder – Carry a list in your wallet of financial goals that you will see every time you take it out to buy something .
Create online savings goals with SmartyPig .
26 . Shopping Plan of Attack – Look at all the sale ads before you grocery shop and go to the store with the most sales .
Write down a list before I go to any store and it saves you from buying unnecessary items .
27 . Vacation During No Child Care Days –
Plan your vacation days on the days your children have half days of school or teacher in - service days .
It yields more time with kids and lower child care costs .
28 . Quit Your Bad Habits –
Be they eating out , smoking , or going out partying .
Every time you stop yourself from doing it , put the money you would have spent into your savings .
29 . Meat Alternative – Meat is generally the most expensive source of protein .
Beans and nuts are pound for pound far more nutritious for your protein dollar , and better for you too .
If you ca n’t stomach the idea of giving up beef , consider ordering your beef online through OmahaSteaks.com
30 . Daily Spending Goal –
Set a daily goal for yourself : how much money you ’re going to spend during the day .
31 . Deal of the Day Sites – Groupon.com .
This is a fantastic site to get some great group deals from local businesses .
The only thing to watch out for is the “ I do n’t really need that but it ’s such a great deal ” syndrome .
32 . Online First , In - store Second –
One of the smartest ways to save money is to always do comparison shopping online before going to stores .
Consider using Wikibuy to save you money before you spend by helping you find lower prices .
This will allow you to find the best deal without wasting time and gas driving around town .
33 . Consider a Stay - Cation –
No need for a big expensive vacation .
Take a week off of work and simply do a bunch of activities in your own hometown .
Skip the hotel and airfare costs and spend more money on entertainment and dining out for the week .
34 . Wash Your Own Work Clothes –
If you need a lot of professional clothes for work , buy the generic equivalent of Woolite and wash your work clothes with it instead of regular harsh detergents .
It costs a bit more initially for the detergent but saves your clothes from fading , thinning , or frizzing , so I can wear them a lot longer and not have to buy new things .
Also , use Dryel instead of dry cleaning my clothes as much as possible .
35 . Do it Right the First Time – If you are working on a car repair or home improvement , consider doing it right the first time .
If you try and cut corners it will likely end up costing you more money in the long run .
36 . Early to Bed , More in the Bank – Go to bed earlier .
Saves light , heat ( in the winter ) and late night nibbles .
37 . Create a Savings Category on the Budget – Make saving part of your budget and set saving goals .
If you monitor your progress toward a goal you are much more likely to succeed in hitting that goal than if you just hoped to save money some day .
Monitoring anything makes you more aware of it .
Gain more awareness of your goals and progress with You Need a Budget
38 . Utilize Free Online Services – Dump the monthly subscriptions ( use a free service like Trim to do this for you ) and read newspapers and magazines online .
Or at least get your magazines for free online using one of the many free offers .
39 . Be Purposely Low in Cash –
Do not take a lot of money with you when you go out , so even if you have the temptation to buy something you will not , if its really that important you will surely go back home to get the money .
If it ’s not , then you just saved yourself from spending money .
40 . Reduce Your Medical Bills –
If you have a hospital bill , just call up the billing department and ask if you can get a discount for paying cash , or if you can pay a lower amount .
Often they ’ll be happy that they ’re just collecting a bill , and are willing to cut 10 - 20 % off your amount .
We saved several hundred by doing this after my wife was hospitalized last year .
If you want to save big on health care , consider a high - deductible health insurance plan .
41 . Lower Your Interest Rates – Call your bank and / or credit card company to negotiate a better interest rate on your loan or outstanding debt .
This can save you hundreds in interest payments .
42 . Do n’t Pay for Your Credit Report – Instead , visit AnnualCreditReport.com and get your truly free credit report .
Get your credit score from the source at MyFICO.com .
Or check out Experian Boost to get your report and a little boost to your score .
43 . Kill the Energy Vampire – Connect all of your appliances to surge protectors and shut the switch off when you are finished using them .
Most of today ’s appliances constantly use electricity when plugged into the outlet .
44 . Cut the Cable TV – Removing unnecessary or extra expenses like this is one of the easiest ways to save money .
Move all your TV watching to online services like Hulu.com .
It ’s free and has fewer commercials .
45 . Pay Yourself First –
Put money in your saving account every paycheck .
Make it the first thing you do and then pay all bill with your remaining funds .
46 . Cancel Your Home Phone Line – Not using your home phone as much ?
Consider going to your cell phone for most of your calls .
Install Skype on your computer for making computer to computer calls or cheap long distance calls .
Video is better than voice anyway .
47 . Work Out and Exercise at Home – Skip the monthly gym membership and start working out at home or in your neighborhood .
Run or walk around the block .
Rent workout DVDs from the library to do at home in front of your own TV .
48 . Fuel Efficient Auto –
If you travel a great deal during the week , consider a high fuel - efficient , hybrid , or electric vehicle to save on rising gas prices .
49 . Read the Fine Print – Do a thorough review of all your monthly bills .
Study the fine print to see exactly what you are being charged for .
Cut out any charges for services you are n’t using .
50 . The Savings Trade - Off – Think about saving money in terms of trade - offs – save money here , spend it there .
If you ’re planning on a vacation this year , keep that in mind as you are looking to save money elsewhere .
It ’ll give you a sense of accomplishment as you save more towards a particular goal and will motivate you to be more creative .
51 . Bring Lunch for Errands –
When running errands around town , pack a lunch instead of eating out .
This is a healthier alternative that saves you time and money while watching your waistline .
52 . Do-it - Yourself Home Repair and Improvement – Most basic home repairs you can do yourself if you take some time to study the manual or look online for video tutorials .
And basic improvements , like painting , can easily be done cheaper if you use your own labor .
53 . Stretch Your Coffee Beans – Use half of your used coffee beans in the next batch .
Repeat this cycle and you ’ll only use half the recommended scoop each time .
Some coffee drinkers swear by this method .
See more coffee related tips in my ultimate guide to saving money on coffee .
54 . Go on a Spend - Free Splurge – Commit to a week without spending new money .
Make it a goal to only spend money for the week that you earn from selling old stuff or making returns .
55 . Separate Your Savings –
Set up a separate bank account with a bank other than your main bank .
Deposit extra money in the account whenever possible .
This will create a nice barrier between you and your savings .
Of all of the ways to save money , this is probably my favorite .
56 . Start a Dinner Club –
If you miss the social element of dining with friends , start having each other over to your houses and cook for each other .
Similarly to eating at home , you can save money by making your own meals instead of buying pre-prepared meals .
57 . Talk Yourself
Out of It – Install a dialog in your head that uses the following questions : “ Do I NEED this , or do I just WANT this ?
If I think I need it , do I have others like it , or will it fulfill a need I ca n’t meet without it ?
If I WANT it , will I really enjoy it and appreciate it , or is it just going to make its way to the back of the closet , the bottom of the toolbox , or the one - more - thing - to - dust category ? ”
58 . Go Cash Only – Avoid using credit cards for a while .
Spend only on things you can already afford with cash , or with your debit card .
Find a good reward debit card to help you save even more .
59 . Throw
Out the “ Deals ” – Stop looking at deals and sales unless you are really in need of something .
This means cancel all the catalog subscriptions and throwing out the junk mail when it arrives .
60 .
Invest with a Low - Cost Broker – Stop using an expensive broker that charges you an arm and a leg each time you trade .
Use one of the best online stock brokers to do your investment trading .
61 . Avoid the Deal Websites – Do n’t visit online shopping or deal sites unless you have a plan for buying something you need .
Doing so will tempt fate .
62 . Consider a Refinance on Your Loans – With interest rates at historic lows , you may be able to significantly lower your monthly payment and overall interest owed on a loan by refinancing at a low mortgage rate .
63 . Get Social Savings –
Use social media , Twitter , Facebook , email etc and follow , fan or subscribe to companies whose products you regularly purchase .
You ’ll get all sorts of deals and offers that way .
You might be better off using a different account or setting up good filtering so you do n’t get overwhelmed .
64 . Use Only One Car –
Get rid of the second car .
Just trying to get by on one car may seem like a challenge , but it ’s well worth it if you are a two - car family .
How does at least $ 500 in insurance savings sound to you ?
65 . Skip the New Bottled Water – Do n’t by bottled water to carry around .
Simply refill a permanent container .
66 . Grow Your Own Organic Veggies – Organics usually cost more than other veggies .
Consider growing some of your own organic vegetables .
67 . Do n’t Believe the Price Tag – Realize that price tags are liars .
Most locally based retailers are willing to negotiate and therefore their price tags are just the starting points .
Even managers at large national retailers will occasionally be willing to negotiate .
It all starts with your willingness to ask .
68 . Mend Your Own Socks – Yes .
Repair your own socks .
You can make them last three or four times as long as they otherwise would , and it really adds up .
69 . Switch to Bio Fuel – Using biofuel for vehicles instead of Petrol / Diesel .
It is environment - friendly too .
70 . Limit the Impulse Buys – Try to limit impulse purchases .
A few small items can add up quickly , and a major purchase like a new car can haunt you for years .
Have a plan .
A marketer ’s number one job is to separate you from your money .
And there are a lot of good marketers out there .
My rule is to never go shopping without a list or a clear idea of what you I am looking for .
Otherwise , I ’ll end up spending more than I had planned to spend .
71 . Diversify Your Investments –
Do not put all your eggs in one basket .
Invest in stocks , mutual funds , bonds , real estate , etc .
72 . Buy Store Brands –
Most of these products come from the exact same factory as the “ brand name ” equivalent – and you can usually find this on the box – but they cost $ 1 - $ 3 less .
73 . Line Dry Your Clothes – Cut down on energy costs by drying your clothes on a clothesline .
They have clotheslines for inside the home as well now .
74 . Check Your Warranties and Ask for Free Repairs –
If something breaks , do n’t immediately run out to buy something new .
Look to utilize any available warranties or free repair offers you can find .
Some manufacturers are so proud of their products that they will repair them for free .
75 . Raise Your Deductible – Raise your car insurance deductible to a higher level .
One of the other quick ways to save money .
This can cut your premiums by several dollars a month .
Just make sure you have the cash saved to cover the deductible in case something happens .
76 . Budget for Irregular Expenses –
Set up a monthly line item in your savings account for bills that do n’t come due every month .
For example , car repairs .
If you know that you will spend around $ 600 on car repairs every year , put $ 50 a month in savings so when the inevitable breakdown happens you do n’t have to charge it on a credit card .
In the meantime , draw interest rather than having to pay it to someone else because you did n’t plan in advance .
Consider You Need a Budget for your budgeting needs .
77 . Get the Kids Involved – Involve your children in the process of saving money .
For each coupon they bring home , split the savings with them .
For instance , if they give you a fifty cents coupon , give them twenty - five cents into their savings account .
Thus , saving both for the family and the children .
78 . Car Pool –
If you drive a car going to work , ask some office mates who could ride with you so that they can share for gas money .
79 .
Wait 2 Days –
On purchases over $ 100 , wait 2 days to think it over before you actually make the purchase .
80 . Make a List , Baby – Before buying anything , or even heading to the store , make a list so that you wo n’t be tempted to buy something more .
81 . Utilize Online Coupon Sites –
There are many websites that offer coupons that cannot be found in the Sunday paper .
They are free to join and easy to use .
82 . Two is Better Than One , in the Dryer – It might sound crazy , but tear dryer sheets in half for the dryer .
A half sheet is just as effective .
83 . Google for Promo Codes –
When you get to the shopping cart , you ’ll see a space to enter a coupon code or promo code .
Instead of just making the purchase , do a quick Google search for your item plus “ promo code ” .
Maybe you ’ll find a nice 10 % off code to save you money at the last minute .
84 . Buy with Your Reward Points – Do n’t spend more than you normally would , but use a reward credit card throughout the year and accumulate reward points for your spending .
Then use the rewards for your Christmas gifts or to help with a vacation .
85 . Install a Programmable Thermostat –
This awesome invention can help you save 10 to 20 % on your energy bill .
Makes saving a no - brainer .
86 . Use Your Library More – Instead of buying books and renting movies , use your local library to check out books and movies for free .
They also typically have free wifi and computers you can take advantage of .
87 . Sweep the Kitchen – Save money by being a creative cook .
Use ingredients on hand , rather than buying ingredients to make a specific dish .
Food does n’t go to waste and you ’ll create some new and different salads , casseroles , etc .
88 . Avoid the Bank Fees – Get rid of those monthly checking and savings fees .
Move to an online savings account or online checking account and stop paying fees .
89 . Free Eggs – Four chickens on a quarter acre of land provide free eggs , natural insect control , and free fertilizer .
90 . Cure Your Savings –
When shopping for over - the - counter medicines compare the labels between the generic and name brand items .
Usually , they are the same and usually , you can get the generic for about 40 percent less than the name brand .
91 . Practice Hypermiling – Drive slower , brake as little as possible , and keep your tires properly inflated .
All will help to conserve on fuel expenses .
92 . Truly Save , Not Spend Less –
The best way to save money , is to deposit money in any bank as a savings deposit for use at a future time .
Do n’t confuse spending less with true savings .
93 . Bundle Your Savings – Bundle your TV , Internet and phone services .
This can typically save you good money each month .
At a minimum consider a service like Dish Network for a little while .
They will give you a great rate on your initial deal .
94 . Do n’t Be a Captive Consumer – Prepare in advance when you might be stuck in a place where the pricing gets marked up because of low competition ( e.g. movie theater , airport , zoo , etc. ) .
Bring your own snack , or eat at home just before heading to these places .
95 . Invest in a Deep Freeze –
If you have a big family , consider buying a deep freeze so you can buy more in bulk , and do more batch cooking .
96 . Eat Before
You ’re Entertained – Eat your meals at home before going to theaters , sporting events , etc .

102 . Buy Used from Craigslist –
When you ’re considering a purchase , first look at Craigslist to see if there is a lightly used version of the product you can purchase for a heavily discounted price .
103 . Pay Less in Taxes Next Year – Shelter your money from taxes by putting it in a 401K or traditional IRA .
104 . Get Excited About Saving – Find a passion for saving money .
Not because you want to hoard all your cash , but because you want to use it for good .
Think about how many lives you could change if you saved more of your money to give it away .
Or think about how great your kids future could be if you saved more money for their education and general well being .
And do n’t forget about your own retirement .
Enjoy watching your savings grow knowing that you wo n’t have to depend on someone else for your future .

What are some other ways to save money ?
List them in the comments below .
Let ’s face it : Financial reform is a hard issue to follow .
It ’s not like health reform , which was fairly straightforward once you cut through the nonsense .
Reasonable people can and do disagree about exactly what we should do to avert another banking crisis .
So here ’s a brief guide to the debate  and an explanation of my own position .
Leave on one side those who do n’t really want any reform at all , a group that includes most Republican members of Congress .
Whatever such people may say , they will always find reasons to say no to any actual proposal to rein in runaway bankers .
Even among those who really do want reform , however , there ’s a major debate about what ’s really essential .
One side  exemplified by Paul Volcker , the redoubtable former Federal Reserve chairman  sees limiting the size and scope of the biggest banks as the core issue in reform .
The other side  a group that includes yours truly  disagrees , and argues that the important thing is to regulate what banks do , not how big they get .
It ’s easy to see where concerns about banks that are “ too big to fail ” come from .
In the face of financial crisis , the U.S. government provided cash and guarantees to financial institutions whose failure , it feared , might bring down the whole system .
And the rescue operation was mainly focused on a handful of big players : A.I.G. , Citigroup , Bank of America , and so on .
Last week , the law firm of Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver dropped a letter in the mail .
A few days ago it was opened by a woman whom we 'll call Sabine ( she asked that her identity be kept private , and some details and dates of her case have been altered to maintain anonymity ) , and it informed her that she had been identified swapping the film Far Cry on peer - to - peer ( P2P ) networks during the night of March 22 .
Sabine could pay the lawyers ( they accept credit cards ) $ 1,500 by early June to make the problem go away , said the letter .
Waiting until the end of June increased the payoff amount to $ 2,500 .
The offer was " extremely reasonable , " in the lawyers ' view .
" While it is too late to undo the illegal file sharing you have already done , we have prepared an offer to enable the rights holder to recoup the damages incurred by your actions , and defray the costs of preventing this type of activity in the future . "
Should Sabine not pay up , the consequences could be life - altering .
Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver could take her to court , where the lawyers would try to prove her actions " intentional . "
And once they did that , " our client will be seeking the maximum statutory damages allowed by the Copyright Act in the amount of $ 150,000 per infringement , attorneys ' fees and costs . "
The demand is breathtaking .
While the Copyright Act does in fact allow a maximum of $ 150,000 per infringement , rightsholders rarely ask for this astonishing amount against individual P2P users .
The recording industry , over years of lawsuits , famously refused ever to ask juries for this specific amount .
The industry , whatever its faults , was attuned to the optics of the situation , and trying to crush young people beneath a mountain of unpayable debt for file - swapping is n't the sort of thing most public relations professionals want to do .
Neither do juries .
In the two most famous P2P cases from the music industry campaign , juries awarded wildly variable amounts of $ 9,250 , $ 80,000 , and $ 22,500 per song infringed ( the Jammie Thomas - Rasset case was retried , resulting in a second judgment ) .
Left to their own devices , no jury thought $ 150,000 was close to appropriate .
Sabine faces an unpleasant choice : pay a couple thousand dollars or take her chances in court , where a lawyer of her own would cost thousands and where losing could bankrupt her .
This might serve as a cautionary tale about the moral and legal issues surrounding file - swapping , a tough but necessary lesson , except for one detail — Sabine claims total innocence .
Details , details
Remarkably specific details in the letter conveyed an impression of omniscience and authority .
Sabine had swapped the file at 3:24:12 am .
She had used Azureus 4.3.1.4 as her P2P client of choice .
Her file had a 32 - character hash value , which the letter duly noted in its full upper - case glory .
Her IP address had been recorded .
Despite the detail , Sabine insists that the lawyers got it wrong .
" I 've never heard of Far Cry .
I 've never heard of any of the BitTorrent technology , I 've never used it , " said Sabine when I spoke to her this week .
As for Azureus , she claims never to have heard of it .
Even the basics of P2P network were a mystery .
" [ I was ] vaguely familiar with it , " she said .
" After getting this letter , I looked it up myself just to find out what it was . "
Her overriding reaction : " Shock . "
Sabine does use Verizon as her ISP , so that part of the letter was correct , but she says that she had been having connectivity issues with the service in the weeks before the alleged infringement .
She notified Verizon about the issues , but worries that " someone has been pilfering my IP address . "
A WiFi network existed but was password - protected .

Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver has been acting for some time as the agents for infamous German director Uwe Boll , who is on a mission to reclaim the cash he thinks P2P users have denied him .
Earlier this year , the firm filed a federal lawsuit against 2,049 " John Does " in a DC court .
The number of Does later climbed to 4,577 .
All of them were accused of sharing Far Cry on the Internet .
Sabine 's name and address had come from her Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , Verizon , which had produced it in response to a subpoena .
Once ISPs like Verizon turn a Doe 's IP address into a subscriber name and address , the legal letters fly out .
Some ISPs , like Time Warner Cable , have claimed that the sheer number of address poses an expensive problem , and that the entire legal campaign has been improper .
Other ISPs , like Verizon , have already started to comply with the subpoenas .
The case is one part of a broader campaign .
Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver has brought numerous such cases , representing independent filmmakers like those behind Call of the Wild and The Hurt Locker .
In each case , hundreds or thousands of John Does have been sued .
According to the website of the US Copyright Group , a firm set up to coordinate the lawsuits , the cases are brought " at no cost . "
Profits from settlements and court judgment are apparently split between the filmmaker and the law firm on a contingency basis .
" We are here to recover losses for copyright holders and to stop film piracy , " says US Copyright Group .
" We are here to SAVE CINEMA . "
This entrepreneurial model for P2P copyright lawsuits is a novelty in the US , where most such cases have been brought by rightsholder trade groups to cut down on infringement .
In this case , the goal appears to be monetizing infringement , and the cases are brought by a law firm that is actively recruiting clients .
It still remains unclear whether Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver will take these cases to trial if people do n't settle .
Given the huge expense of a federal lawsuit , we remain doubtful that tens of thousands of actual trials are in the cards , especially given the small size of the firm ( which is based is Leesburg , VA ) .
The disparity between the settlement amounts ( $ 1,500 and $ 2,500 ) and the threatened trial award request ( $ 150,000 ) suggest the same thing ; the firm does n't truly want to be litigating these cases at trial .
The prospect of massive court judgments works like a stick to bludgeon people into settlement — who could risk losing at trial with so much at stake ?
The letter makes this clear .
" We think that by providing our Doe defendants an opportunity to settle our client 's claims for $ 1,500 instead of having to incur thousands of dollars in attorneys ' fees and being at risk for a high jury verdict , our client is acting reasonably in good faith ... we look forward to resolving our client 's claim against you in an amicable fashion , through settlement . "
Sabine does n't yet know what she 'll do .
" I 'm trying to seek some legal advice , " she said , but she 's leaning toward calling the firm 's bluff .
If they want to convert her " John Doe " lawsuit into a " named " lawsuit , let them .
" No one in my household has ever heard of Far Cry , " she said .
Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver did not respond to our request for comment .
Last weekend was not a good time to be a queer student in the Tri-State .
Not only were two gay Miami University of Oxford , Ohio , students assaulted , but a Lexington , Ky. , area high school student was kidnapped , taken to a remote wooded area , beaten and almost pushed off a cliff because she is a lesbian .
CBS News reported :
“ The incident happened on April 16 , a national Day of Silence intended to raise awareness about bullying and harassment due to sexual orientation .
Cheyene Williams ’ ( the victim ) mother believes that is what was at the root of the attack .
“ School officials said the Day of Silence anti-violence event Friday , promoted by the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network , did spark some controversy on campus .
While some students wore stickers in support of the observance , others protested the event by wearing stickers that said ‘ Gay is not the way . ’
It was n’t clear which side of the debate the three suspects were on .
“ Ashley N. Sams , 18 , of Annville , and Corrine M. Schwab , 18 of Sandgap , were arrested and charged with kidnapping and attempted murder .
A third 17 - year - old girl was also charged in connection with the attack but those charges , and her name , are being withheld because she is a juvenile . ”
Police are not investigating this incident as a hate crime and are now saying it may have simply been a prank gone awry .
“ It is a hate crime , ” the mother of the victim , Dee Johnson , told the Lexington Herald - Leader .
Johnson also claimed her daughter videotaped part of the attack on her cell phone , proving this incident was motivated by the victim ’s sexual orientation , and that video has been turned over to police as evidence .
The FBI defines a hate crime , or bias - related crime , as an offense motivated , in whole or in part , by bias based on race , religion , sexual orientation , disability or ethnicity / national origin .
The FBI notes the presence of bias alone does not mean a crime can be considered a hate crime .
“ Only when law enforcement investigation reveals sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender ’s actions were motivated , in whole or in part , by his or her bias , should an incident be reported as a hate crime , ” states the FBI ’s website .
Honestly , what does an attacker have to do to make an incident legally a hate crime if these incidents are not considered as such ?
It seems as if the real bias - related crime is the police failing to treat these incidents as what they truly are – violent acts motivated by a person ’s identity that are being used to threaten , intimidate and violate not only the victims but everyone in that identity group .
UPDATE : Attorney ’s defending the alleged attackers are now calling this a “ staged incident , ” in which Williams was a willing participant .
Williams will not finish out the remainder of the school year to ensure her safety .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The top layer of the world ’s ocean has warmed steadily since 1993 , a strong sign of global warming and a key driver of sea level rise , according to a study by an international team of scientists .
“ The ocean is the biggest reservoir for heat in the climate system , so as the planet warms , we ’re finding that 80 to 90 percent of the increased heat ends up in the ocean , ” said Josh Willis , an oceanographer at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .
Scientists from NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , Britain ’s Met Office , the University of Hamburg in Germany and the Meteorological Research Institute in Japan analyzed different estimates of heat content in the upper ocean from 1993 to 2008 to assess the size and certainty of growing heat storage in the ocean .
They estimated that the heat content of the ocean has increased over the last 16 years and the energy stored is now enough to light nearly 500 100 - watt light bulbs for every person on the planet .
Warmer oceans cause sea levels to rise as seawater expands as it heats up , accounting for about one - third to one - half of global sea level rise , scientists say .
In an e-mail message sent to employees on Thursday , the chief executive of Digg , the user - driven social news Web site , announced that the company planned to cut its staff by 10 percent .
Ethan Miller / Getty Images
Digg has been struggling to grow over the past several years as social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have taken a large majority of the online link - sharing space .
This is n’t the first bad news out of the company this year .
Kevin Rose , Digg ’s original founder , took over the company as chief executive last month after a shake - up that resulted in the exodus of Jay Adelson , who had been chief executive for several years .
Mr. Rose sent the following message to employees early Thursday morning , which was later posted on the company ’s blog :
Hey everyone ,
This morning we faced the difficult task of reducing our team by about 10 % .
This was an emotional and rough morning for everyone involved .
Laying off dedicated and hard working individuals is extremely difficult , but we tried our best to treat everyone with the utmost respect and support .
I hope all of you will join me in the effort to assist all of those affected , be it as a reference or a referring source and most importantly , as a friend .
This is one of the hardest decisions we ’ve had to make recently but we strongly believe that it is the right decision for the long - term health of the company .
In order to achieve our goals , we are putting more emphasis on the engineering and development efforts .
In fact , we are still hiring for these teams as they are critical in getting us to where we need to be for the future , for our impending upcoming redesign and much beyond .
The only way for us to truly succeed is to adapt and adjust as necessary .
I ’m sure there will be many follow - up questions to this email .
So , we ’ll be holding an all hands today at 3 pm where you can ask questions and share your comments .
Thanks ,
Kevin
As I ’ve reported in a previous article , venture capital investors have shown frustration with Digg , because of the lack of return on the $ 40 million already invested in the company .
It is not clear how these layoffs will affect Digg ’s goals moving forward , or its plans to expand over the coming year .
Mr. Rose said in a previous blog post that employees have “ been super busy on the product side ” getting ready for a long - awaited Digg redesign and the release of a mobile application for both the iPhone and Android mobile platforms .
May 11 , 2010 -- Spearheaded by Michelle Obama , a new presidential initiative would reverse the child obesity epidemic .
The goal , as set out in a report from the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity , is to reduce childhood obesity from 20 % to 5 % by 2030 .
To accomplish this , the plan makes 70 recommendations for early childhood , for parents and caregivers , for school meals and nutrition education , for access to healthy food , and for increasing physical activity .
" For the first time , the nation will have goals , benchmarks , and measurable outcomes that will help us tackle the childhood obesity epidemic one child , one family , and one community at a time , " Obama says in a news release .
U.S. kids have n't always been obese .
Only one in 20 children ages 2 to 19 was obese in the 1970s .
But around 1980 child obesity began to rocket to today 's stratospheric level : Nearly one in three kids is overweight or obese , and nearly one in five is frankly obese .
Everyone knows obese kids face worse health than their normal - weight peers .
What this means is that higher rates of diabetes , heart disease , cancer , and lung disease may lower children 's life expectancy below that of their parents .
Other effects are becoming apparent .
The U.S. armed forces now warn that one in four Americans aged 17 to 24 is too heavy for military service .
To reverse these trends , the White House plan seeks to cut child obesity and overweight rates by 2.5 % by 2015 and by 5 % by 2020 .
It 's not a vague goal .
Scorekeeping will be up to the CDC , which reports child obesity rates every two years .

Animated Engines
Four Stroke Engine
The four stroke engine was first demonstrated by Nikolaus Otto in 18761 , hence it is also known as the Otto cycle .
The technically correct term is actually four stroke cycle .
The four stroke engine is probably the most common engine type nowadays .
It powers almost all cars and trucks .
The four strokes of the cycle are intake , compression , power , and exhaust .
Each corresponds to one full stroke of the piston ; therefore , the complete cycle requires two revolutions of the crankshaft to complete .
Intake
During the intake stroke , the piston moves downward , drawing a fresh charge of vaporized fuel / air mixture .
The illustrated engine features a poppet intake valve which is drawn open by the vacuum produced by the intake stroke .
Some early engines worked this way ; however , most modern engines incorporate an extra cam / lifter arrangement as seen on the exhaust valve .
The exhaust valve is held shut by a spring ( not illustrated here ) .
Compression
As the piston rises , the poppet valve is forced shut by the increased cylinder pressure .
Flywheel momentum drives the piston upward , compressing the fuel / air mixture .
Power
At the top of the compression stroke , the spark plug fires , igniting the compressed fuel .
As the fuel burns it expands , driving the piston downward .
Exhaust
At the bottom of the power stroke , the exhaust valve is opened by the cam / lifter mechanism .
The upward stroke of the piston drives the exhausted fuel out of the cylinder .
Ignition System
This animation also illustrates a simple ignition system using breaker points , coil , condenser , and battery .
A number of visitors have written to point out a problem with the breaker points in my illustration .
In this style ignition circuit , the spark plug will fire just as the breaker points open .
The illustration appears to have this backwards .
In fact , the illustration is correct ; it just moves so fast it ’s difficult to see !
Here ’s a close - up of the frames just at the point the plug fires :
My original intent was to accurately show that the points need to remain closed for only a fraction of a second , called the dwell .
By illustrating this , I inadvertently obscured the overall operation of the circuit .
Perhaps someday I ’ll prepare a more detailed illustration of the ignition system alone .
Larger four stroke engines usually include more than one cylinder , have various arrangements for the camshaft ( dual , overhead , etc. ) , sometimes feature fuel injection , turbochargers , multiple valves , etc .
None of these enhancements changes the basic operation of the engine .
If you keep your current plan
Current plans do n't have to higher benefit standards of new policies , unless the insurer makes significant changes in benefits or cost - sharing .
Within six months , the plans will have to stop some practices , like setting lifetime limits on coverage and canceling policy holders who get sick .
They will also have to allow children to stay on their parents ’ policies until they turn 26 , unless a child 's employer offers health insurance .
Plans that include coverage of children cannot deny coverage for a pre-existing condition .
Starting in 2014 , insurers cannot deny coverage because of a person ’s medical condition or charge higher premiums because of a person ’s sex or health status .
All new plans have to offer a minimum package of benefits defined by the federal government , including certain preventive services without any costs .
Insurers will have to pay a 40 percent excise tax on high - value group plans – those in which premiums for families are $ 27,500 or more , for instance – starting in 2018 .
Experts say the tax will likely be passed on to employees through higher premiums or lower benefits and wages .
Starting in 2013 , flexible spending accounts , which allow users to escape taxes on many medical expenses now , will be limited .
There will be a $ 2,500 maximum on accounts that typically carry $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 limits now , and you will no longer be able to use the accounts for over - the - counter medicines .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Australian mining shares tumbled on Monday after the government slapped a 40 percent tax on mining profits to fund a boost to workers ’ incomes in an election year , sparking warnings that huge new investments could be lost .
Shares in mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton fell sharply on the new tax , which Canberra expects to raise about A $ 12 billion ( $ 11 billion ) in its first two years and help fund a rise in retirement incomes .
The center - left government , which has made the tax a centerpiece of its re-election agenda this year , sought to defend the proposal against miners ’ assertions that it would force them to review A$ 100 billion in projects in one region alone .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , in a pitch likely to strike a chord with voters , said Australians had been shortchanged during a 10 - year resources boom in which profits soared by A$ 80 billion , while only A$ 9 billion extra flowed into national coffers .
“ BHP is 40 percent foreign owned , Rio Tinto is more than 70 percent foreign owned .
That means these massively increased profits ... built on Australian resources , are mostly in fact going overseas , ” Rudd told Australian radio .
The tax , to apply from 2012 , sent a chill through mining sector mergers , too , with shares in takeover target Macarthur Coal dropping 9.5 percent , suggesting U.S. bidder Peabody Energy might pull its $ 3.7 billion bid .
Under the tax reform package unveiled on Sunday , workers will get effective wage rises as the new mining tax will help pay for a cut in corporate tax and a requirement for employers to raise the amount they pay into workers ’ pension funds .
Western Australia , the largest mining state , warned of investment and job losses from the tax , without quantifying them , while BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto and a third global miner , Xstrata , said investment could be jeopardized .
Investors sold off mining stocks , sending the sector sub - index down 2.5 percent in a wider market off just 0.5 percent .
The only mining stocks to gain were those working offshore , with shares in PanAust , which focuses on Southeast Asia , up 1 percent in a sea of red .
“ There ’ll be a huge number of investors in Australian resource companies who will vomit into their cornflakes when they read this , ” said Richard Morrow , stockbroking director at E.L. & C. Baillieu .
GOVT , MINERS DIG IN
The government has picked a fight with the country ’s most important single industry , which accounts for about half of exports , in a gamble that taking money from rich miners and using it to boost workers ’ pension funds will prove a vote - winner .
Rudd faces elections in the second half of 2010 , most likely in October .
He is ahead in opinion polls and tracking to win a second term in office .
The reforms also included a cut in the company tax rate to 28 percent from 30 percent , in addition to the gradual increase in compulsory employer contributions to pension funds to 12 percent from 9 percent over the next decade .
All the changes depend on the mining tax going ahead , and the government faces a difficult fight on two fronts , with upper house opponents also ramping up their attacks on the new resources tax , pointing to eventual rejection in the Senate .
But the Senate , in which the government is 7 votes shy of a majority , will also change shape in the election , making the future of the tax bills uncertain .
The next Senate is expected to have fewer conservatives , but more crossbench greens .
While analysts predicted the tax would be publicly popular and many callers to radio stations on Monday backed the move , a key independent senator said it did not do enough for families .
BHP , RIO LEFT FUMING
The hugely profitable iron ore industry , dominated by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton , is seen as most vulnerable to the new tax .
BHP Billiton estimates its local tax rate will climb to around 57 percent from 43 percent .
Rio Tinto , the second - largest iron ore miner behind Brazil ’s Vale and ahead of BHP in third , said new tax sent a bad signal to investors .
UK - based miner Xstrata agreed .
The only clear winners from Sunday ’s tax reform package were those benefiting from the boost to Australia ’s A$ 1.2 trillion retirement savings pool , the world ’s fourth largest .
Shares in fund managers AXA Asia Pacific and AMP firmed , as did the major banks , which stand to benefit from the pension and other lesser reforms .

There has been a lot of news about North Korea ( The Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea ) recently .
Kim Jong
Il , the North Korean leader , personally visited China earlier this month , and now South Korea is certain that their navy ship , Cheonan , was sunk by a North Korean submarine earlier this year .
Below is a collection of translated Chinese internet posts and Chinese netizen comments from the Shanghai KDS discussion forum .
From KDS :
Actually , Kim Jong
Il coming to China recently was for the South Korean warship matter
If it were only for increasing aid , it would n’t have been necessary for him to personally come , as China providing him aid is n’t new , and sending foreign relations chief would have been enough .
Him personally coming is obviously because the warship was indeed destroyed by North Korea , and he too knows this will cause trouble , that the international community may consider it an intentional act of war , and that [ sending ] someone below him would not give face so he could only come himself .
The question is what motive did North Korea have for taking out this warship ?
A show of force ?
Or have they already prepared their military and economy and are prepared to make a move on South Korea ?
I think so far North Korea definitely does not have the ability to initiate a second Korean War .
If they were to do this , even if China used its veto in the United Nations , America would still send its military , and the defeat and even overthrow of North Korea would be the obvious result .
However , I do not exclude him using this kind of incident to test the international [ community ’s ] bottom line tolerance towards him .
At this point , we can pretty much be sure that this ship was intentionally destroyed by North Korea , otherwise Kim Jong
Il would not personally have come to China .
Comments from KDS :
chauffeur :
This can also be explained by Fatty Kim having been wronged , so he rushed over to ask for help .
There are two sides to everything , and who really understands political things anyways ?
切了特空 :
Actually Kim came for medical treatment , and while he was at it , got botox injections .
大宝男 人:
Of course , can North Korea be trusted / believed ?
I ’d sooner trust / believe Henan people than Fatty Kim .
牛肉面 :
Although I have no good feelings towards South Korea , but Fatty Kim , this rogue always causing trouble everywhere , is even worse .
奶茶小花 :
It is better to take out rogue countries earlier than later .
The people living underneath the light of the Kim sun is really difficult .
侬看个只 腿:
2012 is not so scary , what is scary is the world war North Korea starts then , pulling China first under the water .
光头 :
I bet that in another month there will definitely be another nuclear bomb test , and then big brother [ China ] will quietly give 1 billion USD as compensation , then the fat bastard will take 500 million and give the remaining 500 million to Kimchi [ South Korea ] , then Kimchi and Old Eagle [ America ] will make a few performances about how everything is peaceful … the entire process will take 3 - 6 months …
hdatkds :
Welcome Grandpa Kim to come to Shanghai to see the World Expo .
钢筋 混凝土 :
I feel there ’s a problem with the South Korean bangzi ‘s fighting ability .
The advanced Cheonan , actually being sunk by an antique North bangzi submarine , and the captain even has the face to return alive [ instead of dying in shame with his ship ] .
From KDS :
South Korea fighting North Korean now would simply be cutting grass , no need for imperialist America ’s help !
The Kim family should probably tone it down a little .
Let me edit the post a little , and post some data .
South Korea population : over 40 million , South Korean military : over 600,000 .
North Korea population : over 20 million , North Korean military : over 1 million .
The 38th Parallel is about 150 km away from Pyongyang .
The 38th Parallel is about 50 km away from Seoul .
The national strength of South Korea is N times that of North Korea .
Basically we can ignore North Korea ’s navy and land forces .
But Seoul is within the range of North Korean artillery , this point is pretty annoying / troublesome .
However , seen another way , Pyongyang is also within South Korea ’s range .
With Seoul destroyed , South Korean can still build ships and vehicles .
With Pyongyang destroyed , North Korean would not have any other decent cities .
Comments from KDS :
上海小混混 :
The bangzi [ South Koreans ] may have better weapons than North Korea , but North Korea has nothing to lose , and would have no problem taking you down with them , so the bangzi would n’t dare be too reckless with them !
徽蓝 :
LZ is so naive , when fighting a war , the most frightening are those who are n’t afraid to die .
What use are good weapons when millions of brainwashed charge over .
Even using all your missiles wo n’t blast them all , just give up hope .
伐敢哈来来 :
North Korea has over 10,000 missiles aimed at Seoul , something artillery cannot stop !!!
潸然 :
I look forward to the day when I can see rogue states like North Korea disappearing from the earth .
不吃鸡蛋 :
America was so cocky back in the day , doing whatever it wanted , but eventually made mentally retarded by Vietnamese monkeys [ humbled by the Vietnamese in the Vietnam War ] .
As long as the war is not about comparing technology and money , it ’ll be OK .
无敌小 喵呜 :
Without imperialist America … South Korea will be cut down like grass ~
But South Korea still has one deadly weapon , airdropping Oreo cookies , Big Mac hamburgers , finger - licking good chicken , and Nong Shim ramen .
加个卤蛋 :
Sacrificing one warship in exchange for a reason to attack North Korea , very good very good .
geylang :
South Korea cutting grass accidentally steps on a landmine and South Korea is no more .
Make the North Koreans nervous and they use a nuclear weapon and South Korea is no more .
山姆大叔 :
North Korea as a pile of ruins is still North Korea .
But is South Korea as a pile of ruins still South Korea ?
瘪三 腔调 :
I hope before the fighting begins that both sides ’ XS [ girls ] can first all fly over to Shanghai to avoid suffering and loss .
短信服务商 :
I laugh .
South Korea and North Korea have constantly been preparing for war , treating each other as imaginary enemies for decades .
South Korea today is not the South Korea of yesterday .
The military difference between North Korea and South Korea is not something human wave tactics can make up for anymore .
键盘魔王 :
Hard to say about Northern bangzi .
The government trained them so many years .
Their strength must be much more than Afghanistan and Iraq .
Southern bangzi cutting them down like grass is definitely not possible .
钢管 :
Even China now does n’t dare do anything with North Korea , a completely rogue country …
JIMMY :
LZ you ’re definitely wrong here !
If North Korea were to cast aside the nuclear bomb , we wo n’t say , but their war - fighting ability will definitely shock people !
Just like Mao in the past !
Their mentality is definitely number one in the world !
And , they have the nuclear weapon !
Otherwise , would Fatty Kim be so cocky !?
菜刀推销员 :
Southern bangzi are doing quite well for themselves .
Apart from the people having some inseparable family relations with the Northern bangzi , it does n’t matter if they unify or not unify — — why unify anyway ?
Such a big mess , that bunch of brainwashed , sallow and emaciated so - called compatriots .
If Outer Mongolia were to return [ to China ] , would you want it ?
短信服务商 :
Fatty Kim being able to survive until today … is still because of China and Russia .
The above two countries … of course do not wish the North Korean peninsula to be ruled by the American - friendly South Korea .
However , North Korea now is also out of control .
Internationally , it is already not giving face to China and Russia .
From KDS :
I have to say , North Korea would instantly destroy South Korea
Just an image …
Comments from KDS :
呵呵 :
Compare the two side ’s masters [ China and America ] and see .
brvm :
The two Koreas going to war would simply be China and America playing chess .
Whether they fight and how they fight is not something they themselves will decide …
张多多 :
North Korea - simida actually is just like Iraq = =
A lot of hot air …and messing around …
大师 :
North Korea — East Asian Iraq .
Fatty Kim — North Korean Saddam .
猪小熊 :
Some people do n’t understand , bangzi country ’s president Lee Myung - bak does not have the power to mobilize the Korean army , nor does he have the power to declare war against North Korea .
These two powers are in the hands of the UN Command ( American military ) , which is basically the hands of the American president … so sad .
And some people are speaking for / defending / supporting the South bangzi …
闲人 :
If South Korea goes to war and too many people die , Seoul will probably immediately have several tens of thousands of people walk the streets **…
If North Korea loses several tens of thousands of people , I bet it will be as if it were nothing !~
C.K :
Without Daddy America , North Korea could overtake the 38th Parallel just with artillery alone , even Korean War era artillery .
大 B神 :
The level of two 6 - year - old children fighting , and children with barely passable intelligence at that .
匪 号孟德 :
Actually , personally , regardless of which North Eastern Asian power , whether China , America , Russia , Japan , South Korea , or North Korea , the current situation is probably the best situation .
China , America , Russia , and Japan do not wish for a unified , aggressive North Korean country to appear .
Only a unified Korea under North Korea would result in a truly powerful country .
Japan and Korea still have territorial disputes , China and South Korea / China and North Korea have sea and land boundary disputes .
But for North Korea , or Fatty Kim , to be unified under South Korea would mean the collapse of the Kim family , and nevermind the money , even their lives would be uncertain .
A unified Korea [ under South Korea ] would not be strong .
However , for South Korea , although they have a strong desire for unification , due to the US - Korea treaty , as long as China does n’t make a move , attacking to the Yalu River is not a problem , but , a war of unification would be enough to exhaust 5 - 10 years of South Korea ’s accumulated wealth , collapsing South Korea ’s economy .
If unified , 24 million North Koreans would undoubtedly also be a huge burden .
Besides , from the perspective of American national interests , the United States would definitely maintain the current situation .
Why ?
In a nutshell , because a war to unify the peninsula would cause China to act .
If China does not act , America would naturally support South Korean reunification of the peninsula , conveniently completing the Northeast Asian containment of China .
However , the moment China causes the American military to lose more than it can bear , Americans will not let the American military continue dying for a war on the other side of the world .
Therefore , the present situation , in the eyes of the various powers , is the best situation .
From KDS :
Place your bets , North Korea – South Korea 1:9 odds
Someone make a poll for fun .
Comments from KDS :
细胞 分裂中 :
I definitely bet on South Korea winning .
Those North Korean generals are n’t SBs , they ’ll immediately surrender after crossing the line .
It is not as if they do n’t normally know how developed South Korea is , and who would want to be a criminal of a war that can not be won ?
Their entire army [ under the general ] will surrender .
[ This way , they can ] get a government position + good reputation .
JJR 降临 :
Obviously North Korea , but our country will have to outwardly keep up appearances , but make some moves behind the scenes .
South Korea ’s old man [ America ] is on the opposite side of the Pacific .
They have the will [ to protect South Korea ] but they can only do so much [ because they are so far away ] .
spcard1 :
I bet North Korea will lose everything .
This is a big country game , small countries can only be props .
Japan is the most unlucky , they could get bombed at any moment .
IrishSpy :
I bet the Heavenly Kingdom [ China ] will not deploy forces , will strongly condemn , call for [ this or that ] , observe , etc .
细胞 分裂中 : [ responding to spcard1 ]

One of the best parts about attending college is getting to share in the school spirit and traditions like football games and marching bands .
But even if you 're pursuing a degree from one of the online universities , you can still support your hometown school or parent brick - and - mortar school by catching games online , on the field or on TV .
Even if your school 's traditions or spirit are lacking , watch these 10 college marching bands on YouTube .
Their badass performances won the loyalty of fans around the world , whether or not they were students or alumni .
The BP oil spill is spread across an estimated 2,500 square miles , and is dumping at least 200,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico every day .
What would that look like in New York ?
To give you an idea of the destruction caused in the Gulf , Google Maps engineer Paul Rademacher has created an image of the spill that you can drag over any city .
It 's pretty depressing .
Meanwhile , poor BP has lost $ 350 million to the spill already .
Here it is over Washington , DC .

Wisconsin still can't get emergency contraception to rape victims , Florida tries to get judges to tell pregnant teenagers they should give their babies up for adoption and more stories that went under the radar .
Mandatory ultrasounds , fetal pain bills , and ridiculous waiting periods .
We watched a lot of anti-choice legislation get passed in the 2010 session , but here are a few losses and victories that may have been missed among the more headline - grabbing fights for reproductive choice .
North Dakota
It ’s been a while since the Dakotas have had a ballot measure to get them fired up against abortion .
That appears to be the plan with the recently introduced “ Skull Crushing and Decapitation Ban Act . ”
The ban is an effort to save a “ living unborn child , ” according to the initiative petition , and has such wonderfully vague language as :
1. “ Decapitation ” means serious bodily injury in which a person uses any instrument or procedure to grasp the skull or neck of a living unborn child for the purpose of separating the skull from the neck Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

SUBSCRIBE 2 . “ Skull Crushing ” means seriously bodily injury in which a person uses any instrument or procedure to grasp the skull of a living unborn child for the purpose of compressing or collapsing the skull in a life - endangering manner .
that it could likely be applied to almost any procedure that is n’t a medical abortion .
The Secretary of State approved the proposed petition , which now needs approximately 13,000 valid local registered voter signatures to make it onto the ballot .
Wisconsin
Although Wisconsin has some terrific programs in place like Compassionate Care and now the Healthy Youth Initiative , getting them implemented properly can still be a problem .
Compassionate Care , a program to ensure victims of sexual assault have access to emergency contraception , was passed two years ago , but it appears some hospitals still are n’t getting with the program , according to the Wisconsin Radio Network .
Emergency contraception is still not available at all Wisconsin hospitals , according to a new survey .
Two years after Compassionate Care for Rape Victims became law , a survey by the Wisconsin Alliance for Women ’s Health finds twenty - two percent of state hospitals are not complying .
“ We were n’t totally surprised that many hospitals were lacking resources they needed , to truly comply with the law , ” says the Alliance ’s Sara Finger .
“ It just goes to show that there ’s more work to be done , to educate and empower hospitals . ”
Sara Finger with the Alliance says they ’re distributing a comprehensive compliance tool kit to every emergency room and sexual assault nurse examiner in the state to help overcome a lack of resources .
Other hospitals continue to object to the law , citing “ provider beliefs . ”
Finger says that ’s a matter for education .
“ The AMA , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Public Health Association , the AMA , all agree that emergency contraception is the standard of care to provide a rape victim in preventing a pregnancy from her attacker . ”
South Carolina
Still , we do get to find some small victories here and there .
In South Carolina , an attempt to pass a personhood amendment via bureaucratic hocus pocus after it had been stalled in the legislature got completely shut down , with even Republican leaders chastising the maneuvering .
The Senate put turned back a bid Tuesday to bring anti-abortion legislation to debate on the Senate floor – an effort by an Upstate Republican to bypass stalled hearings at both the subcommittee and full committee levels .
The action , led by Sen. Lee Bright , R - Spartanburg , stalled Senate business , delaying final passage of a cigarette tax increase to 50 cents a pack .
Bright , who has emerged as the Senate ’s most vocal opponent of abortion rights , tried to force a vote on bypassing the committee hearings .
“ This is one of those gotcha votes , ” McConnell protested .
“ You ’re for abortion or you ’re against it . ”
Bright said he took the step because his bill , S450 , which seeks to establish fetal personhood , was introduced in February 2009 but had not yet come up for debate .
“ Never debating the cause – I do n’t see how that helps , ” Bright said .
An irritated Senate president pro-tempore Glenn McConnell , R- Charleston , blasted the move , however , which he said not only breaks Senate procedure , but also would wind up costing the state money .
“ It is unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution , ” said McConnell , an attorney .
“ Let me tell you what he is trying to push on us :
This bill would make a doctor guilty of manslaughter or murder if it goes forward . ”
McConnell , who described himself as “ pro-life , ” scolded Bright for attempting to change U.S. law established by the landmark 1973 Roe v.
Wade case , by passing a conflicting state law .
McConnell also blasted Bright for attempting to force senators either to support that effort or look as if they favor abortions .
Florida
Much attention is still on Florida for passing a new restrictive mandatory ultrasound bill .
But one thing that went mostly unnoticed was a push for more onerous rules around judicial bypass for parental consent , including only being able to go to your local judge , a higher level of evidence to prove the teen is “ mature enough ” and host of waiting roadblocks intended to , among other things , delay the teen until she is too pregnant to obtain the abortion itself or force her to have a more invasive procedure .
The best part ?
This add on measure from the committee :
The House Criminal and Civil Justice Policy Committee added a measure to mandate a judge determine whether a minor is aware of the “ shortage of unborn babies available for adoption . ”
It passed 11 - 4 , but defied party lines with a moderate Republican and a Catholic Democrat switching sides .
Happily , the Florida senate killed the proposed new regulations .
A controversial bill to expand parental notification for abortion appears dead this session after the Senate Health Regulation Committee failed to consider the measure Monday .
It is still moving in the House , so critics are careful not to celebrate yet .
But it ’s the legislation ’s supporters who are throwing in the towel — and blaming bill sponsor Sen.
Andy Gardiner .
In an e-mail titled “ UNBELIEVABLE , ” the Christian Family Coalition said Gardiner “ ran out on his bill ” and “ lost all credibility ” with supporters .
He left the room before it was considered and asked committee Chairman Don Gaetz to postpone it .
The committee wo n’t meet again this session .
“ This is the biggest act of COWARDICE that I have seen a public official display in all of my years in statewide politics , he did n’t even have the decency to stay in the committee hearing room and postpone his own bill , ” said Anthony Verdugo , the founder of Christian Family Coalition in a statement .
“ Someone needs to get the message to Gardiner that politics is a contact sport and NOT for the faint at heart ! ”
Not for the faint of heart , sure .
But it ’s nice to see some politicians remembering to have a heart at all .
One of the best qualities about Chicago 's C2E2 convention is the candid manner in which studio personalities speak about the properties they 've been involved with .
The three - day con packs a big punch , without the pomp and circumstance that goes along with the big kahuna that takes place in San Diego .
A great example of this took place during Kevin Conroy 's panel yesterday .
If you consider yourself a Batman fan , you already know who Conroy is .
The man has portrayed the Dark Knight longer than anyone else ; be it animated series , film or video games .
He is considered by many to be the true voice of Batman .
For those whoknow who he is , or what Batman projects he has worked on , here 's a synopsis of his time with the character :
Now , onto the fun part .
We all know the controversy behind Christian Bale 's ' throat cancer ' Batman voice .
It is considered by many to be one of the weak points in Chris Nolan 's Batman films ( ) .
Though we 've heard comic writers and actors discuss this issue over and over again , there is no one better to give an expert opinion on the matter than Kevin Conroy .
During a panel at C2E2 yesterday , Conroy weighed in on the debacle .
Most notably , he said that someone should have told Bale just howhe sounded .
Pay attention to the first few seconds of the video ; Conroy gives fans a treat by dishing outversion of ' hockey pads ' line :

It also has one of the world 's strictest dress codes for women , who are required by law in the Islamic Republic to cover from head to toe .
However , many women , especially the young , ignore some of the stricter sartorial guidelines , choosing instead to wear scarves that show much of their hair , and tailored coats that reveal their figures .
Syfy Channel has pinned a deal for " Smackdown . "
World Wrestling Entertainment Inc's " Smackdown , " which for years was a mainstay on the UPN and CW networks before moving to News Corp .'s
My Network TV , is now headed to NBC Universal 's Syfy Channel , people close to the situation said .
A deal , which will be announced later this week , further solidifies the growing relationship between NBC Universal and Vince McMahon 's WWE .
Syfy already carries the show " NXT , " which is a reality program featuring wannabe wrestlers trying to make it to the big leagues of WWE .
NBC Universal 's USA cable channel also carries WWE programming including " WWE Raw . "
Although terms were not disclosed , My Network TV was shelling out roughly $ 20 million a year for " Smackdown . "
Syfy 's price tag is believed to be closer to $ 30 million a year .
Although " Smackdown " is more than 10 years old , it still does very well with men , particularly the 18 - 34 demographic , and generally averages about 3.5 million viewers overall .
" Smackdown " will continue to air on Friday nights when it moves to Syfy later this year , most likely in either late September or early October .
WWE is still looking to launch its own cable network , probably sometime in 2011 .
This latest deal with NBC Universal is another sign that the two could end up partnering on such a channel .
WWE chief Vince McMahon has close relationships with NBC Universal brass , particularly Dick Ebersol , who oversees all sports programming for the company .
Just a few weeks ago , Ebersol took part in an induction ceremony for broadcaster Bob Uecker into the WWE 's hall of fame , which was also broadcast as a special on the USA Network .

Several decades after the global libertarian communist revolution , a worker - delegate travels to the rewilded former Canada to carry out a humanitarian mandate ...
The sound of engines droned in the air .
Below , the serried ranks of dirty , ragged people toiling in the organic turnip fields paused in their labour and raised their faces to the sky , their eyes wide with wonder .
Such a sound had not been heard in Hippyshit Sustainable Human Settlement for decades .
Across the valley , the unmistakeable silhouette of a helicopter could be seen making a beeline for the collection of decrepit huts where the locals dragged themselves off to bed each night after the day 's back breaking work was done .
A murmur of dull resentment rises from the onlookers .
" Syndies "
*
Worker no. 365759 turned to the pilot .
“ How much further is it , no . 214119 ? ” he asked , craning his neck to get a better look at the terrain as the sleek , grey flying machine sped over the undulating hills of what , back in the day , had been known as Canada .
The landscape was breathtaking .
The advent of cold fusion , some decades ago , had drastically reduced the need for land – what with virtually limitless power , multi-storey farms , and no reason to expand production further , huge swathes of land were left to revert to pristine wilderness .
“ We 're almost at the place , ” said the pilot laconically , chewing on the end of a toothpick as he spoke .
“ Give it another five minutes and you 'll be able to see it , over that ridge . ”
Worker looked where the pilot had pointed , and saw a broad clearing on the side of the hill they were approaching .
If he squinted , he thought he could see a group of people , spaced out at regular intervals along narrow ridges that cut across the stretch of brown earth .
For a moment , he wondered what on earth they could be doing – then he remembered .
Of course , they were farming ... but by hand ?
Or were those clumsy things they were holding ploughs of some sort ?
“ Damn primmos , ” muttered Worker 's fellow passenger , no .
743101 .
“ Why the fuck do they get charity .
They choose to live in the dirt they should deal with it . ”
Worker shrugged .
“ It 's not like we need any of it , ” he said .
“ It 's mostly junk that gets rejected by the planning bureaus , or whatever left in the communal storehouse .
And besides , a lot of them do n't know any different – there 's kids down there that 've only heard stories about civilization . ”
“ Yeah , I guess , ” said 743101 , staring pensively out of the window .
*
“ Dude ! ”
The Wise Guy of Hippyshit was not pleased .
He glared down at the frightened child standing before him , her toy clasped in her grubby fist .
Behind her , a crowd of sustainable humans looked on with dissaproval .
“ That is not cool , bro , ” he said , shaking his finger authoritatively .
“ You know the rules – we 'll have no round wheels in this town . ”
The girl looked at the wooden toy in her hands , dejectedly .
It was a simple thing , a block of wood with a couple of axles and four , uneven wheels , with a string attached .
“ Are you ... sure , about this , Bill ? ” asked one of the sustainable humans , tenatively .
“ I mean , they look sort of ... useful .
At any rate , they 've got to be better than the triangular ones we 're using at the moment ... ”
The crowd turned to the dissenter , glaring .
Bill adopted a pitying tone .
“ Do n't you , like , understand ? ”
He said , stroking his matted , fucking disgusting beard with one hand as he spoke .
“ Round wheels are like , authoritarian .
That 's capitalist technology man .
The triangular wheel is liberating .
Round wheels , like , just exist to conform to capitalist notions of efficiency ... ”
There were nods at assent at this .
“ If we have round wheels , the next thing you know we 'll have schools , prisons , banks ... ”
He got no further in his exposition of the evils of capitalist technology , as at that moment , with a thunderous roar , the dark shape of a helicopter appeared over the roofs of the village .
“ Oh SHIT ! ” shouted Bill .
“ It 's the Syndies , man !
I always knew this day would come !
They 're back , and they 've come to impose their technology on us !
Bad vibes , dude ! ”
*
The chopper set down in the village square – or the village irregular shape , since straight lines had been out of favour at the time it was constructed .
It was made of uneven cobbles that had been worn smooth over the decades by the tramp of exhausted feet out to the fields and back again , day after day after day .
A crowd gathered quickly as the two workers and pilot began to unload .
The adults mostly looked suspicious or hostile , but the children seemed fascinated with the novelty of this vast metal thing from the sky .
Some began to edge closer to the chopper , dodging their parents attempts to drag them back .
Bill arrived just as the last of the supplies were being unloaded , his face contorted in a scowl of defiance .
“ Stay back ! ” he called to the sustainable humans crowding around the machine .
“ Keep well back , dudes and dudettes !
You do n't want to like , become a part of the technology and not the other way around ! ”
Worker looked at the man quizzically .
Turning , he pulled out his iPhone , where he had saved a pdf of his mandate from the delegates ' council back in Vancouver Municipal Commune .
“ People of Hippyshit , ” he read , “ due to the rampant disease and malnourishment which is apparently causing widespread infant mortality in your community , the workers of VMC have elected to send you this surplus of medical supplies and dietary supplements for the care of pregnant women and children .
We understand you perfect right to free association , and to live where and how you choose – however , we feel kind of bad about how many of you seem to be dying of the common cold .
As a consequence , please accept this donation as a gesture of goodwill ... ”
Worker trailed off .
The hostility of the crowd had deepened .
“ They 're trying to spread ( impose ) their evil Frankenstein technology on us , and they doubtless have few homosexual friends ! ” cried Bill , gesturing at the helicopter .
“ Anti-authoritarian warriors , attack ! ”
With that word , a mass of malnourished , diseased , filthy hippies flung themselves at the workers and began to beat at them with their fists .
Cries of " For Hippyshit ! " and " Smash the megamachine ! " could be heard , as the crowd hurled themselves at the invaders .
“ Fuck this shit ! ” shouted Worker over the din .
“ Back in the chopper ! ”
“ Right behind you ! ” shouted the pilot , picking up two particularly gross specimens by their dreadlocks and knocking their heads together .
The three of them fought their way to the helicopter doors , and closed them on the mob outside .
“ Floor it ! ” Worker yelled to the pilot .
He did n't have to be told twice ; the helicopter roared into the air , leaving the crowd of howling primitivists behind .
“ On second thoughts , ” said worker , wiping primmo blood off onto his jeans , " you were right .
Fuck 'em . ”

In the build - up to next Saturday ’s lightweight title fight at UFC 112 , Frankie Edgar stated the following about the 155 lb division :
“ This is the deepest weight - class in the UFC , and then you ’ve got BJ ( Penn ) at the top of it all , ” said the lightweight division ’s No.1 contender .
He ’s not alone in thinking that 155lbs has the most talent in the UFC , it ’s been said by a number of respected fighters , fans and pundits in recent years – but is it still the case in 2010 ?
—
The Lightweight Division
There ’s undoubtedly a long list of worthy competitors at lightweight .
BJ Penn , Frankie Edgar , Gray Maynard , Kenny Florian , Tyson Griffin and Sean Sherk are names that immediately spring to mind , and they keep on coming .
From established fighters like Clay Guida , Joe Stevenson and Nate Diaz , through to up and coming talent like Evan Dunham , Ross Pearson and George Sotiropoulos , this is a world - class roster in anyone ’s books .
The division is in a transitional phase however which may be putting a dent in it ’s armor .
Most significant is BJ
Penn ’s recent hints that he may be set to vacate his belt and head back to welterweight , possibly after next weekend ’s fight in Abu Dhabi .
Meanwhile the last man to challenge for the title , Diego Sanchez , also recently announced his return to 170 lbs after a little over a year of competing at lightweight , while Roger Huerta has moved onto Bellator after his contract expired earlier in the year .
Former PRIDE lightweight champion Takanori Gomi‘s arrival in the UFC last week could have added an interesting new dynamic to the division , but after a convincing loss to Florian there is now a feeling that the Japanese star ’s best days are behind him .
Speaking of which former champion Sean Sherk is currently 2 - 2 in his last four fights and after sitting the last year out through various injury complaints it ’s questionable whether the 36 year old remains the force he once was .
Then there are the top lightweight talents not currently in the UFC to consider .
At Strikeforce ’s next CBS event on the 17th of April their current lightweight champion Gilbert Melendez takes on DREAM ’s lightweight champ Shinya Aoki – both fighters currently ranked in many people ’s top 10 lightweights – both fighting outside of the UFC .
DREAM also lay claim to at least one more top 10 lightweight in Tatsuya Kawajiri , while Bellator ’s Eddie Alvarez and the WEC’s Ben Henderson also feature in the rankings .
It ’s questionable how many of these fighters would actually be able to make an impact in the UFC ’s ultra-competitive 155 lb division , but until they are brought into the promotion we ca n’t say for sure .
—
The Light - Heavyweight Division
Meanwhile the UFC ’s light - heavyweight division , which has long been a driving force for the promotion , is going from strength - to - strength .
They current have a wealth of talent at their disposal , from current champion Lyoto Machida and No.1 contender Mauricio ‘ Shogun ’ Rua , to upper - tier fighters like Rashad Evans , Quinton ‘ Rampage ’ Jackson , Antonio Rogerio Nogueira , Forrest Griffin , Thiago Silva and Luis Cane .
Beyond that there ’s the veterans like Randy Couture , Chuck Liddell , Tito Ortiz and Rich Franklin , together with the rising stars like Jon Jones , Ryan Bader and Phil Davis .
A fighter like Jones is particularly significant since he ’s not just a talented prospect like many of the others we ’ve mentioned at 155 and 205 lbs , but rather someone who has a genuine chance of reaching the very top of the ladder in the sport .
The division is further boosted by pound - for - pound middleweight champion Anderson Silva ’s occasional appearance , and the indications are that he may yet become a permanent fixture if his dominant reign at 185 lbs continues .
The impressive roster of talent that the UFC has assembled is really driven home when you look at the MMA top 20 light - heavyweight rankings .
Unlike the lightweight division , the UFC virtually has a monopoly at 205 lbs .
The obvious exception is Strikeforce ’s Gegard Mousasi , undoubtedly one of the finest fighters in the division , while ‘ King Mo ’ would be a nice acquisition , but is not essential at this stage .
Beyond that you ’ll be hard pushed to make significant improvements to the division at this time , and that ’s impressive .
—
Conclusion :
It certainly hard to pick between the 155lb and 205 lb divisions as they are both stacked high with quality fighters , but two things convince me that light - heavyweight is edging out in front at this time though .
Comparing the current champions to the top contenders it ’s difficult to see who can beat BJ Penn at 155 lbs , while it seems like there are a number of potential challengers at 205lbs who could give Machida ( or indeed Shogun if he wins the rematch ) a run for his money .
The light - heavyweight division has retained it ’s most talented fighters and may even increase the quality if Silva moves up permanently , while lightweight has seen some fighters leave or move up in weight , and may also be set to lose their champion .
Things can change quickly in mixed martial arts though – you only need to look at the transformation of the heavyweight division in the past 18 months ( as we discussed in a recent article ) to see that .
For example I would n’t be surprised if the UFC to snap up some of the other top ranked lightweights when the opportunity arises , and since Zuffa owns both the UFC and the WEC , it ’s not beyond the realms of possibility that the likes of Ben Henderson , or perhaps 145 lb champion Jose Aldo for example , could be brought into the fold either permanently or in a ‘ superfight ’ capacity .
There ’s still room for growth in the 155 lb division and I ’m eager to see how the roster looks in 12 - 18 months time , but in the mean time , regardless of which is the deepest , I ’m more than happy to sit back and enjoy two of the pound - for - pound best divisions in all of mixed martial arts .
Article By RossC
On the latest episode of the SGU an audience member ( it was a live recording ) asked about the youth culture today and why kids do n’t seem to be interested in science , or much else of perceived intellectual value .
I basically responded that this question is thousands of years old – every generation , apparently , has felt this about the youth of their time .
Things are not necessarily getting worse , although confirmation bias and a narrow perspective may make it seem so .
The generation question aside – this also raises the question of how to make science and skepticism more popular in general , but especially with the next generation .
A listener then sent me a link to the following article : Why Nerds are Unpopular .
The author writes :
I know a lot of people who were nerds in school , and they all tell the same story : there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd , and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular .
Being smart seems to make you unpopular .
But why ?
Basically , the author argues that smart kids invest their time and energy into the things that they like .
Meanwhile , being popular in high school is a full - time job , requiring a great deal of time and effort – time the nerds are unwilling to commit .
I found his argument unconvincing .
The article goes into many other issues , about the roots of teenage angst , that you may find interesting , but I want to focus on this primary point – nerds are unpopular because they do n’t invest time in being popular .
While this is likely to be one factor , there are others that I can readily identify from my own experience .
The answer , as much as there is one , is multifactorial and there will be a different mix of reasons in different kids , different schools , and different cultures .
First , let ’s not avoid the obvious – many nerds are socially awkward .
Having a high IQ does not necessarily mean you have a high EQ ( emotional quotient ) or that you are politically savvy .
I am not suggesting that all nerds fit this stereotype , but some certainly do , and to varying degrees .
To some extent , people will follow their talents because it ’s the path of least resistance .
So for the book - smart but socially inept kid – of course they will choose to value and excel intellectually , and devalue and ignore social networking , fashion , and physical pursuits .
But if you think about it , you probably knew in school , and still know , people who combine talents in these various realms to different degrees .
There are smart athletes , and smart but socially savvy kids , and even not - so - smart nerds .
We must also consider that popularity is also complex – because there are cliques and subcultures .
Many kids will seek out and network with other kids who share their interests ( again , to varying degrees ) .
School also forces us to socialize to some extent across whatever social bounds form .
But in general the jocks hang out with the jocks and the nerds hang out with the nerds .
From this subcultures emerge .
Kids seek to be popular within their subculture , while simultaneously trying to raise the status of their group .
So nerds often try to be popular among their fellow nerds .
Sometimes this can result in desperately isolated cliques – sacrificing and even denigrating any popularity in the broader culture in order to fit in with a small group of like - minded compatriots .
Having trouble fitting in – you can go goth ( for example ) and give up on any broader popularity , but at least you will instantly fit in with the other goths .
This , unfortunately , is also the root of cults – cults provide instant acceptance at the expense of a rigid “ us vs them ” ideology .
Subcultures also mean that interests and experiences reinforce the separation of the subcultures .
The Big Bang Theory is a good representation of this – the nerds on the show share common interests and knowledge which becomes part of the glue of their subculture .
They can share inside jokes about Star Wars and LOTR , discuss science , and entertain themselves with jokes about the low intellectual capacity of the muscular jock boyfriend of the pretty girl next door .
Cultures have inertia .
Kids have their own culture , and many subcultures , and they create awaiting receptacles as kids try to fit in somewhere .
So “ popularity ” is a socially complex and multifaceted phenomenon , and there is therefore no single cause .
But what of the original question – how do we as activist skeptics make science , intellectualism , and skepticism more generally accepted in our own culture ?
It is not , as some would argue , hopeless .
I offer as examples the fact that not every school has the same culture .
I went to a prep school , and I can tell you that the culture was somewhat flipped – the academically successful kids tended to be more generally popular .
There were still subcultures and different groups with different interests and characters – but generally , being smart was considered a virtue .
The culture of the school generally respected hard work , integrity , and achievement .
This is an artificial situation in a way – a selective population , both self - selective , and selected by their parents ( who were probably generally overachievers ) and the school itself .
But it demonstrates that children will not inevitably form a subculture that generally values beauty and athleticism and devalues intelligence .
The culture of this school was that achievement was valued in all its forms , but especially intellectual .
Other countries also have different cultures .
In Asia , generally , scholastic achievement and hard work is more highly valued by the broader culture .
The bottom line is this – do n’t assume that an American public school experience is universal and broadly applicable social lessons can be derived from it .
To me what this means is that we can slowly move the culture in the direction of valuing smarts and even nerdiness .
Bill Gates has done this , to some degree – we now celebrate the alpha nerd .
Kids see wealthy powerful nerds with the attractive mates , and they get the message .
Computers have done this – once the sole domain of nerds , they are now chic .
Even cheerleaders will whip out their iPhones to text their friends – using a computer device to communicate ?
Twenty years ago that was unbelievably nerdy .
We are still fighting the sit-com and TV culture .
While I have seen more programs celebrating smarts ( CSI , The Mentalist , Jimmy Neutron , Mythbusters , etc. ) we are still plagued by the sit - com nerd stereotype , and the general promotion of an anti-intellectual culture , especially among kids .
There is room for improvement there .
Also – we have to consider that we have various goals .
We would like to swell the ranks of those kids who value intelligence and reason , but also we want to empower those kids who are already there .
Encourage them to pick up their heads and see that smarts are valued in at least segments of the broader culture .
The older they get , the more being smart is cool .
I also think the high - school culture significantly flips when you get to college .
Again , we have a somewhat selective subpopulation .
But also we have a different subculture .
Even if we ca n’t penetrate high - school culture that much ( I am not saying we can ’t , but even if ) once kids get to college or even just into their 20s , when they are really searching for themselves intellectually , promoting a culture of science and skepticism can have a great impact .
I think the evidence suggests that we are actually succeeding .
The number of people who show up to skeptical meetings is not only increasing , their average age is dramatically decreasing .
We have a significant following of people in their twenties .
Sure – we have a lot of work to do .
But it ’s not hopeless .
The future , in my opinion , is bright .

About a month ago , I posted a teaser trailer for the upcoming Emma Stone film , Easy A , and wondered if perhaps the film was the next Mean Girls .
The full trailer is here , and the film still looks very promising .

Click to view
Just as Mean Girls tackled the issues behind the weird world of teen girl cliques , Easy A appears to mix social commentary — this time in terms of how virginity , and sexuality in general , is handled in high school — with humor and a touch of sweetness .
If the previews are to be believed , the film takes from some of the best of the genre : the literary update used by Amy Heckerling in Clueless , the frank parental discussions regarding sex seen in Diablo Cody 's Juno , and the holier - than - thou villain in Amanda Bynes , who seems to be modeled after Mandy Moore 's character in Saved !.

So what say you , commenters ?
Are you still excited to see it ?
Or has the trailer not quite met your expectations ?
Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen bei der Arbeitsagentur Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Da gibt es so tolle Arbeitsplätze und dann erfährt niemand etwas davon .
Schade , denn da hätten sich bestimmt auch viele ALG II - Empfänger beworben .
Der gemeine Hartzie hat wenig Zeit sich zu bewerben - neben all den Seifenopern , dem Billigbierkaufen und dem Zigarettenrauchen ist eine Bewerbung nur schwer " dazwischenzuschieben " .
Aber für manchen Job würde selbst der Unterschichtenfernsehenliebhaber sich aufraffen und vielleicht ( aber nur vielleicht ) sich sogar waschen und rasieren bevor er zum Passphotoautomaten wankt .
Das lebend gewordene Klischee würde , getrieben von dem Wunsch , endlich wieder ein vollwertiges Gesellschaftsmitglied mit Erwerbstätigkeit zu werden , zwar nicht sofort aktiv werden , aber je nachdem wie die Ausschreibung lautet , wäre manchmal eben nicht Hopfen und Malz verloren .
Nur dumm , dass diese Verlockungen für den Eintritt ins Erwerbsleben gar nicht erst ihren Weg ins Portal der Arbeitsagentur fanden .
Was im wesentlichen damit zusammenhängen könnte , dass es sich um Jobs bei der Arbeitsagentur handelt , die eben zu gut für den Hartzie gewesen wären .
Handy , zusätzlichen Urlaub , Geschäftswagen und üppige Zusatzvergütungen " um als Arbeitgeberin wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben " sind eben nicht für Jedermann gedacht .
Vielleicht fehlten auch nur die persönlichen Kontakte zu den Entscheidungsträgern .
Es ist jedenfalls erfreulich zu wissen , dass die Arbeitsagentur sich nicht scheut , ihre Angestellten zu Höchstleistungen bei der Arbeitsvermittlung anzuspornen .
Gut , bisher klappt das alles noch nicht perfekt , aber wenn erst der lästige Kündigungsschutz abgebaut , die Mindestlöhne vergessen und die Arbeitspflicht auch für unentgeltlich angebotene Jobs in Privathaushalten eingeführt wurden , dann sind bestimmt die Herren und Damen bei der Arbeitsagentur so erfolgreich gewesen , dass vielleicht noch einmal per Dienstanweisung zu den Vergünstigungen ein Bonus drin ist .
Denn Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen .
While I was doing research for a virtual user interface I was creating in 3D , I spent some time looking at some of the virtual UIs that have come out of Hollywood .
A lot of money and thought goes into their development , so I figured they would make good reference material for my project .
While you ca n’t take the virtual UIs in movies at face value , they do contain some nuggets of information on what the future might hold .
Complexity
I ’ve noticed that UIs in feature films are continually getting more elaborate and complex .
Meanwhile , though , real - world interfaces are getting more simple and intuitive .
It seems an odd contradiction that the futuristic UIs we dream up for movies follow one path , while real world ones are heading down another path .
But the reason for this is simple .
Complexity conveys the impression that a system is very robust and advanced , and a character ’s mastery of a complex system is more impressive than it would be if the system were simple and intuitive .
No matter how complex the system gets , the hero can always operate it expertly , leaving the audience dazzled by the UI and the character ’s skill .
In the real world , though , users are more often like Mr. Magoo than like Tony Stark or ( as in the clip below ) an MI5 agent .
So while high - aptitude , heavily trained users might be the fantasy world for UX professionals , it ’s not the world we live in .
The trend toward complexity in movie UIs does n’t give us much of a preview of the world to come .
Gestural UIs
The most notable use of gestural UIs that I can think of was in Minority Report .
It ’s impressive to see Tom Cruise moving his arms around to call up and manipulate video .
But the large and intricate motions he makes would n’t work in actual practice .
Our arms get tired , and it is hard to make such intricate motions with precision without any form of tactile feedback .
Another issue with this method is that all of the commands Tom Cruise employs are completely memorized .
Systems that do n’t show commands rely completely on memorization and training .
This is faster for an expert but takes a long time to master .
Recalling commands , especially when stressed , can be very challenging .
Gestural UIs will be a part of our future .
They are already present in several devices such as the iPhone and some video game systems , and they ’re in development for televisions .
In order to be successful these UIs will have to be supplemented with menus or be extremely intuitive .
If they are to be a major part of the overall interface they will need to be driven by lazy or small motions that wo n’t tire out a user .
The exception here would be something like the Wii where the gestures are more engaging and getting tired is part of the game .
The XBox Project Natal is a new gaming system that will be gesture driven .
Unlike the Wii ( which uses a remote with an accelerometer to capture movements ) , Natal will use a camera to detect motion .
This may not go over well with users as it does n’t provide any sort of feedback .
Holding a prop steering wheel as you would with the Wii feels more engaging than an imaginary one as you would with Natal .
Eye Tracking UIs
This concept can be seen in the movie Iron Man .
Tony Stark accesses various widgets just by looking at them .
This concept is universal ( cross- cultural ) — just look at something to activate it .
My concern is how the system knows the difference between someone glancing over an item and intentionally focusing on it .
The idea of “ hover intent ” is n’t as applicable since the human eye does n’t scan across a UI and come to rest on a particular spot like a mouse .
Our eyes dart from spot to spot with temporary pauses as they pass over a screen .
This could be worked out by having timer trigger based on the eye movements .
Another issue would be temporary distractions that cause us to look away from the UI would potentially close applications we were working on .
Interactive billboards will be a very likely candidate for this technology ; in fact , a few of them already exist .
Voice Activated UIs
Probably the most famous incarnation of this is Star Trek .
The ship ’s crew can issue almost any command verbally and the ship complies .
This technology is already present in most cell phones , some cars , and computer programs .
If you own any of these systems you may already know some of the current technological pitfalls .
The systems struggle when you speak fast or issue long commands .
They also rely heavily on you speaking with the proper inflection ( which is hard to do when you are panicked , distracted , or sick ) and they user must have commands memorized .
I often only use a couple commands in my car because they are the only ones I can recall while flying down an interstate full of cars .
The only other alternative is asking for a list of commands that is lengthy and distracting .
Hacking Hollywood : The Star Trek Enterprise
On the other hand , these systems are extremely useful when you ca n’t use your hands or have a handicap that prevents you from interacting with the system normally .
The key here in the future will be an easy method of retrieving commands and keeping voice commands short and simple .
Stereoscopy / Holographic UIs
Most recently , you can see these in the movie Avatar and District 9 .
In Avatar , human brains are projected in 3D allowing the doctor to look around at all parts for any abnormalities .
In District 9 , the alien ships are piloted with holographic UIs , something that is especially useful in navigation .
These are a great idea as they help separate content from UI , and separates what is important at the moment and what is n’t .
This can be faked in 2.5D systems as is done now , but with full dimensionality the effect is enhanced as well as allowing the user to create better groupings and spatial mappings .
One trick to this system will be locating the right uses of this technology .
Novelty will not be a good reason to make a UI 3D .
Dealing with geography , multiple dimensions , and multiple axes will be good reasons .
While the keyboard and mouse work just fine as 2D inputs , these UIs will benefit greatly from other forms of 3D input such as multiple cameras comparing imagery to locate users in 3D space , manipulating a device in 3D that contains an accelerometer , or perhaps other current methods of 3D motion capture used in films and games today .
In any of these methodologies , feedback will be important .
Users will need to feel some sort of resistance to know they have pushed a holographic button .
A simple visual indication wo n’t be satisfying enough .
Perhaps a glove that provides feedback will be the solution .
Transparent UIs
Many of the movies that have come out lately feature transparent UIs .
They are very visually stimulating and work for something like a HUD in a jet fighter since you need the UI laid on top of the elements behind it .
However , it does n’t work for a typical screen .
It provides too many distractions when you add the elements on the screen with the complex visual scene and motions occurring behind it .
Large Fonts
Jakob Nielsen included the use of large fonts in his list of top 10 movie UI bloopers .
I do n’t agree with him on this one .
His reasoning that fonts are unnecessarily large so that people in the audience can read them is sound .
However , our culture of computer users is going from a “ leaning forward ” posture to a “ laid - back ” one .
As we buy larger monitors and find more UIs on our television screens combined with wireless input devices , we ’ll need those larger fonts to read the screens from farther away .
Instead of sitting at a desk to interact with a computer , we are doing it more and more from our couches .
Adaptive UIs
The only really good adaptive UI I can think of is the Omega widget in Tony Stark ’s final Iron Man suit .
In the movie , the Omega widget is a single widget that contains all of the information from the previous widgets .
However this one only shows information and options that are currently pertinent .
The easiest UIs are ones where each command has a unique button , but the number of buttons shown is limited to only the current options .
This methodology allows for a tremendous amount of information and commands to be available , but without cluttering the user ’s screen .
Adobe is utilizing this currently in Catalyst and I ’ve seen it in sneak previews of Adobe Rome .
Businessman Albert Gubay aims to create a £ 1bn charity fund
The multi-millionaire founder of Kwik Save is to fulfil a " pact with God " he made as a struggling young man and donate half his fortune to the Church .
Manx - based Albert Gubay , 82 , a life - long Roman Catholic who was born in Wales , has placed his business empire , valued at £ 600 m , into a trust .
The money will be passed into a charitable foundation on his death .
He founded the Kwik Save supermarket chain and has property developments in Liverpool and Manchester .
Mr Gubay , originally from Rhyl , Denbighshire , is ranked 107th on The Sunday Times Rich List in 2009 , with a £ 480 m estate .
Make me a millionaire and you can have half of my money
Albert Gubay 's pact with God Half of his money will go to causes identified by the Roman Catholic Church , with the other half to go to good causes selected at the discretion of the trustees .
He spoke in a 1997 TV documentary about emerging from the Royal Navy after World War II in his demob suit and with £ 80 .
He said he had borrowed £ 100 and had made a pact with God at the time - " make me a millionaire and you can have half of my money " .
Mr Gubay said : " I want to carry on supporting good causes , but my whole focus in the next few years is to work as hard as I can to meet my target of a £ 1bn charity . "
Mr Gubay founded the first Kwik Save supermarket in 1965 and sold it for £ 14 m in 1973 .
The company went into administration in 2007 .
The Albert Gubay Charitable Foundation is chaired by trustee John Nugent who said the millionaire had always been a frugal man who wanted to ensure his money had a purpose .

What are these ?
E-mail this to a friend Printable version
Chances are you have a Facebook page , or if not you have probably thought about creating one .
Privacy is a big concern now online , that ’s why i’m sure you ’ve seen those new public service commercials that show a young teenage girl either walking around telling a bunch of strangers random information about herself or having random people come up saying personal things about her to her .
Privacy is n’t just a concern for teenage girls , it is one that should only be shared by everyone who does anything on the internet .
I ’m not saying do n’t share any personal information on the internet because frankly that ’s what these sites were designed for .
I ’m saying be selective with who you share your information with .
Not everyone i’m friends with on Facebook fits into the same group , so I do n’t want them all to be able to see every bit of information I post there .
That ’s why last year when I started getting really into using Facebook and adding a decent amount of friends I looked into the best way to keep my information restricted to those I wanted to see it .
Now I thought I had it working exactly the way I wanted until recently when I discovered that people I added would have access to certain information that I did n’t want them to until I added them to a specific list .
So I decided to re-evaluate my Facebook privacy settings and as I did so to go through the steps and list them out here so that hopefully I can help others keep their Facebook pages secure and their information private .
The first step is to go under your account and select Edit Friends .
This will bring you to a simple to use interface where you can create lists and manage your friends and pages that are members of those lists .
On the left panel of this page you will see a listing of all the friend actions you can take and below all your lists of friends .
At the top of this page you will also see a button to create a new list .
While creating a new List you will be able to select the friends and pages that you would like to be a member of that list .
You can add members here , but it ’s not as smooth of an interface as doing it within the friends list where you can go through all your friends at once .
I would suggest creating all your lists at once and then going back through all your friends and adding them to your lists .
Make sure to make all the lists you can think of as once you set up your privacy settings it will be a pain to go back and fix them .
Once you have created all your lists you will need to go through all your friends and organize them into lists .
This can be done by going to All Connections in the Edit Friends section and then to the right of each friend ’s name you will either see ‘ Add to List ’ or the number of lists they are currently in .
Now that you have all your friends into specific lists it ’s time to go through and update your privacy settings based on these lists and what information you want each group of friends to see .
To do that go to Account and then to Privacy Settings .
Once you reach the Privacy settings you will see a screen similar to the one below .
The only two options that we care about for this purpose is Profile Information and Contact information .
If you are interested in the other three options I highly encourage you to delve into them further , especially the Applications and Websites section and you can have information being shared about you that you may not realized .
Once you go into one of the options you see the categories that you can manage permissions for .
My biggest complain here is that Facebook lumps Wall Posts , Notes , Photos and Videos all into one category , which irks me because I would much rather them have their own ability to have privacy settings set for .
Once you click on the option to the right of the category you will be presented with a drop down list with 4 options for sharing the specific information ; Everyone , Friends of Friends , Only Friends and Custom .
For our example we will look into the Custom Option as the other three are pretty self explanatory and very broad .
When you select Customize you will be brought to the following Custom Privacy Settings screen .
Now here is where I made my original mistake , this screen gives you the option of selecting who you would like to make the category visible too and who you would like to hide it from .
Originally I had show it to Only Friends and then hide it from specific lists of people , the problem was when people would get added to my friends list they would n’t get properly added to the correct list so they ’d have the ability to view information about me that I did not want them to .
So my new settings include allowing the specific lists of people rather than allowing everyone and then hiding from specifics .
As you can see my six friends lists are all listed here , three are in the list of being able to view and three are in the hide from section because I want to make sure that if I add someone to one of these groups they are absolutely hidden from seeing this category even if they accidentally get added to a different group .
So this is how I ’ve switched my Facebook Privacy settings around and hopefully it helps at least someone else out there do the same to keep their information secure and out of the eyes of people they do n’t want it to be seen by .
If you found this article helpful please share it with someone else so that they can be informed too .
Link ’s predicament casts a long shadow over other China watchers .
“ Three or four times a month I get questions from students : How can I avoid getting on a blacklist like you ? ”
Link said .
He adds that he ’s seen doctoral students avoid writing about democracy in China out of fear of the blacklist .
Jerome Cohen , who teaches Chinese law and society at New York University Law School , has similar impressions .
“ There are writers who I respect who do n’t choose certain subjects because they will engage them in controversy with China , ” he said , adding that Xinjiang , the far western province that has been the site of ethnic and religious unrest , is “ certainly radioactive . ”
For example , several Western contributors to the English - language book “ Xinjiang : China ’s Muslim Borderland ” ( 2004 ) were subsequently denied visas .
It may not even matter what scholars actually write on contentious topics .
“ Visa denials seem to be based on the subject matter more than what the individual says about the subject , ” Cohen said .
While Beijing ’s censorship is well known , the self - censorship of Western writers is shrouded in uneasy silence .
The idea that scholars “ collectively are compromising our academic ideals in order to gain access to China offends people intellectually , but we all do it , ” a professor at a prestigious American university told me in a telephone interview .
He requested anonymity out of fear of alienating not Beijing , but his colleagues in the United States .
This caution shapes the overall body of Western books about China , which some say emphasizes the country ’s economic success over its political repression .
But this may also be a result of a widespread view that the Chinese model , whatever its unsavory aspects , has worked .
“ China is now seen as such a success , ” said Ian Johnson , the author of “ Wild Grass : Three Stories of Change in Modern China ” and winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from China for The Wall Street Journal .
“ I think on a deeper level the books on China reflect the West ’s deeper angst about its own position in the world , and an uncritical view on China that the Chinese themselves often do n’t share . ”
You can still find Western books that take a less rosy view of China , as well as critics of its government who suffer no repercussions .
But Beijing ’s reactions can be unpredictable , which is precisely what makes its brand of censorship so effective .
Those outside China have an even murkier understanding of how it works , and as a result may end up silencing themselves the most .
Ken Chen , the executive director of the Asian American Writers ’ Workshop , describes an event he held in New York for “ Prisoner of the State , ” the posthumously published memoir of Zhao Ziyang , the reformist Communist Party leader who was put under house arrest after the Tiananmen Square crackdown .
At the event , a reporter affiliated with the religious group Falun Gong , which is despised by Beijing , asked to interview two of the book ’s Chinese editors as well as an American professor .
“ What I found interesting and ironic , ” Chen said , “ is that the two Chinese editors felt free to sit in front of the camera for the interview and make some highly controversial pro-democracy statements , but the American professor refused even to be interviewed out of fear of reprisal by the Chinese government . ”
Chinese writers themselves are sometimes caught off guard by Western wariness of Beijing .
Yu Hua , the author of the controversial novel “ Brothers , ” told me that Westerners often ask why his work is n’t banned in China .
“ Chinese readers do n’t think that my books should be forbidden ; instead , Western readers have this viewpoint , ” Yu said in an e-mail message .
Yu has considered various ways to respond when asked why his work is n’t banned .
He said he now goes with the simplest answer : “ I do n’t know , either . ”
There are a variety of estimates as to the total spillage from the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
As of yesterday , they were all significantly losses worse than the 10.8 million gallons of crude the drunk captain of the Exxon Valdez spilled .
The range is 23.2 million gallons by the US government , to the worst case scenario of BP itself at 92.5 million gallons .
And counting .
When this is done , it will dwarf the Valdez in total spillage , economic an d environmental damage .

Size of Oil Spill Underestimated , Scientists Say
JUSTIN GILLIS
NYT , May 13 , 2010
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/us/14oil.html
About the Oil Slick Areas Shown on the Map : The “ probable extent ” of the oil slick is an estimate by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of where oil is mostly likely to go based on wind and ocean current forecasts , as well as analysis of aerial photography and satellite imagery .
The “ observed extent ” show areas where oil was visible on the surface of the water during aerial surveys of the Gulf .
The observed extents are not available every day .
The extents may vary widely from day to day because of changes in wind patterns and ocean currents .
The loop currents are from NOAA and from Roffer ’s Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service .
Rattner , who helped craft the federal rescues of General Motors and Chrysler , left the Obama administration abruptly last year .
This morning , the private equity firm he co-founded , Quadrangle Partners , agreed to pay $ 7 million to settle allegations it made illegal payments to a New York state official and a political consultant in exchange for millions of dollars in pension investments .
But the settlement specifically excludes Rattner , who Cuomo says is no longer with the firm and remains under investigation .
What 's more , Quadrangle issued a scathing statement against its co-founder .
" We wholly disavow the conduct engaged in by Steve Rattner , " the statmement says .
" That conduct was inappropriate , wrong and unethical . "
The statement says Rattner hired former new York political operative Hank Morris to arrange the investment deal .
Rattner also allegedly arranged an $ 88 thousand payment to the brother of former New York State Chief Investment Officer David Loglisci , for the DVD distribution rights to a low - budget film called " Chooch . "
Loglisci pleaded guilty last month to a single felony count .
Morris has denied wrongdoing .
Rattner 's counsel , Jamie S. Gorelick , said his client " does not agree with the characterization of events released today , including those contained in Quadrangle 's statement . "
" Mr. Rattner shares with the New York Attorney General the goal of eliminating public pension fund practices that are not in the public interest .
He looks forward to the full resolution of this matter , " Gorelick said .
So , in a recent editorial , the FT ’s Great Thinker , Martin Wolf , has been fretting that we are about to undergo a period of what he calls ‘ financial repression ’ as insolvent governments take ever more draconian measures in the vain attempt to forestall the inexorable workings of economic law .
Funny how this never seems to have occurred to him and his fellow nomenklatura when they were all deriding us Austrians in 2007 / 8 for arguing that the best means of resolving the banking crisis was simply to adhere to an austere policy minimalism which would offer only the most unavoidably last - ditch safeguards to the innocent bystanders , while otherwise insisting on the rigorous and universal application of accounting standards .
Then , we said , we should insist upon an unflinching economic triage , pursued through the bankruptcy courts , for all those who could not pass the inspection .
For our temerity , Mr. Wolf and his ilk flung the tired old ad hominem of ‘ Liquidationists ’ at us , while trotting out the Golden Calf of Keynes and invoking all the other Philosopher King rhetoric about how the beneficent state could effect a rescue from the ‘ market ’ failure ( actually , an oft - repeated implosion of unbridled financial corporatism ) which would otherwise engulf us all .
But , pass on a few years and now that the respectable establishment pairing of Reinhart and Rogoff have published a quasi-empirical compendium of the many historical precursors of which most modern , pseudo - scientist , New Keynesian , DSGE modellers are so lamentably ignorant , we find that Mr. Wolf is beginning to despair of Leviathan ’s ability to compensate for the widespread malfeasance in which it was itself necessarily complicit all along .
So it is that we have passed from throwing a rather notional dollop of ‘ taxpayers ’ money ’ at the banks – originally only theirs to the extent that the copious central bank creation of that money as the core of the crisis response was potentially diminishing the worth of the stock of it already in said taxpayers ’ possession – to lifting money directly from their pockets , whether by taxing them more heavily or denying them their accustomed easy access to an over lavish public trough .
In the meanwhile , however , the problems have only grown larger – the debt mountains higher , the political entanglements more Gordian , the perverse incentives more corrosive – than they were back when Lehman was thrown to the wolves by way of misdirection from the conjurer ’s trick of using AIG as a conduit to make most of Dick Fuld ’s more politically adept competitors whole again .
So now , with typical Collectivist inconsistency , the fear seems to be that the banks will have the constituents of their balance sheets dictated ; that pension funds will be made first to serve the state , and only afterwards their subscribers ; that ‘ interest rate ceilings will be imposed ’ ; and that the free movement of capital will be hemmed about .
Forgive the cynicism , but is n’t this shopping list exactly what , not too long ago , the interventionist pundits and ‘ Kathedersozialisten ’ were , to a man , proffering as the solution to , not the source of , all our woes ?
Thus the decline of the market order ( in truth a process which occurs when those quintessentially non-market giants , the state - cosseted , fractional reserve banks , are increasing their unbacked , forced - currency lending , not when they are restricting it ) leads , with a grim inevitability , to the defeat of the Versorgungstaat which had presumed to supplant it .
Nothing daunted , the governing elite predictably refuses to learn from this reversal or rein in its rapacious political ambitions , but crosses more fully over from the illusory compromise of the ‘ Third Way ’ into ever more totalitarian behaviour .
Though the transition to the Zwangswirtschaft may initially take the form of relatively trivial irritants such as banning ‘ naked ’ short - selling , it is soon being reinforced with more sinister , Big Brother measures such as imposing restrictions on the amount of the state ’s own legal tender deemed acceptable in ostensibly private transactions .
From thence it is but a small step to imposing foreign exchange restrictions , capital exit levies , and enacting all manner of other revocations of basic human freedoms as Roepke long ago made plain .
Such a ‘ Vampire Economy ’ – regardless of the false distinction of whether the overseers consider themselves as belonging to the Right or the Left – always has for its motto : Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz .
By comparison , a liberal dose of ‘ liquidationism ’ might seem a relatively mild restorative , eh , Mr Wolf ?

* Amount of oil leaking unchanged since top kill started
* BP preparing for next effort to cap Gulf of Mexico well ( Adds quotes , details )
FOURCHON BEACH , La./HOUSTON , May 29 ( Reuters ) - BP Plc's BP.LBP.N " top kill " has not stopped a Gulf of Mexico oil leak and the company is assessing whether to continue or move on to something else , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said on Saturday .
“ I do n’t think the amount of oil coming out has changed , ” he said at a news conference at Fourchon Beach , Louisiana , about 72 hours after the effort began on Wednesday .
“ Just by watching it , we do n’t believe it ’s changed . ”
A live feed of the leak , available on BP ’s website , showed preparations Saturday morning for BP ’s next step .
An underwater robot gripped a saw near the leaking pipe atop a failed blowout preventer .
BP ’s next option is to slice off the pipe and place a cap over the opening .
As the camera moved around , the live feed later showed thick plumes coming from both leaks .
The cap operation is known as the lower marine riser package cap , and Suttles confirmed that BP had been preparing for that step “ all along . ”
“ If we have to go to it , we can do it as quickly as possible , ” he said .
BP has said previously the company was “ planning in parallel , ” or getting ready for other options while working on the top kill -- the injection of heavy drilling fluid and solid materials , like shredded rubber and golf balls , into the blowout preventer to try to push oil and gas back down the well .
Suttles stopped short of saying the top kill has failed .
“ We ’ve said all along this may or may not be successful , ” he said .
Suttles will give another update at a daily briefing , scheduled for 6 p.m. CDT ( 2300 GMT ) , a BP spokesman said .
Suttles also said the company believes oil and gas are being smothered when BP is pumping fluids and materials “ at a high rate ” into the well .
RELIEF WELL TWO MONTHS AWAY
The top kill is BP 's latest effort to quell the leak , which was discovered after Transocean Ltd's RIG.N Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers .
Since Wednesday , BP has periodically pumped fluids and materials , and monitored pressure between pumpings .
Suttles has said higher pressure indicates the leak is unchecked , while lower pressure indicates progress in beating back the leak .
If the cap option proceeds , once the bent pipe is cut off the lower marine riser package , a containment cap and seal would be placed on the opening .
Captured oil and gas would be channeled through a pipe that connects the cap to a drillship , where it would be stored .
“ We have n’t done it to this date because we needed the diagnostic data to make sure we did n’t make the situation worse , ” Suttles said on Saturday .
He said the company was also preparing to place a working blowout preventer on top of the failed one if the cap option fizzles .
Drilling continues on one of two planned relief wells intended to intercept the leaking well and plug it far beneath the seabed .
BP expects the first well to be finished by late July or early August .

Hens poke their heads out of their cages at a research farm in Montmorenci , Ind .
Under new standards , only 7.5 % of chicken carcasses at a food plant would be allowed to test positive for salmonella , down from 20 % allowed since 1996 .
HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER
As many as 39,000 fewer Americans could get campylobacter and 26,000 fewer could get salmonella poisoning from chicken and turkey under new food safety rules announced Monday by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack .
The bacteria , which can be life - threatening , are two of the most common causes of food - borne illness .
" These standards will have probably the greatest public impact for consumers ' health since anything USDA has adopted in the last 15 years , " says Caroline Smith DeWaal , food safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington , D.C. FOOD POISONING : '09 a mixed year for food - borne illnesses
Under the new standards , only 7.5 % of chicken carcasses at a plant would be allowed to test positive for salmonella , down from 20 % allowed since 1996 .
Salmonella levels in chickens were tested at 7.1 % nationally in 2009 , says Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council .
Salmonella can cause diarrhea , abdominal cramps and fever and can be life - threatening , especially for pregnant women , babies and the elderly .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 1.4 million cases of salmonella and more than 500 deaths annually in the USA .

The new rules for campylobacter , which had not been regulated before , are that companies fail if they have more than 10 % positives for " highly contaminated " carcasses and 46 % for " low level " contamination .
The USDA estimates that about 50 % of poultry plants are now at this level .
In 2008 , an estimated 40.2 % chickens tested positive for campylobacter , which causes diarrhea , cramping , abdominal pain and fever .
The CDC estimates campylobacter infects 2.4 million Americans a year and kills 124 .
The poultry industry will work hard to fulfill customers ' expectations " for safe and wholesome chicken , " Lobb says .

Bayern Munich Boss Louis Van Gaal Rages At Postponement Of Olympique Lyonnais – Monaco Game
The Dutchman believes that “ it ’s not fair ” that OL will be given a break prior to their concluding meeting against FCB ...
80 + proud owners in the Riverwalk at Redmond Washington condo complex have had enough and are ready to bail , en masse .
I received news of this event from Matthew who writes ...
Hi Mish
I am good friends with an owner in the Riverwalk at Redmond condo complex and I also used to rent there , which is how I got wind of this story .
It turns out the developer sold out the complex , dissolved his LLC , and is living somewhere in the Caribbean .
Meanwhile , unit owners are in the hole by as much as 50 % of their purchase price , not counting needed repairs of as much as $ 50,000 per unit .
There are major defects that require about $ 4.1 million in renovation work to address underlying ‘ envelope ’ issues that cause leaks and mold issues in 11 units .
The consultants said the exterior on the entire complex had to be replaced .
The home owners association ( HOA ) discussed five alternatives .
1 ) Sue the developer .
Since the developer left the country so there ’s no one to sue .
2 ) Pay the $ 4.1 million maintenance with a loan .
However , no bank will issue a loan because the HOA fund has a high delinquency rate and not everyone is paying their dues nor are they paying on time .
3 ) Make each home owner pay approximately $ 45,000 .
Who would be willing to do that when everyone 's mortgage is seriously underwater ?
4 ) Liquidate the entire complex , forcing everyone into foreclosure .
5 ) Opt for Band - Aid fixes .
Go into each unit , rip it apart and fix the problem .
However , the consultants have said that the damages will eventually spread to all units because the problem is structural .
The HOA has gone this route in the past but the problems in 11 units keep coming back .

" Yo pensaba que esto sólo les pasaba a los actores " , dijo ayer por la mañana el mexicano José Emilio Pacheco al ver la nube de fotógrafos que le recibió en el auditorio del Ministerio de Cultura .
Entró acompañado de la titular de la casa , Ángeles González - Sinde , para participar en un encuentro en el que hubo preguntas de la prensa , lectura de poemas a cargo del último Premio Cervantes y charla distendida y de altura entre el galardonado , la ministra y el presentador del acto , Ignacio Elguero , poeta y director de Radio Nacional .
Pacheco empezó anunciando que no tenía mucho que decir pero terminó hablando de todo : de sus libros más recientes - Tarde o temprano , que reúne su poesía completa , y la novela corta Las batallas en el desierto ( ambos en Tusquets ) - , de su abuela , de su preocupación por la violencia en México y por la salud de sus amigos Sergio Pitol y Carlos Monsiváis .
También de su admiración por Miguel Delibes : " La literatura sirve para imaginar las vidas que no vivimos .
Admiro mucho a Delibes .
Sólo una adversidad : él era cazador y yo , anti-caza .
Pero la belleza de su escritura hace que uno venza los prejuicios " .
Así , poco a poco fue desgranando algunas de las claves de una obra que le valió el premio más importante de las letras en español .
El próximo viernes se le entregarán los Reyes en Alcalá de Henares .
Poeta no es una profesión .
" Que alguien escriba poesía es un absoluto misterio porque todo está en contra .
Cuando uno tiene 14 años tiene tanta vergüenza de escribir que no se atreve a decírselo a sus compañeros de clase .
Luego tampoco puede .
No parece serio .
Una vez al hacerme un carnet dije que era escritor y la funcionaria me dijo : " ¡Eso no es profesión ! " Y puso : " Trabaja por su cuenta " .
Privilegios y esperanzas .
" No quiero quejarme y decir que la situación de la poesía es terrible porque miren todos estos privilegios que tengo ahora .
Pero la verdad es que , usando un verbo tecnocrático que detesto , esto no estaba contemplado .
Cuando empecé a escribir no pensaba en publicar en Tusquets , ni en recibir el premio Reina Sofía , ni el Cervantes .
Por eso actuaba con gran libertad , porque no tenía ninguna esperanza más que la de seguir escribiendo " .
Enemigo de sí mismo .
" Ya somos todo aquello / contra lo que luchamos a los 20 años " .
Mucha gente me ha recordado ahora , sí , estos versos del poema Antiguos compañeros se reúnen .
Por suerte nunca satanicé los premios literarios " .
Discurso secreto .
" ¿ Que qué puedo avanzar del discurso del viernes ?
¡ Nada !
Llevo seis meses repitiendo las mismas cosas .
Agradezco la atención , pero si digo algo es que no lo voy a escribir .
Nabokov decía : " Si hablo soy un niño de siete año .
Si escribo , soy un gran autor " .
Tenía razón .
Yo necesito ver lo que escribo , para corregir .
Y hablando no le puedes decir a la gente : " Borra eso , que te lo digo mejor " .
Los 15 minutos de Andy Warhol .
" Me temo que a la edad que tengo voy a tener que guardar el dinero del Cervantes para gastos de hospital .
Veo enfermo a mi amigo Carlos Monsiváis y me doy cuenta de que ese es mi porvenir inmediato .
Ojalá se recupere pronto .
Sin Monsiváis no se entiende la cultura mexicana de los últimos 50 años .
A mí , me llegaron los 15 minutos de fama de los que hablaba Andy Warhol , pero me llegaron a un cuarto para las 12 .
O sea , que tengo un cuarto de hora de provecho " .
Versos para el teléfono móvil .
" Yo ya no pertenezco al mundo de ustedes , llego tarde , con la tecnología es como tratar de aprender un idioma de mayor : puedes hablarlo , pero siempre con acento .
No obstante , los nuevos medios pueden ayudar a propagar un género breve como la poesía .
Hasta el móvil puede ser un instrumento de poesía .
Pero no perdamos de vista la obsolescencia de los aparatos .
Todavía recuerdo cómo hace 20 años me quedé asombrado al ver salir un fax del teléfono .
Hoy es tan antiguo como una locomotora de vapor " .
Desastre de mundo .
" ¿ Cómo veo el mundo de hoy ?
¡ Desastroso !
Cuando a finales del año pasado publiqué el libro de poemas Como la lluvia [ editado en España por Visor ] mucha gente me dijo que era muy pesimista , pero si uno mira todo lo que ha pasado en este trimestre - los terremotos de Haití y Chile , la violencia de México ...- se da cuenta de que todo lo escribí parece de color de rosa , cosas de un optimista absoluto .
Alguna vez dije que el siglo XX se podía situar entre un título de Dickens y otro de Balzac , entre grandes esperanzas y las ilusiones perdidas " .
México : la eterna violencia .
" La nube de ceniza que se cierne sobre Europa me tuvo sin saber si podría venir , pero eso no es nada al lado de la violencia que sufre México .
Lo terrible es que va ocupando hasta los oasis .
Piensen en Cuernavaca , un lugar al que la gente iba a descansar .
Siempre se decía que era la ciudad de la eterna primavera .
Hoy se dice que es la ciudad de la eterna balacera .
Se ha vuelto tan terrible como Ciudad Juárez " .
Poesía para los sicarios .
" No creo haber influido en la historia de la literatura mexicana .
En la sociedad , seguro que no , aunque me hubiera gustado escribir un poema que sirviera para parar la violencia .
La sensibilidad por la poesía , como por la música , se tiene o no se tiene .
Yo conozco a grandes intelectuales que no la tienen , pero cuando fui al festival de poesía se Medellín , en Colombia , me llevaron , primero a un estadio con 12.000 personas y luego , a una escuela secundaria en la que los chicos eran sicarios ( deben de estar todos muertos ) , y tenían una gran sensibilidad poética .
¿ Una definición de poesía ?
No tengo , lo siento .
Yo escribo porque me pasa algo .
Un epigrama griego dice que la poesía es pintura que habla y la pintura , poesía del silencio .
Antes decía yo que todo conspira contra ella , pero la poesía está en el propio lenguaje .
Basta pensar en lo que preguntan los niños .
Cosas como : ¿ A dónde van los días que pasan ? "
La pregunta quedó ahí , flotando , sólo la ministra de cultura aventuró una respuesta : " A la poesía de José Emilio Pacheco " .

Image caption Many Pakistanis are angry at the ' Draw Muhammad ' competition
Pakistan has blocked the popular video sharing website YouTube because of its " growing sacrilegious content " .
Access to the social network Facebook has also been barred as part of a crackdown on websites seen to be hosting un -Islamic content .
On Wednesday a Pakistani court ordered Facebook to be blocked because of a page inviting people to draw images of the Prophet Muhammad .
Some Wikipedia pages are also now being restricted , latest reports say .
Correspondents say it remains to be seen how successful the new bans will be in Pakistan and whether citizens find a way round them .
Because YouTube is a platform for free expression of all sorts , we take great care when we enforce our policies .
YouTube statement Pakistanis divided over bans
YouTube says it is " looking into the matter and working to ensure that the service is restored as soon as possible " .
The site was briefly blocked in Pakistan in 2008 - ostensibly for carrying material deemed offensive to Muslims .
Facebook said on Wednesday that the content did not violate its terms .
There have been protests in several Pakistani cities against the Facebook competition .
' Derogatory material '
The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority said it had ordered internet service providers to " completely shut down " YouTube and prevent Facebook from being viewed within Pakistan .
It said the move came only after " all possible avenues " within its jurisdiction had been used .
Analysis Countries , companies and even individuals can easily block various websites if they choose .
China has a notorious firewall in place to control internet activity and many Western organisations choose to block access to social networks in the office .
In this case , Pakistan will probably have instructed its internet service providers ( ISPs ) to prevent any pages containing the phrase " youtube.com " in the address from loading on web browsers .
There are various ways of implementing a block and sometimes it can go awry - Pakistan accidentally pulled YouTube offline around the world in 2008 when it tried to implement an internal ban by " hijacking " the youtube.com address in order to re-direct links to a different page .
There are also ways to duck underneath a ban - most commonly by accessing the internet via a " proxy " server based abroad .
This can fool an ISP into thinking a computer is actually based in another country and therefore not subject to the ban .
" Before shutting down ( YouTube ) , we did try just to block particular URLs or links , and access to 450 links on the internet were stopped , " said PTA spokesman Khurram Ali Mehran .
" But the blasphemous content kept appearing so we ordered a total shut down . "
One of the links blocked is to a BBC News website article about Pakistani soldiers apparently beating Taliban suspects in a video posted on Facebook .
A YouTube spokesperson said : " You Tube offers citizens the world over a vital window on cultures and societies and we believe people should not be denied access to information via video .
" Because YouTube is a platform for free expression of all sorts , we take great care when we enforce our policies .
Content that violates our guidelines is removed as soon as we become aware of it . "
The controversy began with the Facebook feature called " Everybody Draw Muhammad Day " .
Depictions of the Prophet are forbidden in Islam .
A message on the item 's information page said it was not " trying to slander the average Muslim " .
" We simply want to show the extremists that threaten to harm people because of their Muhammad depictions that we 're not afraid of them . "
The page contains drawings and caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and characters from other religions , including Hinduism and Christianity .
" Such malicious and insulting attacks hurt the sentiments of Muslims around the world and cannot be accepted under the garb of freedom of expression , " Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said about the page .
Facebook said in a statement that it would take action if any content " becomes an attack on anyone , including Muslim people " , but that in this case its policies were not violated .
" Facebook values free speech and enables people to express their feelings about a multitude of topics , even some that others may find distasteful or ignorant , " the statement said .
A hotline has been set up in Pakistan , asking members of the public to phone in if they see offensive material anywhere .
Islamic parties say they are planning nationwide protests in Pakistan .
Five people were killed in the country in 2006 during violent demonstrations following publication of Muhammad cartoons in a Danish newspaper .
BBC website readers have been telling us what they think of the ban .
Here is a selection of their comments .
I am a university student and use Facebook and Youtube as a way of interacting and staying in touch with friends .
But all students are willing to give up this source of entertainment for the sake of principles .
Zahara Sohail Khan from Lahore , Pakistan
The strict policies of Facebook regarding racism and harassment are only for individual users .
Now a page on Facebook is harassing billions of Muslims world - over and Facebook 's management is not bothered .
What hypocrisy .
Maroof from Lahore , Pakistan
I am a Muslim girl , just a normal student .
When my religion is insulted , it is me who is insulted .
I can live without Facebook but I definitely cannot live in humiliation .
I am with my country on this and if Facebook does not take action on this , then ban or no ban , I would never go back to it anyway .
Maham Tanveer from Rawalpindi , Pakistan
As a Muslim growing up in America , I am frustrated that neither side takes the time to understand the other .
For Muslims , directly insulting the sacred is beyond petty ' freedom of speech ' privileges we mortals have .
In the West , people think arrogantly that they are free to say anything without limits whatsoever , no matter how ridiculous or insulting .
Qureshi from Florida , USA
I am now living in Karachi , Pakistan , and I never thought I 'd have to endure blocks on websites ever again after I moved from Saudi Arabia .
Even though I have found a way to access blocked websites , I can't believe the government would put a ban on them .
Omar from Saudi Arabia
I did use Youtube and Facebook but I have removed my accounts from both sites and have communicated this to all my family and friends who have been using them .
Hassan Mehmood from Pakistan
This is ridiculous .
I find these to be ill - advised measures .
Blocking websites in countries does not prevent the content from existing in the first place .
I think the Pakistani government should move to ban pornography ( which is still easily available ) before they ban Facebook and YouTube which are obviously on the better side of human development .
Myra from Karachi , Pakistan
This has been outrageous and infuriating .
I feel disconnected from the world , from my friends , and from the easiest modes of expression available today .
Uzma from Lahore , Pakistan
It is not only Facebook and YouTube which have been blocked in Pakistan , but parts of the BBC website too , for example the link given below , many stories about Pakistan and the entire South - East Asia section .
In fact , I am forced to use a proxy server just to post this comment .
As a Pakistani , I feel very frustrated and angry about this crackdown on the internet and can only hope that this is temporary .

South Korea 's Lee Myung - bak announced his retaliation plan for the attack on the Cheonan this morning in Seoul .
Although restrained like he has been for the past two months , the president finally referred to the possibility of war :
" If our territorial waters , airspace or territory are militarily violated , we will immediately exercise our right of self - defense . "
Moving from " passive defense to proactive deterrence " is a significant shift for a country that seems to get pushed around by North Korea every year .
Just this month South Korea fired warning shots when North Korean ships ventured across the border .
On the other hand , if Kim Jong - il were to refrain from lighting the powderkeg for a year or so , he'd be getting off easy .
The rest of Lee 's retaliation involves a ban on sand and fish imports .
South Korea will continue to share an industrial complex with North Korea and continue sending foreign aid across the border .
Lee will also bring his case to the UN , but the UN can do little without the support of China .
Here 's the rest of Lee 's statement , from Joongang Daily :
" From this moment , no North Korean ship will be allowed to make passage through any of the shipping lanes in the waters under our control , which has been allowed by the Inter - Korean Agreement on Maritime Transportation , ” Lee said .
“ The sea routes meant for inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation must never again be used for armed provocations . ”
“ In close consultations with the nations concerned , the government will refer this matter to the UN Security Council , so that the international community can join us in holding the North accountable , ” Lee said .
“ Many countries around the world have expressed their full support for our position . ”
“ Trade and exchanges between the Republic of Korea and North Korea will also be suspended , ” Lee said .
“ However , we will continue to provide assistance for infants and children , ” he said .
“ Matters pertaining to the Kaesong Industrial Complex will be duly considered , taking its unique characteristics into consideration . ”
England 's Daily Mail is n't just a source of funny Internet posts , it 's also a veritable font of hysterical , nutso reporting about " epidemics " of child abuse , immigration , welfare cheats , violent crime , etc and so forth .
They 're not solely responsible for the rise of authoritarianism and surveillance and the erosion of civil liberties here , but they 're sure in the vanguard .
Here 's some sticker template for decorating the free copies of the Wail that you encounter in your life .
I wish these were a ) funnier and b ) better designed .
I have a feeling that , like the cigarette - pack ads they 're meant to ape , they 're just going to come across as finger - wagging .
Got ideas for improving them ?

BP has succeeded in capturing “ some ” oil and gas by inserting a mile - long tube into the main Gulf of Mexico leak , but would not say if it was a significant percentage of the gusher or just a dribble .
Despite the uncertainty , it was still the first tangible sign of success in more than three weeks of efforts to prevent at least 210,000 gallons of oil from spewing unabated into the sea each day and feeding a massive slick off the coast of Louisiana .
ADVERTISEMENT
BP senior executive vice president Kent Wells refused to be drawn on quantity Sunday , but confirmed that after a temporary hitch in which the tube became dislodged overnight , siphoning operations were up and running once again .
“ We will look to … capture as much of the oil as we can , ” he told reporters in Houston , Texas .
“ At this point , we do n’t know what percentage we will capture ” by the process , in which the oil was sucked up as if through a straw to the giant ship .
A BP statement said simply that the four - inch ( 10 - centimeter ) diameter tube inserted into the 21 - inch leaking pipe using undersea robots had captured “ some amounts of oil and gas . ”
Wells added that the BP crews “ do n’t have any idea at this point ” how much crude is being collected and would only have a better estimate in coming days .
“ The oil was stored on board the Discoverer Enterprise drill ship 5,000 feet ( 1,500 meters ) above on the water ’s surface , and natural gas was burned through a flare system on board the ship , ” the statement said .

The Barack Obama administration seemed unimpressed however , saying BP ’s latest efforts , even if they manage to slow the leak , would not permanently stop the underwater geyser .
“ This technique is not a solution to the problem , and it is not yet clear how successful it may be , ” said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement .
“ We are closely monitoring BP ’s test with the hope that it will contain some of the oil , but at the same time , federal scientists are continuing to provide oversight and expertise to BP as they move forward with other strategies to contain the spill and stop the flow of oil , ” they said .

The Deepwater Horizon rig , leased by BP from Transocean , has been gushing oil since an explosion on April 20 ripped through the drilling platform and caused it to sink two days later .
Eleven workers were killed .
Fresh analysis of enormous plumes of oil under the surface suggest the spill may be far worse than previously estimated .

One was reported to be 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) long , three miles wide and 300 feet thick .
Researchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology said the plumes were “ perhaps due to the deep injection of dispersants which BP has stated that they are conducting . ”
Response crews have so far used some 560,000 gallons of the controversial chemical dispersants , spraying them onto surface oil and also directly into the leak in a bid to break up the oil .

“ The oil still exists , it ’s just spread in smaller pieces , ” Aaron Viles , campaign director for the Gulf Restoration Network , a coalition of environmental groups , told AFP .
“ It could have a significant impact on the marine life of the Gulf of Mexico . ”
University of Georgia researcher Samantha Joye , who is on a scientific mission to gather details about the looming environmental disaster , told The New York Times that oxygen levels have dropped 30 percent near the plumes , in an “ alarming ” trend that is endangering marine life .
But Andrew Gowers , head of group media for BP , dismissed reports that “ speculate ” on the giant plumes .
He said officials “ had no confirmation ” of oil clumping together in mid-ocean areas .
On Sunday a large concert in New Orleans was drawing crowds to support Gulf fishermen , whose livelihoods are threatened by the oil spill , with rocker Lenny Kravitz heading the line - up .

Officials said some 19,000 personnel and more than 650 vessels have been deployed to try to mitigate the negative effects of the spill on the Gulf shoreline and wildlife .
Meanwhile , the US Coast Guard told AFP that oil was washing ashore in at least two new locations — Whiskey Island , Louisiana and Long Beach , Mississippi .
Engineers are mulling several different options to seal the main leak , which has spewed out an estimated five million gallons so far according to the most conservative estimates , and prevent the giant slick from destroying ecologically fragile wetlands and nature reserves .
A relief well that would divert the flow and allow the well to be permanently sealed may not be ready until August .
Most of earnings came from book sales , as Obama family discloses assets of $ 7.7 m and charitable donations of $ 329,000
It used to be that American presidents served their terms , wrote the book and hoped to rake in the royalties .
George Bush is working on his now – although it should be noted his wife , Laura , has beaten him to the bestseller list with her new tome .
But , as ever , Barack Obama is different .
He wrote the book – two of them , in fact – and then became president , earning himself a lot of money last year .
The president reported income of $ 5.5 m ( £ 3.8 m ) last year on his tax returns , most of it from Dreams from My Father and Audacity of Hope , his two bestselling books that have continued to be popular , proving that in contrast to the track record of presidential accounts , Obama can both write and has something to say .
According to the White House financial disclosure forms , the Obamas declared assets of $ 7.7 m , not including the family home in Chicago .
But the assets do include the family dog , Bo , who is valued at $ 1,600 and filed under " gifts , reimbursements , and travel expenses " .
The Portuguese water dog was a present from the late Senator Edward Kennedy .
Obama declared his Nobel medal and diploma ( recorded as " value not readily ascertainable " ) .
The $ 1.4 m cheque he collected in Oslo last December was donated to charity .
The Obamas also donated a total of $ 329,100 to 40 different charities including the United Negro College Fund and the aid agency , Care .
The president 's other declared gifts include $ 500 in travel expenses from the National Association of Rock Collectors to attend its conference and a $ 300 leather briefcase from a Frank Jones of San Francisco , who is recorded asa " personal friend " .
The Obamas also have some retirement savings accounts and college savings for their daughters , Malia , 11 , and Sasha , eight .
Most of the book income is invested in US treasury bills .
Five days before he was sworn in as president , Obama received a $ 500,000 advance from his publisher .
The declaration records that he makes 15 % of the hardcover sale price in the US and up to 10 % on paperbacks .
Obama 's income from his books far outpaces his annual presidential salary of $ 400,000 which met only a fraction of the Obamas joint income tax bill of nearly $ 2 m .
The vice - president , Joe Biden , did not do nearly so well .
The Bidens reported income last year was $ 333,182 .
But he did get some unique gifts including a 1928 first edition of James Joyce 's Anna Livia Plurabelle , signed by the author and valued at $ 3,500 .
Margaret Spanel , a 97 year old widow from New Jersey , gave Biden the book after watching him make a campaign speech in which he said that Joyce was his favourite poet .
13 - Year - Old Prodigy Cries Discrimination After University Denied Him Ecology Class
Teen blames professor for not wanting him to travel abroad as part of course .
March 12 , 2010  --
He may be young but Colin Carlson said he is no stranger to discrimination .
Carlson , a gifted child , was at age 12 turned away from his dream school , Connecticut College , amid concerns that he was too young for a dormitory , even though he agreed to live off campus with his mother .
Now , more than a year later , 13 - year - old Carlson said he has faced trouble again at the University of Connecticut , where he maintains a 3.9 GPA as a double - degree candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology , and in environmental studies .
The university barred his entry into an African field ecology class that required a three - week trip to Johannesburg , South Africa , because the professor thought Carlson was too young for the journey , Carlson and his mother , Jessica Offir , said .
Offir had intended to accompany her son on the trip at her own expense to make " the university more comfortable , " she said .
Denying her son enrollment in the class was a violation of state and federal law and of the university 's own anti-discrimination policy , Offir said .
" To base your opinion of a person on his age is no different than to base it on their sex , religion , race or group membership , " she said .
University of Connecticut spokesman Michael Kirk declined to be interviewed but said in a written statement , " The university does n't comment on pending claims or litigation .
Speaking generally , when it comes to study - abroad programs , student safety is our first concern . "
The trouble began in November when Carlson was not admitted to a class that he said had been promised to him prior to his admission to UConn , said Offir , who has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights .
" He applied for the course that he had his eye on before he matriculated and that we 'd mentioned by name to the administrators as something he wanted to do , " Offir said .
Gifted Child Colin Carlson Wants to go to South Africa
But when Carlson did not hear back from the professor , despite what Offir referred to as the professor 's publicized plea that he had room for more students , they began to wonder what went wrong .
Carlson was called in for a meeting with Denielle Burl , the university 's director of risk management , who told them that the professor teaching the class did not want a 13 year old taking the course , Offir said .
" She [ Burl ] expressed to him [ Carlson ] that [ his case ] had landed on her desk when [ the professor ] was told by the Office of Study Abroad that one of the kids on his class list was 13 and he did n't want a student who was 13 , " she said .
" She [ Burl ] said , ' Can I dissuade you , ' and , ' Is there anything else you can take , ' and Colin kept saying ' No , no no , ' " said Offir .
Messages left for the professor of the course were not immediately returned and Burl directed ABCNews.com directly to the university 's spokesman .
Officially , Carlson is a sophomore but already is a senior based on credits .
He plans to graduate in the spring of 2012 .
Offir and Carlson say this is the first negative experience they 've had at UConn and that they want the university to correct its mistake and allow Carlson to study in the same capacity as other students , regardless of his age .
" People treat me like they would any other student and I 'm really happy at UConn , " Carlson said .
" So it was really kind of a shock when this all came down because this is the first negative encounter I 've had .
" If you think about the two degrees I 'm doing , I have to see how communities react to the environment , " he said .
" And in order to do that , traveling is really , really important and the one thing that made this particular class so appealing is that it will be in a country that has certain civil issues and I would be able to study how conservation plays in to it . "
Since not being admitted into his first choice class , Carlson has enrolled in a class taught by Carl Schlichting that also has a travel component to South Africa , albeit Cape Town .
While Schlichting is so far happy to have Carlson in his class , Carlson and his mother worry that their complaint about discrimination might result in retaliation by the university and might get Carlson kicked out of his class .
Mother Goes Public to Help Others , Too
Carlson is also concerned about fulfilling his degree requirements because Schlichting 's class does not meet the same requirements as the original class .
Offir said she hopes that by going public with her son's problems as a prodigy child at a large university , she might help other children going through the same thing .
" Colin is not the only one of his kind , these kids suffer , " Offir said .
" We call them prodigies because they 're one in a million but there are really many more like him .
" We do n't want other kids to go through what Colin has had to go through , " Offir said .
" People like him can very happily navigate through college as long as people do n't try to throw obstacles in their path . "
The National Association for Gifted Children estimated that there are about 3 million academically gifted children in grades K - 12 in the United States , about 6 percent of the student population .
There 's no similar information available for college students .
The association 's executive director , Nancy Green , speaking generally about universities nationwide , said that because of the lack of precedent in accommodating gifted students , many academic institutions still use a lot of caution when dealing with cases like Carlson's .
" Some of these kids , while they 're not adults yet , are ready for a higher level of challenge and we can't just ignore that because it is inconvenient , " Green said .
" These kids need a challenging curriculum that really is n't aged - base . "
The only benefit of hitting rock bottom is you can't really fall further .
Which is precisely what has happened with Greece .
The little country that started off the chain reaction that has already led to a currency and liquidity crisis , and made the solvency crisis in Europe all too tangible , by belonging to a monetary union it had no place in ( a union which no reason to exist in the first place ) , is once again reminding the world of its existence , this time by G - Pap opening his mouth and inserted two whole legs in it .
In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria to be aired today , G - Pap has threatened he may sue US banks for " contributing " to his country 's debt crisis .
For those of you lacking in analogy skills , Greece is in the same shoes as a bankrupt debtor who wants to sue his creditors for daring to hike up his interest rate when the only means he has to roll his debt is by using another credit card ( this one issued by US and European Taxpayers ) , even as bankruptcy is literally hours away .
The Greek summation : that of a petulant 5 year old who has just broken dad 's favorite gadget : “ We have made our mistakes , ” Papandreou said .
“ We are living up to this responsibility .
But at the same time , give us a chance .
We ’ll show you . ”
Now that would be amusing - after Greece destroyed its economy the first go round , we can't wait to see what the country does for an encore .
The only reason Greece is not bankrupt now is because even as its past mistakes have caught up with it and climaxed in a solvency and liquidity crisis unseen since the Lehman days , the country 's end would bring down all of Europe .
If Greece would not have impaired French , German and UK banks , the country would have long been allowed to default .
Yet diversion is always a good tactic : let 's bring the " speculators " into this yet again .
After all it is unheard of in these turbulent Keynesian times for anyone , especially our own Fed Chairman , to own up to their endless mistakes .
It is always , without exception , someone else 's fault .
More from Bloomberg :
Papandreou said the decision on whether to go after U.S. banks will be made after a Greek parliamentary investigation into the cause of the crisis .
“ Greece will look into the past and see how things went , ” Papandreou said .
“ There are similar investigations going on in other countries and in the United States .
This is where I think , yes , the financial sector , I hear the words fraud and lack of transparency .
So yes , yes , there is great responsibility here . ”
In the days leading up to the May 10 announcement of a loan package worth almost $ 1 trillion to halt the spread of Greece ’s fiscal woes , European Union regulators were examining whether speculators manipulated the prices of bonds and equities and contributed to the crisis .
The Committee of European Securities Regulators said on May 7 it was investigating “ exceptional volatility ” in the markets and would work with other regulators , including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , as part of a coordinated clampdown .
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet said May 6 that he was concerned about speculation in bond markets using credit default swaps .
“ By first buying the CDS and then trying to affect market sentiment by going short on the underlying bond , investors can make large profits , ” he said .
In the CNN interview , Papandreou said many in the international community have engaged in “ Greek bashing ” and find it easy “ to scapegoat Greece . ”
He said Greeks “ are a hard - working people .
We are a proud people . ”
“ We have made our mistakes , ” Papandreou said .
“ We are living up to this responsibility .
But at the same time , give us a chance .
We ’ll show you . ”
Let 's assume Greece goes ahead and sues Wall Street - does that mean the country will be perpetually locked out of the capital markets ?
Or does Greece think that Piraeus Bank can place $ 10 billion in rolling over Bills every month ?
The ridiculousness of G - Pap 's interview , which we will bring to you once it airs , is beyond commentary .
Yes , just like Lehman bashing brought down that insolvent bank , just like Enron bashing brought down that particular house of off balance sheet cards , just like Argentina bashing contributed to countless episodes of sovereign default in the Latin American country ...
Too bad we had no more Madoff bashing when we had the chance : the final outcome may have been differed to some $ 60 billion worth if investors .
On our end , Zero Hedge is doing what it can to contribute at least marginally to " Fed bashing " so when the final ponzi bubble blows up , we can proudly say it was indeed our " speculative " fault the biggest pyramid scheme has been toppled once Ben Bernanke starts making the scapegoating tours .
Assuming , of course , anyone still cares about anything he has to say at that point .
Some lucky Disneyland park guests experienced a very special meet and greet with Mickey Mouse this week .
Mickey , who usually saves his voice for shows and parades , talked with guests and interacted with them in never - before - seen ways !
This was part of a process we call “ playtesting ” as it gives us a chance to develop new concepts with our guests long before they end up in the Parks .
“ We ’re always looking for innovative ways to let guests interact with our beloved characters , ” says Disney Imagineer and head of Advanced Development Scott Trowbridge .
“ And we have many more surprises up our sleeves . ”
Since many guests did not have an opportunity to experience this , here ’s a short video that shows some of the fun .
Well , we already knew that Rand Paul 's brand of " libertarian conservatism " was actually a front for the far - right beliefs he gets from his father -- even though he 's done his best to scurry away from the consequences of having revealed that extremism inadvertently when Rachel Maddow put it in a context that mattered -- in this case , the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s .
But you know it 's going to keep bubbling up , nearly every time he opens his mouth .
For instance , in a recent interview with an English - language Russian news station recently , Paul held forth on immigration [ via Ian Millhiser at ThinkProgress ] :
Paul : I recently have been talking more about satellite observation .
They say you can sit in front of the store here and a satellite can read the headline on your newspaper .
So I think you could also monitor your border with satellites , and then you just have to have some means of intercepting people who come in illegally .
You could have helicopters stations positioned every couple of hundred miles .
I think you just have to have some means of intercepting people who come here illegally .
You could have helicopter stations positioned every couple of hundred miles .
And I think you could control your borders and control your borders within months if you had the willpower to do it .
And I think neither party in our country has had the willpower to control our borders .
Q : Why not ?
Paul : I do n't know .
Some of it may be labor force , things like that .
But I 'm not opposed to letting people come in and work and labor in our country , but what I think we should do is , we should n't provide an easy route to citizenship .
A lot of this is about demographics .
If you look at new immigrants from Mexico , they register 3 - to - 1 Democrat .
So the Democrat Party 's for easy citizenship and for allowing them to vote .
I think we need to readdress that .
We ’re the only country I know of that allows people to come in illegally , have a baby , and then that baby becomes a citizen .
And I think that should stop also .
It 's worth noting that Paul is not only opposed to providing a path to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants already here , but he is apparently also opposed to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution .
You know , the one that reads :
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
This is a bit odd , do n't you think , for someone who not only constantly cites the Constitution and calls himself a " constitutionalist , " but also accuses his opponents of " violating the Constitution " at every turn ?
Indeed , only earlier in the segment he declared that President Obama 's health - care reforms were " unconstitutional . "
Note the words that people like Rand Paul never want to use when they talk about this , but which are what we 're talking about here -- namely , birthright citizenship .
And contrary to Paul 's assertion , there is a long list of nations [ predominantly in the Americas ] that practice jus soli .
Moreover , it 's not , as the Wikipedia entry explains , a particular innovation of American law , having its origins in British common law :
Birthright citizenship , as with much United States law , has its roots in English common law .
Calvin ’s Case , 77 Eng. Rep. 377 ( 1608 ) , was particularly important as it established that under English common law “ a person 's status was vested at birth , and based upon place of birth -- a person born within the king 's dominion owed allegiance to the sovereign , and in turn , was entitled to the king 's protection . "
This same principle was adopted by the newly formed United States , as stated by Supreme Court Justice Noah Haynes Swayne : " All persons born in the allegiance of the king are natural - born subjects , and all persons born in the allegiance of the United States are natural - born citizens .
Birth and allegiance go together .
Such is the rule of the common law , and it is the common law of this country … since as before the Revolution . "
That , of course , has n't stopped the Nativists who want to either overturn or ignore the Constitution .
Indeed , Paul is just echoing the latest efforts of Arizona 's immigrant - bashing nativists .
And as we noted then :
[ T ] his is a sick joke .
Surveys of undocumented workers have made indelibly clear that they do n't come here to have " anchor babies , " or to get our free health care , or any of the other fantasies harbored by nativists : they come here for jobs .
Moreover , there 's no serious benefit to be had from having your child be born a citizen -- because under American law , you can be deported anyway , and in fact thousands of parents of American birthright - citizen children are deported every year : 100,000 of them over 10 years , to be precise .
There is an exemption available :
After the immigrant parent has been present for no less than ten years , he or she may apply for Cancellation of Removal if he / she can prove ten years of good moral character and establish that deportation would create an exceptional hardship to her citizen child .
There is an annual cap of 4,000 on the number of illegal immigrants who can be granted such relief , and for the past several years the government has not even reached that cap .
Of course , facts never have been much of an impediment to people like Rand Paul .
Except when they make the tactical mistake of appearing on the Rachel Maddow Show .
The man that beat the living hell out of the malt challenge at Crown Candy a few days ago is not who he claimed to be .
We now are positive the actual record holder is Ben Monson .
Yesterday we reported that the famous Crown Candy malt challenge has its ass handed to it by someone who claimed to be Kevin Ross .
According to reports , a Kevin Ross from San Bernardino , California waltzed in to the popular St. Louis store and proceeded to drain seven malts in six minutes .
The “ goal ” of Crown Candy ’s challenge is fivemalts in 30 minutes .
We searched the internet and assumed this Kevin Ross was the same professional gurgitator that competed in the Nathan ’s Hot Dog challenge as recently as 2008 and closing by putting out a call to find and talk to Ross to get a quick comment about his amazing malt - drinking feat .
We succeeded … kinda .
Kevin
Ross the professional eater did get in contact with us , but he claims that anyone that dropped his name at Crown Candy was a big fat bloated lair .
I guess Andy “ Candy ” Karandzieff , owner of Crown Candy , should hold off on the plaque he promised to honor the malted accomplishment …
I am Kevin Ross , the competitive eater from California quoted in your piece .
However , the person who did that malt record is not me .
It was another eater who thought it would be funny to use my name instead of theirs .
Why would they do that ?
It ’s a strange thing , but the professional eating organization does n’t seem to like it if you do independent eating challenges .
So this other person was trying to disguise their identity and possibly cause me stress by using my name instead of theirs … strange but true !
Any idea on who could be dropping your name ?
I ’m not capable of doing what this person did , so it was clearly a better eater than me !
I ’m not naming who I think it was because I do n’t really yet understand their motivation for using my name .
. . but I can definitely say it was n’t me .
Well that ’s freaking weird .
We are certainly grateful for Mr. Ross getting in contact with us about this odd development , and frankly this does kinda make sense .
For instance , if you gave a fake name and did a challenge , that for some reason is against Pro-Eating rules , you probably would n’t want to stay around for a TV interview just like KSDK claimed .
We got in contact with the fine people of Crown Candy about the issue and they quickly replied .
When presented with Kevin Ross ’ flat denial it was him they said …
He point blank told us his name was Kevin Ross .
He also apparently did the pizza challenge at Pointers right before he came in yesterday afternoon .
Bummer he lied but quite entertaining to watch .
He could n’t finish malt # 8 – started to look a bit queasy !
Karandzieff , tweeted a photo just after contacting Crown Candy yesterday night of who the Crown Candy folks now believe is professional eater Ben Monson ( right ) and Punching Kitty has been able to confirm that .
A quick search found forum postings from Monson himself about his “ 5 day vacation food challenge ” with photos from many different midwest establishments and a few of them he is wearing the very same jersey as the photo that Karandzieff tweeted :
We have an email in to Kevin Ross to see if Monson was who he thought was using his name and any comments he had on his doppelganger .
We ’ll let you know when we get a response .
Also no word yet as to why anyone would want to travel around places wearing a jersey from a tattoo shop … maybe that ’s why he gave a fake name .
[ Editor ’s Note : Hey John Pertzborn , what do you think about all of this ?
_ He appears to be as confused as we are . ] _
( NaturalNews ) A huge U.K. health care scandal recently shocked the public with reports that up to 1,200 patients in a British hospital needlessly died from abuse and neglect .
And the worst part is that not a single worker involved has been prosecuted for his crimes .
It all started when an independent review of the U.K. 's Mid Staffordshire National Health Service ( NHS ) hospital found that patients there were routinely neglected , bullied , abused and treated poorly .
The details of the report include evidence that : - Nurses regularly ignored patients and left them unwashed in their own filth for as long as a month , and even ignored requests by patients to use the restroom or have their sheets changed .
- Four family members , including a newborn baby girl , all died at the hospital due to carelessness and malpractice .
The baby had to be delivered by her grandmother because the midwife was not paying attention .
Upon birth , the baby was not breathing , but workers resuscitated her .
However she died four days later because a junior pediatrician went against the family 's wishes and decided to release the sick baby .
- Patients were regularly released prematurely because medical workers feared they would lose their jobs for perceived " delaying " .
- Hospital wards were filthy and contaminated with blood , used needles , and dirty dressings .
Those workers who had concerns about the horrible conditions at the hospital were bullied by managers into not coming forward with the truth .
And what researchers initially perceived as having caused 400 deaths ended up burgeoning into 1,200 .
Those responsible for the atrocious conditions have either retired with generous pensions or found other jobs in the field .
None have had to bear the responsibility for their crimes , and many have not even responded to the allegations .
According to the accusing parties , hospital officials were so concerned with cost-cutting and pursuing " elite foundation trust status " that they lost sight of actually caring for their patients .
Part of the problem also lies in what has been termed " box - ticking " , or merely checking a box and sending a patient off to a ward to die .
The formulaic method to which the hospital philosophy of care had devolved is the subject of investigation , as concerned officials pursue justice in the matter .
Many are demanding a full public inquiry into the case .
The report also outlined that the hospital staff count was allowed to dwindle so low that there were simply not enough caretakers to handle all the patients .
And while some did their best to provide care , many displayed a disturbing lack of compassion and simply discarded patient needs , resulting in hundreds of deaths .
Even basic needs like changing bedpans and sheets and bringing food and water were neglected .
Former chief executive of the hospital , Martin Yeates , was suspended from his job , but with full pay for six months and a hefty pension .
Sources for this story include :
The Senate Intelligence Committees investigation of how 23 - year - old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab soiled his underpants with a makeshift bomb over Detroit last Christmas hung out so much dirty linen on the crowded clothes line of the U.S. intelligence community that it was an easy call to get rid of Director of National Intelligence , Dennis Blair .
The Senate committees findings released on Tuesday showed the community in all - too - familiar disarray  adrift with no helmsman strong , savvy and courageous enough to bang heads together to get the far - flung intelligence bureaucracies to cooperate .
The report is a damning catalogue of misfeasance and mistakes .
Yet , given recent precedent , with the intelligence community screwing up so clearly and regularly with no accountability , the Christmas Day fiasco and other recent misadventures might not have been enough to send Blair packing .
Rather , the underpants - bomber fiasco should be seen as the proximate cause of Blairs abrupt departure  which came without so much as the de rigueur thank - you to President Obama for  the privilege of serving . 
Truth be told , the White House and the CIA have been out to get Blair for many months .
An incompetent manager ?
Seems so .
But Blair also demonstrated a strain of integrity .
And that can often be the kiss of death in Official Washington .
On substantive issues , like Irans nuclear program , Blair did not show the malleability that is desired by those who are out to zap Iran ; I believe it likely that these get - Iran hawks helped to zap Blair .
Denied His Own Staff
Last year , the hawks also had their feathers ruffled by Blairs choice of independent - minded former Ambassador Chas Freeman to be chair of the National Intelligence Council , without clearing this first with White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel .
The NIC has purview over the preparation of National Intelligence Estimates and the President Daily Brief  the two premier intelligence publications .
Blairs choice of Freeman raised the ire of Washingtons still - influential neoconservatives and their allies in the Obama administration because he was regarded as a realist on the Middle East , rather than someone who would side reflexively with Israel .
When rumors began to circulate about Freemans appointment , the neocons unleashed a media barrage , denouncing his criticism of Israel and his associations with the Saudi and Chinese governments .
One influential column , entitled  Obamas Intelligence Blunder ,  was published Feb. 28 on the Washington Posts neocon - dominated op - ed page , written by Jon Chait of The New Republic , another important neocon journal .
Still , on the morning of March 10 , 2009 , Blair described the high value that Freeman will  bring to the job  his long experience and inventive mind ,  for example .
Enter Sens. Chuck Schumer , D - New York , and Joe Lieberman , I - Connecticut who simply could not abide someone in that post with open respect for the rights and interests of both sides of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
By five oclock that afternoon , Freeman was told by Blair to announce that he ( Freeman ) had asked that his selection not proceed . 
To his credit , Freeman went down swinging .
He made it clear that he was withdrawing his previous acceptance of Blairs invitation to chair the NIC because of the character assassination of him orchestrated by the Israel Lobby .
Freeman added :  The aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process through the exercise of a veto over the appointment of people who dispute the wisdom of its views and the exclusion of any and all options for decision by Americans and our government other than those it [ the Lobby ] favors . 
Foreign policy analyst Chris Nelson described the imbroglio as a reflection of the deadly power game regarding what level of support for controversial Israeli government policies is a requirement for U.S. public office . 
Schumer led Lobby boasting .
 His [ Freemans ] statements against Israel were way over the top ,  Schumer said .
 I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him , and I am glad they did the right thing . 
Though the Freeman flap soon faded away , Blair had suffered a political hit and had made some powerful enemies .
I recall the morning after ,  as I found myself wondering when White House chief of staff Emanuel  who reportedly was Schumers go - to guy on the get - Freeman campaign  saw fit to let Admiral Blair in on the little secret that no way could he have Freeman .
And I wondered why Blair tucked tail , rather than quit in protest of having his choice for the nations senior intelligence analyst blackballed .
It is , after all , a position that is supposed to be about objectivity , giving the President unvarnished information , not ideologically favored spin .
A Messy Structure
It seems clear now that Admiral Blair was doomed to failure from the start , as was the bureaucratic superstructure built around the Director of National Intelligence as a key reform that followed the twin intelligence failures on 9/11 and Iraqs WMD .
The DNI was given the supremely difficult task of ruling over the intelligence community , a responsibility previous invested in the Director of Central Intelligence .
The job was hard enough , but Blair was hampered further because he lacked the strong personal support of President Obama .
I served under nine directors of central intelligence  several of them at close remove .
Admiral Stansfield Turner , who was picked by his Naval Academy classmate Jimmy Carter , was the only one who really grasped the reins of the entire intelligence community and made it cohere .
A few years ago , as Adm .
Turner and I sat together waiting to go into a TV studio , I had a chance to ask him how he was able to do that .
To the best of my recollection , this is what he told me :
 I was in command of the Sixth Fleet cruising in the Med when I was tipped off that I was about to get a call from the president - elect .
There had been earlier signs that Carter was going to ask me to be his Director of Central Intelligence .
 Now , Ray , when you know you re going to be made that kind of offer  one you cant really refuse  that s precisely the time when you need to think long and hard about how you might use what little bargaining power you may have at that point , in order to improve your chances for success in the new job .
I had about ten minutes .
Then the call came .
 Mr. President - elect , I said , as a former naval officer you will be able to appreciate this conundrum I see .
The job is twofold .
I would have no trouble running the CIA  I can run the Sixth Fleet ; I can run the CIA .
 What gives me pause is the equally important  maybe more important  job of running the entire intelligence community .
As a military man I am very reluctant to accept responsibility for something over which I have only tenuous authority .
 And my experience with the intelligence community suggests that the fiefdoms that comprise it will not work together effectively , no matter what I say or do , UNLESS you make it clear that I have the authority derived from the President , commensurate with my responsibility in leading the entire community .
If you can make that clear , I will accept the nomination with gusto . 
Carter said he would take care of it and shortly thereafter came a directive from the President - elect to heads of the main national security and intelligence agencies and staffs .
In it Carter announced he had selected Turner to be his DCI , that ALL addressees would cooperate fully with him as he harnesses the intelligence community behind the new administrations main objectives , and that he had instructed Turner to let him know immediately , should there be any sign that he was not getting the full and unfettered cooperation he would need as the chief intelligence adviser to the President .
That did it , Turner told me .
Turner was too modest to add what I had already learned as a lesson about his tenure , that an effective director of the intelligence community needs the courage to put noses out of joint .
He should NOT adopt team player mode that so many intelligence directors since Turner have succumbed to .
If Turner was not getting full cooperation from , say , the FBI , he would simply go down to the White House and let President Carter and / or his advisors know .
The attorney general and / or the FBI director would promptly receive the necessary remedial instructions .
Consummate Team Player
Two decades later , team player  George Tenet ( the team being George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and Donald Rumsfeld ) stood this on its head .
Nary a nose did timid , incurious George put out of joint .
But Tenet , who had mastered the skills of serving his principal  as a staff aide to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren , was so well - liked in Washington that even the 9/11 Commission was reluctant to offer pointed criticism of his gross misfeasance in his community role .
( At one hearing , commissioner Jamie Gorelick fawned over Tenet , noting with admiring wonderment what she said especially distinguished him ; namely , that everyone in the Establishment simply called him  George ,  and all automatically knew to whom they were referring .
Amazing ! )
Instead of affixing blame for 9/11 , co-chair Lee Hamilton , Gorelick and others kept wringing their hands , complaining that no one was in charge of the intelligence community . 
True enough , but that was by no means solely due to the CIAs two - hat - director responsible for both analysis and covert operations .
It was much more a case of George Tenet showing off the bureaucratic skills he had learned as a Capitol Hill aide , ingratiating himself with the powerful and never putting them in an uncomfortable situation .
You dont insinuate yourself into top jobs in Washington , or get to stay in them , by knocking important noses out of joint , no matter how badly such disfigurement is needed .
No one ever needed plastic surgery after an encounter with George Tenet .
On July 22 , 2004 , the day the 9/11 report was released , I had been asked to comment on it immediately at the BBCs studio in Washington .
After expressing amazement at the reports bizarre bottom line , that the calamity seemed to be no ones fault , I emerged from the studio and promptly bumped into two commissioners , Jamie Gorelick and Slade Gorton .
They had been waiting on deck in the outer room .
Gorelick went in first ; I thought to myself , nows your chance , McGovern .
I approached Gorton and said that I was bothered by the reports mantra that no one is in charge of the intelligence community and the commissions misguided notion that a new DNI superstructure should be placed atop it .
I said that no doubt you are well aware that , by statute , Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet is supposed to be in charge of the community and to ensure that all agencies cooperate .
Gorton put his arm around me , as senior ex-senators are wont to do , and in an avuncular voice ( as if explaining something pretty basic to a freshman ) , said :  Yes , of course I know that , Ray .
But Tenet would not do it .
My follow - up question was to be :
So you all are advocating an entirely new superstructure just because George Tenet  would not do it ?
Unfortunately , the door opened , Gorelick walked out and Gorton escaped into the studio .
The year 2004 was an election year and , in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the commission report , members of Congress wished to be seen as doing something  anything .
So , they moved to enact many of the 9/11 Commissions reforms . 
By then , the CIA and the just - resigned Tenet had been completely discredited , not only for failures prior to 9/11 but also for the unconscionable cooking of intelligence to justify war on Iraq .
Yet , instead of focusing on individual responsibility for 9/11 and the politicization of the CIAs analytical division  what might be called cultural failures 
Congress found it easier to diagram a new bureaucracy .
Protests from intelligence professionals were seen as self - serving .
So , we got a new Director of National Intelligence ostensibly to preside over the whole enchilada , but WITHOUT the kind of authority and support Carter gave Turner .
Admirals and Admirals
If recent years have proved anything , it is this : there are admirals ; and then there are admirals .
Admirals in the mold of Stansfield Turner  like William ( Fox ) Fallon and Joint Chiefs  Chairman Mike Mullen  are one thing .
They represent the tough independence that the Navy often requires of its senior officers .
Near the end of the Bush administration , Fallon and Mullen deserved most of the credit for facing down Vice President Dick Cheney and persuading President Bush that war with Iran would not be a good idea and that Israel needed to be told exactly that  in no uncertain terms .
That was just three years ago ; war was pretty close .
Then there are the admirals who know how to salute and avoid confrontations , the likes of Mike McConnell , who was snatched away from his sinecure as VP at Booz - Allen & Hamilton marketeer to become the second director of national intelligence , apparently because he was judged to be incapable of doing much harm .
What McConnell lacked in managerial knowhow , well , let me put it this way ; he in no way made up for that lack by his substantive expertise .
Three poignant illustrative vignettes involving the hapless McConnell come to mind .
(1) Testifying before the Senate , McConnell was asked to venture a guess as to why Israel might put forward a more alarming view of Irans progress toward a nuclear weapon than that of the U.S. intelligence community .
He was at a loss for an answer .
(2) At times McConnell would display his naïveté by saying too much .
The subject of torture came up in an interview McConnell gave Lawrence Wright of the New Yorker magazine .
McConnell innocently told Wright that , for him :
 Waterboarding would be excruciating .
If I had water draining into my nose , oh God , I just cant imagine how painful !
Whether its torture by anybody elses definition , for me it would be torture . 
Later , McConnell let slip the rationale for the Bush administrations refusal to admit that waterboarding is torture .
For anyone paying attention , that rationale had long been a no - brainer .
But here is McConnell inadvertently articulating it :
 If it is ever determined to be torture , there will be a huge penalty to be paid for anyone engaging in it . 
(3) More damning was  Malleable Mike McConnells attempts to finesse the key judgments of the bombshell NIE of November 2007 , which directly contradicted what Bush and Cheney had been saying about the imminence of a nuclear threat from Iran .
Facing withering criticism from the likes of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and the irrepressible former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton , McConnell backpedaled .
In testimony to the Senate on Feb. 5 , 2008 , he confessed to careless wording in the NIE due to time constraints , and even indicated he probably would have changed a thing or two . 
Whereas the NIE started out with a straightforward ,  We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program ,  McConnell indicated he would now prefer to say , for example , that maybe even the least significant portion [ of the Iranian nuclear program ; i. e. , the warhead ] was halted and there are other parts that continue . 
A Mixed Bag
McConnells successor
Blair was in no way a strong manager as DNI .
And with an increasingly bloated staff tripping over one another , there was little hope that Blair was up to the job of taking hold of the intelligence community .
Nor was there any sign that he ever thought to ask President Obama for the necessary endorsement and support .
Besides ,
Blair seems to have been an innocent to the ways of Washington .
Anyone could have told him there would be no percentage in locking horns with CIA Director Leon Panetta with the latters longstanding political connections in this town and a CIA staff that has proven past master at political infighting .
Worse still , Blair let himself be used in a way no U.S. intelligence official should permit .
Those in the Obama administration who think its a good idea to put U.S. citizens on the CIA assassination list needed to send up a trial balloon to see if Congress and the media would look the other way .
And so , in February , the White House inflated the balloon for Blair to float at a congressional hearing .
He contended that there were certain counterterrorism cases that could involve killing an American citizen .
There were very few objections from Official Washington .
Administration officials have since cited secret evidence showing that the Yemen - based Muslim cleric Anwar al - Awlakis connections to al - Qaeda have gone operational ,  thus making him a target for killing even though he is a native - born American citizen .
The Bill of Rights be damned .
I would wager Blair regrets letting himself be used like that .
I have independent confirmation that during the Sixties at the Naval Academy the curriculum included a block of instruction on the Constitution and Bill of Rights .
A Saving Grace
There is one substantive matter of considerable significance , on which Blair did muster the courage to stand up .
He withstood intense pressure from those wishing to exaggerate the danger that Iran could have a nuclear weapon soon .
There is no sign that whoever succeeds him will have the courage or the professionalism to face down those in Congress and the administration determined to exaggerate that threat , to the point where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be emboldened to launch a pre-emptive attack ( the term now in vogue for what the post - WWII Nuremberg Tribunal called a war of aggression ) .
In testimony before Congress early this year , Blair virtually wore out the subjunctive mood in addressing Irans possible plans for a nuclear weapon .
His paragraphs were replete with dependent clauses , virtually all of them beginning with if . 
Blair repeated verbatim the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate judgment that Iran is keeping the option open to develop nuclear weapons ,  while also repeating the intelligence communitys agnosticism on the $ 64 question :
 We do not know , however , if Iran will eventually decide to build nuclear weapons . 
Addressing the uranium enrichment plant at Qom , Blair said its small size and location under a mountain fit nicely with a strategy of keeping the option open to build a nuclear weapon at some future date , if Tehran ever decides to do that . 
Such advancements lead us to affirm our judgment from the 2007 NIE that Iran is technically capable of producing enough HEU [ highly enriched uranium ] for a weapon in the next few years , if it chooses to do so . 
Notably absent from Blairs testimony was the first high confidence judgment of the 2007 NIE that in fall 2003 Iran halted its nuclear weapons program ,  and the moderate confidence  assessment that Iran had not restarted it .
That was the most controversial judgment in 2007 .
But Blair did not disavow it .
Nor did he weasel on it , as McConnell did .
He simply didnt mention it  probably in an attempt to let that sleeping dog lie .
Possible Revisions
A Memorandum to Holders is intelligence jargon for updating a definitive estimate , like the one from November 2007 , with any necessary changes .
As has been the custom in recent years , one regarding the Iranian nuclear program has been delayed and delayed again .
The Washington Post says it is now due in August .
There is no minimizing the importance of this update .
It needs to be as honest as the earlier NIE , though that will take courage and clout .
In this sense , I regret Blairs departure .
For those now in charge are relative non-entities with , truth be told , very little experience in intelligence work and still less clout .
It is doubtful they will be able to stand up against the mounting pressures to paint Iran in the most alarmist colors .
The task is complicated by the recent tripartite Iran - Turkey - Brazil deal .
With Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her neocon friends and supporters already trashing this viable initiative , it will take courage to point out clearly to the President the relative merits of allowing Iran to transfer half of its low enriched uranium to Turkey and then onward for further processing .
Except for the political pressures , not much courage should be needed .
By any objective measure , the relative merits should be pretty obvious , IF one is willing to disappoint Israel .
( Where is Chas Freeman when we need him ? )
According to press reports , the leading candidate to succeed Dennis Blair is retired Air Force Lt. Gen. James Clapper , whose record does not inspire confidence .
Clapper has a well - deserved reputation for giving consumers of intelligence what they want to hear .
He now serves as undersecretary of intelligence at the Defense Department , working for Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who was the chief bureaucrat responsible for politicizing U.S. intelligence in the 1980s as an apparatchik for CIA Director William Casey .
Some of my colleagues in Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity have the book on Clapper , who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1991 to 1995 .
There , according to Larry Johnson , Clapper earned the reputation of worst - ever DIA director . 
Among other things , he restructured DIAs analytical corps , removing an analysis capability that would have been an invaluable asset in the period before 9/11 and succeeding years .
As a direct result , hundreds of the most experienced analysts took early retirement , and DIA has had to play catch - up ever since to reconstruct its analytic capability .
Retired U.S. Army Col .
Pat Lang , who held some of the most senior positions at DIA , told me Friday ,  Clapper is a man who is just a walking mass of ambition . 
What I find most damaging , though , is the fact that Clapper was head of the National Geo-spatial Agency from 2001 to 2006 .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chose well , for his purposes .
It is abundantly clear that Clapper smothered any imagery analyst who suggested that , since there was not a trace of WMD in the various kinds of available imagery of Iraq , there might not be any WMD .
Clapper , rather , was one to salute and enthusiastically subscribed to the Rumsfeld dictum :  The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . 
Quick , someone tell Barack Obama about Clapper before the President is led once again down the garden path .
FEATURES Game Design Challenge : Time For Change [ 05.26.10 ]
- GameCareerGuide.com staff
GameCareerGuide.com 's
Game Design Challenge is an exercise in becoming a game developer , asking you to look at games in a new way -- from the perspective of a game creator , producer , marketer , businessperson , and so forth .
Every other Wednesday we 'll present you with a challenge about developing video games .
You 'll have two weeks to brainstorm a brilliant solution ( see below for how to submit your answers ) .
After the two week submission period elapses , the best answers and the names of those who submitted them will be posted , along with some commentary .
The Challenge
Profoundly change a game 's main character .
Assignment Details
Recently two interesting examples of modifying an existing game character 's gender came to light .
Artist David Stonecipher recently drew a series of gender - swapped game characters , both male and female .
This was done just for fun .
On GameCareerGuide , on the other hand , SMU Guildhall masters student Shaylynn Hamm shared a more robust look at the same idea , in her project The Aesthetics of Unique Video Game C haracters .
The aim of the project was to examine how female characters are created for games , what purpose they serve , and how they could be designed to stay true to the spirit of an exisiting character while offering a new experience that might appeal to a broader audience , and making sense in a real - world context .
Hamm examined existing female characters in games , conducted a survey of gamers , and then devised a scheme to meaningfully adapt two of Team Fortress 2's characters from male to female .
How would profoundly changing the main character of a game change the adventure ?
As designers , your job is not to work on the visual design of the characters in a game world , but on how that world works from a gameplay and story perspective .
What challenges would a female Kratos face that the God of War hero would n't otherwise ?
It would change the story of the original game -- maybe make parts of it impossible .
Your submission can be tongue - in - cheek or serious -- but should fully and plausibly examine how a gender change effects the gameplay of the game you choose .
To Submit
Work on your ideas , figure out your strategy for coming up with a solution , and ask questions on the forum .
When your submission is complete , send it to [ email protected ] with the subject line " Design Challenge : Time For Change . "
Please type your answer directly in the email body .
Submissions should be no more than 500 words and may contain up to three images .
Be sure to include your full name and school affiliation or job title .
Entries must be submitted by Wednesday , June 9
Results will be posted Tuesday , June 15

Ask Palestinians why there is no Gandhi in their movement , and often the answer comes : but there are several , and Mustafa Barghouti should be recognized more widely as one of them .
A medical doctor , born in Jerusalem in 1954 , trained both in the old Soviet Union and in the US , he is the advocate of a strong , non-violent push to a two - state deal with Israel .
He got his break in the show biz of American opinion last Fall on the Daily Show .
His B. D. S. campaign this Spring in the world press and on American campuses stands for Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions to bring the pressure of international attention and law on the Israeli government .
Mustafa Barghouti has set his own course in the famous Barghouti family and in Palestinian politics .
With Edward Said and others in 2002 , Mustafa Barghouti helped found the Palestinian National Initiative .
He was the Initiative ’s candidate ( and ran second to Mahmood Abbas ) to succeed Yasir Arafat as president of the Palestinian Authority in 2005 .
His Initiative banner waves for “ a truly democratic and independent ‘ third way ’ for the large majority of silent and unrepresented Palestinian voters , who favour neither the autocracy and corruption of the governing Fatah party , nor the fundamentalism of Hamas . ”
In a long conversation at Brown ’s Watson Institute yesterday , Dr. Barghouti seemed a model of the old virtues : patience , long - suffering , gentleness and a certain deep enthusiasm .
There is n’t any place in the world where apartheid is so systematic as it is today in Palestine …
You are talking about a situation where we the Palestinians are prevented from using all our main roads because they are exclusive for Israelis and Israeli Army and Israeli settlers .
This did not happen even during the segregation time in the [ United ] States .
People could not use the same bus or same restaurant .
But here you ca n’t use the same road even .
I am an elected Member of Parliament .
I ran for president in Palestine ; I was second in the presidential race .
I was born in Jerusalem .
I worked as medical doctor , as a cardiologist , in a very important hospital in Jerusalem for 15 years .
And since five years I am prevented , like 98 percent of the Palestinians , from entering Jerusalem .
If I am caught in Jerusalem , I could be sentenced to seven years in jail .
This is unbelievable .
You have a situation where a husband and a wife can not be together .
If a husband is from Jerusalem and his wife is from the West Bank , or the opposite , they can not live together .
Because if the husband or the wife comes to the West Bank they lose their ID , they lose their residency .
And the wife or the husband from the other side cannot be granted citizenship in Jerusalem .
We have never seen a situation where a country occupies a city like East Jerusalem and then declares the citizens of the city — who have lived there for hundreds , and some of the families for thousands of years — “ temporary residents . ”
And if one of them goes out to study at Brown for five years for instance , they would lose their residency .
This is what you see are acts of ethnic cleansing .
There is n’t a place in the world where officially the policy is , if I have a person with a heart attack and I need to get him to a hospital in Jerusalem or in Israel , I have to get a military permit from a coordinator in the military headquarters .
And this can take hours or days , or it can not be granted at all .
I ’ve had patients die in front of my eyes because I could not get them through the checkpoints .
We had 80 women who had to give birth at checkpoints , and 30 of them lost their babies .
And to me , the fact that a woman cannot give birth in a dignified manner , and having to give birth in front of foreign soldiers out in the street , is equal to the utmost injustice .
Tell me , where does that happen anywhere in the world ?
And this is happening by a country that is claiming that it is a democracy and that it is civilized .
And by people that have had suffering in the past .
I mean , that ’s what amazes me , you know .
People who understand how terrible it is to be discriminated against …
So we ask ourselves : how do we make the Israelis change their minds ?
How do we convince them to stop the oppressive system which is hurting our future and their future ?
… We have to make their system of occupation painful ; and we have to make their system of occupation costly .
This can be done through only two ways : either you turn to violence , which I totally disagree with , I do n’t believe in and I think is counterproductive ; or you turn to non-violence and mobilizing international pressures on Israel , as people did in the case of the apartheid system in South Africa .
If it was n’t for the divestment sanctions campaign in the 80s and 90s we would never have seen the apartheid system fall apart in South Africa , simply because the balance of forces between the regime and the people is so big in the interest of the regime .
We have the same situation in Palestine .
That ’s why I speak about divestment and sanctions to encourage non-violence .
This is the only way we make non-violent resistance succeed , by having an international component , especially in the United States .
We are not talking about boycotting Israel , or Israeli people .
We are talking about boycotting occupation and about divestment from occupation and military industry that is exploiting people , that is destroying people ’s lives and that is consolidating an apartheid system .
So we are calling for divestment from occupation and apartheid and injustice …
Let ’s say we have a Palestinian state and an Israel state .
This will make many Israelis calmer because they will not be afraid about the Jewish nature of Israel as a state , although 20 percent of its citizens are Palestinian today .
Eventually there will be cooperation between the Palestinian state and the Israeli state , economically , say .
I do n’t see a problem with us and Israel joining the European Union together , for instance .
But Israel has to answer a bigger question .
I mean , Israel is not an island in the ocean .
Israel is an island in the Middle East .
What we have so far is an Israeli government that is always in conflict with others .
They seek conflict , in my opinion , and they use this conflict to justify oppression of Palestinians , and to justify a lack of solutions to the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
First it was the Soviet Union : they could not make a solution because a Palestinian state would be closer to the Soviet Union , for instance – or with Egypt which was at that time closer to the Soviet Union .
Then it was the problem of Egypt and Syria , and then they had peace with Egypt and ceasefire with Syria .
They had a problem with Iraq .
Today they speak about Iran .
Tomorrow if Iran is no problem they probably will start speaking about Azerbaijan .
They keep looking for an external justification for a problem that ’s internal .
Many Israelis speak of this .
And they ask : in a globalized world when you have economic cooperation , why does Israel want us not to be a democracy ?
Why did they kill twice already our best experiences developing a democratic system – once in 1976 when we had the first municipatlity elections , and they did n’t like the results .
At the time there was no Hamas ; at that time Israel was cooperating with Islamic parties against the secular national democratic groups like us .
And they killed the results of the 2006 elections which were praised by the United States and the world community as the best democratic elections in the Middle East .
You see , I see racism here .
Why are Israelis entitled to democracy and Palestinians are not ?
The question is why are they afraid of us being a democracy ?
Because we will have a government that cannot be manipulated ?
Mustafa Barghouti in conversation with Chris Lydon at Brown ’s Watson Institute , April 29 , 2010 .
Image caption Neelie Kroes wants to see more people online
All European households will have broadband speeds of 30 Mbps ( megabits per second ) by 2020 , the European Union has pledged .
It also promised universal broadband coverage by 2013 while getting half of Europeans using public services and shopping online by 2015 .
It is part of the European Union 's five year plan for the digital economy .
The raft of measures was announced by newly appointed digital affairs commissioner Neelie Kroes .
The EU 's digital agenda will see over 30 laws introduced over the next three years .
Laying out her plans , Ms Kroes said that the EU invested 40 % less in technology than the US .
It meant that nearly a third of Europeans had never used the internet and only 1 % had access to fibre - based high - speed networks .
In order to catch up , EU governments must double their annual spending on research and development to 11bn euros ( £ 9.4bn ) by 2020 , she said .
She also plans to improve technology standards , eliminate regulatory barriers , encourage electronic payments and simplify digital copyright management and licensing .
In November the European Parliament voted in favour of a major overhaul of telecoms law .
It aimed to harmonise the way mobile broadband is rolled out across Europe as well as establishing internet access as a fundamental right .
CNN AC 360 round table discussion on May 18th 2010 primary results
“ Too many rookie mistakes ”
http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf
Errol Louis + 2:30 : He ( Rand Paul ) made a statement the other day about wanting to repeal the American ’s with Disabilities Act .
Which is literally carved in stoned in every jurisdiction in the country .
He ’s got to answer some questions , I mean , I got calls from all over the country , senior citizens , disabled people , saying , ‘ What is this guy talking about ? ’ and if you get too many rookie mistakes like that , and he ’s a first time candidate , you can really start to upset the apple cart .
This part of the political discussion of the primary results stood out in my mind because it said a lot about the state of politics and conventional political wisdom .
Questioning scared cows that are ‘ carved in stone ’ is considered by many to be a rookie political mistake .
Rand Paul ’s father Ron Paul , is also known for pointing out problems with sacred cows in politics –most notably , Ron Paul has been championing the problems with the ‘ carved in stone ’ Federal Reserve for decades .
Rand Paul questioning a sacred cow was no mistake and should not be perceived as one .
Politicians only saying what people want to hear , things wo n’t rock the boat , can be blamed for a large number of the problems in Washington DC .
There is no hope for change as long as people see things done by the government as being carved in stone , not to be changed or even questioned .
I ’ll take rookie ‘ mistakes ’ over professional political mistakes like lying about your past , sex scandals , or adding trillions of dollars to the national debt .
If that was a rookie mistake , it makes a good argument to bring in more rookies .
LADWP To Arizona : ' Suck It , We Actually Own Your Power Plants '
The massive , hot star seemed out of place when astronomers first spotted it in 2006 , and now thanks to Hubble , we know why .
The misfit , 30 Dor # 016 , appears to have been ejected from a cluster of even heftier stars , pinging off of them and off into space at tremendous speed .
The star is traveling away from the R136 star cluster at about 250,000 miles per hour .
Just 1 or 2 million years old , the star already appears to have traveled 375 light - years from its place of birth .
" These results are of great interest because such dynamical processes in very dense , massive clusters have been predicted theoretically for some time , but this is the first direct observation of the process in such a region , ” astronomer Nolan Walborn of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a press release .
Walborn is a member of the team that tracked down the star ,
30 Dor # 16 is 90 times more massive than the sun and resides in the Tarantula Nebula , approximately 170,000 light - years from Earth .
It 's part of the Large Magellanic Cloud , the Milky Way 's third - closest neighbor .
You can see the R136 cluster in the middle left part of the imageabove .
The runaway star is in the upper right , a bright blue spot trailing red dust .

Page 2 asked fans to come up with a nickname for the newest Bronco , Tim Tebow .
Page 2 asked fans to come up with a nickname for the newest Bronco , Tim Tebow .
What should we call Tim Tebow ?
You had hundreds of ideas -- ranging from " second coming " declarations to snide asides about the NFL value of performing a crisp circumcision .
For every 10 suggested nicknames that honored Tebow , there were another five that clearly are not expecting the best .
So what nickname will actually stick with the Denver Broncos ' first - round draft pick , if any sticks at all ?
Obviously that will depend upon what he accomplishes ( or fails to accomplish ) on NFL playing fields .
But , meanwhile , your votes are in and our totally subjective choices for a Top 10 list have been made .
And the majority rules .
The Mile - High Messiah .
It 's a little long to be a great nickname , but it already is being used in Denver , where expectations are , well , at least that high .
And the rush goes beyond Denver : His No. 15 jersey was the NFL 's top seller in April .
So , as soon as Tebow wins his first game for the Broncos with three passing touchdowns , four rushing touchdowns and a half - dozen miracles on the way out of the stadium , expect to see " WWTMHMD ? " T - shirts everywhere .
What Would The Mile - High Messiah Do ?
But there were other good ones , too , not all of which were that complimentary .
Here 's our selected Top 10 Tim Tebow Nicknames :
1. The Mile - High Messiah -- First suggested by Eric M. , Kingsport , Tenn. ; Dan L. , Austin , Texas ; and Andrew B. , New York .
2. Tebench -- Nick S. , Rochester , N.Y .
3. Uno Cinco -- Anthony F. , Philadelphia .
4. Capt. Snipit -- Jason G. , Longwood , Fla .
5 . The Big Tebowski -- Josh C. , Canastota , N.Y. , and Tim C. , San Diego .
6. Tebowlicious -- Mary - Jane K. , Madison , Ala .
7. Clipboard -- Joe M. , Navarre , Fla. , and Capt. Clipboard -- Jess C. , Savannah , Ga .
8. The Unicorn -- " Because only women and defensive ends of pure virtue will be able to touch him " -- Steve R. , Ottawa , Ontario .
9. Media Messiah -- Ryan K. , Chowan University ( Murfreesboro , N.C. ) .
10 . Timmmmaaaay -- " South Park salute " -- Sammy M. , Beaumont , Texas ; Daryn H. , Stevens Point , Wis. ; and Josh W. , Asheville , N.C .
A few more that just missed are " Straight Arrow , " Bill P. , Tualatin , Ore. ; " T - Squared , " Daniel B. , Rome , Ga. ; " New T( estament ) , " Joe D. , Sherwood , Ore. ; " Heaven 's Heisman , " Michael C. , Charleston , S.C. ; " Docile Apostle , " Casey M. , Columbia , S.C. ; and " Tool Man , " Jorge R. , Tulare , Calif . .
Note :
We disqualified " Ryan Leaf " as a Tebow nickname , but Staff Sgt. Jason DeGrasse at Keesler AFB in Mississippi , tried to get around that by suggesting " JaMarcus Russell . "
It did n't work , Sarge .

A comparison of the networks formed by genetic code and the Linux operating system has given insight into the fundamental differences between biological and computational programming .
The shapes are very dissimilar , reflecting the evolutionary parameters of each process .
Biology is driven by random mutations and natural selection .
Software is an act of intelligent design .
" One of the biggest problems of biological data is that you have no intuitions about it .
It 's just a bunch of gobbledygook symbols .
One way to get intuition is to map its structure onto something we know about , " said study co-author and Yale University informaticist Mark Gerstein .
" Linux is evolving and changing .
But unlike evolution in biology , we know exactly what 's going on . "
Several years ago , he refined a technique for turning gene - network " hairballs " — densely tangled depictions of gene interaction — into hierarchical maps .
At the top of each map are what Gerstein calls master regulators , which steer the activity of many other genes .
At the bottom are workhorses , which pump out protein code .
In between are the middle managers , which do a bit of both .
Since then , Gerstein has compared the structure of gene networks between species , and contrasted biological networks with corporate and governmental structures .
He hopes the contrasts will illuminate how network structure shapes genomic function .
In the latest study , published April 4 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , he compared the genome of E. coli , a widely studied microbe , to Linux , the popular open source operating system .
Though Gerstein hoped for insight into biological networks , the study also suggests strategies for social and technological engineers .
" If we do n't have designers fine - tuning things , and we have to deal with random changes , then what do we need to do in the control structure to make it robust ? " said Gerstein .
E. coli's network proved to have a pyramid - like shape , with a few master regulators , more middle managers , and many workhorses .
In stark contrast , the Linux kernel call graph — the network of interactions between different pieces of program code — looks almost like an inverted pyramid .
A great many top - level programs call on a few common subroutines .
Gene network structures start to resemble the Linux call graph as species become more complex , according to Sergei Maslov , a Brookhaven National Laboratory systems biologist not involved in the study .
However , their pyramids never become as top - heavy as Linux .
There seems to be a natural limit to this progression .
The new study suggests why .
" If you update a low - level function , then you need to update all the functions that use it .
That 's doable if you 're an engineer .
You just go through all the code .
But it 's impossible in biology , " Maslov said .
Indeed , when Gerstein 's team tracked the evolution of Linux kernel code since its original 1991 version , they found that its basic components had undergone extensive alteration .
Biologically analagous are so - called evolutionarily conserved genes , which are used in a great many functions , but these have hardly changed at all .
When a mutation is added , evolution can't quickly update the rest of the genetic code .
Asked if human software engineers have outpaced natural evolution , Gerstein said the opposite was true .
The computer model may be so extreme that it can't be scaled to biological levels of complexity .
" You can easily see why software systems might be fragile , and biological systems robust .
Biological networks are built to adapt to random changes .
They 're lessons on how to construct something that can change and evolve , " said Gerstein .
For now , the researchers have no plans to compare genomes to the most widely - used operating system of all , Windows .
" That 's forbidden , " said study co-author and Stony Brook University biophysicist Koon - Kiu Yan .
" Windows is not open source . "

McMahon said he welcomed all challengers , while former Fossella mentor Guy Molinari believes Fossella knew the executive committee would select him and called the development a " new low . "
Party chairman John Friscia said Fossella was the best candidate to beat McMahon .
However , he acknowledged that he has no information Fossella would run .
" It is my firm belief that he [ Fossella ] is the strongest candidate we can field , " Friscia said after the executive committee interviewed candidates for Congress and other races at the Road House in Sunnyside .
Said Friscia , " I have an obligation to pick the strongest candidate with the best chance of success . "
Fossella abandoned his 2008 re-election bid after a DUI arrest led to revelations that he had fathered a child during an extramarital affair .
The seat was won by McMahon .
" There seems to be a three - ring circus on the Republican side of this race , " McMahon said from Washington .
" Whoever emerges in the center ring , I 'll be proud and honored to run against .
We 'll see what happens in November . "
Fossella did not appear for an interview with the committee last night .
Michael Allegretti and Michael Grimm , who have been seeking the GOP endorsement for months , did interview .
Former Borough President Molinari , a one - time Fossella mentor who backs Grimm , skewered the GOP Executive Committee for its action .
" I think the status of the Republican Party on Staten Island has reached a new low tonight , " he said .
" Fossella has been playing his usual game at the expense of two other candidates . "
Molinari vowed that Fossella would face a bruising GOP battle .
" I welcome a primary with Fossella , " he said .
" It 's going to be ugly , it 's going to be nasty , but he has to know that would come out in the course of a campaign .
Everything he has done will be brought to light by me in this campaign . "
Said Molinari , " I have a difficult time believing that Fossella would put his own personal ambitions above his family .
His family has been through enough and I could n't believe that he would be willing to put them through all of that once again . "
Fossella pleaded guilty to the DWI charge and served two weekends in a Virginia jail last year .
Molinari predicted that if Fossella were to win the primary , the House Ethics Committee investigation that was dropped when he declined to run for re-election would be reopened .
" I am told that there are other matters that would be brought to the surface if he were to win again , " Molinari said .
The party 's county committee will have to ratify the Fossella endorsement at a county convention next week .
Fossella could not be reached for comment last night , and Friscia said he did n't know if the former lawmaker would accept the nomination .
Fossella has said repeatedly that he has " no plans " to seek his old seat .
Friscia insisted he was not pressured into making the recommendation by Fossella or members of Fossella 's family .
View full size
" Think what you will , " he said .
" The truth remains the truth . "
Said Molinari : " There 's no way this would have been done tonight without his [ Fossella ] knowing it . "
The executive committee vote was 23 in favor with 4 opposed .
Friscia , who made the motion to support Fossella , would not say which Republicans voted against the motion , but the Advance learned that party stalwart Annette Battista was one of them .
" I could n't believe it , " she said .
" My mouth was hanging open .
I thought I was hearing things .
We have these two clean - cut guys already in the race .
They 've been going door to door .
To throw Vito in there is not fair . "
Another executive committee member , who did n't want his name used , said the motion was " shoved down our throats . "
" There was very little time to deliberate , " he said .
" They cut off debate .
It was extremely rushed , and disrespectful to the committee .
It deprived us of the right to vet Vito , to ask him anything about the scandal or his record or his plans for Congress . "
When asked whether he was concerned about the baggage that Fossella would bring to the race , Friscia said , " That 's a decision that Vito has to make . "
State Sen. Andrew Lanza ( R - Staten Island ) , who was at the meeting to be interviewed for his own re-election bid , said , " It 's the responsibility of the Republican Party to put forward its strongest candidate .
Clearly , of the people who are being discussed , Vito Fossella is that person . "
Allegretti and Grimm could not be immediately reached for comment .
The party last night also endorsed Lanza and Assemblyman Lou Tobacco ( R - South Shore ) for re-election , and recommended that the state party endorse District Attorney Daniel Donovan for attorney general .
The committee held off on making endorsements in other races and will meet again before next week 's convention .
Also last night , the Kings County Republican Party Executive Committee unanimously endorsed Allegretti for Congress .

SOCHI , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russia offered on Friday to merge gas giant Gazprom with Ukraine ’s state energy firm Naftogaz , to a furious outcry from Ukraine ’s opposition accusing Moscow of trying to destroy Ukraine ’s independence .

Since the election in February of Kremlin ally Viktor Yanukovich as Ukraine ’s president , ties with Moscow have rapidly improved with accords on gas pricing and a lease extension for a key Russian naval base in Ukraine ’s Crimea .
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ’s proposal was Russia ’s boldest move yet and would allow Moscow to control its gas transit to Europe .
Ukraine ’s opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko said the deal was part of “ a plan to destroy Ukraine . ”
“ It is not a merger based on partnership but Russia ’s full acquisition of Ukraine , ” Tymoshenko said in a statement posted on her party ’s website .
“ The Crimea was just the beginning . ”
The deal would at a stroke give Moscow control of the major gas pipelines which run through Ukraine to supply Europe , as well as a lockhold over Ukrainian domestic gas supplies .
Owned by the state , Naftogaz is the exclusive importer of Russian gas into Ukraine and about 20 percent of the EU ’s gas needs flow through its pipelines .
Naftogaz ’s finances have crumbled as it buys gas from Russia at expensive prices and is then forced to sell it at subsidised prices to Ukrainian consumers .
The Gazprom - Naftogaz merger proposal came at a meeting in Russia ’s Black Sea resort of Sochi of the Russia - Ukraine inter- governmental commission .
NUCLEAR COOPERATION
The head of Russia ’s state nuclear corporation , Sergei Kiriyenko , had earlier said both countries were considering creating a joint venture to implement nuclear power projects .
“ We spoke about integration in the nuclear sphere .
We are ready to do the same in gas .
I propose to merge Gazprom and Naftogaz of Ukraine , ” Putin told the meeting .
A spokesman for Ukraine ’s premier described Putin ’s comments as “ impromptu , ” Interfax reported , but gas industry sources said the proposal was serious and not an off - the - cuff remark .
“ Ukraine ’s Prime Minister Mykola Azarov states that the idea to merge ( Naftogaz ) and Gazprom was not discussed and not even raised ( at the meeting ) , ” Interfax Ukraine quoted spokesman Vitaly Lukyanenko as saying .
“ The idea expressed by the Russian prime minister was impromptu .
So , we will discuss impromptu proposals and look into concrete proposals , ” he said .
Putin ’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters the deal would most likely take form of an equity swap between the two firms , with Ukraine possibly exchanging its 100 percent holding in Naftogaz for a corresponding stake in Gazprom .
“ We are talking about a creation of a single company , ” Peskov said , dismissing talk that the proposal was “ impromptu . ”
“ It ( the proposal ) was not an impromptu one .
It was a thought - out , calculated proposal .
Such proposals are not made in an impromptu way , ” Peskov said .
He added that Russia ’s plans to diversify gas supplies to Europe remained on track .
Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told Reuters Putin ’s offer was “ interesting ” and Gazprom was ready “ to work on it . ”
“ Obviously , the synergy effect is there , we will see how it is implemented , ” he said .
Gazprom shares fell 2.5 percent to 170 roubles after the news , and some analysts were skeptical .
Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Russian brokerage Uralsib , said it would be “ an impossible merger . ”
“ I think that the two companies are different animals in terms of size and transparency , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think that Ukraine would agree to a merger . ”
Medley Global Advisors ’ analyst Douglas Busvine said valuing Naftogaz , which is not a public company , does not disclose its financials and had restructured its debt last year , would be difficult .
“ Naftogaz is not viable as a going concern but they have some assets that are worth something , ” he said .
Peskov suggested that as Russia diversifies its supplies routes the value of Naftogaz assets is set to decrease .
Weafer said Gazprom ’s size meant it would completely dominate any joint company .
“ And that would be unacceptable to the Ukrainian public , ” he added .
The fiery opposition leader Tymoshenko called for the creation of a “ committee to save Ukraine . ”
She called for mass protest rallies starting May 11 to depose Yanukovich .
Gazprom ’s CEO Alexei Miller said the firm was ready to consider an asset swap with Naftogaz in business segments ranging from exploration to sales .
“ In reality , that ’s the question of a merger of the two companies , ” he said .

By By David James Young May 16 , 2010 in Entertainment Ronnie James Dio - best known for his work in bands such as Black Sabbath , Rainbow and the eponymous Dio band - died today at 67 .
A contentious Wikipedia entry mentioning his death was at the heart of an online debate .
Articles quickly began to appear reporting on Dio's death , but none with official statements .
Blabbermouth later reported an update from Dio's wife and manager , Wendy Dio , confirming that he was indeed alive .
" I am at the hospital and Ronnie has NOT passed away !!!!
He is not doing good , but he is not dead .
I will let you know if anything changes .
Thank you for your concern . "
He later passed away at 7:45 a.m. on May 16 .
Dio had been battling stomach cancer in the past few years .
Tour dates with his current band , Heaven & Hell , were postponed because of Dio 's ill health .
At approximately 5:40 a.m on May 16 , a Wikipedia user known as A Sniper changed Dio's Wiki entry with the message " I have just been informed that RJD died today " .
This was continually changed back and forth from Dio being alive and Dio being dead over several hours , until the article was officially locked by Wikipedia moderators due to confusion about the events .

From the world - famous fossil deposits of Alberta comes the king of all dinosaurs : Tyrannosaurus rex .
With an overall length of 12 m ( 39 ft ) and a gaping 1.85 m ( 6 ft ) bite full of 10 to 15 cm ( 4 to 6 in ) long teeth , it was the most ferocious of all !
Read the full story behind the coin ...
This coin ’s exceptional design reveals just how immense the jaws of this formidable predator were — it ’s an amazing find that any coin collector , nature lover and dinosaur hunter would be proud to call their own .
NOTE : By popular demand , this 4 - coin collection is being expanded to include an exciting fifth coin scheduled to launch in the Fall of 2010 .
Highlights : A selective aging effect creates a powerful impression of fossilized bones in stone .
In fact , this technique ensures no two coins are exactly alike .
Each 99.99 % pure silver coin is unique and — with a design that was developed in close collaboration with palaeontologists at Alberta ’s Royal Tyrell Museum — is an original and compelling keepsake of one of humanity ’s great fascinations .
Reverse :
An unusual perspective of a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton accentuating its immense jaws .
Tyrannosaurus rex - the story
It is a discovery that sends hearts pounding — and opens a window to the mystifying world of dinosaurs .
Their fossilized bones testify to the massive beasts that once ruled the earth but disappeared suddenly 65 million years ago .
During the time of these great beasts , a great inland sea covered much of western Canada and the area now known as Alberta and Saskatchewan was a lush subtropical shore — and home to over 35 dinosaur species .
As these animals died , the evolving landscape covered their bones with centuries of mud and sand — only to be revealed when the glaciers from the last Ice Age scraped away the top layers of rock and exposed bits of fossilized bone .
Discovered by paleontologists in the late 1800's , they inspired generations of dinosaur hunters and established Canada as one of the richest sources of Late Cretaceous fossils on earth .
Tyrannosaurus rex was one of several large carnivore ( tyrannosaur ) species that lived in Alberta , appearing shortly before the mysterious mass extinction .
Its name means " tyrant lizard " and there is no doubt it still rules today as the most popularized image of these prehistoric animals .
The mighty Tyrannosaurus rex measured up to 12 m ( 39 ft ) from head to tail .
It had a gaping one - metre ( 3 ft ) bite with 10 to 15 cm ( 4 to 6 in ) long teeth that could rip out hundreds of pounds of flesh at a time .
Today , Monday 17th May 2010 , the 6th International Day Against Homophobia And Transphobia marks the exact 20th anniversary of the World Health Organisation ’s decision to remove homosexuality from its list of illnesses on the 17th May 1990 .
Leaders from the European Council , the European Parliament and the European Commission have issued strong messages condemning homophobia and transphobia .
It is the first time that three top - level EU leaders have addressed homophobia and transphobia jointly and unequivocally .
Herman van Rompuy , President of the European Council , the EU institution representing 27 national governments , has issued a written statement affirming the EU ’s commitment to refuse discrimination on any grounds , and affirming that “ discrimination on the basis of gender and sexual orientation has ceased to constitute a political cleavage , and is enshrined in the EU ’s founding act and statement of values . ”
[ Direct link to PDF of the full statement by Herman van Rompuy ]
Jerzy Buzek , President of the European Parliament , issued a video message reaffirming the commitment of the European Parliament to combat any form of discrimination , including homophobia .
The President of the European Parliament declared : “ Homophobia is a clear breach of human dignity that questions fundamental rights ; and thus , it must be strongly condemned . ”
[ Direct link to video message from Jerzy Buzek ]
Viviane Reding , Vice - president of the European Commission and Commissioner for Justice , Fundamental Rights and Citizenship , also issued a statement condemning homophobia and transphobia as “ a blatant violation of human dignity ” , “ incompatible with the principles on which the EU is founded ” .
[ Direct link to video message from Viviane Reding ]
Co-presidents of the European Parliament ’s Intergroup on LGBT Rights , Ulrike Lunacek and Michael Cashman welcomed the initiative , and congratulated all 3 EU leaders on their renewed commitments .
“ We are indeed very pleased that the highest authorities of the 3 core EU institutions have come out against homophobia today .
Their statements are exemplary , and clearly show one thing : in 2010 in the European Union , the fundamental rights of everyone , including lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , have ceased to divide mainstream political parties and can be considered an integral part of the European Union ’s foundations recognised across the mainstream political spectrum . ”

AUSTRALIA'S housing market might be booming , but the shape of that boom varies by town and state .
For the past year , the sharpest growth in prices has been in Sydney and Melbourne .
Research by property monitoring companies and official figures suggest the price rises appear to be the result of exuberant demand amid a trickle of new housing supply .
A report released today by CommSec 's chief economist , Craig James , highlights the dynamic at work .
It places NSW at the bottom of the states in economic performance , in part because so few new homes are being built .
" NSW is anchored firmly at the bottom of the table and there is a fair gap to bridge , " he said .
" The stronger pace of population growth may serve to provide fresh momentum for the economy , but the risk is that workers will be drawn away to the resources states . "

This is the nineteenth in a series of blog posts I ’m doing on the upcoming VS 2010 and .NET 4 release .
Today ’s post covers a small , but very useful , new syntax feature being introduced with ASP .
NET 4 – which is the ability to automatically HTML encode output within code nuggets .
This helps protect your applications and sites against cross -site script injection ( XSS ) and HTML injection attacks , and enables you to do so using a nice concise syntax .
HTML Encoding
Cross - site script injection ( XSS ) and HTML encoding attacks are two of the most common security issues that plague web - sites and applications .
They occur when hackers find a way to inject client - side script or HTML markup into web - pages that are then viewed by other visitors to a site .
This can be used to both vandalize a site , as well as enable hackers to run client - script code that steals cookie data and / or exploits a user ’s identity on a site to do bad things .
One way to help mitigate against cross -site scripting attacks is to make sure that rendered output is HTML encoded within a page .
This helps ensures that any content that might have been input / modified by an end - user cannot be output back onto a page containing tags like < script > or < img > elements .
How to HTML Encode Content Today
ASP.NET applications ( especially those using ASP.
NET MVC ) often rely on using < %= %> code - nugget expressions to render output .
Developers today often use the Server. HtmlEncode( ) or HttpUtility .
Encode ( ) helper methods within these expressions to HTML encode the output before it is rendered .
This can be done using code like below :
While this works fine , there are two downsides of it :
It is a little verbose Developers often forget to call the Server .
HtmlEncode method – and there is no easy way to verify its usage across an app
New <% : %> Code Nugget Syntax
With ASP.NET 4 we are introducing a new code expression syntax ( < % : %> ) that renders output like < %= %> blocks do – but which also automatically HTML encodes it before doing so .
This eliminates the need to explicitly HTML encode content like we did in the example above .
Instead , you can just write the more concise code below to accomplish the exact same thing :
We chose the <% : %> syntax so that it would be easy to quickly replace existing instances of < %= %> code blocks .
It also enables you to easily search your code - base for < %= %> elements to find and verify any cases where you are not using HTML encoding within your application to ensure that you have the correct behavior .
Avoiding Double Encoding
While HTML encoding content is often a good best practice , there are times when the content you are outputting is meant to be HTML or is already encoded – in which case you do n’t want to HTML encode it again .
ASP .NET 4 introduces a new IHtmlString interface ( along with a concrete implementation : HtmlString ) that you can implement on types to indicate that its value is already properly encoded ( or otherwise examined ) for displaying as HTML , and that therefore the value should not be HTML - encoded again .
The <% : %> code - nugget syntax checks for the presence of the IHtmlString interface and will not HTML encode the output of the code expression if its value implements this interface .
This allows developers to avoid having to decide on a per-case basis whether to use < %= %> or < % : %> code -nuggets .
Instead you can always use <% : %> code nuggets , and then have any properties or data - types that are already HTML encoded implement the IHtmlString interface .
Using ASP.NET MVC HTML Helper Methods with <% : %>
For a practical example of where this HTML encoding escape mechanism is useful , consider scenarios where you use HTML helper methods with ASP .
NET MVC .
These helper methods typically return HTML .
For example : the Html. TextBox ( ) helper method returns markup like < input type= ” text ” />.
With ASP.NET MVC 2 these helper methods now by default return HtmlString types – which indicates that the returned string content is safe for rendering and should not be encoded by < % : %> nuggets .
This allows you to use these methods within both < %= %> code nugget blocks :
As well as within < % : %> code nugget blocks :
In both cases above the HTML content returned from the helper method will be rendered to the client as HTML – and the < % : %> code nugget will avoid double - encoding it .
This enables you to default to always using < % : %> code nuggets instead of < %= %> code blocks within your applications .
If you want to be really hardcore you can even create a build rule that searches your application looking for < %= %> usages and flags any cases it finds as an error to enforce that HTML encoding always takes place .
Scaffolding ASP.NET MVC 2 Views
When you use VS 2010 ( or the free Visual Web Developer 2010 Express ) to build ASP .
NET MVC 2 applications , you ’ll find that the views that are scaffolded using the “ Add View ” dialog now by default always use <% : %> blocks when outputting any content .
For example , below I ’ve scaffolded a simple “ Edit ” view for an Article object .
Note the three usages of < % : %> code nuggets for the label , textbox , and validation message ( all output with HTML helper methods ) :
Summary
The new <% : %> syntax provides a concise way to automatically HTML encode content and then render it as output .
It allows you to make your code a little less verbose , and to easily check / verify that you are always HTML encoding content throughout your site .
This can help protect your applications against cross -site script injection ( XSS ) and HTML injection attacks .
Hope this helps ,

DOVER — Bob and Mary St. Germain say they ca n’t believe it .
Four years after their son , Bryan , used his cellphone to connect to the Internet , the couple is still trying to fight the bill : a nearly $ 18,000 tab from Verizon .
Bryan , now 26 , thought his family ’s plan included free data downloads .
It did n’t , and in August 2006 , the St. Germains ’ phone bill ballooned to more than 100 times the normal amount .
“ You ca n’t print what my husband said ’’ when the bill came , Mary St. Germain said .
“ He was very shocked . ’’
Verizon eventually offered to reduce the bill by half , but Bob St. Germain , 66 , a retired marketing professional , said he rejected the offer after consulting with state utility officials who advised him not to pay .
So Verizon sent the reduced bill to a collection agency .
Verizon officials said that the charges were legitimate and that they have tried to work with St. Germain to resolve the dispute .
“ We go to great lengths to educate our customers on their products and services so that they avoid any unintended bills , ’’ Philip Santoro , a spokesman for Verizon Communications Inc. , and Michael Murphy , a spokes man for Verizon Wireless , wrote in an e-mailed statement .
The case highlights how confusing wireless plans can be and how any misstep can be costly for customers .
Sascha Meinrath , director of the New America Foundation , a nonpartisan research group in Washington , D.C. , said cellphone contracts have become so bewildering that he fields at least one complaint a month from customers with sky - high bills looking for help .
Meinrath said what outrages him is that many carriers offer unlimited data plans for about $ 30 a month and are “ making money off that . ’’
“ So how is it that they were charging $ 12,000 a month ? ’’ he asked .
“ How is it conceivable that is not price gouging ? ’’
Kevin Brannelly , an official at the state Department of Public Utilities , tried to help the St. Germain family fight the bill because it did not seem right .
“ Never in my 25 years here have I seen such stubborn and senseless resistance to what is obviously a mistake , ’’ he wrote in an e-mail to St. Germain .
Telecommunications experts said it is difficult to know how much it actually costs Verizon to transmit data .
Verizon and other wireless companies typically do not release that information .
Srinivasan Keshav , a professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario , said the problem is not the cost of the service , but whether the customer knows the cost .
He said customers are making mistakes because they do not have the time to sort through pages of fine print to understand the terms and conditions of a plan .
The Hamas leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh said Saturday that if Israel behaved like pirates and attacked the international Freedom Flotilla carrying 10,000 tons of aid meant for Gaza , then the Palestinians will have won .

" The flotilla 's message is clear and it will reach the entire world , " Haniyeh said Saturday morning during a press conference held at the Gaza port where the ships were expected to dock .
" The meaning of the flotilla is that the entire world opposes the siege on the Gaza Strip , and if Israel behaves like pirates and sea- terrorists – we will win , " he added .
The 8 - ship Freedom Flotilla protesting Israel 's blockade on Gaza , is expected to set sail from the international waters off the shores of Cyprus on Sunday evening and arrive at the Gaza Strip on Monday morning .
Flotilla organizers arranged the timing so that a potential encounter with the Israeli Navy would occur during the daytime hours , and not during the darkness of night .
Israel has said it will overtake the ships as soon as they enter a 20 - mile Israeli - controlled zone off Gaza .
They will then be towed to the Israeli port of Ashdod , where the foreign nationals will be handed over to Immigration Police for deportation abroad , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor .
The Israel Navy started preparing for the arrival of the Gaza aid flotilla by sending ships to counter the convoy in the Israeli - controlled waters .
Despite the convoy 's delay , the Israel Defense Forces continued to prepare for its arrival as planned .
Earlier on Friday , Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the Freedom Flotilla violent propaganda against Israel 's sovereignty , and added that Israel would not allow such a threat to continue .
" The aid convoy is violent propaganda against Israel , and Israel will not allow its sovereignty to be threatened in any way , in any place - land , air or sea , " Lieberman said during a foreign ministry briefing on the aid convoy 's progress towards the shores of Gaza .

" There is no humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip , " Liebeman added .
" Despite Hamas ' war crimes against Israeli citizens and the thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns , Israel continues to respond in the most humane way possible . "
Lieberman stressed that Israel permitted thousands of tons of products to enter the Gaza Strip on a daily basis .
Organizers of an eight - ship flotilla said Friday they continued to head for Gaza despite Israel 's warnings to intercept them as soon as they enter Israeli - controlled waters off the coast .
Israel 's Foreign Ministry held meetings with ambassadors of European countries from where the ships are sailing , urging them not to cooperate and calling the campaign - aimed at drawing attention to the stringent Israeli economic embargo of Gaza - a " blatant provocation . "
The organizers had ignored Israeli offers for the flotilla to dock in its southern port of Ashdod , just north of Gaza , and to transport the 10,000 tons of aid to the coastal enclave from there , it said .
Foreign Ministry officials said Cyprus authorities notified them that Nicosia would not allow the pro-Palestinian activists to dock on the island .
But Audrey Bomse , a spokeswoman for the Free Gaza movement , one of the organizers , told the German Press - Agency DPA the flotilla never planned to dock in Cyprus because of the heavy pressure by Israel on the Cypriot government .
The ships that had sailed from various ports over the past week were in the process of hooking up in international waters and scheduled to arrive off the coasts of Gaza on Saturday afternoon , she said .
The IDF on Thursday completed its preparations for countering the international aid flotilla .
Israel announced that it will prevent the ships from reaching their destination , and warned that it will not hesitate to make use of limited force if it becomes necessary .
Israel considers the effort by international left - wing elements and Islamic organizations as intentional provocation under the guise of humanitarian aid .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Ministry Director General Yossi Gal held a round of explanatory calls with foreign ministers from countries whose citizens are participating in the flotilla , and also with foreign diplomats on Thursday .
The Israeli message has been that the activists are welcome to bring the humanitarian aid to the port of Ashdod , where it will be examined and if found suitable will be permitted to enter the Gaza Strip through the land crossings .
If the activists try to break the siege , they will be arrested .
Barak and Gal insisted that there is no humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip .
IDF sources say that a clash with the activists on the ships will produce bad press from Israel 's point of view - but they believe that this is inevitable in any eventuality .
The instruction from the political leadership to the Israel Navy is to stop the flotilla from entering the Gaza Strip .
From the point of view of the navy , a successful mission would be if they manage to perform their duty in a controlled manner , with minimal use of force .
The flotilla with some 700 passengers is the largest yet attempt to break the Israeli - imposed embargo on the Gaza Strip .
Er galt als reaktionäre Reizfigur .
Dann kam die Sache mit den " Watsch'n " .
Aber erst nach dem Vorwurf der Veruntreuung ließen ihn die Seinen fallen .
Und Erzkonservative wachsen genügend nach .
Ein Kommentar von Frank Ochmann
Als am vergangenen Samstag der Erzbischof von München in Augsburg vorfuhr , hätte Walter Mixa wissen müssen , dass es aus war .
Die Kritik von Robert Zollitsch , dem ungeliebten Vorsitzenden der Deutschen Bischofskonferenz , hätte Mixa noch locker wegstecken können .
Es wäre ja auch nicht das erste Mal gewesen .
Und zudem ist es kein Geheimnis , dass die Oberhirten von Freiburg und Augsburg unterschiedlichen Flügeln im deutschen Episkopat angehören .
Dass mit Reinhard Marx nun aber nicht nur der zuständige Metropolitanbischof , sondern auch ein exponierter Vertreter der konservativen Fraktion auf den Plan trat , veränderte die Situation grundsätzlich .
Die Ohrfeigen zwangen ihn nicht zum Rücktritt
Und es waren nicht die vergangene Woche zugegebenen und vor vielen Jahren ausgeteilten " Watsch'n " , die den Augsburger Bischof schließlich zu Fall brachten .
In der Tat hatte er damals nur getan , was zumindest viele bei der Erziehung für völlig normal hielten .
Das war kein Rücktrittsgrund .
Es war das Geld , bei dem die Freundschaft der bischöflichen Brüder endete .
Den Verdacht , da habe es einer der ihren mit den Finanzen nicht so genau genommen , konnten sie , egal aus welchem Lager , nicht dulden .
Allein die Vorstellung , welche Fragen da womöglich auf die Kirche zukommen könnten , dürfte dem einen oder anderen Oberhirten das Atmen schwer gemacht haben .
Also wurde gehandelt .
Einvernehmlich und über alle ideologischen Grenzen hinweg .
Dass Mixa beim Angriff des nur selten auf derselben Seite streitenden Doppels Zollitsch und Marx nicht sofort kapitulierte , zeigt ein weiteres Mal seine unheilige Einfalt .
Mixa begriff offenbar auch nicht , dass dabei längst auch der Vatikan im Spiel war .
Erst als die Trennung von seinem Bischofssitz auch öffentlich gefordert wurde und selbst im eigenen Bistum kaum noch jemand hinter ihm stand , gab er widerwillig auf .
Der Augsburger Bischof wurde geopfert , um endlich wieder Ruhe in die eigenen Reihen zu bringen und der peinlichen Debatte um das Verhältnis der katholischen Kirche zu ihren eigenen moralischen Ansprüchen ein möglichst schnelles Ende zu bereiten .
Denn jeder
Tag mit weiteren Fragen und öffentlichen Disputen kann schließlich auch ein Tag sein , an dem neue Skandale ans Licht kommen .
Hintergrund Ein Bischof ist ein leitender Geistlicher christlicher Gemeinden .
Das
Wort ist abgeleitet vom griechischen " episkopos " ( Aufseher , Vorsteher ) .
Nach katholischem Verständnis übt der Bischof sein Amt in der Nachfolge der Apostel aus .
Als " Stellvertreter und Gesandter Christi " leitet er als Diözesanbischof sein Bistum .
Dort hat er die oberste Hirten - und Lehrgewalt inne .
Mindestens ein Weihbischof steht ihm zur Seite .
Zur Amtstracht gehören Bischofsstab , Mitra , Bischofsring und Brustkreuz .
In der evangelischen Kirche kennen nur einige Landeskirchen Bischöfe , andere werden zum Beispiel von einem Kirchenpräsidenten geführt .
Ein Don-Camillo- Typ
Mit Walter Mixa geht einer der letzten deutschen Bischöfe vom Don-Camillo - Typ .
Sie stammen noch aus Zeiten , in denen der sonntägliche Kirchgang eine Selbstverständlichkeit war und ein Pfarrer seine Herde noch nach Gutsherrenart führen konnte .
Zwar hatte auch Mixa schon den geistigen Umbruch erlebt , der mit den Studentenrevolten und dem Zweiten Vatikanischen Konzil in den 1960er - Jahren begann .
Doch brauchte die Revolution eine ganze Weile , bis sie auch tief ins Bayernland eingedrungen war .
Und Bischöfe wie Mixas Augsburger Vorvorgänger Josef Stimpfle taten damals alles , um die Hochburgen des katholischen Glaubens gegen die Angriffe der gottlosen
Welt zu verteidigen .
Dass die alte erzkonservative Fraktion unter den deutschen Bischöfen , zu der auch der Kölner Kardinal Meisner gehört , nun nach und nach abtritt , bedeutet allerdings keineswegs , dass damit in der deutschen Kirche aufgeklärtere Zeiten anbrechen .
Nicht das Gedankengut verändert sich , sondern die Art , wie es unter die Leute kommt .
Junge Bischöfe sind heute nicht selten mehrsprachig , erstklassig gebildet , durch ein Studium in Rom international vernetzt und dazu mit einem Selbstbewusstsein gesegnet , das keinen Kampf zur Durchsetzung der eigenen Werte scheut .
Wer heute zum ersten Mal den Bischofsring an den Finger steckt , weiß in aller Regel um seine Minderheitenposition und hat die oft schon von Kind an kennengelernt .
Und wie immer , wenn eine Gruppe in Bedrängnis gerät , rückt sie näher zusammen und radikalisiert womöglich auch ihre Sicht der Dinge .
In Ansätzen ist das auch hierzulande bereits zu beobachten .
Darum ist die jüngere Generation im Episkopat , wie sie etwa der neue Essener Bischof Franz - Josef Overbeck repräsentiert , nicht weltoffener als ihre barocken Vorväter à la Mixa .
Sie ist nur weltgewandter .
In light of the recent drug - related violence in Mexico , it is appropriate to reflect on how our current prohibition laws affect crime , law enforcementand the economy .
Many will have the knee - jerk reaction of wanting to see more of a crackdown on illegal drugs .
But I have to ask :
Have n't we been cracking down on drugs for several decades only to see the black market flourish and the violence escalate ?
Could there be a more effective approach ?
The illegality of drugs is , in fact , the Number One factor that keeps profits up for dealersand cartels , and ensures that organized crime dominates the market .
Cocaine , for example , has about a 17,000 - percent markup and sells for more than gold in some areas .
This is nothing new or unique to drugs , but a predictable outcome of prohibition .
During alcohol prohibition , Al Capone and others involved in organized crime made fortunes taking advantage of the dangerous and lucrative underground market the laws had created .
Every time law enforcement makes another bust , profits rise for the remaining suppliers .
These types of economic forces are insurmountable for law enforcement , but make for very good business for dealers and cartels .
For the rest of us , however , it is a disaster .
The war on drugs keeps our prisons full to bursting at great expense to taxpayers , but also at great danger to the public at large when the real criminals , the murderers , the rapists , the child molesters , are let out to make room for non-violent drug offenders .
We imprison more of our population per capita than Russia or China ever have , and yet criminals like Philip Garrido ( Jaycee Lee Dugard 's kidnapper ) are out there able to rape and kidnap again and again .
( It is interesting that in his case , a little marijuana caught the attention of law enforcement more than repeated reports from neighbors of children in his backyard ) .
The War on Drugs skews the priorities of law enforcement to the detriment of the public .
Repeal of alcohol prohibition certainly did organized crime no favors .
So too today , if we wanted to pull the rug out from under violent drug cartels , create legitimate job opportunities in place of the black market , realign the priorities of law enforcement , and make room in prison for the people that ought to be there , we need to end the insanity of the War on Drugs .
Decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level would be a start .
MEXICO CITY — Killings of gays and lesbians have risen in Mexico despite a government tolerance campaign and a law legalizing same - sex marriage in the capital , according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of civic groups .
A review of more than 70 newspapers in 11 Mexican states found an average of nearly 30 killings a year motivated by homophobia between 1995 and 2000 , compared to nearly 60 a year between 2001 and 2009 , the report said .
Ricardo Bucio , president of the government 's National Council for the Prevention of Discrimination , backed the report , saying it gave visibility to a lingering problem .
The government launched a radio campaign in 2005 to promote tolerance of homosexuals .
In December , the Mexico City legislature approved the first law in Latin America explicitly giving gay marriages the same status as heterosexual ones .
The legislation , affecting only the capital , also allows same - sex couples to adopt children .
Mexico City 's annual gay pride parade draws tens of thousands of people , and in some neighborhoods gays openly hold hands .
But violence against gays seems to have increased as more become public about their sexual orientation , said Alejandro Brito , director of Letter S , one of the groups that released the report .
Mexico City had the most homophobia - motivated killings , with 144 between 1995 and 2009 , according to the report .
Despite the federal government 's push to promote tolerance , President Felipe Calderon 's conservative administration campaigned against the Mexico City law allowing same - sex marriage .

A PALESTINIAN VIEW
The same song in a different key
by Akram Baker
Much has been said about United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's December 10 speech at the Brookings Institute .
Analysis has ranged from it being admission of complete failure on the part of the Obama administration and a win for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu ( with US President Barack Obama backing down on the settlements ) to some in Palestinian - American circles declaring it a victory for the Palestinians ( with the withdrawal of the much - criticized , so - called US " security sweetener " package for Israel in return for a 90 - day settlement - building moratorium ) .
All of these may be correct in a technical sense , but they completely miss the greater meaning .
No new American policy was laid out in Clinton 's speech .
She utterly failed to lay out any novel approaches to solving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
What was interesting was the very subtle change in tone .
Looking first at the visuals , all that was left was for Clinton to put a Star of David crown on her head to underscore just how much she loves Israel .
The large backdrop was a montage of dual Israeli and American flags with -- more or less -- only the Israeli one showing on TV and still images of those behind the podium .
I was just waiting for the PA system to break into a rousing rendition of HaTikva .
And as is so depressingly common , Secretary Clinton spent the first ten minutes or so of her address parroting every declaration of love possible about the enduring and infinite strength of US - Israel relations .
But then something , however subtle , changed .
She mentioned Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , who was in the audience , and began what could only be called a glowing appraisal of the Palestinian leader .
With Israel , she spoke in general platitudes about the relationship , words taken from the standard handbook if you wish , while with Fayyad , the secretary not only heaped praise in the abstract , but was very specific in her comments : state - building , institution - building , security , economics , infrastructure .
And all of this accomplished " under very difficult circumstances " -- read : Israel is not helping him , as it should .
On the other side , Clinton had very few nice things to say about Netanyahu .
To those who were looking , it was clear that she was seriously miffed about Bibi passing on her way - too - generous offer of unrivalled security , military and political carrots for nothing more than an inconsequential short halt to settlement - building .
It had seemed for a while that the US administration was trying its best to imitate Spike Lee 's Mars Blackmon in its " Please , baby , baby , please " approach toward incentives for Israel to end its intransigence .
Sources say that Obama was particularly upset about the rejection , feeling that Clinton had gone too far in the first place .
Whatever the reason , the secretary of state was not happy with the way Israel 's government was treating them .
At the same time , there were undertones that Clinton was not happy about the way Obama had thrown down the gauntlet about settlements in the first place , feeling that he should n't have bet the barn from the outset of his term .
But she qualified that stance with her very clear rejection of the settlement " experiment " .
I believe that Obama was absolutely right in understanding that stopping the settlements is the first step toward resolving the conflict -- which can only come with an end of the Israeli occupation of Palestine .
I have no doubt in my mind that the Americans , Obama and Clinton in particular , know what has to be done to end the conflict .
There are enough papers and resolutions and plans to fill the entire White House twice over explaining in finite detail how to divide the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan : an end of the Israeli occupation of 1967 , compensation of refugees with a symbolic return of a few to Israel and joint sharing of Jerusalem under international protection .
I cannot believe that intellectually , they do not have a firm grasp on this reality .
However , what is needed is political will to implement the solution .
Clinton forcefully set out the parameters , but just as weakly failed to inject the key element for success : accountability .
By not putting the parties ( especially Israel ) on notice that failure to meet the following measures will lead to A , B and C , she -- like administrations before her - - took the bite out of her bark .
Carrots without sticks are just vegetables .
The hard fact is that Israel cannot continue to occupy Palestine with impunity .
Over the long term , it cannot survive unless it decides that making peace with the Palestinians is the only way to guarantee its future .
Its military strength is fleeting and no country in history has ever survived on that alone .
If the US really cares about Israel , it has the moral responsibility of telling the Israelis as much in unambiguous terms .
All the rest is nothing more than an academic exercise .
Maybe , just maybe , the tone in Hillary Clinton 's voice was the first faint sound of that happening .

He is also an organizational development and restructuring expert .
Los Angeles has lost over 150,000 jobs in the past year , is on the brink of bankruptcy , and experienced an unexpected 16 percent decline in sales tax revenue last year .
And it 's located in a state with its own dire fiscal situation that is also facing unexpected gaps in tax revenue .
Yet this week the Los Angeles City Attorney 's office made a move that 's certain to make things worse for its citizens : forcing over 400 functioning businesses to close shop , under threat of jail time .
Do n't worry , though .
It 's no big deal .
Those businesses are only selling medicine .
Medical marijuana , that is .
As detailed in my May Reason magazine cover story , Los Angeles struggled for years with regulating medical marijuana storefronts — which thrived in L.A. as in no other city .
In January the city finally came down with an ordinance imposing a variety of new restrictions , including how the businesses handled cash , provided security and lighting , and paid their employees , as well as insisting that the shops were not technically allowed to make a profit .
But the ordinance 's most important effect will be to reduce the 500 - plus functioning storefronts serving the city 's medical marijuana community to a mere 70 ( with some possible grandfathering that might bring the eventual total higher ) .
On June 7 , the ordinance is finally supposed to go into effect .
Under the law 's tenets , any functioning medical pot store that did not register with the city prior to a November 2007 moratorium is outlawed — despite the fact that in October 2009 a judge declared the moratorium legally void .
Thus , as the L.A. City Attorney 's office declared in a letter issued to 439 stores on Tuesday :
Dear Business / Property Owner : On June 7 , 2010 , Article 5.1 of Chapter IV of the Los Angeles Municipal Code ( Medical Marijuana Collective ) will become operative .
… Section 45.19.6.7 of Article 5.1 provides that " any existing medical marijuana collective , dispensary , operator , establishment , or provider that does not comply with the requirements of this article must immediately cease operation … . "
The establishment at the above referenced address is operating as a medical marijuana provider and did not register with the City Clerk prior to November 13 , 2007 .
Consequently , this establishment does not , and cannot , comply with the requirements of Article 5.1 .
Under Section 45.19.6.7 , this establishment must therefore immediately cease its operations …..
Violation of any section of the Los Angeles Municipal Code is a misdemeanor , punishable by six months in jail and / or a $ 1000.00 fine … and a nuisance , subject to a daily civil penalty in the amount of $ 2500.00 .
In addition to existing remedies under federal , state , and local law , Section 45.19.6.9 of Article 5.1 authorizes the City to seek injunctive relief , revocation of the certificate of occupancy for the location , disgorgement and payment of any and all monies unlawfully obtained , costs of abatement , costs of investigation and attorney fees .
That 's a very official , very stern way of saying that a business which is paying taxes , paying salaries to employees , providing support for companies and families , and providing medicine to satisfied patients / customers , has to stop doing all those positive things — some of which directly benefit the government — simply because the city says so .
The reasons are stated , lamely and without support , in the preamble to the ordinance , with some jabber about crime , health hazards , and public safety and welfare .
That jabber , as my Reason feature shows , is unsupported by any rigorous evidence beyond the petty complaints of a small number of very vocal citizens .
L.A. attorney Eric Shevin , an experienced medical marijuana litigator , told me this week he 's working on a legal challenge to these shutdown letters , one that might be based on the notion that order takes away a vested property right without due process .
( He 's also working on a larger challenge to the ordinance itself , as is the group Americans for Safe Access . )
Shevin takes heart from an April decision from Superior Court Judge Robert S. Boyd in California 's Sonoma County .
Boyd 's decision came in a case involving the attempt to shut down a medical marijuana storefront in Sonoma County .
He concluded that under a doctrine derived from the Supreme Court 's 1985 City of Cleburne decision , any California law that prejudicially disadvantages medical marijuana stores fails legal muster if it is based solely on " groundless assumptions , prejudices , and fears " and has no rational basis .
Shevin thinks L.A. 's ordinance could be successfully challenged on similar grounds .
And this week 's flood of shutdown letters is n't the end of the trouble that the new ordinance will cause L.A. businesses in the coming months .
From the time the ordinance goes into effect , those medical marijuana stores that were registered with the city prior to the moratorium in 2007 ( around 137 are still thought to be operating ) will have to prove to the city they are meeting all the other requirements of the ordinance and apply to operate legally going forward .
But staying legal will be very tricky , thanks to the very tight buffer requirements that force legal pot shops to be 1,000 feet away from a variety of " sensitive uses " ( including libraries , schools , youth centers , churches , or other marijuana stores ) and bars them from being adjacent to or across an alley from residential property .
Most L.A. retail space , of course , is next to or across an alley from residential property .
While neither city officials nor the medical marijuana community has yet fully mapped the city to see what legal areas remain available for pot stores , local marijuana collective operator and activist Don Duncan says that although registered stores will theoretically have six months to get fully legal , they have just one month to locate and inform the city about their new legal locations .
And Duncan points out that the buffers are n't the only difficulty : " It 's also finding property that 's not occupied with a landlord willing to rent " to medical marijuana facilities , which can be the target of constant legal hassles from localities and federal cops .
Duncan , who is probably the most well - connected man on the L.A. medical marijuana scene , says he only knows four stores that have found workable properties , while another two are already OK where they are , " which is a pretty small number considering 90 - 100 are looking around the city . "
Attorney Eric
Shevin also adds that the ordinance requires legal marijuana cooperatives to be in compliance with state law .
That 's a very tricky proposition , since it will be L.A. 's city and county attorneys judging whether those shops are compliant .
In the city and county 's opinion , backed up by one local judge but in clear contradiction to the state 's guidelines about medical marijuana , if you are exchanging cash for pot even to certified medical marijuana patients , you are breaking the law .
Thus , a city facing economic trouble will kill thriving businesses , destroy the entrepreneurial dreams of individuals and families , and cause great inconvenience to qualified patients .
And that 's all in the name of making it harder for those patients to obtain a plant that the state of California legally permits them to obtain , while solving no social or civic problem larger than quieting a small handful of noisy citizens who convinced the L.A. City Council that pot stores made their neighborhoods feel icky and undesirable .
It 's all in a day 's work for the Los Angeles City Attorney 's office .

By By Stephanie Dearing Apr 11 , 2010 in World Reuters / Ipsos undertook a poll to measure the strength of human belief in extraterrestrial beings , and the results are astounding .

One out of every five persons believes in extraterrestrials is the conclusion of an exhaustive poll that saw 23,000 people canvassed in 22 countries .
While the majority of adults polled did not believe aliens were living here on earth , those polled in Asian nations expressed a strong belief that aliens , disguised as humans , are here .
The poll results demonstrate men are more likely to believe in aliens than women .
Believing in aliens , even believing that they walk among us disguised as a human , is nowhere near as frightening as what is termed alien abduction phenomenon .
The phenomenon was explored in a recent movie , The Fourth Kind , which portrays a young female psychologist who comes to believe aliens are bedeviling her Alaskan community .
The modern belief that extraterrestrials visit earth has been growing since at least the late 1940s and the well - known Roswell incident , or Area 51 , as this case is sometimes called .
Abductees tend to report more than one unwanted interaction with aliens .
Another category of believer are those who claim to be in contact with aliens on a regular basis .
These interactions are not reported as harmful , and the believers welcome the interaction .
A recent study written up for the Fortean Times , while not conclusive , leans towards dispelling popular psychological explanations of reported alien abductions .
Explanations tend to debunk the belief in interactions with aliens as dreams , hallucinations , fantasies , false memories or the result of a temporal lobe epileptic seizure .
On the other hand , the challenge to reports of alien abductions or social interactions is the provision of proof Proof aside , the Vatican has said it is okay to believe in aliens .
Reflecting the poll 's findings , UFOlogy is not dismissed in China , but is instead treated seriously .
The growing belief in paranormal phenomena such as extraterrestrials , was one reason for the popularity of the X - Files , a television show that featured two FBI agents , one a believer , the other a firm skeptic , chasing down dark and spine - tingling mysteries .

SATIRE and ridicule can help win the fight against al - Qaeda by stripping it of its glamour and mystique , argues a team of British researchers .
Beating the Islamist movement is as much about winning the battle of ideas and undermining al - Qaeda 's counter - culture cachet as it is about conventional anti-terrorism operations , said the report .
" Terrorism must be defeated through the deliberate ' toxification ' of the al - Qaeda brand ; not by making it seem dangerous , but by exposing it as dumb , " Jamie Bartlett , one of the report 's authors , told AFP .
" Al - Qaeda has to be ridiculed as the equivalent of a middle - aged dad at a school disco : enthusiastic , incompetent and excruciatingly uncool . "
Dr Bartlett , together with Jonathan Birdwell and Michael King , published The edge of violence , a radical approach of extremism on the website of the London - based think tank Demos .
The report summarised two years of work in Britain , Canada , Denmark , France and the Netherlands , which included interviews with 58 people convicted of terror - related offences and with 20 radical , but non-violent Muslims .
Researchers also interviewed 70 Muslims in Canada and 75 local and national experts .
" An increasingly important part of al - Qaeda 's appeal in the West is its dangerous , romantic and counter - cultural characteristics , " said an executive summary of the report .
" Young Muslims are drawn , like young people throughout the ages , to excitement , rebellion and a desire to be cool , " Dr Bartlett , who heads up the extremism and violence department at Demos , told AFP .
" But like every anti-establishment movement before it , al - Qaeda has become cool , with Mr bin Laden cast as the new Che , " he added .
One could not deny that ideology was important to some of al - Qaeda terrorists , he said .
" But there is a blind spot that people do n't quite see : there is another side for some people which is the call , the idea of adventure .
" You can understand : it 's quite exciting if you are from a rundown banlieue in Lyon or wherever , to go overseas , travel , see the world , get to shoot a gun .
It 's not surprising that some young men would be drawn to that .
" This is true of young men the world over : whether it's in Islam , in football hooliganism or in gangs . "
So while it was important for the police and intelligence agencies to continue their battle against al - Qaeda , other tactics also had an important role to play .
Part of the battle was to strip the movement of its glamour and mystique , said the report .
Messages " from a range of organisations , should stress that most al - Qaeda - inspired terrorists are in fact incompetent , narcissistic , irreligious " .
The idea was to demystify terrorist lives and deaths , said Dr Bartlett .
" The average day in the life of an Islamic extremist is similar to that of a petty criminal : tedious , lonely and punctuated by fear . "
Satire was another powerful tool , the report added , noting that it had been used effectively against both the Ku Klux Klan and the British Fascist party in the 1930s .
Satire , however , was not a job for the authorities , but for others in society , it added .
Fighting al - Qaeda was not about preventing angry young Muslims from rebelling , but about finding ways to channel a natural sense of subversion and radicalism into non-violent areas , the report argued .
It also recommended a liberal approach to fighting al - Qaeda 's ideology , exposing it to debate rather than suppressing it , but being sure to provide effective counter - arguments .
" The threat of violent radicalisation can never be ' solved ' or completely neutralised ; it can only be managed , " the report warned .
" Governments must focus on the things it can realistically change , while the lead role must be played by society - individuals , groups , organisations and communities . "
Hal Turner took the stand today in his federal trial and accused the FBI of instructing him to make violent and racist statements .
The North Bergen , New Jersey , radio talk show host is on trial for allegedly threatening three Chicago - based federal appeals court judges .
In June of 2009 , Turner said the judges " deserved to be killed " for a ruling they made in a gun control case .
In more than two hours of testimony , Turner described how he was recruited in 2003 by the FBI 's Newark - based Joint Terrorism Task Force .
He said he was paid " in excess of $ 100,000 " by the FBI during his almost five years as an informant , according to The Record .
Turner ’s first trial ended in deadlock back in December .
A mistrial was declared after the jury deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquitting Turner who was originally indicted in Illinois .
During the first trial , Assistant Special Agent in Charge Amy Pickett , the third highest ranking FBI Official in New York City , admitted that Turner was involved in “ National Security Intelligence . ”
On February 16 , The Record reported federal prosecutors sought to bar Turner from revealing his longtime role as a FBI informant to a jury during the current trial .
“ Prosecutors want U.S. District Judge Donald Walter to preclude Turner 's lawyers from referring to his background as a confidential source for the FBI , ” the newspaper reported .
According to research conducted by Alexandra Natapoff of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles , the FBI maintains an army of at least 15,000 " confidential informants , ” while the DEA admits to having 4,000 snitches .
“ But the number of informants working directly for the Feds is probably only a tiny fraction of the entire stukachi [ a Russian epithet used to describe a secret police informant ] population , given the uncounted masses of snitches working for state and local police agencies , ” writes William Norman Grigg of the Pro Libertate blog .
On March 2 , two federal judges testified in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that they feared for their lives after Turner posted the comments on his blog .
“ I read it as a threat to kill me , ” testified U.S. Appeals Court Judge William Bauer .
However , neither judge asked the U.S. Marshal Service for special protection .
“ The government ’s case began to fall apart almost immediately when government witnesses confirmed Turner was a national security intelligence operative for the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force from 2003 through 2008 , ” the Family of Hal Turner blog noted on February 24 .
“ Turner ’s attorneys pointed out that the FBI itself ‘ counseled ’
Turner on the lawful use of violent rhetoric so he could flush out radicals before they committed acts of terrorism . ”
The Family of Hal Turner blog , however , does not provide evidence of “ radicals ” bent on committing acts of terrorism in order to make its case .
The FBI has a long track record of creating fake terror groups and urging easily conned patsies to plot harebrained terror attacks .
According to the MIAC report and the Department of Homeland Security ’s “ rightwing extremism ” report , the government considers Ron Paul supporters , Libertarians , Constitutionalists , returning veterans , and Second Amendment advocates a threat .
Both reports conflate the miniscule white supremacist movement with the larger and vastly more popular patriot movement .
In addition , the government considers the anti-war movement a threat .
Responding to ACLU FOIA requests filed in 20 states on behalf of more than 150 organizations and individuals in 2006 , the government released documents revealing monitoring and infiltration by the FBI and local law enforcement , targeting political , environmental , anti-war and faith - based groups .
Celebrity wrestler Hulk Hogan has been wearing hair extensions since his split from ex-wife LINDA - after melting off his iconic blond mane in a dyeing mishap .
The star , real name Terry Bollea , relied on his former partner to colour his locks before their divorce last year ( Jul09 ) .
After the split , Hogan tried the beauty treatment on his own - but he left the dye on too long and the bleach caused permanent damage .
He explains , " When I was married back in the day Linda would do my hair - I never paid attention .
When she filed for divorce and I was on my own and the roots grew out , I went to my local drug store and bought the hair ( dye ) and put in on .
I did n't know you were n't supposed to put it on the scalp .
I kind of rubbed it through ( my hair ) and then the phone rang .
It ( the dye ) was on for an hour ... ( Then ) I 'm in the shower and it ( my hair ) all goes down there ( the drain ) . "
When Sunil Chhetri signed for the Kansas City Wizards in April , he became the first Indian in Major League Soccer , and only the third to play in a professional league overseas .
India boasts the best cricket team in the world , has successful golf and tennis players and now competes in Formula One , yet the national football side is ranked 132nd in the world , sandwiched between Swaziland and Sierra Leone .
World Football asks why India , a country with a population of 1.2 billion people is unable to produce more talented footballers ?
BBC football reporter Sean Wheelock asked Chhetri why this is - and why more players do n't travel abroad .

Mohammad Bin Hammam called for club owners to " accelerate steps to professionalise the game " .
Rahul Tandon reports on the Indian football scene from Kolkata , which is considered to be the home of football in the country - with India 's two biggest clubs located in the city .
The sun beams fiercely on the Brooklyn Botanic Garden , and even as evening approaches , the humidity is relentless .
Backstage , costume makers prepare to show off their best to a circus tent loaded with strangers who share their eccentric hobby .
I glance over my opening speech one last time before noticing a veteran cosplayer sweating bullets through her eye shadow , shaded cheekbones and full - body jumpsuit .
Though she has been modeling her homemade costumes for over six years , earning over thirty awards from conventions across America , Caitlin Beards is sweating through her skintight pleather and spandex one - piece .
This is her one - hundredth costume to date , and she has poured three months of her skill into sculpting the seven yards of metal chain and the eighteen - inch tall wig strapped to her head to become the video game heroine Bayonetta .
Beards , like many others , belongs to a previously underground sub-culture of geeks that has blossomed in recent years .
The selected nineteen cosplayers standing with me under the tent are accustomed to posing for photos at conventions , but never for an audience of magazine and radio personalities , and never after having their make - up applied by personnel from MAC Cosmetics .
For the first time in New York ’s history , fashion - centered video game and Japanese anime fans have been pampered and prepped by internationally acclaimed make - up artists .
2010 has so far marked a new step in public exposure and professional treatment for cosplaying , and the community is still rising in the public eye .
The hobby of cosplay is easy to explain but difficult to execute : it is the act of dressing like your favorite character from a TV show , movie , video game or comic book .
In some social circles , cosplay is a competitive sport , to others it is a challenge to prove their sewing skills , and for some it is purely for fun and an excuse to meet other fans .
The French navy has located the flight recorders of the Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic almost a year ago , but retrieving them may be an impossible mission , officials said .
The recorders have been localised with a margin of error of three nautical miles ( five kilometres ) in a remote area of the Atlantic Ocean .
But French military officials cautioned the breakthrough did not mean the black boxes will be successfully retrieved from the ocean floor .
" It 's like trying to find a shoe box in an area the size of Paris , at a depth of 3,000 metres and in a terrain as rugged as the Alps , " said navy spokesman Hugues du Plessis d'Argentre .
Flight 447 was en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro when it went down on June 1 in stormy weather , killing all 228 people on board .
The crash was the worst in Air France 's 75 - year history .
Intensive but unsuccessful sweeps of the Atlantic Ocean using submarines equipped with deep - sea sonar had turned up some debris but no sign of the flight data and cockpit recorders .
The flight recorders from the Airbus A330 are key to understanding what caused the disaster , which remains largely unexplained .
The French navy started a new operation on Monday to find the black boxes .
Welcoming the news , the families of the crash victims said it raised hopes , but they quickly added that they would hold off on any celebration until the flight recorders were raised to the surface .
" This is a sign of hope .
It 's very good news for the families after 11 months of waiting , " said Jean - Baptiste Audousset , president of an association grouping the families of 60 victims .
French government spokesman Luc Chatel added : " We must remain extremely cautious , because at this time we are talking about an area where they have been located . "
" We then have to see if it is possible to recover the black boxes , depending on the depth , the surface area to cover ... so I will remain extremely cautious , " Mr Chatel told France Info radio .
Sonar breakthrough
The breakthrough in pinpointing the area where the black boxes can be found came after new computer software was used to decode data collected by deep - sea submarines during their search last summer , said the defence ministry .
The latest search effort was set to wrap up on May 25 , but officials said it may be extended following the new findings .
The latest search covered an area of 1,500 square kilometres in a remote area far off the coast of Brazil .
The French air accident agency BEA has said the jet 's speed probes , made by French firm
Thales , gave false readings and were " one of the factors " in the crash but " not the sole cause " .
Pilots ' unions and some of the relatives of victims have accused Air France and Airbus of ignoring longstanding problems with air speed monitors on its jets in the run up to the disaster .
The companies insist their jets met all safety standards , but they have nevertheless now replaced the speed monitors with a different model produced by US firm Goodrich .

A SNARL of superhighways and skyscrapers , Houston is easily dismissed as a corporate campus  home to Fortune 500 giants like Halliburton and Waste Management and a company formerly known as Enron ( currently known as Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation ) .
And the view from an airplane is n’t exactly inviting : a flat and featureless plain of generic towers sprawling into the horizon .
But in recent years , this Texas megalopolis has been inching back to its urban core .
Cool art galleries have sprung up in once blighted neighborhoods .
Midcentury modern buildings have been saved and restored .
And former factories have been turned into buzzing restaurants and bars .
Yes , oil money still reigns supreme , but it now competes with culture .
Friday
5:30 p.m .
1 ) PARK IT DOWNTOWN
Houston may be a sea of office towers , but this subtropical city is also surprisingly green .
Hundreds of parks carpet the city , and one of the newest  a 12 - acre park called Discovery Green ( discoverygreen.com )  is quickly becoming the heart of the city ’s still sleepy downtown .
Opened in 2008 , the park serves as a true public space ; elderly couples stroll around the artificial lake as toddlers roll down grassy knolls .
For sunset cocktails , follow the area ’s young professionals to the Grove ( 1611 Lamar Street ; 713-337-7321 ; thegrovehouston.com ) , a modern restaurant inside the park , which offers treehouse - like views of the skyline .
8 p.m.
2 ) GULF OF TEX -MEX
The city ’s young chefs are working overtime to step out of the shadow of Texas barbecue .
Among the most feted these days is Bryan Caswell , the chef and owner of Reef ( 2600 Travis Street ; 713-526-8282 ; reefhouston.com ) , a seafood restaurant with a Southern twist .
Housed in a former car dealership with soaring windows and ceilings , the restaurant creates a dramatic space for winning dishes like roasted grouper with corn pudding and grilled peach ( $ 25 ) .
On a recent evening the dining room was humming with an eclectic crowd that included men in white suits eating ceviche , couples on dates and well - dressed families celebrating birthdays .
10 p.m .
3 ) SLICE OF AUSTIN
Sports bars and mega - clubs fuel much of the city ’s night life , but a clutch of down - to - earth bars can be found along the tree - lined streets of Montrose .
Poison Girl ( 1641 Westheimer Road ; 713-527-9929 ; myspace.com/poisongirlbar ) has pinball machines , a long shelf of whiskeys and a dirt - packed backyard jammed with 20 - somethings in vintage Wranglers and Keds .
Down the street is Anvil Bar and Refuge ( 1424 Westheimer Road ; 713-523-1622 ; anvilhouston.com ) , which styles itself as a classic cocktail bar , though it can feel like a meat market on weekends .
A handful of gay bars are also nearby , including the oldie but still rowdy 611 Hyde Park Pub ( 611 Hyde Park Boulevard ; 713-526-7070 ) .

MERCHANT CREDIT CARD ABUSES :
What They Cannot Ask You To Do Many merchants engraft their own rules to your use of a credit card , usually without the right to do so .
What are you required to do and what can you rightfully refuse to do ?
The Financial Guide explains your rights .
Do sales clerks ask you to write your phone number or address on a credit card slip ?
Have you been told that " store policy " requires a $ 25 minimum for credit card use ?
Have you been charged an extra 3 % just for using a major credit card ?
When you pay by personal check , does the clerk ask for two forms of identification and then write your credit card number on your check ?
These practices violate your privacy , expose you to potential credit fraud and may be illegal in some cases .
We will tell you how to say " no " to a merchant who engages in these impermissible credit card practices :
Writes your personal information on a bank credit card sales slip ,
Imposes a minimum sales amount for credit card purchases ,
Charges extra for payment by credit card , or
Writes your credit card number on your personal check .
Merchants may ask you to provide a phone number , home address , or other personal information on credit card sales slips .
This practice not only violates your privacy , but American Express , MasterCard , and Visa prohibit requiring it as a condition of sale .
There is no need for merchants to obtain phone numbers or other personal information from customers .
Once they have correctly processed the bank card transaction ( gotten an authorization number and made sure the signatures match ) , they are guaranteed to receive payment .
TIP : If you do n’t want to provide personal information on a credit card sales slip , you can refuse to do so .
The merchant has no right to refuse you the sale ( although unknowledgeable clerks may have no authority to vary from store policy ) .
Further , if you refuse to present identification , such as a driver ’s license , the merchant may not refuse to make a credit card sale under Visa , MasterCard , and Amex rules .
TIP : If you exceed your credit limit , the card - issuing bank absorbs the loss , so there is no need for the merchant to contact you .
Thus , there ’s no reason to provide your personal information .
Some stores require consumers to spend at least $ 20 ( or some other minimum ) to pay for purchases by credit card .
They engage in this practice because they and their banks do not want the expense of processing a credit card transaction involving a small amount of money .
This practice defeats one of the major purposes of credit cards — convenience — and may force credit card users to spend more than they want to .
In addition , minimum charge requirements vary from merchant to merchant , and there are no regulations requiring disclosure of these minimum purchase levels .
Visa 's and MasterCard 's regulations prohibit minimum charge amounts .
American Express 's regulations do not explicitly prohibit minimum charges , but its policy is to discourage any merchant practices that create a " barrier to acceptance . "
Amex does prohibit " discrimination " against the Amex card , however , so if a merchant has no minimum charge for Visa and MasterCard , the merchant may not discriminate against Amex by imposing a minimum charge .
TIP : If a store requires a minimum purchase for Visa or MasterCard , point out to the store manager that the practice is prohibited by the card companies .
Some merchants seek to impose a service fee for all credit card purchases .
When a merchant gives a credit card slip to the credit card company or bank for processing , a percentage of each purchase — usually 1.5 % to 5 % of the purchase amount — is deducted .
This " merchant discount fee " helps pay for the bank 's services and for the credit card system .
By charging extra for credit card use , the merchant passes the discount fee on to customers .
MORE : Since 1984 , when a Truth in Lending law ban on surcharges expired , some states have enacted laws prohibiting surcharges ; see States That Prohibit Credit Card Surcharges .
Visa and MasterCard prohibit surcharges , and American Express discourages them .
Amex does prohibit " discrimination " against the Amex card , however , so if a merchant accepts Visa and MasterCard ( and can not impose a surcharge under those companies ' rules ) , the merchant may not discriminate against Amex by imposing a surcharge .
TIP : Any merchant that accepts American Express cards and also accepts Visa and / or MasterCard may not charge consumers a surcharge on Amex purchases .
Surcharges invite numerous abuses by retailers , including bait - and - switch tactics .
There are no laws on how and when surcharges must be disclosed , making it difficult to figure out the total price of an item .
Travelers often find it difficult to get out - of - state checks accepted , and should not be penalized for using credit cards .
Further , credit card acceptance usually produces higher sales for merchants , offsetting the cost of processing credit card transactions .
Note that a cash discount is legal and permitted under all credit card companies rules .
A cash discount offers a lower price for cash than credit ; for example , many gasoline stations offer cash discounts .
While this may merely be a loophole , it is permitted .
In addition , there are a few state governmental agencies , including state tax offices and motor vehicle departments , that are permitted to charge surcharges due to state laws that do not permit them to pay discount fees .
However , retail merchants may not impose surcharges .
Merchants often ask for two forms of identification before accepting a personal check as payment for a purchase : a driver 's license and a major credit card .
Merchants also believe consumers with credit cards are less likely to bounce checks .
This is a misconception : nearly 90 % of all bounced checks result from arithmetic error , not fraud .
When merchants write your credit card number on your personal check , they are subjecting you to possible fraud .
Anyone who sees the check sees your name , address , telephone number , and credit card number .
Further , several states use an individual 's Social Security number as the only identifying number on a driver 's license .
Once a thief has your Social Security number , along with the other information on the check , he or she can get your credit report , and even apply for credit in your name .
Someone can use your credit card number to order merchandise by phone or through the mail by requesting the merchandise be sent to a post office box or an address other than your own .
Someone might use your personal information to apply for credit in your name , then run up bills on your account without paying them , of course .
People who are victims of so - called application fraud do not find out until months or even years later , when they begin receiving letters from creditors , by which time the damage has been done to their credit histories .
Although Visa , MasterCard and American Express do not have the authority to prohibit the practice of writing credit card numbers on checks , the three card companies do prohibit merchants from charging a credit card account to cover a bounced check .
MORE : Several states prohibit merchants ’ writing a credit card number when accepting a check as payment .
Unless you live in one of the states where the practice is illegal , there is no way to stop the merchant from refusing you the sale ; see States That Prohibit Recording A Credit Card Number On A Check .
TIP : If a merchant asks for your credit card number , ask why he or she needs to record it , since , due to the above prohibition , nothing can be done with it .
TIP :
There is probably no harm in allowing a merchant to see that you carry a major credit card , and even to note on the check whether it is Visa , MasterCard , or American Express .
For your own safety , this is the only credit card - related information you should allow to be recorded .
You should not allow the merchant to record the credit card number .
If the sale is refused , ask to speak with the store manager .
Explain the risks of fraud , and point out that the rules of the three major credit card companies prohibit charging a credit card to cover a bounced check .
You might also point out that , if there is a problem , merchants usually have all the information they need to locate the customer written right on the check : name , address , phone number and driver 's license number .
Also , merchants will not be able to use the credit card number to locate the consumer .
Many store clerks are simply unaware of the potential crimes associated with the use of personal information written on checks .
Other cards may not provide cardholders with any of the protections described above .
However , purchases made with other cards are covered in all states that have laws prohibiting the practices described here .
TIP : Cardholders who experience the practices discussed here should complain to store managers and encourage the card company to change its policies .
When merchants violate the policies described here , report them to Visa , MasterCard , and American Express .

This is the time of year when hundreds of thousands of young Americans graduate from institutions of higher learning all across the United States .
This horde of fresh - faced young Americans is full of knowledge and ambition and is ready to get good jobs and start living the American Dream .
But there is only one problem .
There are not nearly enough good jobs for them .
In fact , there have not been nearly enough good jobs for college graduates for a number of years .
As a result , record numbers of college graduates are moving back in with mommy and daddy and are taking jobs as Wal - Mart greeters , Chinese food delivery people and video store clerks .
But it is tough to blame them when the job openings simply are not there .
It is hard to describe how depressing it can be for a young person to send out dozens of resumes day after day and not receive a single positive response .
The reality is that the real world is a lot different from the safe environment of college .
In fact , 2010 college graduates are finding out that the real world can be downright cruel .
Many parents end up becoming incredibly frustrated when their college - educated children cannot get a decent job , but the reality is that the vast majority of college graduates are struggling right now .
In a piece recently published on MSN Money , Joe Queenan described the environment that 2010 college graduates are being thrown into as the enter the real world ....
They will enter an economy where roughly 17 % of people aged 20 through 24 do not have a job , and where two million college graduates are unemployed .
They will enter a world where they will compete tooth and nail for jobs as waitresses , pizza delivery men , file clerks , bouncers , trainee busboys , assistant baristas , interns at bodegas .
Things are not pretty out there .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in March the national rate of unemployment in the United States was 9.7 % , but for Americans younger than 25 it was 18.8 % .
In fact , according to a Pew Research Center study , approximately 37 % of all Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 have either been unemployed or underemployed at some point during the recession .
So if you are a young American that cannot get a decent job you are far from alone .
And unfortunately , America is looking to this new generation of college graduates as the generation that will pay for all of our national financial mistakes .
The U.S. national debt has just passed the 13 trillion dollar mark , and the Social Security system is facing massive shortfalls in the years ahead .
America has piled up the biggest mountains of government , business and consumer debt in the history of the world , and now the bills are coming due .
So who is expected to pay for this mess ?
Generation Y .
In his recent piece , Joe Queenan described it this way ....
The legacy costs that society has imposed on young people will be a millstone around their necks for decades .
Who 's going to pay for the health care bill ?
Gen Y .
Who 's going to pay off the federal deficit ?
Gen Y . Who 's going to fund all those cops ' and teachers ' and firemen 's pensions ?
Gen Y .
Who 's going to support baby boomers as they suck the Social Security system dry while wheezing around Tuscany ?
Gen Y .
Now , one would think that anyone younger than 30 would be more than a little peeved about the legacy of debt that we have left to them .
Well , the truth is that a lot of them are , and it is not only folks under 30 .
According to a new poll , seven in ten Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in Washington D.C. , and 22 percent say that they are downright " angry " about the direction the U.S. is headed .
There is a rapidly growing anger that is sweeping the nation as millions of Americans have begun realizing what a fine mess the folks in D.C. have gotten us into .
Unfortunately , the financial problems of the U.S. are accelerating at a staggering pace .
The U.S. government is projected to run a 1.6 trillion dollar deficit this year , which is about four times higher than deficits were typically running during the Bush administration .
That is beyond catastrophic - that is downright nightmarish .
Were n't we supposed to be creating a better life for the generations to follow ?
Instead , we have left them with a debt burden that will haunt them for the rest of our lives .
Because of our endless appetite for debt , we have squandered the wealth that our forefathers left us and we have ruined the greatest economic machine that the world has ever seen .
Now we are leaving future generations a financial mess that seems virtually impossible to solve under the current system .
So if they seem a bit upset , please try to be understanding .
They have a very good reason to be angry with us .

Community members are calling for the Phoenix Union High School District to implement a policy to keep school - resource officers from complying with Arizona 's new immigration law .
Their concern is that the sworn police officers assigned to campuses will be arresting students or their family members who are in the country illegally .
School officials sought to assure residents that would not occur .
At a meeting this week , Eve Aguirre , a parent in the Phoenix Union district , demanded the district adopt a policy of non-compliance in the wake of Senate Bill 1070 , saying the strict new immigration law negatively affects young people .
The law takes effect July 29 , four days before the first day of school .
Aguirre said she fears that the law , which makes it a state crime to transport illegal immigrants , could put her daughter and family members at risk .
" She has a lot of friends who are undocumented , " Aguirre said .
" Am I supposed to ask these kids , ' Who has papers ?
Only kids with papers can get in my car . '
You get criminalized if you have an undocumented person in your vehicle . "
School - resource officers are sworn police officers attached to schools by the local police department .
Their salaries are funded from the School Safety Program , a state program paid for through federal grants .
Statewide , 193 schools in 63 districts receive funding for a total of 183 officers , said Rani Collins , school - safety program administrator at the state Department of Education .
Phoenix Police Department legal advisers are reviewing the most recent language added to the immigration bill and are awaiting guidance this month from a board on state peace - officer standards regarding how to provide immigration training for their officers .
Phoenix Union Superintendent Kent Scribner , who sent a letter home to parents the day Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill into law , said the district will continue to honor U.S. Supreme Court ruling Plyler vs .
Doe , which , among other things , prohibited public schools from enforcing immigration law , requiring proof of citizenship from students or parents , or providing information on a student 's or family 's status to any outside agency , including the Immigration and Naturalization Service , which is now part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
" We will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of our students or staff , " Scribner wrote .
Gabriel Trujillo , principal at Trevor Browne High in west Phoenix , said his school is hosting parent forums to answer questions and ease fears .
The school estimated that 1,000 students from Browne walked out of school to protest and march to the Capitol on April 22 , one day before Brewer signed the bill criminalizing the presence of undocumented immigrants .
The bill also requires police to enforce federal immigration law .
" My kids are known for being politically active , " Trujillo said .
" They write letters to the City Council , to the police .
They do these things on their own .
When I get to campus , my job is not about SB 1070 .
My job is to make sure the campus is secure and the students are educated . "
Amy Kobeta , chair of the Phoenix Union governing board , told the audience that the board cannot take action on items not on the agenda , but the board directed Scribner and board attorney Lynn Adams to look into the non-compliance policy request .
The district of 25,000 students , 78 percent of whom are Hispanic , also has a diversity of academic achievers .
In addition to approving the new contract for the superintendent at the meeting , the board recognized three Gates Millennium Scholars : Josue Macias from Maryvale High and Ronald Gonzalez and Nelson Guillen from Camelback High .
Each year , about 1,000 of the scholarships from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are distributed nationwide .

Astronauts on the shuttle Atlantis 's latest , and probably , last mission to the space station have made their first spacewalk .
Mission specialists Garrett Reisman and Steve Bowen ventured outside the platform to install an antenna and a robot tool tray .
Atlantis arrived at the station on Sunday following a picture perfect launch from Florida on Friday .
The ship 's crew of six are spending the next week at the 350 km - high outpost .
Other key tasks will include the replacement of six large batteries and the addition to the underside of the platform of a Russian docking and storage module .
The berthing on Tuesday of the Rassvet module to the Earth - facing port of the station 's Zarya unit is likely to be the trickiest operation of the entire mission .
Cable niggle
The Atlantis crew were unable to do their usual full post - launch inspection of the orbiter 's external surfaces on Saturday due to a snagged cable that prevented the ship 's robotic arm from picking up a high - resolution laser imager and TV camera .
To compensate for some of the missing data , mission managers instead ordered more pictures than usual to be taken from the space station of the shuttle as it moved in for its docking .
ATLANTIS SHUTTLE BY NUMBERS
First flight : 3 October 1985
Total number of flights : 31
Distance travelled : 186,315,249km
Total number of days in orbit : 282
Total number of orbits : 4,462
Three station crew - members took a total of 398 photographs of Atlantis 's heat - shield as the orbiter performed a back - flip .
The pictures were then sent down to Earth for analysis .
The docking occurred at 1428 GMT , with the hatch opening and the movement of the Atlantis crew through into the International Space Station ( ISS ) taking place a little under two hours later .
" It 's bigger than we remember and , speaking for myself , better than I remember , " shuttle commander Ken " Hock " Ham was heard to say on the radio .
" I love this place . "
Atlantis is undertaking what many expect to be its last mission before retirement .
' Standby ' role
US President Barack Obama has announced a new exploration policy that he says would take humans beyond the International Space Station ( ISS ) , beyond even the Moon , to asteroids and to Mars .
The shuttles , which have been working in space since 1981 , cannot fulfil that role .
Nasa is being asked to pass the business of taxiing astronauts to and from the ISS to private companies and to concentrate its efforts on developing the vehicles that can reach more distant targets .
After it returns from the station , Atlantis will not go straight to a museum .
It will instead be prepared as a standby vessel ready to go to the rescue of the astronauts on November 's flight of the Endeavour orbiter should they get into trouble .
Nasa has not excluded the possibility that it could yet fly out the standby Atlantis to take additional spares and supplies to the space station .
The next shuttle mission - what should be the second to last - will see Discovery deliver a container full of supplies and spares to the ISS .
Nasa is working towards a September lift - off .
I love sharing the color and beauty in the world .

For many lizards , global climate change is a matter of life and death .
After decades of surveying Sceloporus lizard populations in Mexico , an international research team has found that rising temperatures have driven 12 percent of the country 's lizard populations to extinction .
An extinction model based on this discovery also forecasts a grim future for these ecologically important critters , predicting that a full 20 percent of all lizard species could be extinct by the year 2080 .
The detailed surveys of lizard populations in Mexico , collected from 200 different sites , indicate that the temperatures in those regions have changed too rapidly for the lizards to keep pace .
It seems that all types of lizards are far more susceptible to climate - warming extinction than previously thought because many species are already living right at the edge of their thermal limits , especially at low elevation and low latitude range limits .
Although the researchers ' prediction for 2080 could change if humans are able to slow global climate warming , it does appear that lizards have crossed a threshold for extinctions -- and that their sharp decline will continue for decades at least .
Barry Sinervo from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California in Santa Cruz , along with colleagues from across the globe , reached these conclusions after comparing their field studies of the lizards in Mexico with extensive data from around the world .
Their research will be published in the May 14 issue of Science , the peer - reviewed journal published by AAAS , the nonprofit science society .
After compiling the global field data , Sinervo and his colleagues studied the effects of rising temperatures on lizards ' bodies , and created a model of extinction risks for various lizard species around the world .
Their model accurately predicted specific locations on five continents where populations of lizards have recently gone extinct , and it might inform researchers on how these patterns of extinction will continue in the future .
" How quickly can Earth 's lizards adapt to the rising global temperatures ?
That 's the important question , " Sinervo said .
" We are actually seeing lowland species moving upward in elevation , slowly driving upland species extinct , and if the upland species can't evolve fast enough then they 're going to continue to go extinct . "
According to the researchers ' global model , which is derived from today 's trends of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities , about six percent of lizard species are due for extinction by the year 2050 .
Since carbon dioxide hangs around in the atmosphere for decades , the researchers say that this statistic can no longer be avoided .
However , they do say that concentrated global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could possibly avert the 2080 scenarios , in which 20 percent of lizard species are expected to disappear from the planet .

The detailed study notes specifically that lizards that bear live young are particularly at risk of extinction , compared to those that lay eggs .
" Live - bearers experience almost twice the risk of egg - layers largely because live - bearers have evolved lower body temperatures that heighten extinction risk , " Sinervo said .
" We are literally watching these species disappear before our eyes . "
Sinervo began focusing his attention on lizard extinctions after he noticed an obvious trend during his field work in France .
He identified an unsettling pattern of lizard extinctions with French researchers , Jean Clobert and Benoit Heulin , while they were surveying some of their well - documented populations .
Disturbed by their findings , they contacted colleagues around the world -- Jack Sites and Donald Miles in the United States , Fausto Méndez - de - la - Cruz in Mexico , and Carlos Frederico Duarte Rocha in Brazil -- and a global collaboration ensued .
" This work is a fine example of interdisciplinary science and international collaboration , using methods and data from a range of scientific disciplines to improve confidence in the prediction of the biological effects of contemporary climate change , and in particular showing how long - term records and research are so crucial to the understanding of ecological change , " said Andrew Sugden , the International Managing Editor of Science .
" We would never have been able to do this without certain free , online tools like Google Scholar and Google Earth , " Sinervo said .
" It took us awhile to pinpoint the appropriate search terms .
But once we did , we locked onto key published studies .
I was surprised at how fast researchers began sending us data …
That 's what happens though :
When scientists see a problem , with global evidence backing it , they come together . "
In order to fine - tune their model with this surprising global outpouring of data , Sinervo and his colleagues used a small electronic device that mimics the body temperature of a lizard basking in the sun .
They placed these thermal models in sun-drenched areas for four months at sites in Mexico where lizard populations were still thriving -- and at sites where they have already gone extinct .
advertisement
" There are periods of the day when lizards can't be out , and essentially have to retreat to cooler places , " Sinervo said .
" When they 're not out and about , lizards are n't foraging for food .
So we assessed how many hours of the day lizards would have been driven out of the sun at these different locations .
Then , we were able to parameterize our global model . "
For the authors , who claim a deep appreciation for these lizards and the important role the reptiles play in the global food chain , these findings are both " devastating and heart - wrenching . "
But , they say , hope does remain for the world 's lizards .
" If the governments of the world can implement a concerted change to limit our carbon dioxide emissions , then we could bend the curve and hold levels of extinction to the 2050 scenarios , " Sinervo concluded .
" But it has to be a global push …
I do n't want to tell my child that we once had a chance to save these lizards , but we did n't .
I want to do my best to save them while I can . "

I was actually looking for an RPG ( dunno why it 's tagged so in NewGrounds ) , but this was enjoyable nonetheless :)
Aiming and shooting was a bit annoying , especially when monsters wereon a lower level and the only way to hit them was get too close ... ( or jump on their heads , as I realized at some point ) .
Still , for a week 's work , a game including multiple weapons , several enemies + boss , secret areas etc is quite an achievement .
Serious foodies know there 's so much more about food than just eating .
Food plays a part in culture , history , and even revolutions .
These 20 lectures will have you on the edge of your seat and ready for another serving .
By examining 52 paintings of Jesus ' Last Supper , scholars have determined that " portion distortion " — the modern phenomenon of ever - expanding serving size — has been going on for at least a thousand years .
Cornell University obesity expert Brian Wansink and his brother Craig Wansink , a Biblical scholar , found that the main course at the iconic meal grew 69 percent larger in the period from 1000 to 2000 A.D..
( Watch Rachel Maddow 's take on the Last Supper . )
Here , five ideas of what the artistic " super- sizing " of the Last Supper could mean :
1 . It explains why we 're getting fatter
This 1,000 - year - long trend has clearly " changed our perception " of what constitutes a " normal " portion , says Weight Concern dietician Charlene Shoneye , quoted in BBC News .
Larger servings have been shown to feed obesity — as proven by our massive 21st century waistlines .
2. Portion size is n't our only problem
Meals may have been getting bigger for the past 1,000 years , but Americans and other Westerners only " started becoming noticeably fatter in the 1980s , " says Jacob Sullum in Reason .
So if this study shows anything , it 's that our ballooning portion sizes are n't the sole cause of our " obesity epidemic . "
3 . There 's just more food in the world now
" Art imitates life , " says Brian Wansink , quoted in NPR .
" The last thousand years have witnessed dramatic increases in the production , availability , safety , abundance , and affordability of food , " and so it 's natural that " these changes have been reflected in paintings of history 's most famous dinner . "
4 . We 've all become foodies
Maybe " people just became more interested in food " in recent centuries , says Craig Wansink , quoted in BBC News .
Certainly there 's " no religious reason why the meals got bigger . "
Case in point : Leonardo da Vinci's 1498 Last Supper party " was more lavishly fed " than older versions that portrayed the first Christians as ascetics .
And a hundred years later , Tintoretto " piled the food on the apostles ' plates still higher . "
5. Jesus did n't eat McNuggets
Sure , portion size is important — but look what Jesus ate , says Susan Albers in Psychology Today .
Fish , bread , and wine .
If scholars look back at images of our family parties 200 years from now , they 'll not only see huge portions but also " mindless " piles of artificial and " highly addictive " junk food that Jesus would n't have touched .
Sony 's move to disable Linux on the PlayStation 3 is being met by a proposed class - action lawsuit accusing the company of unjustly enriching itself at the expense of its customers .
Citing " security concerns , " Sony announced in March it was no longer supporting the so - called " Other OS " feature on the game console .
This , after the company had repeatedly promoted the $ 500 device as one to " play games , watch movies , view photos , listen to music and run a full - featured Linux operating system that transforms your PS3 into a home computer , " according to a lawsuit ,
The PlayStation 3 had emerged as a favorite among researchers looking to create homebrew supercomputers on the cheap .
When clustered , the PS3's Cell processor – developed by Sony , IBM and Toshiba – can rival the power of a supercomputer , researchers say .
The suit , filed in San Francisco federal court Tuesday , seeks class action status .
" Sony has been unjustly enriched at the expense of plaintiff and the class ( .pdf ) and is required , in equity and good conscience , to compensate plaintiff and the class for harm suffered as a result of its actions , " according to the filing .
The suit was brought on behalf of a California man who paid $ 500 for his PS3 in July 2007 , and chose to pay the hefty price because of the Linux feature , the suit says .
But on March 28 , the company announced software updates would not longer support that .
To retain the feature , however , consoles could not be updated .
Failing to update means PS3 players lose the ability to sign into the online PlayStation network , chat or play Blu-ray discs , according to the suit .
Sony declined comment .

We propose a link between logical independence and quantum physics .

Whenever a mathematical proposition is logically independent of the axioms encoded in the measured state , the measurement associated with the proposition gives random outcomes .
This allows for an experimental test of logical independence .
Conversely , it also allows for an explanation of the probabilities of random outcomes observed in Pauli group measurements from logical independence without invoking quantum theory .

Wider implications .
While we have studied only quantum mechanics , our reasoning applies to any theory of systems with limited information content in which physical states can encode mathematical propositions and measurements can be identified with questions about their truth values .
Whenever the information required to assign the truth values of the propositions which are tested on the system exceeds its information content , measurement outcomes are inevitably random .
Main results .
We show that quantum states from a certain class encode mathematical axioms and that corresponding measurements test the truth - values of mathematical propositions .
Quantum mechanics imposes an upper limit on how much information can be carried by a quantum state ( ' N qubits carry N bits of information ' ) , thus limiting the information content of the set of axioms .
We show that whenever a mathematical proposition is logically independent of the axioms encoded in the state , the measurement associated to the proposition gives random outcomes .
Whenever the proposition is logically dependent on the axioms , the measurement outcome is definite .
This shines new light on the nature of quantum randomness without invoking the quantum formalism itself .
GENERAL SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY
Introduction and background .
Quantum theory makes only probabilistic statements about individual measurement outcomes .
In general , the outcomes have an element of randomness , the roots of which are still not fully understood .
We propose a link between quantum randomness and logical independence .
A proposition is logically independent from a set of axioms if it can neither be proved nor disproved from the axioms .
A logically independent proposition represents entirely new information , which is not contained in the axioms .
As opposed to the case of classical statistical physics , the theorems by Kochen and Specker [ 1 ] and Bell [ 2 ] opened up the possibility of viewing probabilities in quantum physics as irreducible and not as stemming from our ignorance about some ( non-contextual or local ) predeterminated properties .
Adopting this view , one can ask if there is any reason why such irreducible probabilities should have different values at all .
Here we show that — at least in a certain subset of measurements ( Pauli group measurements ) — quantum probabilities can be seen as following from logical independence of mathematical propositions that are associated with the measurements without invoking quantum theory itself .
Any formal system is based on axioms , which are propositions that are defined to be true .
Whenever a proposition and a given set of axioms together contain more information than the axioms themselves , the proposition can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms — it is logically independent ( or mathematically undecidable [ 3 , 4 ] ) .
If a proposition is independent of the axioms , neither the proposition itself nor its negation creates an inconsistency together with the axiomatic system .
We demonstrate that the states of quantum systems are capable of encoding mathematical axioms .
Quantum mechanics imposes an upper limit on how much information can be encoded in a quantum state [ 5 , 6 ] , thus limiting the information content of the set of axioms .
We show that quantum measurements are capable of revealing whether a given proposition is independent or not of the set of axioms .
Whenever a mathematical proposition is independent of the axioms encoded in the state , the measurement associated with the proposition gives random outcomes .
This allows for an experimental test of logical independence by realizing in the laboratory both the actual quantum states and the required quantum measurements .
Our axiomatic systems can be completed and are therefore not subject to Gödel 's incompleteness theorem [ 7 , 8 ] .
Intuitively , independent propositions contain entirely new information that cannot be reduced to the information in the axioms .
This point of view is related to Chaitin 's information - theoretical formulation of logical independence [ 3 , 4 ] .
Given a set of axioms that contains a certain amount of information , it is impossible to deduce the truth value of a proposition , which , together with the axioms , contains more information than the set of axioms itself .
To give an example , consider Boolean functions of a single binary argument :
There are four such functions , y k ( k=0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , shown in figure 1 .
We shall discuss the following ( binary ) propositions about their properties :
These two propositions are logically independent .
Knowing the truth value of one of them does not allow one to infer the truth value of the other .
Ascribing truth values to both propositions requires two bits of information .
If one postulates only proposition ( A ) to be true , i.e. if one chooses ( A ) as an ' axiom ' , then it is impossible to prove proposition ( B ) from ( A ) .
Having only axiom ( A ) , i.e. only this one bit of information , there is not enough information to also know the truth value of ( B ) .
Hence , proposition ( B ) is logically independent from the system containing the single axiom ( A ) .
Another example of an independent proposition within the same axiomatic system is :
Again , this statement can be neither proved nor disproved from axiom ( A ) alone because ( C ) is independent of ( A ) as it involves f ( 1 ) .
Figure 1 . The four Boolean functions y=f(x ) of a binary argument , i.e. f( x ) =0 , 1 with x=0 , 1 .
The different functions are labeled by y k with k=0 , 1 , 2 , 3 .

We refer to such independent propositions to which one cannot simultaneously ascribe definite truth values — given a limited amount of information resources — as logically complementary propositions .
Knowing the truth value of one of them precludes any knowledge about the others .
Given the limitation of one bit of information encoded in the axiom , all three propositions ( A ) –( C ) are logically complementary to each other .
When the information content of the axioms and the number of independent propositions increase , more possibilities arise .
Already the case of two bits as the information content is instructive .
Consider two independent Boolean functions f 1 ( x ) and f 2 ( x ) of a binary argument .
The two bits may be used to define properties of the individual functions or they may define joint features of the functions .
An example of the first type is the following two - bit proposition :
An example of the second type is :
Both ( D ) and ( E ) consist of two elementary ( binary ) propositions .
Their truth values are of the form of vectors with two components being the truth values of their elementary propositions .
Propositions ( D ) and ( E ) are logically complementary .
Given ( E ) as a two - bit axiom , all the individual function values remain undefined and thus one can determine neither of the two truth values of elementary propositions in ( D ) .
A qualitatively new aspect of multi-bit axioms is the existence of ' partially ' independent propositions , i.e. propositions that contain more than one elementary proposition , of which only some are independent .
An example of such a partially independent proposition within the system consisting of the two - bit axiom ( D ) is :
The first elementary proposition is the same as in ( D ) and thus it is definitely true .
The impossibility of deciding the second elementary proposition leads to partial independence of proposition ( F ) .
In a similar way , proposition ( F ) is partially independent of the axiomatic system of ( E ) .
The discussion so far was purely mathematical .
We have described finite axiomatic systems ( of limited information content ) using properties of Boolean functions .
Now we show that the independence of mathematical propositions can be tested in quantum experiments .
To this end we introduce a physical ' black box ' whose internal configuration encodes Boolean functions .
The black box hence forms a bridge between mathematics and physics .
Quantum systems enter it and the properties of the functions , i.e. the truth values of propositions , are written onto the quantum states of the systems .
Finally , measurements performed on the systems extract information about the properties of the configuration of the black box and thus about the properties of the functions .
We begin with the simplest case of a qubit ( e.g. a spin- particle or the polarization of a photon ) entering the black box in a well - defined state and a single bit - to - bit function f( x ) encoded in the black box .
Inside the black box two subsequent operations alter the state of the input qubit .
The first operation encodes the value of f( 1 ) via application of , i.e. the Pauli z-operator taken to the power of f ( 1 ) .
The second operation encodes f( 0 ) with , i.e. the Pauli x-operator taken to the power of f( 0 ) .
The total action of the black box is
Consider the input qubit to be in one of the eigenstates of the Pauli operator ( with i the imaginary unit ) .
The three particular choices ( m , n ) = ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) or ( 1 , 1 ) correspond to the three Pauli operators along orthogonal directions ( in the Bloch sphere ) , or , respectively .
The measurements of these operators are quantum complementary .
Given a system in an eigenstate of one of them , the results of the other measurements are totally random .
The input density matrix reads
with λ mn =±1 and the identity operator .
It evolves under the action of the black box to
Depending on the value of n f( 0 ) + m f ( 1 ) ( throughout the paper all sums are taken modulo 2 ) , the state after the black box is either the same or orthogonal to the initial one .
If one now performs a measurement in the basis of the initial state ( i.e. the eigenbasis of the operator ) , the outcome reveals the value of n f( 0 ) + m f ( 1 ) and hence the measurement can be considered as checking the truth value of the proposition
It is crucial to note that each of the three quantum complementary measurements , or — given the suitable initial state — reveals the truth value of one of the independent propositions ( A ) , ( B ) or ( C ) , respectively .
Independent of the initial state , we now identify the quantum measurement ( m , n ) with the question about the truth value of the corresponding mathematical proposition ( G ) .
Those states that give a definite ( i.e. not random ) outcome in the quantum measurement encode ( G ) or its negation as an axiom .
For example , the two eigenstates of after the black box encode ( A ) or its negation as an axiom , and the measurement reveals the truth value of proposition ( A ) .
This one bit is the maximal amount of information that can be encoded in a qubit [ 5 , 6 ] .
When a physical system prepared in an eigenstate of a Pauli operator is measured along complementary directions , the measurement outcomes are random .
Correspondingly , the proposition identified with a complementary observable is independent from the one - bit axiom encoded in the measured state .
For example , the measurement of on an eigenstate of gives random outcomes , and accordingly proposition ( B ) is independent of the one - bit axiom ( A ) .
This links logical independence and quantum randomness in complementary measurements .
We propose that it is therefore possible to experimentally find out whether a proposition is logically independent or not , as summarized in figure 2 .

In a single experimental run it is impossible to infer whether the outcome is definite or random and thus whether it stemmed from a dependent or independent proposition .
Therefore , any quantum experiment revealing logical independence requires many repetitions .
( It can be shown that — given a certain level of noise — the probability to infer wrongly whether the proposition is dependent or not decays exponentially with the length of the outcome string . )
Generalizing the above reasoning to multiple qubits , we show in the following that whenever the proposition identified with a Pauli group measurement is dependent ( on the axioms encoded into the qubits ) , the measurement outcome is definite , and whenever it is independent , the measurement outcome is random .
Consider N black boxes , one for each qubit .
They encode N Boolean functions f j ( x ) numbered by j=1 , ... , N by applying the operation
The initial N - qubit state is chosen to be a particular one of the 2N eigenstates of certain Nindependent and mutually commuting tensor products of Pauli operators , numbered by p=1 , ... , N :
with m j ( p ) , n j ( p ) {0 , 1} .
A broad family of such states is the family of stabilizer [ 10 , 11 ] and graph states [ 12 ] .
( Note that not all states can be described within this framework . )
As before , each qubit propagates through its black box .
After leaving them , the qubits ' state encodes the truth values of the following N independent binary propositions ( negating the false propositions , one has N true ones , which serve as axioms ) :
In suitable measurements quantum mechanics provides a way of testing whether certain propositions are dependent or not .
If one measures the operator of the Pauli group [ 11 ]
with α j , β j {0 , 1} , one tests whether the proposition
is dependent or not .
The proposition ( J ) can be represented as the 2N - dimensional proposition vector with binary entries .
Therefore , there are 4N different ( J ) s .
For all dependent propositions , the vectors are linear combinations of the vectors representing the axioms , i.e. .
Since α j , β j are binary , the coefficients must also be binary : k p {0 , 1} .
This gives 2N dependent propositions ( J ) .
The corresponding operators can be written as the products .
In this case commutes with all the s , and the quantum mechanical formalism implies that the measurement of has a definite outcome .
The measurements of all the remaining 4N − 2N=2N ( 2N−1 ) operators give random outcomes , and the corresponding propositions ( J ) are independent .
Note that there are many more independent propositions of the form ( J ) than dependent ones .
The ratio between their numbers increases exponentially with the number of qubits , i.e. .
In logic , one can always complete the axiomatic system by adding new axioms to the set of ( H p ) such that any proposition ( J ) becomes dependent .
However , this would require the axioms to be encoded in more than N qubits .
Having only N qubits , projecting these qubits into new quantum states , and propagating them through their black boxes , new propositions can become axioms but only if some or all previous axioms become independent propositions .
This is a consequence of the limited information content of the quantum system .
We have proved that a proposition of type ( J ) is dependent on the axiomatic system ( H p ) if and only if the corresponding measurement from the Pauli group is commuting with all .
Note that one does not need to first prove the ( in ) dependence of a proposition by logic before one is able to identify the experiment to test it .
For a given set of ( H p ) , defining an N - bit axiom , one must prepare a joint eigenstate of N commuting operators .
In order to test the logical ( in ) dependence of a new proposition ( J ) , one needs to measure the operator that corresponds to ( J ) in this state .
The procedures of preparation and measurement can be performed without knowing whether ( J ) is logically independent of the set of ( H p ) .
The measurement is highly degenerate because it tests the logical ( in ) dependence of the binary proposition ( J ) of the axioms .
Less degenerate measurements are possible , which simultaneously test the logical ( in ) dependence of several elementary propositions of the form ( J ) .
Such multi- bit propositions contain many elementary propositions .
If not all of them are independent of the axioms , this gives rise to partial independence .
This provides an explanation for different values of outcome probabilities in Pauli group measurements , which is based on logic without invoking quantum theory .
A measurement corresponding to any single independent elementary proposition ( with two possible measurement outcomes ) gives uniformly random results .
In a measurement whose outcomes reveal the independence of m independent elementary propositions ( with 2 m possible measurement outcomes ) , these outcomes occur with probabilities .
( The results revealing dependence of elementary propositions are always definite . )
To illustrate the idea of multi-bit propositions and partial independence , consider proposition ( E ) described above .
Its elementary propositions correspond to the set of independent commuting operators and .
The common eigenbasis of these operators is spanned by the maximally entangled Bell states ( basis b E ) : , , where , e.g. |z± 1 denotes the eigenstate with the eigenvalue ±1 of for the first qubit .
Thus , after the black boxes the four Bell states encode the four possible truth values of the elementary propositions in ( E ) , and a so - called Bell State Analyzer [ 13 ] ( i.e. an apparatus that measures in the Bell basis ) reveals these values .
In the same way , the truth values of the elementary propositions in ( F ) are encoded in the eigenstates of local bases , i.e. by the four states |z± 1 |z± 2 ( basis b F ) .
Finally , the elementary propositions in ( D ) are linked with the four product states |z± 1 |x± 2 ( basis b D ) .
In general , if all the axioms involve joint properties of Boolean functions the multi-partite state encoding these axioms must be entangled .
Measurements in the Bell basis , b E , prove that the entangled state indeed encodes joint properties of the two functions , i.e. information about ( E ) .
Measurements in other bases can then be interpreted in terms of ' partial ' and ' full ' independence .
Proposition ( D ) is fully independent given ( E ) as an axiom , and the four possible measurement results are completely random with probabilities of .
On the other hand , proposition ( F ) is partially independent , which is disclosed by the fact that two ( out of four ) outcomes never occur , while the two remaining occur randomly , i.e. each with probability .
When the outcome of a quantum measurement is definite , it need not possess an a priori relation to the actual truth value of a dependent proposition as imposed by classical logic .
This can be demonstrated for three qubits initially in the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger ( GHZ ) state [ 14 ] :
We choose as axioms the propositions
linked with the operators , and , respectively .
One can logically derive from ( K 1 ) to ( K 3 ) the true proposition
On the other hand , proposition ( L ) is identified with the measurement of , but the result imposed by quantum mechanics corresponds to the negation of ( L ) , namely 'f 1 ( 1 ) + f 2 ( 1 ) + f 3 ( 1) =0 . '
This is the heart of the GHZ argument [ 14 ] – [ 16 ] .
In the ( standard logical ) derivation of ( L ) , the individual function values are well defined and are the same , independently of the axiom ( K i ) in which they appear .
Since this is equivalent to the assumption of non-contextuality [ 1 , 17 ] , the truth values of dependent propositions found in quantum experiments do not necessarily have to be the same as the ones derived by classical logic .
Nonetheless , there is a one - to - one correspondence between definiteness ( or randomness ) of the measurement outcomes and the associated propositions being dependent ( or independent ) within the axiomatic set .
As shown above , this correspondence is independent of the rules used to infer the specific truth values of the propositions ( e.g. classical logic or quantum theory ) .
One might raise the question as to whether a classical device can be constructed to reveal the independence of propositions .
All operations in the experimental test belong to the Clifford group subset of quantum gates and therefore can be efficiently simulated classically [ 11 , 18 , 19 ] .
A classical device is possible , given sufficient resources : N classical bits are required to propagate through the black box in order to specify the N - bit axiomatic set and additional bits are required to model randomness in measurements corresponding to independent propositions .
( Specifically , 2N classical bits propagating through the black box are known to be sufficient to specify definite outcomes in the measurements corresponding to the axioms and random outcomes in the measurements of fully independent propositions [ 20 , 21 ] . )
Such a device can give the truth values of dependent propositions according to classical logic .
On the level of elementary physical systems , however , the world is known to be quantum .
It is intriguing that nature supplies us with physical systems that can reveal logical dependence but cannot be used to learn the classical truth values .
Finally , a historic point deserves comment .
The inference that classical logic cannot capture the structure of quantum mechanics was made by Birkhoff and von Neumann [ 22 ] and started the field of quantum logic .
Our link between mathematics / logic and certain elements of quantum physics is related to , but yet distinct from , their approach .
Quantum logic was invented to provide an understanding of quantum physics in terms of a set of non-classical logical rules for propositions that are identified with projective quantum measurements .
However , ' one requires the entire theoretical machinery of quantum mechanics to justify quantum logic ' [ 23 ] .
Our approach aims at providing a justification for quantum randomness starting from an operational representation of purely mathematical propositions and systems with limited information content .
The no -go theorems of Bell [ 2 ] and Kochen and Specker [ 1 ] prove that quantum randomness cannot be understood as stemming from the ignorance of a hidden variable substructure without coming into conflict with local realism and non-contextuality .
This suggests that quantum randomness might be of irreducible ( objective ) nature [ 24 , 25 ] and a consequence of fundamentally limited information content of physical systems , namely N bits in N qubits [ 6 ] .
If one adopts this view , the present work explains which experiments will have irreducibly random outcomes , namely those that correspond to logically independent propositions .
After leaving the black boxes , the N qubits ' quantum states encode exactly N bits of information about Boolean functions , i.e. the systems encode an N - bit axiom , and the other logically complementary propositions are independent of this axiom .
If there exists no underlying ( hidden variable ) structure , no information is left for specifying their truth values .
However , the qubits can be measured in the bases corresponding to independent propositions , and — as in any measurement — will inevitably give outcomes , e.g. ' clicks ' in detectors .
These clicks must not contain any information whatsoever about the truth value of the independent proposition .
Therefore , the individual quantum outcomes must be random , reconciling logical independence with the fact that a quantum system always gives an ' answer ' when ' asked ' in an experiment .
This provides an intuitive understanding of quantum randomness , a key quantum feature , using mathematical reasoning .
Moreover , the same argument implies that randomness necessarily occurs in any physical theory of systems with limited information content in which measurements are operationally identified with asking questions about independent propositions [ 26 ] .
In conclusion , we have demonstrated that the dependence or independence of certain mathematical propositions in a finite axiomatic set can be tested by performing corresponding Pauli group measurements .
( It would be interesting to investigate the possiblity of extending our results beyond this class of measurements . )
This is achieved via an isomorphism between axioms and quantum states as well as between propositions and quantum measurements .
Dependence ( independence ) is revealed by definite ( random ) outcomes .
Having this isomorphism , logical independence need not be proved by logic but can be inferred from experimental results .
From the foundational point of view , this sheds new light on the ( mathematical ) origin of quantum randomness in these measurements .
Under the assumption that the information content of N elementary physical systems ( i.e. qubits ) is fundamentally restricted to N bits such that no underlying ( hidden variable ) structure exists , measurement outcomes corresponding to logically independent propositions must be irreducibly random .
The results of a recent experimental demonstration of the concepts introduced in this paper can be found in the e-print [ 27 ] .

eBay , Facebook , Yahoo , and Ask.com owner IAC / Interactive may compete with Google for users , views and ad clicks , but the four know which side their bread is buttered on when it comes to digital copyright law .
That 's why they 've rushed to Google 's side this week to defend their rival in a massive copyright infringement lawsuit launched by Viacom .
Viacom 's interpretation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) " would slow development of the Internet by making the hosting of user generated content an activity fraught with legal peril , " eBay et al warned the court hearing the case in an amici brief .
" The threat of ruinous liability would mean that other companies and services might never get off the ground in the first place . "
And that , in turn , would " retard the development of the Internet and electronic commerce and inhibit the growth and development of user - centric online models that , day after day , make the Internet and the world more democratic . "
Blatant disregard
So now the future of global democracy is tied up in this case — plus a billion bucks .
That 's the sum for which Viacom is suing Google as it charges the search engine giant with " blatant disregard for the intellectual property laws " contained in the DMCA .
The media company has found 150,000 Viacom content clips on Google 's YouTube service , it says , and they just keep popping up despite repeated takedown notices .
Plus YouTube has an extortionist 's history of refusing to implement filtering technologies , Viacom insists , unless content companies sign licensing agreements favorable to Google .
Nonsense , Google lawyers respond , " For years , Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube , even while publicly complaining about its presence there , " they charge .
" It hired no fewer than 18 different marketing agencies to upload its content to the site .
It deliberately ' roughed up ' the videos to make them look stolen or leaked .
It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses . "
Discourse between the litigants has gotten pretty nasty of late , with public document dumps that one side or the other says are taken massively out of context , and , recently , internal e-mails that win the Ars Technica Corporate Potty Talk prize , hands down .
Multiplications
But various public interest groups and Web companies are nervously watching this case , fearful that the United States Southern District Court of New York could side with Viacom 's contention that the DMCA and its " safe harbor " provisions offer Google few protections .
This , in turn , could expose a host of sites to " statutory damages — multiplied by thousands of works " demanded by media companies in lawsuits , say eBay and others .
eBay and the gang are particularly worried about arguments suggesting that when a service provider sets up an automated process to make content uploadable to a site , the offering of those tools excludes the site from any protections under the DMCA .
Viacom contends that YouTube 's activities go way beyond " storage " — thus exempting it from the safe harbor law .
These companies disagree .
Congress clearly intended the DMCA to cover sites that do more than simply store data — " Internet access , e-mail , chat room and Web page hosting services " were mentioned at one Senate hearing discussing the legislation , they note .
These Google defenders also want the court to interpret the DMCA 's " red flag " awareness provisions as narrowly as possible .
Section 512 ( c ) of the law stipulates that it does n't protect service providers who have " actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing " or are " aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent . "
There 's huge back - and - forth between Google and Viacom over whether the former had this sort of red flag knowledge or not .
But the eBay and Facebook crowd contend that , whatever the situation actually was at YouTube , Congress targeted these red flag provisions at " sophisticated ' pirate ' directories — which refer Internet users to other selected Internet sites where pirate software , books , movies , and music can be downloaded or transmitted . "
Lawmakers wanted the DMCA 's " knowledge disqualifiers " to apply " only in the most extreme of situations , " they write .
" Mere generalized awareness of infringement on a site is not enough . "
That was then
And if keeping track of infringement was tough in 1998 when Congress passed the DMCA , consider the challenge now , the amici brief notes :
If service providers lacked the practical ability to determine which of their users ' materials were infringing in 1998 , that is all the more true for amici and other service providers today .
More than half of Facebook 's 400 million users log in on any given day , and the average user creates 70 pieces of content every month .
At any given moment , there are more than 200 million listings available for sale on eBay .
IAC - owned Vimeo hosts over 10 million videos at any given time and receives an average of 15,000 new video uploads per day .
The " widespread use of amici 's services , as well as those of other service providers , is the foundation of the democratizing virtues of the Internet , " they add .
If Viacom 's arguments prevail , service providers would be exposed to lawsuits , " even where they lack particularized knowledge regarding what material is infringing and should be removed . "
Financial benefits
The eBay filing also takes on what is perhaps the most dicey question in this case , whether Google received " a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity , in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity . "
Under those circumstances , DMCA safe harbor protections disappear .
But Google 's allies contend that Congress never intended this " financial benefit " language for companies that engage in legit activities and marketing practices .
In support of that position , they extract this prose from a Congressional hearing :
" In general , a service provider conducting a legitimate business would not be considered to receive a ' financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity ' where the infringer makes the same kind of payment as non-infringing users of the provider 's service .
Thus , receiving a one - time set - up fee and flat periodic payments for service from a person engaging in infringing activities would not constitute receiving a ' financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity ' . "
No predictions from us as to what the Southern District Court will make of this logic .
Viacom 's reaction was easier to obtain :
" The courts have been clear that creating and building a Web - based business on the intellectual property of others is illegal , " a Viacom spokesperson told us .
" That is exactly what YouTube did in its formative years .
Nothing in this case threatens the principles of the DMCA or the ability of legitimate Internet - based businesses to flourish .
At its core , the DMCA seeks to protect both the work of content creators and lawful online businesses for the benefit of all consumers . "
In 2003 , several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel .
In response , he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen .
The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel .
Luntz found that they mostly did n’t .
“ Six times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel , ” he reported .
“ Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted .
Six times these Jewish youth used the word ‘ they ’ rather than ‘ us ’ to describe the situation . ”
That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising .
In recent years , several studies have revealed , in the words of Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at Davis , that “ non-Orthodox younger Jews , on the whole , feel much less attached to Israel than their elders , ” with many professing “ a near - total absence of positive feelings . ”
In 2008 , the student senate at Brandeis , the only nonsectarian Jewish - sponsored university in America , rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state .
Luntz ’s task was to figure out what had gone wrong .
When he probed the students ’ views of Israel , he hit up against some firm beliefs .
First , “ they reserve the right to question the Israeli position . ”
These young Jews , Luntz explained , “ resist anything they see as ‘ group think . ' ”
They want an “ open and frank ” discussion of Israel and its flaws .
Second , “ young Jews desperately want peace . ”
When Luntz showed them a series of ads , one of the most popular was entitled “ Proof that Israel Wants Peace , ” and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land .
Third , “ some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians . ”
When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful , several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair , citing their own Muslim friends .
Most of the students , in other words , were liberals , broadly defined .
They had imbibed some of the defining values of American Jewish political culture : a belief in open debate , a skepticism about military force , a commitment to human rights .
And in their innocence , they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel .
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and capable of peace , and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs .
Luntz did not grasp the irony .
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment has been working against for most of their lives .
Among American Jews today , there are a great many Zionists , especially in the Orthodox world , people deeply devoted to the State of …
David Blunkett this morning claimed he may sue the government for a refund on his £ 30 ID card , which new laws will render worthless by the end of summer .
The former Home Secretary and political originator of the ID cards scheme went on Today this morning to explain why he was right to introduce the scheme and the ConDem coalition is wrong to scrap it .
Blunkett 's cheerleading for ID cards led to the Labour government spending £ 257 m on the scheme for nothing .
He criticised the new government for scrapping the scheme , warning " it wo n't change anything for anyone out there " .
Blunkett also pointed to the relatively small saving - £ 86 m over four years - that will be made .
However , he appears most annoyed about his personal loss of thirty quid .
" I 've got a card , it 's very useful , " Blunkett said .
" I 've used it already in travel in Europe .
I do n't believe anybody 's surveilled anything that they did n't already know about me . "
He continued : " Unfortunately nobody 's going to get their money back - I 'm thinking of suing them but it might cost me more than £ 30 . "
Blunkett may have been joking , having developed something related to a sense of humour in the last few years on the Labour backbenches .
He was serious and defiant however when challenged on his statements as Home Secretary that ID cards would prevent terrorism .
He insisted the main purpose of the scheme had always been to control access to public services .
" I wanted an ' entitlement card ' , " he said .
Nevertheless , he rejected the position now taken by Alan Johnson , the final Labour Home Secretary , that claims that ID cards were a counter - terrorism measure were a mistake .
Instead he offered a more nuanced version of history .
" It was a mistake to allow the debate to get to the point where people thought that was the prime objective , " Blunkett said .
Demonstrating impressive predictive powers , early in the interview , while reminiscing about the ID cards debate , he had noted , " exaggeration , hyperbole and self - deception are the hallmarks of all of us at one time in politics " . ®
Bootnote
On the question of Blunkett 's missing thirty quid , we at El Reg would respectfully suggest the many , many thousands of pounds he has made as an advisor to ID card vendors since leaving the Home Office ought to be compensation enough .

WASHINGTON–Key senators were close to a deal on legislation to overhaul financial regulations , people familiar with the matter said , bringing the U.S. a step closer to sweeping changes to the way banks interact with consumers and the markets alike .
Top senators from each party were near a breakthrough agreement to create a new consumer - protection division within the Federal Reserve .
This has been a contentious point due to heavy criticism of the Fed 's past handling of its consumer - protection powers .

May 4 is the 124th day of the year ( 125th in leap years ) .
There are 241 days remaining .
May 4 is often known as " Star Wars Day " .
It is jokingly said : " May the 4th be with you " , in reference to the popular phrase in Star Wars : " May the Force be with you . "
The phrase dates back to at least 1979 , on the day Margaret Thatcher was elected Britain 's first woman prime minister .
Her party took out a newspaper ad in the London Evening News that said " May the Fourth be with you , Maggie . Congratulations . " [ 1 ]
On May 2nd , 2019 , the state of California 's legislature voted and officially declared May 4th as " Star Wars Day " in recognition of Star Wars : Galaxy 's Edge opening later in the month of May . [ 2 ]

The former president had some tough words for real progressives :
Using unusually vivid language to describe the threat against Sen.
Blanche Lincoln , Clinton urged the voters who nurtured his career to resist outside forces bent on making an example out of the two - term Democratic incumbent .
He pounded the podium with Lincoln at his side , warning that national liberal and labor groups wanted to make her a “ poster child ” in the June 8 Senate run-off to send a message about what happens to Democrats who do n’t toe the party line .
“ This is about using you and manipulating your votes to terrify members of Congress and members of the Senate , ” Clinton said in the gym of a small historically black college here .
Clinton did n’t mention Lt. Gov. Bill Halter ’s name – the lieutenant governor worked in the former president ’s administration – or single out any specific liberal groups .
But he did n’t need to .
Too bad for Bill , and Lincoln , no one gives a shit about them anymore :
From the Politico report :
“ If you want to be used that way , have at it , ’ he said to about 200 Democrats at Philander Smith College , speaking without notes for 20 minutes
Philander Smith College is a historical black university .
How many African American students do you see in those pictures ?
That 's also the basketball gym .
It fits more than 200 people .
Lots more .
Notice how they used partitions to shrink the size of the room significantly .
( The Tolbert Report , a conservative blog , tweeted that the facility held 800 , for whatever it 's worth . )
And finally , see all those baby blue shirts ?
Those are Lincoln campaign staffers .
People at the event guesstimated that between 15 - 25 percent of the attendees were campaign workers .
So to reiterate , few in Arkansas gives a shit about Blanche Lincoln anymore .
Nor , apparently , about Bill Clinton .

A Jesuit investigation has cited 205 allegations of sexual abuse against priests at its schools in Germany , revealing decades of systematic abuse and attempts of a cover - up by the prestigious Roman Catholic order .
The new allegations threaten to further undermine the Roman Catholic Church in Germany , already accused of hushing up hundreds of sexual and physical abuse allegations in Church - run schools that have come to light recently .
“ In the name of the order , I acknowledge with shame and guilt our failure , ” Father Stefan Dartmann , Germany ’s leading Jesuit official , said in a statement .
“ I ask for forgiveness . ”
The report also cited a further 50 allegations of abuse relating to other , mostly Catholic institutions .
The allegations by predominantly male victims in the Jesuit investigation focus on 12 priests , six of whom are now deceased , from several schools and youth facilities in Germany .
Solitary victims cited a further 32 church figures .
Though allegations of abuse in Jesuit schools surfaced in January , Dartmann admitted that Father Klaus Mertes , director of the Canisius Kolleg high school in Berlin , informed him about the problem in 2006 .

Catholics commentators say the Vatican has no media strategy
The Vatican 's handling of child abuse allegations has been called into question , following a senior cardinal 's suggestion of a link between homosexuality and paedophilia .
Gerard O'Connell of the British Catholic newspaper The Universe says the Church 's attempts to defend itself often just cause more damage .
Where is the Vatican 's media strategy going wrong ?
Pope Benedict XVI has been caught in the eye of the cyclone for several weeks , battered by accusations from lawyers and victims in Germany , the USA and elsewhere that he and senior Vatican officials have badly mismanaged or sought to cover up serious cases of abuse , and protected abuser priests .
These accusations - if not fully answered or firmly rebutted in timely fashion - are particularly damaging to the Catholic Church 's credibility and image , as well as to the moral authority of the Pope and of the Holy See on the world stage .
But the Vatican has struggled to defend him from the daily drip - drip of damaging revelations , and many questioned its communications strategy .
' Shooting the messenger '
When I asked John L Allen , the American Catholic commentator on the Vatican , why its media strategy was failing , he responded : " As soon as I see that they have a strategy , I will answer you !
The fact is , they do n't have one , and that is where they are going wrong . "
Cardinal Sodano dismissed accusations against the Pope as ' idle chatter '
Indeed , the absence of a coherent media strategy is evident , as a variety of Vatican personalities take it upon themselves to respond publicly to the accusations .
They often do it in a defensive or denial mode , shooting the messenger , or denouncing a conspiracy against the Pope and the Catholic Church because of its moral stances on life , the family and bioethics .
Over recent weeks , the Vatican has often resembled a fire brigade as it dashed to quench a fire in one place only to find another has broken out elsewhere , and never knowing where the next might blaze up .
It was caught completely off guard on several occasions , before and after Easter , when its own people started fires right inside the Vatican .
Jews and gays On Good Friday , Fr Raniero Cantalamessa , preaching in St Peter 's Basilica , sparked tensions with Jews by quoting a letter from a Jewish friend that suggested a comparison between the attacks against Pope Benedict with anti-Semitic attacks on Jews .
On Easter Sunday in St Peter 's Square , the Dean of the College of Cardinals , Angelo Sodano , dismissed as " idle chatter " the accusations against the Pope , thereby offending victims ' organisations .
Cardinal Bertone claims there are links between homosexuality and pedophilia On April 13 , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Secretary of State enraged the worldwide gay community by asserting that studies show a link between homosexuality and paedophilia .
The Vatican press office had to quench that fire too .
Commenting on these missteps that fanned rather than moderated the media frenzy , Andrea Tornielli , a leading Italian commentator on the Vatican , said " all this makes it difficult to understand what is the Vatican 's strategy and line of response " .
The Holy See 's press office is headed by an Italian Jesuit , Fr Federico Lombardi , a journalist who is also in charge of the Vatican 's radio and TV stations .
But whereas in any modern government 's communication strategy the chief spokesman is in on all the major discussions about key issues as was , for example , Alistair Campbell during the Blair government , the same is not true of Fr Lombardi .
' Undermined '
He has not once spoken with Pope Benedict about the abuse crisis since it first blew up in Germany last February .
Fr Lombardi describes himself as " a spokesman who is dependent on the Vatican 's Secretariat of State , from whom I get directions " .
" It is the Secretariat of State that decides the line , and I try to communicate that as best I can , " he said .
I do believe they have a good story to tell , but they are just not getting it through
Senior Western diplomat
He does not consider himself as co-ordinator of the Vatican 's media strategy .
" No - one has ever given me that mandate , " he told me .
He realises the need to rebut accusations quickly when there is no solid basis to them , and to provide answers to questions .
Fr Lombardi's patent sincerity is an advantage and he is doing as well as he can under the circumstances .
But he is being undermined when everyone in the Vatican feels they are in a position to comment too .
Missing strategy Fr Lombardi has collaborated closely , during the crisis , with the heads of the other Vatican media operations : L'Osservatore Romano - the official Vatican daily paper , the Council for Social Communications , and the website .
Victims ' groups have denounced the Vatican 's handling of their case
This has led to the publication on the website of a layman 's guide explaining how the Vatican deals with allegations of sex abuse of children and priest offenders .
While all this is a welcome development , it is far from being the centrally co-ordinated media strategy the Vatican needs if it wishes to defend its moral credibility and authority in an increasingly sceptical world .
One senior Western diplomat told me he wished " the Vatican could get its act together " because " there is no justification for the accusation that Pope Benedict has taken a soft line on child abuse " .
" I do believe they have a good story to tell " , he said , " but they are just not getting it through . "

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - A solid majority of Americans back Arizona ’s tough crackdown on illegal immigrants , while just 25 percent support President Barack Obama ’s immigration policy which includes legalizing millions of unauthorized migrants , a study found on Wednesday .
The controversial Arizona law passed last month requires state and local police , after making “ lawful contact , ” to check the immigration status of anyone they reasonably suspect is in the country illegally , and arrest those who cannot prove it .
The report by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press ( www.people-press.org) found that 59 percent of adults polled in a national survey gave their overall approval to the law , which opponents charge is unconstitutional and a mandate for racial profiling .
Seventy - three percent said they backed a measure requiring people to produce documents verifying their legal status if police ask for them , while 67 percent approve of allowing police to detain anyone who cannot verify that they are in the country legally .
The new law has pushed a debate over immigration to the fore in U.S. politics , and rebooted a drive by Obama and Senate Democrats to overhaul federal immigration laws -- although it is seen as a longshot before November congressional elections .
Obama supports a system allowing undocumented immigrants in good standing to pay a fine , learn English and become citizens .
He also backs tightening border security and clamping down on employers that hire undocumented workers .
The survey , carried out among 994 adults -- found that only 25 percent supported Obama ’s handling of immigration policy , while more than twice as many -- 54 percent -- said they disapproved .
It found that Democrats are evenly split over the Arizona law -- which is set to come into effect at the end of July -- with 45 percent backing it and 46 percent saying they disapprove of it .
The measure , signed into law by Arizona ’s Republican Governor Jan Brewer on April 23 , has triggered an international furor and unleashed legal challenges and calls for an economic boycott of the Grand Canyon state .
On Tuesday , United Nations human rights experts added their voices to criticism of the law , saying it may lead to police targeting people on the basis of ethnic origin , in violation of international law .
Making Abstract Data Types Abstract
An approach to make systems safe from heap spray attacks
Doug Tygar is an expert on computer security in the broad sense .
It started with his thesis work on building secure operating systems .
This work was notable for its unique approach to this fundamental problem , partly driven by the views of his famous advisor Michael Rabin .
Since then he has continued working on all aspects of security : including attacks against intrusion detectors themselves , covert channels , and spam and botnet protection .
Today I want to talk about some attacks on software systems and an attempt to try to model them formally , and perhaps prevent them .
This is related to some research of Doug ’s , but the ideas here are work still in progress .
Doug started his career as junior faculty at CMU , where he taught a class on security .
One thing about CMU students , in general , they are good “ hackers . ”
Even theory students are known for being able to write code , and the systems students are seriously good .
At the start of the class , Doug announced to his students he had a great password and that no one would be able to break it .
I am not sure why he challenged the class , but he did .
It was not a good idea — do not wave red flags at a bull — or in this case at a class full of them .
The game was on .
In a couple of days the class had figured out his password .
The problem they solved is given a “ one - way ” function and a string , find a string , the password , so that
They had used a standard dictionary based attack : try all the words from some dictionary , and test each to see if .
Usually , these programs are a bit more clever and can get a password like “ 99hello ” quite easily .
They told Doug his password , and so he changed it to a better one .
Game on .
This they still cracked , even though it took much more computer time , but they still got it .
Now Doug announced to his class that he had picked a password that would foil these simple dictionary attacks .
But , he made a small error , he told them how he had selected the password .
He wanted a password he could remember , so he used his knowledge of Japanese .
He told them he had used a Japanese phrase as his password .
He smiled to the class , and told them to forget about trying to crack this password .
They decided to attack his password , Japanese or not .
Of course he had to write his phrase as a series of roman letters , since the login routine did not accept Japanese characters .
There are standard ways to encode Japanese into roman letters , see this ; thus , they built their own special dictionary for Japanese phrases .
It was a lot of work , but in a week or so , and with some luck , they again broke his password .
Doug was getting tired of this game of password cracking : he wanted them to work on more important security projects .
So he told his class he had changed his password to a random string of letters :
Let ’s move on , I win .
Of course this was not the end , recall these were CMU hackers .
They knew the attacks using dictionaries were out , but there were other ways to get passwords .
In those days , this was many years ago , the CMU department was using workstations that allowed users to listen in on all the ethernet traffic on the network .
Essentially they could sniff the packets as they went by , whether they were meant for them or not .
So they wrote a program that examined each packet .
The goal was to find packets that looked like they were part of a remote login .
Each time they found one they got a and checked to see if it was Doug ’s password .
After a few days , a packet went by with his password , and they had him .
The key insight was that the operating system did not encrypt passwords when logging into remote machines .
After Doug heard they had his password again , he gave up .
Game over .
You win .
He told them his new password — this stopped all attacks .
And the class moved on to more interesting issues concerning the security of systems .
Let ’s move on to a class of interesting attacks on systems .
Code Injection
One of the fundamental ways that malware takes over a system is this :
First , the malware runs in normal mode and does something legal , but something that will help it break your system .
Often this involves writing some data somewhere in memory by legal means .
.
Then , the malware uses some bug , and jumps to a given location in memory .
Now , the malware is running its own code and does whatever it wants to do to you .
The second step is critical .
Without the bug or hole in your system the malware would likely be unable to run the code that it wants to run .
However , modern software systems are large , complex , and distributed : all make “ preventing the jump ” step very hard .
Thus , the need for methods that detect or even protect systems from this type of attack .
Heap Spraying
In early attacks the malware could control the jump step — it could decide where to jump to exactly .
The software bug that was exploited allowed the malware to jump to a specific location .
This made the malware ’s job pretty easy : place its code there and jump .
However , as software engineers have become more aware of attacks , there are less predictable ways for malware to take control .
Today many bugs allow malware to jump into memory , but not to a specific location .
The challenge is simple : given that malware can jump into memory , how does the malware make sure it can jump into its code ?
It would be useless , from the malware ’s point of view , to jump into the middle of legal code or data .
Likely , this type of jump might crash the system , but would not allow the malware to take over .
Hence the creation of heap spraying .
Sounds like a garden product :
use “ heap spray ” and all your weeds will go away .
The idea of heap spraying is simple , since the jump is unpredictable , place many copies of the malware code all over memory .
Then , when the jump occurs , there will be a good chance that the malware jumps into its own code .
There is one further simple idea to make this work .
The malware wants to get to the start of its own code — jumping into the middle is not very useful .
So nop sleds are used .
Imagine memory is filled with pieces of code like this :
Here is typically a “ nop . ”
Note , now as long as the jump hits the sequence the malware ’s code will get executed properly .
Here is an example of how this type of attack looks :
The Problem : Abstract Data Types
I see the problem as : the malware is given legal access to some abstract data type .
During the first part of the attack the malware can do any legal operations on the data type .
In the above example , the malware just filled an array — legally — with its sled and code .
However , later on the malware will do the jump step .
This will take it into the memory and perhaps with luck it will hit a nop sled and then execute its malware code .
The problem is : the abstract data type is not abstract .
A white hat programmer only uses the correct calls to the data type ; on the other hand , the malware jumps into the middle of the data type .
This is an abuse of the data type , and is how the malware gets control of the machine .
Here is a “ solution ” to the heap spray problem based on the use of theory type ideas .
I say “ solution ” for the following reason : unless the exact attacks are clearly defined the solution can still fail — more on this later on .
I do think , however , that ideas from theory could easily play a bigger role in the security of modern systems .
I will explain the idea for the simple data type of a one - dimesional array of integers .
Imagine some scripting language that hat allows programs to access arrays .
They can execute to write the array value , and execute to read the array value .
The implementation of the array type is changed very slightly .
I need to explain how it is created , read , and written .
Create Array : A random value integer is selected .
The array is set up as usual : let denote the memory locations where the array is stored .
Write Array : Suppose is to be written into .
Then , execute
Read Array : Suppose is to be read from .
Then , execute
and return the value .
The point of this is the values stored in the actual memory are not the “ raw ” values sent to the data type .
They are scrambled to make them appear random .
Clearly , a jump now will hit ,
Thus , a malware program that fills memory with nop sleds and then jumps is likely to hit random garbage .
This may cause an exception or even a crash , but will unlikely allow the malware to take over the system .
Does This Work ?
I believe the above is a pretty good “ solution . ”
However , it could be defeated if the array allows access to undefined locations .
This shows how careful one must be in designing such “ solutions . ”
I think whether this particular idea is useful or not is less important than the idea that we may be able to use crypto like methods to protect software .
The malware could learn the value of as follows .
It would access some yet - undefined location and get back where was the value left in the location .
For example , if , then the malware would learn , and this would defeat the method .
Even if were arbitrary , the malware could use this approach to try to learn the secret random value .
To avoid this attack there are at least two methods .
We could assume that the data type does not allow the access of undefined values .
It can return “ undefined value , ” but must monitor whether a location is defined or not .
The other possibility is to use a more complex crypto solution .
The advantage of the latter is the data type need not watch and check that no read occurs to a location that is undefined .
I will discuss this method and related issues in a later post .
Stopping Heap Spray — Other Approaches
There are several other methods for protecting against heap spray attacks .
One project is called Nozzle and is work of Paruj Ratanaworabhan , Benjamin Livshits , and Benjamin Zorn of Microsoft .
This method is really an intrusion detection method : it watches the memory and reports if it detects the presence of objects that contain executable code .
One problem with this method is the existence of false positives .
They note that often data stored by programs is legal code .
Another project is called BuBBle and is the work of Francesco Gadaleta , Yves Younan , and Wouter Joosen .
They use a method very close to one I am suggesting .
They replace parts of memory by random pieces — these random pieces cause the memory left by the attacker to be gone .
This will cause the malware to cause an exception when it attempts to execute that part of memory .
One problem is they only modify some of memory , and second is they need additional storage for the actual values of the modified memory .
Open Problems
Can theory help in other ways in building secure operating systems ?
Does the idea here have any use in fighting heap spray attacks ?
Can we use more crypto in making secure systems ?

In a study appearing in the journal PLoS ONE , Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) scientists describe finding mathematical patterns underlying the way individuals unconsciously distribute their preferences regarding approaching or avoiding objects in their environment .
These patterns appear to meet the strict criteria used to determine whether something is a scientific law and , if confirmed in future studies , could potentially be used to guide diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders .
" Law - like processes are important in science for their predictive value , and finding patterns in behavior that meet criteria for lawfulness is extremely rare , " explains Hans Breiter , MD , principal investigator of the MGH Phenotype Genotype Project in Addiction and Mood Disorder ( http://pgp.mgh.harvard.edu), who led the study .
" The patterns we observed appear to describe the unconscious range of preference an individual has with a specificity suggestive of that of a fingerprint .
We look forward to learning what other scientists find about these patterns . "
These patterns -- which the authors group together under the name relative preference theory -- incorporate features of several older theories of reward and aversion into a single theory .
The PLoS ONE study reports on the outcome of three sets of experiments .
In each , healthy participants were presented with a series of images and could vary the amount of time they viewed each image by pressing the keys of a keypad .
The first group of participants viewed a series of four human faces -- average - looking male , average - looking female , attractive male and attractive female .
The second group was presented with a series of photographs of images ranging from children , food , sports and musical instruments to war , disaster , and drug paraphernalia .
The third group viewed four different images of food -- two of normal appearing meals , one in which the food was abnormally colored , and one of raw , unprepared food -- on two different days .
For one viewing , participants were hungry , for the other , they had just eaten .
Responses were measured by whether participants increased , decreased , or did nothing to change how long they viewed particular images .
All three experiments showed the same patterns in both groups and individuals , patterns that contained a set of features that varied between people .
These patterns describe how groups and individuals make tradeoffs between approaching and avoiding items ; how value is attributed to objects , which is linked assessments of other objects of the same type ; and how individuals set limits to how strongly they will seek or avoid objects .
The authors note that these patterns incorporate aspects of three existing theories in reward / aversion : prospect theory , which includes the fact that people are more strongly motivated to avoid negative outcomes than to attain positive outcomes ; the matching law , which describes how the rates of response to multiple stimuli are proportional to the amount of reward attributed to each stimulus ; and alliesthesia , which notes that the value placed on something depends on whether it is perceived to be scarce -- for example , hungry people place greater value on food than do those who have just eaten .
One of the key differences between relative preference theory ( RPT ) and earlier theories is that RPT evaluates preferences relating to the intrinsic value of items to an individual , rather than relating preferences to values set by external forces -- such as how the overall economy sets the value of the dollar .
The patterns observed in this study are similar at the individual and group levels -- a relationship known as " scaling . "
" In order for behavioral patterns to be considered law - like , they need to be described mathematically , recur in response to many types of stimuli , remain stable in the face of statistical noise , and potentially show scaling across different levels of measurement , " explains Anne Blood , PhD , deputy principal investigator of the Phenotype Genotype Project , director of the MGH Mood and Motor Control Laboratory , and a co-author of the PLoS ONE report .
" Relative preference theory meets those requirements , but these observations need to be confirmed by other scientists , " she adds .
Other work by our team is examining how these RPT patterns are affected by depression and addiction , with the goal of developing RPT as an Internet tool for psychiatric diagnosis . "
Earlier studies by the MGH investigators also connected aspects of RPT to reward circuits in the brain , using magnetic resonance imaging , and to measures of genetic variability .

The bid by Chicago businessman Jerry Reinsdorf to buy the Phoenix Coyotes is dead and the city of Glendale has returned to the previously shunned Ice Edge Holdings group in a last - minute bid to keep the team in Phoenix .
The Glendale City Council is expected to file documents Friday morning accepting a new lease proposal from Ice Edge and agreeing to work exclusively with the group moving forward , sources close to the deal said .
Ice Edge CEO Anthony LeBlanc confirmed to ESPN.com late Thursday night he has met with city of Glendale officials a number of times this week in the hopes of reaching an agreement on a new lease proposal .
" However no decision has been reached by either side in regards to next steps , if any , " LeBlanc said .
The desperation move comes less than a month after backroom politicking led to the city council rejecting Ice Edge 's proposal in favor of Reinsdorf's , owner of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox .
His group 's proposal has now been abandoned .
But the about - face by the city of Glendale does not ensure the team will remain in Phoenix .
Sources told ESPN.com the city must guarantee a number of conditions with the NHL , including covering operating losses incurred next season , before the league will consider agreeing to sell the team to Ice Edge .
One source said the league wants conditions meant by the end of this week , although NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told ESPN.com that timeline is not accurate .
It 's believed Ice Edge was waiting for those conditions to be met before signing the agreement with the city .
The situation in Glendale remains fluid ; if the city does not agree to the league 's conditions , it is possible the NHL will instead move quickly to finalize a purchase agreement with Canadian billionaire David Thomson and move the team to Winnipeg .
Sources tell ESPN.com there is a purchase agreement ready if the Glendale situation disintegrates .
Daly would not comment to The Associated Press on reports about Reinsdorf 's deal or a potential move to Winnipeg .
However , a person with knowledge of the situation told The
Associated Press that as of Friday , Reinsdorf was still in the mix .
The
individual requested anonymity because that information had not
been authorized for release .
If the Coyotes end up moving to Winnipeg , it 's unlikely the current tenants of the arena there , the AHL Manitoba Moose , could remain .
There is a possibility Ice Edge would be interested in moving the AHL franchise to Thunder Bay , Ontario , where a number of executives are from .
" Ice Edge remains committed to our stated long - term goal of someday bringing professional hockey to Thunder Bay , however at this point in time it remains simply that , a long - term goal , " LeBlanc said .
When the city refused to accept the first lease proposal from Ice Edge , it was assumed the bid to buy the team was dead .
However , about a week ago , city officials reached out to Ice Edge and told them the Reinsdorf deal was not going to move forward .
A month ago , the city council voted not to endorse the Ice Edge proposal even though the group pledged not to move the team for the remaining 24 years on the city 's lease with Jobing.com Arena .
Instead , the council approved Reinsdorf 's group 's proposal , giving him the inside track to buy the team from the NHL .
But there were immediate questions about the Reinsdorf proposal , including a clause that would have allowed him to sell and / or move the team at any point after five years .
Although there have been questions about Ice Edge 's ability to come up with funds for the purchase price , believed to be between $ 140 and $ 150 million , sources told ESPN.com funding is in place and will be secured as soon as the exclusivity documents were filed with the city of Glendale .
Meanwhile , the team had a highly unexpected successful season on
the ice , setting franchise records for wins and points and selling
out the arena late this season .
The Coyotes were eliminated by
the Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs 4 - 3 .
The franchise never has turned a profit since moving from
Winnipeg in 1996 .
Jerry Moyes , the owner who took the team into
bankruptcy , said in court documents that he had lost some $ 300
million on the team .

The New York Police Department thinks it may have caught the wannabe Times Square car bomber on tape – and is hoping to use a $ 24 million phalanx of surveillance cameras to stop future attacks in midtown Manhattan .
It 's a goal that 's unlikely to be reached anytime soon .
New York 's original spycam array is running behind schedule .
And the track record of large , metropolitan surveillance networks pre-empting terrorists is weak , at best .
" NYC is a high risk area , " New York officials note in a homeland security grant request , obtained by City Limits magazine .
" One threat in particular involves a vehicle - borne improvised explosive " – a car bomb .
In 2006 , the New York Police Department announced a three - year , $ 106 million plan that promised to prevent attacks on New York 's financial district with a web of license - plate readers , chemical sniffers , radiation detectors and 3,000 publicly and corporately owned cameras .
All the information would then be channeled into a single coordination center .
Specialized video intelligence algorithms would be used to spot would - be attackers as they case their targets .
" This is about identifying and eliminating a threat , rather than dealing with the consequences , " NYPD assistant chief John Colgan told me as planning for this Lower Manhattan Security Initiative got underway .
" I 'm not in the consequence - management business . "
Today , the LMSI 's coordination center is up and running .
Some cameras are now keeping watch over the financial district .
But according to the grant request , the installation and integration of many of those cameras is running far , far behind the initial three - year deadline .
The NYPD says it aims to " install all camera systems at designated locations " between January 1st of 2011 and July 31st of 2012 .
It also wants a " video surveillance system and collaboration portal " to integrate feeds from old and new cameras by 2012 – three years past the original goal .
By the middle of this year , the Department wants to " acquire and install CCTV cameras and all Coordination Center equipment , " as well as " acquire , install and implement all software programs .... [ and the ] hardware to run systems ' software . "
But even if all the pieces are put in place , it 's unclear exactly how helpful the system will be .
Terrorists around the world have shown an utter disregard for spycams .
They know they 'll be taped as they plan and execute their strikes ; they just do n't care about being filmed .
Take this latest Times Square attack : Already , the area is one of the most heavily surveilled on the planet .
Yet the bomber went ahead with his plan anyway .
Of course , today 's bombers know city spycams are only used for forensic purposes – finding the bomber , after the bomb has gone off .
Attitudes could change , if the video feeds can be integrated and upgraded with the kind of algorithms banks and casinos use to keep tabs on their customers .
When they work , this software can spot suspicious behavior – leaving a backpack in the middle of the street , lingering too long outside a secure facility , or running up a down escalator .
But to the best of my knowledge , no city has been able to pull such a system off , yet .
Banks and casinos have consistent lighting , and access to every nook to position a camera .
Cities do n't .
The challenges of open - air , mass surveillance of people are still too great .
It 's one of the reasons why surveillance nets from Chicago to New York 's subways have faced mounting costs and missed deadlines .
New York is hoping to be the first to pull it off .
And not just with the LMSI , but with the recently announced Midtown Manhattan Security Initiative , too .
The idea is to blanket " key locations between 30th and 60th Streets from river to river " with spycams and license - plate readers .
According to the grant documents , the NYPD would like to complete a " study of the area to determine locations for surveillance assets " by July , 2012 .
As the same time , New York officials also want to set up a " dedicated ... network ... to handle all data sources as previously identified to expand this security initiative into midtown Manhattan .
Once established , the network will provide virtually unlimited bandwidth and access to the cumulated data . "
The most useful data may be the simplest to obtain and to share .
License plate numbers are much easier to recognize than human faces .
The technology to pick out a suspicious number is time - tested .
Which is why a key component of New York expanded surveillance ring " is to reduce NYC 's vulnerability to an IED attack through a comprehensive domain awareness program focused on key bridges , tunnel , infrastructure and vehicles entering the Lower and Midtown Manhattan zones , " the NYPD notes in its grant request .
" Each License Plate Recognition System can scan thousands of cars per day and will alert Police Headquarters to the presence of a suspicious vehicle .
This capability provides the NYPD with early warning capability to support investigation and interdiction . "

In an open letter sent of May 14 , Chavannes Jean - Baptiste , the Executive Director of MPP and the spokesperson for the National Peasant Movement of the Congress of Papay ( MPNKP ) , called the entry of Monsanto seeds into Haiti “ a very strong attack on small agriculture , on farmers , on biodiversity , on Creole seeds … , and on what is left our environment in Haiti . ” [ 1 ]
Haitian social movements have been vocal in their opposition to agribusiness imports of seeds and food , which undermines local production with local seed stocks .
They have expressed special concern about the import of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
For now , without a law regulating the use of GMOs in Haiti , the Ministry of Agriculture rejected Monsanto ’s offer of Roundup Ready GMO seeds .
In an email exchange , a Monsanto representative assured the Ministry of Agriculture that the seeds being donated are not GMO .
Elizabeth Vancil , Monsanto ’s Director of Development Initiatives , called the news that the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture approved the donation “ a fabulous Easter gift ” in an April email .
[ 2 ]
Monsanto is known for aggressively pushing seeds , especially GMO seeds , in both the global North and South , including through highly restrictive technology agreements with farmers who are not always made fully aware of what they are signing .
According to interviews by this writer with representatives of Mexican small farmer organizations , they then find themselves forced to buy Monsanto seeds each year , under conditions they find onerous and at costs they sometimes cannot afford .
The hybrid corn seeds Monsanto has donated to Haiti are treated with the fungicide Maxim XO , and the calypso tomato seeds are treated with thiram . [ 3 ]
Thiram belongs to a highly toxic class of chemicals called ethylene bisdithiocarbamates ( EBDCs ) .
Results of tests of EBDCs on mice and rats caused concern to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , which then ordered a special review .
The EPA determined that EBDC - treated plants are so dangerous to agricultural workers that they must wear special protective clothing when handling them .
Pesticides containing thiram must contain a special warning label , the EPA ruled .
The EPA also barred marketing of the chemicals for many home garden products , because it assumes that most gardeners do not have adequately protective clothing .
[ 4 ]
Monsanto ’s passing mention of thiram to Ministry of Agriculture officials in an email contained no explanation of the dangers , nor any offer of special clothing or training for those who will be farming with the toxic seeds .
Haitian social movements ’ concern is not just about the dangers of the chemicals and the possibility of future GMO imports .
They claim that the future of Haiti depends on local production with local food for local consumption , in what is called food sovereignty .
Monsanto ’s arrival in Haiti , they say , is a further threat to this .
“ People in the U.S. need to help us produce , not give us food and seeds .
They ’re ruining our chance to support ourselves , ” said farmer Jonas Deronzil of a peasant cooperative in the rural region of Verrettes . [ 5 ]
Monsanto ’s history has long drawn ire from environmentalists , health advocates , and small farmers , going back to its production of Agent Orange during the Vietnam war .
Exposure to Agent Orange has caused cancer in an untold number of U.S. Veterans , and the Vietnamese government claims that 400,000 Vietnamese people were killed or disabled by Agent Orange , and 500,000 children were born with birth defects as a result of their exposure . [ 6 ]
Monsanto ’s former motto , “ Without chemicals , life itself would be impossible , ” has been replaced by “ Imagine . ”
Its web site home page claims it “ help [s ] farmers around the world produce more while conserving more .
We help farmers grow yield sustainably so they can be successful , produce healthier foods … while also reducing agriculture 's impact on our environment . ” [ 7 ]
The corporations ’ record does not support the claims .
Together with Syngenta , Dupont and Bayer , Monsanto controls more than half of the world ’s seeds .
[ 8 ]
The company holds almost 650 seed patents , most of them for cotton , corn and soy , and almost 30 % of the share of all biotech research and development .
Monsanto came to own such a vast supply by buying major seed companies to stifle competition , patenting genetic modifications to plant varieties , and suing small farmers .
Monsanto is also one of the leading manufacturers of GMOs .
As of 2007 , Monsanto had filed 112 lawsuits against U.S. farmers for alleged technology contract violations or GMO patents , involving 372 farmers and 49 small agricultural businesses in 27 different states .
From these , Monsanto has won more than $ 21.5 million in judgments .
The multinational appears to investigate 500 farmers a year , in estimates based on Monsanto ’s own documents and media reports . [ 9 ]
“ Farmers have been sued after their field was contaminated by pollen or seed from someone else ’s genetically engineered crop [ or ] when genetically engineered seed from a previous year ’s crop has sprouted , or ‘ volunteered , ’ in fields planted with non-genetically engineered varieties the following year , ” said Andrew Kimbrell and Joseph Mendelson of the Center for Food Safety . [ 10 ]
In Colombia , Monsanto has received upwards of $ 25 million from the U.S. government for providing Roundup Ultra in the anti-drug fumigation efforts of Plan Colombia .
Roundup Ultra is a highly concentrated version of Monsanto 's glyphosate herbicide , with additional ingredients to increase its lethality .
Colombian communities and human rights organizations have charged that the herbicide has destroyed food crops , water sources and protected areas , and has led to increased incidents of birth defects and cancers .
Vía Campesina , the world ’s largest confederation of farmers with member organizations in more than sixty countries , has called Monsanto one of the “ principal enemies of peasant sustainable agriculture and food sovereignty for all peoples . ” [ 11 ]
They claim that as Monsanto and other multinationals control an ever larger share of land and agriculture , they force small farmers out of their land and jobs .
They also claim that the agribusiness giants contribute to climate change and other environmental disasters , an outgrowth of industrial agriculture . [ 12 ]
The Vía Campesina coalition launched a global campaign against Monsanto last October 16 , on International World Food Day , with protests , land occupations , and hunger strikes in more than twenty countries .
They carried out a second global day of action against Monsanto on April 17 of this year , in honor of Earth Day .
Non-governmental organizations in the U.S. are challenging Monsanto ’s practices , too .
The Organic Consumers Association has spearheaded the campaign “ Millions Against Monsanto , ” calling on the company to stop intimidating small family farmers , stop marketing untested and unlabeled genetically engineered foods to consumers , and stop using billions of dollars of U.S. taypayers ' money to subsidize GMO crops .

The Center for Food Safety has led a four - year legal challenge to Monsanto that has just made it to the U.S. Supreme Court .
After successful litigation against Monsanto and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for illegal promotion of Roundup Ready Alfalfa , the court heard the Center for Food Safety ’s case on April 27 .
A decision on this first - ever Supreme Court case about GMOs is now pending . [ 14 ]
“ Fighting hybrid and GMO seeds is critical to save our diversity and our agriculture , ” Jean - Baptiste said in an interview in February .
“ We have the potential to make our lands produce enough to feed the whole population and even to export certain products .
The policy we need for this to happen is food sovereignty , where the county has a right to define it own agricultural policies , to grow first for the family and then for local market , to grow healthy food in a way which respects the environment and Mother Earth . ”

The results have now been posted on the Internet and submitted to the Physical Review .
It was Andrei Sakharov , the Russian dissident and physicist , who first provided a recipe for how matter could prevail over antimatter in the early universe .
Among his conditions was that there be a slight difference in the properties of particles and antiparticles known technically as CP violation .
In effect , when the charges and spins of particles are reversed , they should behave slightly differently .
Over the years , physicists have discovered a few examples of CP violation in rare reactions between subatomic particles that tilt slightly in favor of matter over antimatter , but “ not enough to explain our existence , ” in the words of Gustaaf Brooijmans of Columbia , who is a member of the DZero team .
The new effect hinges on the behavior of particularly strange particles called neutral B - mesons , which are famous for not being able to make up their minds .
They oscillate back and forth trillions of times a second between their regular state and their antimatter state .
As it happens , the mesons , created in the proton - antiproton collisions , seem to go from their antimatter state to their matter state more rapidly than they go the other way around , leading to an eventual preponderance of matter over antimatter of about 1 percent , when they decay to muons .
Whether this is enough to explain our existence is a question that cannot be answered until the cause of the still - mysterious behavior of the B- mesons is directly observed , said Dr. Brooijmans , who called the situation “ fairly encouraging . ”
The observed preponderance is about 50 times what is predicted by the Standard Model , the suite of theories that has ruled particle physics for a generation , meaning that whatever is causing the B - meson to act this way is “ new physics ” that physicists have been yearning for almost as long .
Dr. Brooijmans said that the most likely explanations were some new particle not predicted by the Standard Model or some new kind of interaction between particles .
Luckily , he said , “ this is something we should be able to poke at with the Large Hadron Collider . ”
Papaver Somniferum , the Opium Poppy , has been considered one of the most influential , as well as interesting things in the world for thousands of years .
For those unfamiliar with it , the poppy produces opium , the euphoric painkiller that is the starting point for heroin .
Depictions of the plant have been traced back to the Sumerians of 6000 years ago .
The beautiful flower has been worshiped as a gift from the gods , and just the same has been feared for its potential to destroy millions of lives .
Rather you see them as divine , or quite the opposite , it ’s hard to argue how much influence they ’ve had in our world .
Here are ten particular areas that the plant and its drug have dramatically impacted .
10 Music
“ Music is a beautiful opiate , if you do n’t take it too seriously . ”
Henry Miller .
Think of your favorite rock band from the 70s or 80s .
I ’ll bet you the shoes on my feet that at least one of their songs was inspired by , or if not , directly refers to heroin .
It became popular with the rock community for its mild altering effects .
Inspiring romanticism , creativity , joy , fun , and of course pleasure made it a hit to rebellious world .
Some songs you might be familiar with that have been thought to refer to the drug – “ The Needle and the Damage Done ” by Neil Young , “ Mr. Brownstone ” by Guns N’ Roses , “ Heroin ” by Velvet Underground , and “ Comfortably Numb ” by Pink Floyd ( that one is probably the most arguable ) .
Courtney Love ( above ) did well to summarize the relationship between musicians and heroin : “ the drug you do if you ’re in a fuckin ’ four - star hotel and you can order all the goddamn room service that you want and you can just lay in bed and drool all over yourself because you ’ve got a million bucks in the bank .
That ’s the drug you want to do if you want to be a kid forever . ”
9 Surgery
Surgery is thought to have been practiced for centuries , pioneered by ancient civilizations in Egypt , India , Greece and China .
The gap between ancient surgery and modern lies heavily on the control of the inevitable pain that comes with it : anesthesia .
While local anesthesia is available for us by a completely different plant , the Coca , general anesthesia became possible with the Opium Poppy .
The art of putting patients out for surgery made a breakthrough in the 19th century , when Morphine , one of the opiate alkaloids found naturally in opium , was extracted from the plant .
With this discovery , surgery was able to advance to the previously unheard of feats we think of commonly today .
Soldiers were able to inject themselves with Morphine in the latter half of the Civil War , making the removal of bullets a much less excruciating experience .
Nowadays we have other methods of general anesthesia for surgery , such as hypnotics ( propofol ) and Dissociatives ( nitrous oxide ) , but nevertheless morphine and other opium - derivatives are still commonly used .
8 Beautiful Flowers
Stepping aside from the drug the Opium Poppy produces ; let ’s focus on the flower itself .
At a time referred to as the “ common garden poppy ” , the plant is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes all over the world .
The flower , depending on the particular variety , ranges from red to white and even purple hues .
The capsules containing the opium are very interesting looking and easily emphasizes the plant as a poppy .
Even the tiny black seeds are used to decorate food , such as cakes and muffins .
The poppy seeds you can go get at your local grocer this afternoon are indeed the same species of poppy used to harvest opium .
While not trying to drift too far off topic , I ’ll note that the common “ myth ” that someone who consumes poppy seeds can fail a drug test is absolutely true and proven .
The seeds contain enough opiate alkaloids to make it show in your system .
My advice : let your employer know if you ’ve been eating anything with poppy seeds before your drug screening results come back , or you might be looking for a new job .
7 Culture
The customs and traditions of societies throughout written history have likely been much more influenced by the Opium Poppy than your high school history teacher let you know .
Starting back in Ancient Greece , Homer described opium ’s pleasant effects in “ The Odyssey ” : “ … had a happy thought .
Into the bowl in which their wine was mixed , she slipped a drug that had the power of robbing grief and anger of their sting and banishing all painful memories .
No one who swallowed this dissolved in their wine could shed a single tear that day , even for the death of his mother or father , or if they put his brother or his own son to the sword and he were there to see it done … ” .
Fast - forward to 19th century China , where the drug was so popular it ’s estimated that at least a quarter of Chinese men were addicted to it .
It was smoked in opium dens as a pastime , something at first thought to be joyful and social .
This was before its addictiveness was well known .
The Chinese eventually outlawed it , leading to the Opium Wars in the next section .
To this day opiates are used worldwide recreationally and and impact many cultures .
6 Wars
The Opium Wars were two separate affairs between the Chinese and British , both stemming from China ’s opium prohibition and its effect on the British Empire ’s cash crop .
The first war was fought between 1839 - 1842 , and the second 1856 - 1860 .
Massive opium production was occurring in British India and acted as a huge source of wealth , as China ’s demand for it was unrelenting .
When China ’s government realized the harmful effects of so many men being addicted to it , it was outlawed .
One way to put it : they quit cold turkey .
Although the drug was still being smuggled into China , the effects of Britain losing its main source of money were very damaging , and it would lead to war .
The British would end up defeating China , and they were forced to allow opium to be imported into the country .
Even the Governor - general Lin Zexu ’s efforts of destroying millions of pounds of it and arresting some 1700 dealers were futile ; it was an entire nation under the spell of the Opium Poppy .
5 Literature
I remember in March I was so excited to see the new Alice in Wonderland movie coming out .
I ’ve always found the story interesting and I decided to do some research on it and its original author , Lewis Carroll .
I was surprised to find that it is popularly held that he was an avid opium user , and that the drug was probably a huge inspiration to the story ’s imaginative world and characters .
This is disputed by some – but laudanum was popular in his time so it is certainly not improbable that he used it .
Authors such as Arthur Conan Doyle , Oscar Wilde , and Charles Dickens were all fans of the Opium Poppy ’s inspirational potential , showing just how much of an impact a single plant has had on literature , especially notable in the 19th century .
The Wizard of Oz , commonly referred to as one of the greatest and timeless films ever , comes from an opium inspired book .
However , you might have been confused by the scene where Dorothy falls deeply asleep in the poppy field before Emerald City .
But perhaps the most famous work inspired by opium use is Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge – he was using opium to counter the effects of dysentery and in doing so dreamed up one of the most ravishing poems in the English language .
4 Wealth
Knowing that the outlawing of opium in China lead to two major wars , it ’s obvious that the financial potential of the plant has been huge throughout history .
From the opium harvesters of the past , to the Pharmaceutical Companies who use the poppy to produce medicine , to the common street heroin dealers , one thing is clear : Opium Poppy is a cash crop .
It ’s estimated that growing kilogram of opium costs a farmer about $ 300 .
He can sell that to a drug dealer for around $ 800 , making him a hefty little profit .
That dealer , after converting the opium to heroin , will make $ 16,000 on the same amount of product it took $ 300 and some help from nature to grow .
An enjoyable modern depiction of this process is 2006 ’s “ American Gangster ” .
A man goes from rags to riches after getting connecting from poppy farmers in Vietnam .
3 Pain Relief
While pain relief is of course a key to surgery , it goes much further than that .
Opium has been used from the very beginning for its painkilling properties .
In some parts of the world , there is no such thing as retirement .
A man will work his whole life , and opium ’s relief has sometimes been the only way to keep living .
It ’s been called “ God ’s own medicine ” , and considered divine and sacred by many people .
The two alkaloids in it that bind to out brain ’s opioid receptors are morphine and codeine .
Many opiate derivatives have been discovered from these ; heroin ( diacetylmorphine ) and hydromorphone from morphine , and oxycodone and hydrocodone from codeine .
Since these are semi-synthetic , these substances may start from the poppy , but have to be chemically structured in labs by Pharmaceutical Companies
2 Pharmaceutical Industries
Opium Poppy may be quite easy to grow , but its genetic properties have made pharmaceutical companies billions and billions of dollars .
Bayer marketed Aspirin and Morphine as painkillers for uncontrolled use in the 19th century .
The rose of morphine ’s superiority to aspirin came with the thorn of its unforgiving addictiveness .
Finally a solution , the rose without a thorn .
A drug with the power of morphine that would n’t hook you : heroin !
Well , you can guess what comes next , heroin ( named for being thought of as a heroic substance ) was found to be even more addictive .
Opiates were criminalized in the United States , and used legally only when a medical doctor saw fit to let you .
In the 20th century many other opium - derivatives were discovered , such as oxycodone ( OxyContin , Percoset ) , hydrocodone ( Lortab , Vicodin ) , and oxymorphone ( Opana , Numorphan ) .
Next time your doctor gives you medicine for your sore back or broken foot , chances are that medicine came from the Opium Poppy .
1 Addiction
This section really has little need for further description .
Opium Poppy introduced society to one of the most harmful and abundant issues of today : drug addiction .
With moderate , spiritual opium use addiction was n’t an issue , but as time went on : chronic use , harmful ways of ingestion , and chemically altering the substance all helped see the downfall of the plant ’s “ divinity ” .
It may be the most useful , helpful , and peaceful thing in history .
Or it may be the plant responsible for a father ’s neglect or a brother ’s death .
Whichever way you look at it , the Opium Poppy is one of the most influential things to ever grace this Earth .
Web 2.0 Expo Scribd - the document sharing site that boasts 50 million unique users a month - has told the world that after three years and " multi- millions " of dollars of development on Flash , it 's ditching the beleaguered platform in favor of the fledgling HTML5 standard .
Company co-founder and CTO Jared Friedman announced the move this morning at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco , calling it " the largest HTML5 deployment to date . "
Friedman and crew have already moved 200,000 documents from Flash to HTML5 , and eventually , the company will transfer all documents stored on the site , which number in the tens of millions .
Friedman was careful to call Flash " a terrific technology . "
But somewhere along the line , Scribd realized it 's a plug - in . " [ Flash ] has always had a few drawbacks , " he said .
" It boils down to the fact that you 're putting the content inside a separate application .
This leads to a browser - in - a - browser problem where we end up duplicating functionality in the user 's browser ourselves .
" This is one , a lot of work , and two , almost incessantly a bad user experience . "
Friedman acknowledged that until recently , handling documents in the browser proper was n't the best option .
" The biggest challenge is formatting .
Documents use very complex formatting - vector graphics , rotated text , precise positioning - that was difficult to replicate in a webpage , " he said .
" Browsers only supported a dozen fonts .
Without the right font , you can't reproduce the document effectively . "
But now that the major browsers have rolled out support for additional fonts through the @font - face element and for vector graphics through either the canvas tag or VML , Friendman says , Scribd believes it can serve 97 per cent of all browsers without Flash .
" This even includes IE6 , " he said .
Not even Internet Explorer 9 has embraced the canvas tag , but that 's where VML comes in .
Scribd can convert documents originally formatted by Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org , or in PDF , PostScript , rich text , or plain text formats
Naturally , Friedman demoed his new HTML5 setup on an iPad .
The iPad is controlled by a Silicon Valley cult that has a pathological aversion to Flash . ®
BP rebrands British Petroleum recently launched its new corporate identity , with the familiar green shield replaced with a solar ' sunburst ' image .
BP has also dropped Amoco from its name , and says its initials should now be taken to reflect its move ' Beyond Petroleum ' .
It has doubled its investment in renewables , including solar , to $ 500 m .
However Greenpeace was not impressed .
It said that BP was spending more on rebranding ( $ 100 m ) than it did last year on solar power , while at the same time massively increasing their oil and gas production , including opening up the Arctic Ocean for new oil exploration .
Certainly BP is continuing to increase its investments in oil and gas .
In July it announced that Gross capital spending on exploration and production would rise to an average of $ 8 billion a year , on refining and marketing to $ 2.8 billion and on petrochemicals to $ 2 billion .
And its new gas and power business would spend some $ 400 m .
In parallel , the rebranding and image update exercise will cost BP more than $ 200 million over the next two years , with $ 7 million already spent on the initial consultation and logo design .
The doubling of expenditure on renewables is obviously to be welcomed , but Greenpeace were hard to please .
They said that it does little more than bring BP into line with Shell 's level of investment in green energy technology announced in 1997 " .
In addition , it still only meant that renewables would account for just 1 % of their total capital spend .
But oil and gas investment will increase by 40 % , resulting in 50 times more cash going to exploration and production of fossil fuels than to green energy ..
Greenpeace felt that in fact , the new marketing strategy had more to do with BP 's hopes of giving its service stations a higher profile as supermarkets , than any change in energy investments  .
For example , they say , speaking to market analysts , BP Chairmen Sir John Browne recently noted that , with 28,000 service stations , BP is a bigger retailer than McDonalds .
Oil “ may ” Enter Loop Current : Target - Florida Keys - Beaches - Beyond
I was stunned when I found this breaking news .
I lived in the lower Florida Keys for 20 years and am intimately familiar with its waterways and wildlife .
Unless you have been there you would have no real idea of the terrible devastation this will cause to that fragile ecosystem .
Here is the heartbreaking story from The Huffington Post :
Scientists say the Gulf oil spill could get into the what ’s called the Loop Current within a day , eventually carrying oil south along the Florida coast and into the Florida Keys .
Nick Shay , a physical oceanographer at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science , said Monday once the oil enters the Loop Current , it likely will end up in the Keys and continue east into the Gulf Stream .
Shay says the oil could affect Florida ’s beaches , coral reefs , fisheries and ecosystem within a week .
He described the Loop Current as similar to a “ conveyor belt , ” sweeping around the Gulf , through the Keys and right up the East Coast .
Shay says he cannot think of any scenario where the oil does n’t eventually reach the Florida Keys .
Here , thanks to Oso , is an even more thorough analysis of this crisis .
The State and the Energy Monopoly
An advanced society requires energy – in the form of fuel or electricity – to power the devices necessary to sustain it .
Politicians and capitalists would not ignore such an opportunity to exert tremendous influence over society , and their efforts to control the market in energy harm the environment and the economy for the rest of us .
Privilege
Benjamin tucker used the term “ monopoly ” to describe areas where government intervention allowed some people to monopolize critical economic functions .
As Charles Johnson writes [ 1 ]
Benjamin Tucker described “ four great areas where government intervention artificially created or encouraged ‘ class monopolies ’ – concentrating wealth and access to factors of production into the hands of a politically - select class insulated from competition , and prohibiting workers from organizing mutualistic alternatives . ”
He identified these as the Land Monopoly , the Money Monopoly , the Patent Monopoly , and the Tariff Monopoly .
Considering the common use of patents to monopolize sectors of economic activity , the patent monopoly ought to be examined here .
As Kevin Carson explains in Studies in Mutualist Political Economy :
The patent privilege has been used on a massive scale to promote concentration of capital , erect entry barriers , and maintain a monopoly of advanced technology in the hands of Western corporations …
Patents are also being used on a global scale to lock the transnational corporations into a permanent monopoly of productive technology …
Only one percent of patents worldwide are owned in the Third World .
Of patents granted in the 1970s by Third World Countries , 84 % were foreign - owned .
But fewer than 5 % of foreign patents were actually used in production .
As we saw before , the purpose of owning a patent is not necessarily to use it , but to prevent anyone else from using it . [ 2 ]
The company that owned the patents for nickel metal hydride battery technology , which could have been useful in developing better electric cars , was purchased by oil company Texaco in 2001 .
Texaco was later purchased by oil company Chevron , who owned the battery patents until 2009 . [ 3 ]
Whether or not this represents some petroleum executives ’ plot to kill the electric car [ 4 ] , it is certainly a case of using government privileges to monopolize the production of energy .
Nobody but Chevron was allowed to experiment with the technical information that Chevron owned during the time its subsidiary held the patents .
Chevron used a government privilege to insulate itself from competitive innovation .
There is certainly a demand for alternative energy vehicles .
After noting the difficulties that car companies placed in front of eager buyers , and the less - than - enthusiastic advertising for electric cars , reporter Matt Coker concludes :
“ No one wants electric cars ?
No one — except just about everyone who has given one a test drive ( including a certain guilty Caddy driver ) and got on a waiting list for one or is about to have one taken away from them . ” [ 5 ]
The excitement surrounding Tesla Motors ’ electric vehicles [ 6 ] would seem to bear this out .
So there existed a significant demand for electric vehicles that is still not being met , which should point to some kind of interference in the market .
Statist Oil
As Sheldon Richman notes [ 7 ] , petroleum “ has long been a top concern of the national policy elite , most particularly the foreign - policy establishment . ”
Influence over the substance that powers armies , industrial production , and the transportation of the workforce is an immense source of power .
Because the goals of politicians involve exercising power over events around the world , it is not surprising that they would want to have a hand in energy production .
It is widely acknowledged that oil was a major consideration in Axis offensives during the Second World War .
More recently , war profiteering by Haliburton and fighting in the Niger Delta have involved oil in a major way .
World conflicts could bring to mind Mad Max II , but with better equipped gangs .
If more electricity was produced using neighborhood generators or individually - owned solar arrays , it would significantly decentralize the production of energy , leaving less for politicians to preside over and compensate campaign contributors with .
What does the state offer oil companies ?
Only the state that can claim massive amounts of land by force , and cut deals with companies that rotate employees between corporate and government ranks .
Without the power of the globe - spanning offensive US military , it is unlikely that oil fields in Iraq could be secured .
Without the state , it is also less likely for a risky prospect like offshore drilling to be accepted by the neighbors of the proposed well – those whose source of production it could threaten .
And if they did accept it , they would have greater incentives to focus on safety than the government regulators and BP , neither of whom hold much accountability .
Because government , not local people own the environment , environmental regulations will be based on who has the most political pull , not on who is most immediately affected .
And those with the most political pull are those with the power and wealth to give politicians what they need . [ 8 ]
The concept of “ regulatory capture ” is important .
As Sheldon Richman writes in The Freeman :
Regulators and the industries they oversee develop mutually beneficial relationships that would appall those who idealize regulators as watchdogs .
The rules that emerge from those relationships tend to foster more monopolistic industries .
It took the Deepwater Horizon tragedy to bring out the fact that a single federal agency , the Minerals Management Service , is “ responsible for both policing the oil industry and acting as its partner in drilling activities , ” writes the New York Times .
“ Decades of law and custom have joined government and the oil industry in the pursuit of petroleum and profit .
The Minerals Management Service brings in an average of $ 13 billion a year . [ 9 ]
Lobbyists are another way that energy companies are linked to the state .
When industry representatives are consulted to write government policy , they obviously have their companies ’ interests in mind .
Liability caps socialize the risk that drilling companies would be held responsible for in the absence of government interference , raising incentives to engage in irresponsible activity .
A law passed in response to the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska [ which still harms the area ] makes BP responsible for cleanup costs .
But the law sets a $ 75 million limit on other kinds of damages .
Economic losses to the Gulf Coast are likely to exceed that . [ 10 ]
No wonder BP took shortcuts and ignored hazards . [ 11 ]
BP , the company responsible for spewing millions of gallons of oil into the ocean over the past month , has a noticeably statist history .
Looking at the well - cited historical segment of the Wikipedia article on BP , one finds a history of colonialists fighting nationalists for control of resources through covert operations , assassination , and the installation of puppet dictators [ 12 ] .
For many decades the British government held a majority share in BP until the Thatcher administration sold the government ’s shares [ 13 ] .
Competition
Government reduces diseconomies of scale and socializes costs .
This increases the difficulty for small production of new technologies to compete with large production .
As Benjamin Darrington notes in Government Created Economies of Scale and Capital Specificity :
An overriding theme of economic policy is the protection and furtherance of the interests of monopoly capitalist corporations .
The production techniques necessary to overcome the multiplicity of grave flaws inherent in gargantuan operations such as these would be uneconomical if not for the government ’s constant efforts to pay for them publicly , either by defraying the cost of developing and using of these technologies , or expanding the advantages of large firm organization so that it offsets the massive costs of using this flawed system .
The immense mass of privileges granted to the operations of the monopoly corporations generates non-market driven economies of scale and skews competition in the favor of bigger firms .
The capital developed for and , of necessity , employed by these firms has a strong tendency towards certain characteristics including a high degree of use specificity , and geographical concentration .
These features would prove a great liability to the companies that use them if it were not for the government ’s frequent actions to stabilize market conditions , soak up excess supply with public expenditures , and bailout insolvent corporations when what should be minor economic upheavals turns into catastrophic disaster under the brittle and inflexible capital structure of the corporatist economy . [ 14 ]
When government issues grants for alternative energy technology , money will likely go to big , established firms .
Sometimes the same companies that collect subsidies for fossil fuels will be the ones who are able to control new technologies through government privilege .
Freedom
An industry relying so much on government privilege , with links to government policy is really just another arm of political authority .
State control locks competition out of the economy , and those who want to share the controls are very willing to play along .
Undermining them requires innovation and a desire to decentralize or abolish power entirely .
A free economy containing strong , empowered demands for freedom and healthy environment will produce things that satisfy these demands .

Let 's talk about steak for a moment .
Was the last one you ate good ?
How about the one before that ?
Be honest .
The first bite , in all probability , was juicy and tender .
Not bad .
A brief hit of beefiness , enough to spur you on to bite No. 2 . But by bite No. 4 , there was a problem : grease .
The tongue gets entirely coated in it .
It is at this point that many hands reach for that terrible abomination called steak sauce .
It 's acidic and zingy and cuts through grease , but it blots out the weak flavor of the steak .
At ...
As one senior American intelligence official put it , “ You ’re not going to find the North Korean uranium project from these guys . ”
So the traditional methods of intelligence collection — using satellite imagery , phone and computer intercepts , and informants and agents of South Korea ’s intelligence service — remain the main sources of information .
Still , the Web sites appear to have inflicted damage .
North Korea ’s spy agencies , which almost never admit to weaknesses , recently warned that South Korea ’s “ plot to overthrow our system , employing all manners and means of spying , is spreading from the periphery of our territory and deeply inland . ”
They vowed retaliation , especially against “ human trash , ” an apparent reference to the North Koreans who have betrayed their leaders ’ code of silence out of principle or for pay to supplement their usually meager wages .
The informers ’ networks are part of broader changes in intelligence gathering rooted in the North ’s weaknesses .
The first breakthrough came in the 1990s , when famine stoked by a breakdown in the socialist rationing system drove defectors out of the country and into the arms of South Korean and American intelligence agencies .
The famine also led North Korea to allow traders to cross the border into China to bring home food , leaving them vulnerable to foreign agents , the news media and , most recently , the defectors and activists intent on forcing change in the North .
The first of their Web sites opened five years ago ; there are now five .
At least three of the sites receive some financing from the United States Congress through the National Endowment for Democracy .
The Web reports have been especially eye - opening for South Koreans , providing a rare glimpse of the aptly named Hermit Kingdom untainted by their own government ’s biases , whether the anti-Communists who present the North in the worst light or liberals who gloss over bad news for fear of jeopardizing chances at détente .
“ I take pride in my work , ” said Mun Seong - hwi , a defector turned Web journalist with the site Daily NK , who works with the informers and uses an alias to protect relatives he left behind .
“ I help the outside world see North Korea as it is . ”
Even in the days of the Iron Curtain , North Korea was one of the world ’s most closed societies .
There were few Western embassies where spies could pose as diplomats .
And with citizens deputized to watch one another for suspicious activities , strangers could not escape notice for long .
Pineberries and cream ?
The new summer fruit which looks like a white strawberry ... but tastes like a pineapple
Seeing their juicy red flesh in the shops is a sign that summer is on its way .
But this year your strawberries could be as white as the cream poured over them , after a new variety went on sale today .
The pineberry is said to combine the shape and texture of a strawberry with a flavour and smell closer to that of a pineapple .
Tasty ?
Pineberries may look like a blanched version of the strawberry but they taste very different
Grown in glasshouses , pineberries start off green , gradually turning paler as they ripen .
When the fruit is sweet and juicy enough to eat , the flesh is almost totally white but studded with red seeds - the reverse of the usual variety .
Discovered wild in South America and rescued from extinction by Dutch farmers , they can now be bought in Waitrose .
They are smaller than most commercially grown strawberries , measuring between 15 and 23 mm across - slightly less than an inch .
According to Waitrose , they can be used as an alternative to their red counterparts in a range of recipes and desserts .
Pineberries will be on sale for fiveweeks .
A 125g punnet will cost £ 2.99 until April 13 and then sell for £ 3.99 .
They join other unusual recently introduced fruits such as the strasberry , which looks like a cross between a strawberry and a raspberry .
Grown in glasshouses , the pineberry - as they have been dubbed for the British market - starts off green , gradually turning paler as it ripens .
When it is sweet and juicy enough to eat , the flesh is almost completely white but studded with red seeds .
Waitrose fruit buyer Nicki Baggott said : ' Pineberries offer our customers the chance to add a new fruit into their diet , and the berry 's bright appearance can add an unusual decoration to sweet dishes .
' As the summer unfolds we wo n't be surprised to hear that our customers are inviting their friends over for pineberry pavlovas or punch , or serving them up with yoghurt for a lighter alternative . '
All commercially grown strawberries originate from an 18th century European cross between wild varieties from North and South America which achieved the sought - after combination of sweet taste and large , juicy berries .
They quickly took over from the tiny , tart - tasting fruits now known as alpine strawberries which have been grown and enjoyed in European since before Roman times .
Imagine getting the same amount of garden produce using only 20 percent of the space you used to plant .
As added incentive , you ’ll also have healthier plants , fewer weeds and less physical strain when it comes time to reap what you ’ve sown .
That is the gospel according to Mel Bartholomew ; a grinning , gregarious man in a straw hat who wanted to revolutionize the way Americans grow vegetables .
He is , after all , the father of square - foot gardening , a method of planting brought into the national psyche 30 years ago and promoted on public television .
The biggest mistake people make , he says , is going overboard .
“ It ’s so easy to put more and more in , ” Bartholomew said in a recent interview from his home outside of Salt Lake City .
“ You get carried away . ”
Downsize
Rather than planting in conventional rows , Bartholomew wants you to downsize .
Start with a 4 - by - 4 - foot raised box filled with the perfect soil and assigned a grid pattern so each plant variety has its own square - foot section .
That may mean only one head of broccoli in one square and 32 radishes in another .
HOW TO Square - foot gardening Step 1 : Start with a 4 - by - 4 - foot area
Step 2 : Remove weeds from soil surface and level
Step 3 : Use 2 - by - 6 - inch boards plus hardware to join the ends together
Step 4 : Fill inside with 6 inches of soil , using equal parts of peat moss , coarse - grade vermiculite and blended compost .
Mix well and spread evenly .
Step 5 : Nail six lengths of wood strips — three east - west and three north - south — to delineate 16 square - foot planting areas .
•
The 4 - by - 4 - foot garden will allow for 16 plants ( vegetables , flowers and herbs ) , each in its own 1 - foot area .
• Use multiples of 1 , 4 , 9 and 16 ; depending on plant variety and fit per square foot .
Then , space them out .
• Start with staples : green onions , carrots and herbs .
What to plant
Here ’s an example of what you can harvest from one 4 - by - 4 - foot box in one spring season : • 1 head of broccoli
• 1 head of cauliflower
• 4 heads of romaine lettuce
• 4 heads of red lettuce
• 9 bush bean plants , placed 4 inches apart
• 16 carrots
• 32 radishes Grow plants vertically , using a trellis or netting .
Plants that can be grown this way on the outside squares include : • 1 summer squash
• 1 tomato
• 2 cucumbers
• 8 pole beans
The smaller area is easier to reach from the sides , and climbers — such as pole beans , cucumbers and tomatoes — grow up rather than out .
“ Growing our own groceries can be fun and money - saving , ” Bartholomew said .
“ And a little planning can keep excess vegetables from causing headaches for the cook and the neighbors . ”
Planting a garden — either the conventional way or the square - foot way — seems to be catching on , according to a recent survey by the National Gardening Association .
An additional 7 million families grew vegetables last year , up 19 percent from 2008 .
That number is expected to increase by 10 percent this year .
Hands - on training
As a civil engineer , Bartholomew oversaw installation of utilities — such as sewers , drains , electrical lines — on college campuses .
“ Everything that runs the place , ” he said .
After retiring in 1972 , the “ frustrated weekend gardener ” started tinkering with methodology of gardening , like having 25 - foot rows spaced 3 feet apart .
“ I asked the agriculture experts why you have to have 3 - foot spacing between rows , ” Bartholomew recalled .
“ They said so you can get between the rows and weed .
Wait a minute ; I do n’t want to weed . ”
The tradition of planting in rows , he concluded , is fine for commercial agriculture but not a backyard garden .
He planted a field on Long Island , N.Y. , using his square - foot method as part of the nation ’s bicentennial celebration in 1976 .
Five years later , his book , " Square Foot Gardening , " was published , and Bartholomew launched a show by the same name on public television .
The program ran five years and is the highest - rated PBS gardening show to date .
A second weekly show , “ The Square Foot Show , ” aired on Discovery Network .
He has met with pockets of resistance , mostly from makers of products that are n't required — or used a lot less — in square - foot gardening .
“ Some of the tool companies were reluctant to sponsor me because I came in with a wheelbarrow full of tools and asked the audience , ‘ You know how many tools you need ?
You do n’t need any of them , other than a little trowel . ’
That ended sponsorships , ” Bartholomew said .
No digging
“ Square Foot Gardening ” was revised in 2007 to make it less strenuous .
His first book advocated digging down 6 inches and adding another 6 inches of amended soil .
Now , you do n’t have to dig , just fill the 4 - by - 4 - foot frame with 6 inches of soil .
The “ soil ” is a mix of equal parts peat moss , coarse - grade vermiculite and blended compost .
“ How can you grow in soil only 4 to 6 inches deep ? ” he asks , rhetorically .
“ I experimented and found that every single plant — even tomatoes — grows in 6 inches of soil .
Roots roam looking for nutrients and water .
Put in the box , fill it with the perfect soil blend and get going . ”
The perfect soil blend , he notes , is packaged and sold in Utah under the name Mel ’s Mix .
He hopes to bring Mel ’s Mix to garden centers across the U.S.
In the meantime , people can make their own using bulk packages of peat moss , coarse grade vermiculite and blended compost .
His latest book , “ The All New Square Foot Gardening Cookbook , ” released this year , walks you through the gardening steps — from planting seeds to putting your harvest on the dinner table .
Do n’t worry ; it ’s not rocket science , he assures .
“ First of all , we deal with non-experts , mostly people who are afraid to start a garden or who started a garden and failed because weeds took over , and plants did n’t grow like they were supposed to , ” Bartholomew said .
“ This method also targets a generation too busy to garden or those who used to garden but are too old to lean over and do the work . ”
Proper planning
Building the square - foot garden frame need n’t be expensive , either .
Untreated lumber at least 6 inches wide , which costs about $ 6.50 at a hardware store , will do .
Once you have your box on level ground and the soil mix distributed , think about what your family eats .
Do n’t grow turnips if no one likes turnips .
Nor is it necessary to plant everything at once , consider the turn - around time between planting and harvest .
Cool - season vegetables , such as radishes and lettuce , can go in now .
Heat - loving crops , such as tomato and pepper , are best planted around Memorial Day weekend .
Also , do n’t underestimate the mature size of what you ’re planting , Bartholomew said .
“ Think about a mature zucchini plant , and how many zucchinis you were leaving on people ’s doorstep last summer because you planted too many . ”
“ Like gardening in general , a lot of trial and error goes into this planning , ” he said .
“ Eventually , you ’ll develop a personal planting guide with a flow chart from seed to table . ”
He likes to tell people to think like a chef .
“ Plan your vegetable garden from the dinner table backward , ” Bartholomew suggests .
“ That ’s the secret to more rewarding and economical gardening — planting things your family will actually eat . ”
Tips to grow your own vegetables
Think of the harvest when planting ; what will a mature plant look like and produce ?
• Plant according to harvest times .
Leaf lettuce takes 45 to 50 days to mature from seed and about a week to sprout .
• Take a salad bowl , scissors and bucket of water to the garden .
Clip spinach , lettuce , Swiss chard , radish , a few carrots and wash in the water .
Your salad is ready ,
• Take the kids to the grocery store and have them point out what fruits and vegetables they ’ll eat .
Plant what they like .
• Add flowers and ornamental plants for interest and variety .
• Plant close to house so you do n’t have to walk far .
• Select an area that gets 6 to 8 hours of sunshine daily .
• Stay clear of trees and shrubs where roots and shade interferes .
• The area should not puddle after a heavy rain .

May 16 , 2010 --
When the White House is quiet as protesters are butchered in the streets of Bangkok , suspicions are raised .
Silence often equals complicity .
One can only imagine what the US government 's response would be to a Venezuelan government slaughter : the US media and US President Barack Obama would loudly condemn such an act , in contrast to the muted response to Thailand 's bloodbath .
The history of US - Thailand relations explains why .
During the Vietnam War , the US used Thailand as one of the main “ anti-communist ” bulwarks in an area that included China , Vietnam and other countries that were challenging capitalism .
Thailand was thus transformed into a US client state and given money , guns and US government intelligence to battle Thailand ’s “ communists ” .
This relationship has equalled numerous
Thai dictatorships that have a very bloody history , including the shooting of untold numbers of protesters who the Thai government named “ communists ” or the modern equivalent , “ terrorists ” .
The US - Thailand relationship began to sour when the recently deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra formed a closer relationship with China that included economic and military deals .
The November 7 , 2008 , Asian Times summarises the consequences :
Thaksin 's willingness to promote defense ties with China came at the US 's direct strategic expense and many observers believe that 's one reason Washington 's reaction to the September 2006 military coup that ousted a democratically elected government was so muted .
The US government often overthrows “ unfriendly governments ” by bribing sections of their military , a fact discussed at length in Tim Weiner ’s history of the CIA , Legacy of Ashes .
When a US - backed coup happens , the US government and corporate media give tacit approval ; whereas a howl of fury erupts when a coup happens against a US puppet government .
The Asian Times confirms :
Many of the [ 2006 ] coup - makers were known U.S. allies , including alleged masterminds and former CIA - trained spy chief Prasong Soonsiri and Privy Council president Prem Tinsulanonda .
Prasong has openly acknowledged his role in the coup …
The coup against Thaksin is at the root of the current crisis in Thailand .
Large sections of the Thai working class and peasantry still identify Thaksin as their president and are demanding his return .
They have resorted to extremely militant tactics to achieve their demands , which , if won , would amount to the restoration of democracy in Thailand .
The May 15 , 2010 , New York Times adds :
Thailand is convulsed by a bitter struggle between the nation ’s elite and its disenfranchised poor , played out in protests that have paralyzed Bangkok for weeks and now threaten to expand .
President Obama has not said one word of support for Thailand 's poor , while his silence enables Thailand ’s elite to murder protesters in the streets free of foreign pressure .
The US is the main purchaser of Thailand ’s exports , while providing important economic and military assistance .
One strong statement from Obama would deter Thailand ’s elites from further killing .
But he will remain silent .
So far , dozens of protesters have been murdered .
But for Thailand ’s US - backed elite to successfully maintain their political dominance , hundreds if not thousands more will have to be slaughtered .
By working to maintain the Bush - era coup government in Thailand , President Obama bears criminal responsibility for the current atrocities .
If the Thai working class is unable to overthrow their murderous government , Obama will bear further blame for propping up a coup - government that must resort to prolonged , massive brutality to maintain its rule .
[ Shamus Cooke is a social service worker , trade unionist and writer for the US - based Workers Action , where this article first appeared . ]
I know I say it over and over , but it still remains true : our is due , in part , to how well we are able to regulate our own feelings .
And how well we regulate our own feelings affects our relationships .
And the solidity of our relationships affects our self esteem .
You can see there is one big cycle of influences .
With that in mind , I 'd like to pass along one of the breakthrough neurologic discoveries for enhancing inner calmness and .
And that discovery is the practice of purposeful deep yawning .
Do you think that when someone yawns they are bored or disinterested ?
Think again .
Andrew Newberg , M.D. and therapist Mark Robert Waldman write about the usefulness of yawning in How God changes Your Brain : Breakthrough Findings from a Leading Neuroscientist .
They even call yawning " one of the best kept secrets in neuroscience . '
The Theory
Yawning helps reduce , and .
It can be used for calmness when in a conflictual situation with another person , and helps with a difficult problem .
It has been used for decades for reducing performance anxiety .
Yawning enhances awareness , calmness , alertness and bodily relaxation .
In fact , it only takes a minute to relax you physiologically .
Newberg and Waldman discuss the various neurochemicals that are involved with yawning , noting that they " regulate pleasure , sensuality , and relationship between individuals , so if you want to enhance your and stay together , yawn together . "
How To Practice Deep Yawning
1 . Set aside a specific time to practice the yawning .
That trains the brain to get into a habit of deep relaxation , and studies show that the regularity produces the most benefits .
Setting an alarm clock can be helpful .
2 . Know that your brain will probably give you resistance .
That 's normal .
But do n't let the resistance rule .
3 . Stand up in a place where you are comfortable and wo n't be disturbed by others .
Standing gives you possibility of a fuller inhalation than sitting .
4 . Open you mouth as wide as you can and take a very deep breath .
As you exhale , make an extended sigh .
Keep doing it , even if you do n't feel like yawning .
Fake it .
Usually by the fifth or sixth fake yawn a real one appears .
5 . Notice what goes on in your mouth , eyes , throat , chest , and belly .
6 . Go for a dozen to fifteen yawns with a few seconds between each one .
All together , it can take around two minutes .
Discover for yourself what happens as you practice yawning .
Let me know the results you have .
Fairerweise muss man hier wohl mehrere Aspekte erwähnen .
Für den einen ist es die Zeit .
Wie bringe ich alles unter einen Hut ?
Familie , Beruf , Ehrenamt , Elternpflege , Gesundheit - und dann noch lernen ?
Wie soll das gehen ?
Für den anderen ist es das Geld .
Wie soll ich über Jahre jeden Monat hundert Euro extra aufbringen ?
Vielleicht bist
Du alleinerziehend mit drei Kindern ?
Vilelleicht arbeitslos und alleinerziehend ?
Vielleicht hast Du Schulden vpn früher ?
Oder musst Deine Eltern unterstützen ?
Und für wieder andere ist es der Stoff .
Ich will doch Naturheilkundler
In werden und nun muss ich Schulmedizin lernen - und das nicht zu knapp .
Vielleicht musstest
Du noch nie in Dienem Leben eine so große Menge Informationen abspeichern ?
Vielleicht ist Deine letzte Lernphase schon dreißig Jahre her ?
Ich möchte Dir deshalb zurufen : Egal , wovon
Du gerade herausgefordert bist .
Egal , was Dich gerade an Deine Grenze bringt : Erinnere Dich an den Grund , warum Du diesen
Weg gehst .
Wofür tust
Du es eigentlich ?
Und dann freue Dich , dass Du den
Mut hast , das zu tun .
Das Du trotz aller Schwierigkeiten dieser tiefen inneren Motivation erlaubst , sich zu zeigen .
Das ist wirklich edel und kostbar - ist zumindest meine Meinung .
Es bereichert die Welt , wenn Menschen wagen , Chancen zu ergreifen für tiefe gute Möglichkeiten .
Für viele ist die größte Herausforderung : Dran zu bleiben , weiter zu gehen , sich nicht aufhalten zu lassen .
Ganz ehrlich , dafür habt ihr alle ein Dankeschön verdient !
Dankeschön !

Image caption The IMF has also provided loans to Latvia and Hungary
Romania is to cut wages and pensions in the public sector later this year to comply with an IMF - led rescue deal .
Romanian President Traian Basescu said the " programme to cut public expenses was inevitable " .
Public sector wages will be cut by 25 % and all salaries , including the minimum one , will be affected .
Jobless benefits and pensions will be slashed by 15 % .
Romania is the recipient of a 20 bn - euro aid package from the IMF , the EU and the World Bank .
The country , as well as two other bailed - out states , Latvia and Hungary , have missed targets for cutting their deficits by significant margins .
' Fat man '
" This [ cuts ] plan was inevitable , " Mr Basescu told a news conference .
" The state sector is like a fat man of 200 kg sitting on the back of a 50 kg little man who is the real economy . "
He also said that as part of negotiations with the IMF the country had narrowly avoided an increase in VAT from 19 % to 24 % and a rise in the tax on profits and income to 20 % from 16 % .
Meanwhile , the IMF said on Thursday it would extend a mission in Romania for two more days .
The IMF has cut its forecast for Romania 's economic growth to 0.8 % for this year , after the economy contracted 7.1 % in 2009 .
Education , Organic Farming and Angels Exhibition Highlights Rudolf Steiner 's Influence on Modern Germany
The Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner is best known as the somewhat eccentric founder of anthroposophy , widely regarded as a wacky Christian splinter group .
But his ideas have had a profound impact on many aspects of modern German society , as a new exhibition shows .
Via Weasel Zippers , a clip that ’s destined to be viral by tomorrow morning .
Even so , go easy on him .
Yes , he was an Iraq defeatist , and granted , he demagogued Joe Wilson ’s outburst in the scummiest way imaginable , but he ’s also a guy with a serious illness that affects his mind ( “ he regularly gets lost in thought in the middle of a discussion ” ) .
Although if that ’s what ’s going on here , a polite question for Madam Speaker arises :
What ’s he doing at these hearings instead of resting ?
You may also remember Johnson as the man who beat Cynthia McKinney in the 2006 primary .
All things considered , I think I still prefer him to her .

24 Themis is one of the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt , and researchers recently discovered that it 's entirely coated in a thin layer of ice .
It may be a remnant of the frozen space rocks that created Earth 's oceans .

Last week , two articles in Nature described the discovery of water ice on 24 Themis .
Using an infrared telescope , an international team of researchers analyzed the spectrum of light reflected off the asteroid 's surface .
The pattern of light absorption and reflection was characteristic of frost combined with various minerals on the asteroid 's surface .
Scientists have speculated that asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter might contain water ice , which would be a boon to space colonists who need to stock up on water on their way to the outer planets .
It 's also likely that this frosty asteroid will provide a key to how the Earth 's oceans formed on what started as a dry dirtball .
Asteroids like 24 Themis crashed to Earth , bringing water with them .

24 Themis is part of a " family " of asteroids that were originally part of the same body but were shattered by an impact about a billion years ago .
Above you can see an artist 's conception of the asteroid along with two small fragments of its family .
You can see that one of the fragments has a comet - like tail , which scientists speculate is caused when water evaporates from its surface .

A freewheeling flock of birds is one of nature ’s most endearing spectacles .
The flock ’s members move with uncanny coordination , changing direction in unison , splitting and reforming , and even landing as one .
The intricacies of these synchronised flights are very difficult to entangle .
Who is following whom ?
Is there even a leader and , if so , does the same bird always take up pole position ?
Our feeble eyes could never hope to discern the answers just by watching a flying flock .
But fortunately , we have technology that can do the job for us .
, Budapest , has found that flying pigeons obey strict chains of command , even when in flight .
He used state - of - the - art GPS devices to track the movements of groups of ten pigeons with exquisite sensitivity .
The lightweight monitors , just 16g in weight , captured the subtleties of the pigeons ’ twists and turns in mere fractions of a second .
Back on the ground , Nagy analysed their recordings to show that pigeons fly according to the pecking orders they establish on the ground .
The dominant bird takes the lead and the others follow his directions .
Studying the collective movements of animal groups has been a difficult challenge .
Many cameras can be used to film animals moving within the same block of space , but the jostling bodies often block one another from view .
Mathematical models can tell us about the basic rules that groups of moving animals adhere to , but they are difficult to test in real life .
But our technology has now become advanced enough to start skirting around these problems .
For scientists studying birds , the key breakthrough was the creation of sensors that are light enough to be strapped to a flying bird without compromising its aerial abilities .
Now , these sensors include GPS devices that can record a bird ’s speed and direction every fifth of a second .
Nagy attached such devices to 13 homing pigeons and watched as they flew in flocks of 7 to 11 birds .
Máté Nagy from the University of Eötvös
Nagy catalogued every instance when one pigeon changed direction only to be followed by another .
By pooling together this data , he created a network of leaders and followers , showing the relationship of each bird to its peers .
This colourful diagram shows one such network .
Each circle represents an individual pigeon , the arrows point from a leading bird to one that follows it , and the numbers represent the time delay between the leader ’s movements and those of its follower ’s .
The networks showed that flocking pigeons maintain a dependable hierarchy on the wing .
On average , when a leading bird changed direction , its followers would follow suit after around a third of a second .
Birds will consistently copy the movements of specific individuals further up the pecking order and , in turn , they are consistently copied by more junior underlings .
What makes a leading pigeon ?
It seems that skill counts for something .
Nagy released each of his birds on a solo flight , some distance from home .
When they returned , he found that those who arrived home quickest were also most likely to wield leadership authority , although this link between navigation ability and seniority was n’t quite statistically significant .
Indeed , the chains of seniority within pigeon flocks are fairly flexible , changing dynamically from flight to flight .
Influential birds tend to remain influential but Tamas Vicsek , who led the study , says , “ There are days when the pigeon which takes the role most of the time is less active .
Perhaps it did not have a good sleep !
During these days some of the birds on lower levels of the hierarchy have their chance to lead . ”
Nagy ’s data also revealed that leaders do indeed take up pole position at the front of the flock .
That may seem intuitively obvious to us , but remember that pigeons have a field of vision that extends for almost a full 360 degrees .
When you can easily see individuals flying behind you , the leading bird does n’t necessarily need to be at the front , and yet it does .
More surprisingly , leaders also tend to stay on the left of the flock .
Nagy found that the more time that a bird spent behind a leading partner , the more likely it was to be flying on that partner ’s right .
There ’s an obvious reason for this – like us , pigeons have highly asymmetric brains with each half wielding greater influence over certain thought processes .
Their right brain , which receives signals from the left eye , controls the ability to recognise other pigeons .
So if a pigeon sees one of its peers through its left eye , rather than its right , it responds more quickly or more strongly .

Greens senator Scott Ludlam has delivered a blunt rejoinder to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy ’s statement this week that Australians would stand up against a future broadening scope of the internet filtering project , saying : “ We are standing up ” .
In an interview with ABC television show 4 Corners broadcast on Monday night , Conroy had said Australians should stand up and say ‘ just a minute ’ if future Parliaments wanted to broaden the filter ’s scope beyond Refused Classification material .
“ I ’ll be one of them , ” he said .
“ The time for Australians to stand up is right now , and we are standing up , ” Ludlam , who has been a strident opponent of the filter , said in the Senate this afternoon , adding that the Greens would definitely vote against the filter legislation when it was introduced .
Ludlam said in response to Australia “ standing up ” against the filter over the past several years , Conroy has spent that time “ vilifying anybody who criticised the proposal — including digital rights organisation Electronic Frontiers Australia , Google and Reporters without Borders .
“ And every time the government shoots the messenger , more messengers arise , ” he said .
Ludlam said — although he has long been a critic of the filter — that he had held back from declaring the Greens ’ voting intentions on the filter issue in “ the faint hope ” that when the legislation arrived , Conroy might have accommodated some of the concerns put to him by those against the project .
“ But , on the back of the Four Corners piece the other night , it is pretty obvious that this is a false hope .
So let me remove that ambiguity once and for all .
If the government presents its mandatory internet censorship scheme to the parliament in the form that the minister has been describing to us , the Australian Greens will vote against it , ” he said .
According to Ludlam , the filter proposal should not be judged against the scope of the current blacklist of banned sites administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , but against what future governments would do with the technology .
“ The installation of a physical choke point on every internet service provider in the country , filtering against a growing secret list of material , ranging from illegal to unwanted , establishes hard - wired censorship architecture , which future governments will almost certainly be unwilling to dismantle , ” he said .
The senator also reiterated a number of other points that he had previously claimed about the filter — that it would not do anything to protect children online and that it was technically unworkable .
Instead of pursuing a mandatory filter , Ludlam said , the Greens is proposing a three - fold strategy to tackle objectionable content online — education , law enforcement and tailored , optional filtering solutions .
His full speech is available online .

I thought that I knew how to create my own business website design , but I quickly found out that I had no clue whatsoever .
The design looked okay enough , but I knew that it was missing that spark or energy that other websites have .
I did not want to copy another site ’s design , but I did not know how to come up with something on my own either .
I also was not getting any traffic to my site .
I knew that I needed to look into getting some ecommerce web design professional help , so I went to my favorite search engine to begin what I thought would be a long process .
With the keywords that I entered , I actually found the website design company that I wanted to use rather quickly .
That was the kind of results I had hoped for .
I wanted someone to put in the keywords that describe my business and have my online company be at the top of the search engine results .
I had no clue on how to make that happen on my own .
I read a good bit on this company ’s website , and I knew rather quickly that they were the search engine optimization experts that could make it happen .
I showed them what I had already , and they used that for the foundation of my website .
I was happy that they did not scrap it altogether , because I really did like what I had .
It just needed some pizzazz added to it along with some technical things that I was absolutely clueless on how to even incorporate them .
The finished product was finished before I expected it to be , and the finished result was better than I ever could have imagined .
Not only did the site look much better , but I quickly started getting traffic to it once it went live .

Climatic change will increase water stress in many places , the report says
The amount of water used to produce food and goods imported by developed countries is worsening water shortages in the developing world , a report says .
The report , focusing on the UK , says two - thirds of the water used to make UK imports is used outside its borders .
The Engineering the Future alliance of professional engineering bodies says this is unsustainable , given population growth and climate change .
It says countries such as the UK must help poorer nations curb water use .
" We must take account of how our water footprint is impacting on the rest of the world , " said Professor Roger Falconer , director of the Hydro - Environmental Research Centre at Cardiff University and a member of the report 's steering committee .
If the water crisis becomes critical , it will pose a serious threat to the UK 's future development
Professor Peter Guthrie
" If we are to prevent the ' perfect storm ' , urgent action is necessary . "
The term perfect storm was used last year by the UK government 's chief scientist , Professor John Beddington , to describe future shortages of energy , food and water .
Forecasts suggest that when the world 's population soars beyond 8bn in 20 years time , the global demand for food and energy will jump by 50 % , with the need for fresh water rising by 30 % .
But developing countries are already using significant proportions of their water to grow food and produce goods for consumption in the West , the report says .
" The burgeoning demand from developed countries is putting severe pressure on areas that are already short of water , " said Professor Peter Guthrie , head of the Centre for Sustainable Development at Cambridge University , who chaired the steering group .

" If the water crisis becomes critical , it will pose a serious threat to the UK 's future development because of the impact it would have on our access to vital resources . "
Key to the report is the concept of " embedded water " - the water used to grow food and make things .
Embedded in a pint of beer , for example , is about 130 pints ( 74 litres ) of water - the total amount needed to grow the ingredients and run all the processes that make the pint of beer .
A cup of coffee embeds about 140 litres ( 246 pints ) of water , a cotton T - shirt about 2,000 litres , and a kilogram of steak 15,000 litres .
EMBEDDED WATER
Item Litres per unit Size of unit Litres per kg Sheet of paper 10 A4 sheet of 80gsm 2000 Cup of tea 30 250 ml 2400 Apple 70 100g 700 Cup of coffee 140 125 ml 21,000 Bottle of beer 150 500 ml 300 Slice of bread 440 400g 1100 Chicken fillet 683 175g 3900 Packet of sugar 1500 1kg 1500 Chunk of cheese 2500 500g 5000 Packet of rice 3400 1kg 3400 Beef steak 3875 250g 15,500 Pair of jeans
10,850 1kg 10,850 Using this methodology , UK consumers see only about 3 % of the water usage they are responsible for .
The average UK consumer uses about 150 litres per day , the size of a large bath .
Ten times as much is embedded in the British - made goods bought by the average UK consumer ; but that represents only about one - third of the total water embedded in all the average consumer 's food and goods , with the remainder coming from imports .
The UK is not unique in this - the same pattern is seen in most developed countries .
FUTURE WATER STRESS
Interactive map : Rising water stress in a changing world
The engineering institutions say it means nations such as the UK have a duty to help curb water use in the developing world , where about one billion people already do not have sufficient access to clean drinking water .
UK - funded aid projects should have water conservation as a central tenet , the report recommends , while companies should examine their supply chains and reduce the water used in them .
This could lead to difficult questions being asked , such as whether it is right for the UK to import beans and flowers from water - stressed countries such as Kenya .
While growing crops such as these uses water , selling them brings foreign exchange into poor nations .
In the West , the report suggests , concerns over water could eventually lead to goods carrying a label denoting their embedded water content , in the same way as electrical goods now sport information about their energy consumption .
The Engineering the Future alliance includes the Institution of Civil Engineers ( ICE ) , the Royal Academy of Engineering ( RAE ) and the Chartered Institute of Water and Environmental Management ( CIWEM ) .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Stars do n't exactly ease into retirement , and for some stellar objects , the twilight years just got more complicated .
How a star spends its final days depends on its mass .
After burning through their supply of nuclear fuel , smaller stars collapse into extremely dense neutron stars .
Scientists believe more massive stars implode into black holes — regions of space where the force of gravity created by the collapsing star is so strong that not even light can escape its pull .
But a group of physicists say there may be another stage in the life of massive stars before being snuffed out by total collapse into black hole .
Stars could burn for millions of years as electroweak stars , according to Glenn Starkman , a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University .
Starkman , together with former graduate and post - doctoral students , describe the electroweak star in a paper submitted to Physical Review Letters .
Starkman and his team theorize that at the extreme temperatures and densities reached during stellar collapse could give rise to the electroweak phase of a star 's life .
Ordinary stars are powered by the fusion of light nuclei into heavier ones — such as hydrogen into helium in the center of our sun .
Electroweak stars would be powered by the total conversion of quarks — particles that make up the building blocks of those nuclei — into much lighter particles called leptons .
The energy created by the conversion could halt the implosion of the dying star , granting it something of a celestial reprieve before total collapse into a black hole .
In fact , if the electroweak burning is efficient , it could consume enough mass to prevent what 's left from ever becoming a black hole .
Most of the energy eventually emitted from electroweak stars is in the form of neutrinos , which are nearly without mass and hard to detect .
A small fraction comes out as light , which is where the electroweak star 's signature will likely be found , says Starkman .
" But to understand that small fraction , we have to understand the star better than we do , " he says .
And until scientists know more , it 's hard to tell electroweak stars from other stars .
Generations of scientists have plenty of time to learn though .
Starkman 's group calculates that this phase of a star 's life can last more than 10 million years — a long time for us , but just an instant in the life of a star .

Sarah Ferguson at a charity dinner in Los Angeles
By Peter Jackson
BBC News Magazine
A tabloid sting has highlighted the Duchess of York 's difficulty with funding a lavish lifestyle on low earnings .
Is it worse to have had money and lost it than never to have had it at all ?
With her penchant for first - class air travel and lavish gifts , not to mention failed business ventures , Sarah Ferguson is by her own admission almost penniless .
As she was filmed offering a reporter access to her ex-husband , the Duke of York , for cash , she revealed as much in blunt language .
The duchess blamed her divorce settlement , which grants her £ 15,000 a year .
However , that 's a sum many people of more modest tastes manage to live on .
Others point to her unbridled outgoings .
Indeed , the duchess herself once referred to her " overspending disease " .
Glamour girl Hedy Lamarr frittered away millions on her lavish lifestyle Even as the royal household sought to limit the damage from the News of the World scandal at the weekend , the 50 - year - old jetted off to Cannes for model Naomi Campbell 's 40th birthday .
It 's not the sort of occasion that would be synonymous with a low - cost lifestyle .
Low income and poverty are the normal triggers for debt , but for those who had money then lost it , it can be reckless spending caused by pride or low self esteem .
The Duchess of York 's royal credentials make her situation rare , but she 's not the first high - profile figure to live beyond their means .
Despite a sizeable income , the extravagant lifestyle of the 17th Century Lord Chancellor , Sir Francis Bacon , landed him in a debtors ' prison in the Tower of London .
' Humiliation ' Hedy Lamarr made millions as a glamorous Hollywood actress in the 1940s , but lavish spending on the best homes , finest furnishings and travel left her spectacularly broke by the mid 1960s .
More recently , boxing champ Mike Tyson famously amassed a $ 300 m ( £ 207 m ) fortune , only to file for bankruptcy due to out - of - control spending and bad financial advice .
I 'd go out and buy whatever I wanted , I really did n't have to think about it
Sue Stone Businesswoman turned personal coach Sue Stone knows what it 's like to have had it all and lost it .
As a child growing up in an exclusive part of Dorset she wanted for nothing .
Her father , a successful lawyer , had a private plane , a yacht and horses and she enjoyed a " very privileged upbringing " .
That life continued when she amassed a small fortune in business with her husband , manufacturing licensed products for children .
" We made so much money we were drinking champagne all the time , going on skiing holidays , holidays abroad and going out for dinner , " the 49 - year - old recalls .
" I 'd go out and buy whatever I wanted , I really did n't have to think about it .
" We spent it when we should n't have done , spending rather than putting it aside for a rainy day . "
For richer for poorer : Sue Stone on a carriage at her grand wedding
By the late 1990s the business was growing too fast , they failed to sustain the turnover needed to break even and the debts piled up .
" To begin with you think it 's just a short blip , we had easy access to credit cards and we did n't think it would go on .
For a while I continued to spend , " she says .
But then the lines of credit dried up , her marriage broke down , and she was left with debts of £ 250,000 , a home about to be repossessed , and three young children to support .
" I remember thinking ' what am I going to do ' ?
I had £ 10 left in my purse , it was terrifying , " she says .
" I put £ 5 of petrol in the car , bought the children some sausages and potatoes and a cheap bottle of wine for me to numb the pain .
I could n't believe how life had come to this . "
At that point , despite the " humiliation " , Sue says she had no choice but to put pride aside , stop spending and accept her predicament .
She went on to turn her life around , writing a book - Love Life , Live Life - about her experiences and now works as a personal coach , business mentor and motivational speaker .
DUCHESS'S TROUBLED FINANCES
Settled three outstanding bills in September after creditors cited unpaid accounts worth £ 21,539 US company Hartmoor - in which she had 51 % stake - folded last year with $ 1 m ( £ 630,000 ) debts Faces High Court battle with law firm Davenport Lyons , which is seeking £ 200,000 in unpaid bills Psychotherapist Benjamin Fry , who co-presents BBC Three 's Spendaholics programme , says giving up a lavish lifestyle can make for a very traumatic sense of loss .
" It 's the change in circumstances that 's difficult Fergie [ The Duchess of York ] was caught in between failing her own moral code and adapting her own external ego , " he says .
" She could have accepted she was poor but would n't know who she was .
The alternative was to do something I 'm sure she did n't really want to do .
He says people can become attached to money like a drug , with the most insecure needing the most .
" If you were to force an addict to stop taking drugs , it can be very difficult .
The way to cope is to try really hard to invest in non-material sources of wealth - family , relationships , community or self care . "
He adds : " People do overspend because they 've got a low sense of self worth .
If you feel very small on the inside and present yourself as very big on the outside , it 's compensation . "
Clare Francis , editor of price comparison website Moneysupermarket , says people who splurge money like water have to know when to turn the tap off .
" Some can have a big splurge then come back down to earth and still be sensible , others will just carry on spending , " she says .
When the money dries up , it can leave some " very vulnerable " , as they rack up debts on credit cards and build up problems for later , she adds .
The Duchess of York has suffered repeated financial troubles ever since she and the Duke parted in 1992 and divorced four years later .
As she prepares to meet her ex-husband to discuss the latest twist , she may well wonder whether it 's better to have enjoyed and lost great riches or never to have had them at all .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I am not in the same class as the Duchess , but I have experienced what it is like to be well - off then poor .
Fortunately I was able to climb back from the depths and make lots of money again , and now am able to look at the whole situation philosophically .
Because of ill - health I have not worked for a year but we got by with careful management of what money we had .
Now I am about to go back into the market and earn good money again but I now know that it can go as easily as it comes , so I pack as much as I can into my pension fund .
We live well but not extravagantly .
I drive a 5 year - old car and we shop at supermarkets , but we allow ourselves some treats .
Life would be dull without them .
Roy Brookes , Hamburg , Germany I 've taken a voluntary cut in income to spend more time with my family and my allotment .
It was scary , but incredibly empowering .
And we have enough money for the things that really matter , like an ice - cream for the kids after a walk by the river .
Oscar Franklin , London , UK I do n't see how the Duchess of York can say she is poor .
She gets £ 15 k a year regardless of what she does .
I understand that when she chooses to do some public speaking she is paid more per event than I earn in a year as a criminal defence solicitor .
If she really has no money it is because she chooses not to work .
Nick , London , UK
There is another twist - those who spend a lifetime on modest means and become rich .
It can lead to financial bulimia .
Best follow Robinson Crusoe 's father 's advice - have enough to pay your bills and put enough aside for a rainy day .

It 's worth noting , though , that Edwards had already suspended his campaign — due in part to the love - child scandal , but still — and endorsed Obama by the time Hitchen corralled him in Beverly Hills .
All the stories Levine submitted to the Pulitzer board — based though they may have been on oldfashioned shoe - leather reporting — were published after Obama was elected .
Levine insists that Obama was considering Edwards for attorney general up until the Hunter scandal broke , but it 's still hard to argue that the Enquirer 's scoops helped the American public to dodge a bullet of any kind .
One thing Levine knows is that these stories touched a nerve .
As the Edwards scoops rolled out , he says , " I received phone calls every day from people all across America — Middle America , small towns .
The lady who 's the treasurer is effing the mayor .
The police chief is looting drugs and selling them .
I said to these people , ' I appreciate you calling , but this is the National Enquirer .
Tell your local newspaper . ' "
For what it 's worth , it was also the Globe that reported , in its February 8 , 2010 , issue , that in 2009 the president and the first lady " blew $ 10 MILLION of YOUR money " on drunken White House parties , including a shindig at which guests " wildly gyrated to the sounds of the RB group Earth Wind and Fire in the dignified East Room — and right under a portrait of George and Martha Washington , " who were presumably disgusted .
FESS PARKER MARKED FOR DEATH
Edwards was the first major story the Enquirer broke online .
" We 're the last of the Mohicans in terms of discovering our Web site , " Levine says .
They caught Edwards at the Beverly Hilton after that week 's paper locked ; worried that Edwards would attempt to spin the story before next week 's edition , they posted the story on the Web site on Tuesday morning .
The Enquirer 's full - time Web staff consists of one guy .
Dick Siegel is in his fifties , works out of a cubicle decorated with color rod comic - book covers from the ' 60s ; the fact that he's an obvious pop-culture junkie ( " I was able to write Fess Parker 's obit , or 90 percent of it , off the top of my head , which is scary " ) makes him the ideal man to run the Enquirer 's Web site , where Old Hollywood types — Natalie Wood , Ingrid Bergman — tend to get more hits than Justin Bieber and the Jersey Shore kids .
( By way of illustration , he pulls up a recent blog post , sourced to Carrie Fisher 's Twitter , about speed fiend eddie fisher . )
" My forte is not journalism , " Siegel says .
" I 'd be fired .
I had been working at the late , lamented Weekly World News .
That was after my film jobs —
I 'd been an independent - film cinematographer .
Really bad horror movies .
Including one that I wrote , about zombies at a women 's prison . "
He tells me that the Weekly World News gig was good training for what he does now .
You learned to write short stories , in AP style , even if they concerned the travails of Bat Boy , " and present them in a serious manner , even if the punch line was a joke . "
But it makes sense that someone with Siegel 's background wound up at the Enquirer .
The tabs are a form of rogue pop culture .
They 're vehicles for celebrity adoration , but they burrow , termitelike , into the sanctioned narratives of American fame .
They 're camp — a form of fantasy that revels and resists .
They 're a comic - book , zombie - movie draft of Hollywood history , right down to the zingy sobriquets .
" It 's like professional wrestling , " Siegel says .
" When we wrote about Tiger Woods 's wife , we always described her as ' livid , ' so now she 's always ' livid Elin . '
And Rielle Hunter is ' the New - Age Temptress . ' "
Heroes and villains , in primary colors .
" That 's what separates the giant scandals from the everyday scandals , " Levine says , explaining to me why Tiger Woods and Edwards , stepping out on his cancer - stricken wife , were tabloid rocket fuel .
" If somebody is a hero and they do something unthinkable , something unconscionable , if the betrayal is so overwhelmingly dirty and sickening , that 's what makes what we do . "
At the same time , Levine says , the tabloids ' coverage of famous people at their most abject — their most bloated or drunk or cheatedon or close to death — offers readers a kind of reassurance .
" One of the formulas of the National Enquirer , " he says , " is showing mainstream Americans that the people they admire have the same problems they do .
Bad marriages , it could be money issues , health issues , alcoholism , weight issues . "
That 's a stock explanation , of course ; Levine 's basically paraphrasing Aaron Spelling 's definition of gossip : " rich people having problems money can't solve . "
I 'm not sure either of them is entirely right .
If ( as we 're constantly told ) we live in such a cynical age , why is it such surprising - and - therefore - compelling news that ( for example ) Sandra Bullock 's husband , this TV - hack grease monkey , turned out to be the kind of guy who'd seek out Nazi - fetish models to allegedly break his marriage vows with ?
Are there really still " mainstream Americans " who view famous people — or politicians — as their moral betters ?
Maybe tabloids do n't exist to disabuse us of our innocence regarding the personalities they cover .
Maybe , by presenting obvious - inretrospect news — famous people , like all people , drink too much , do drugs , cheat , and die alone — as " shocking , " they give us a little bit of our innocence back , allowing us , the cynical readers numbed by a cynical age , to feel shocked ( even though we 're not ) the way horror movies ( in which the zombies do n't pose any actual threat ) let us feel scared .
CONTAMINATED HAMBURGER
Just before 3 p.m. , everybody gathers in Levine 's office waiting for word .
" We 're the people 's champion , " Levine says , " so it does n't matter . "
But there 's still an anticipatory buzz — at least for a few seconds , until Levine 's assistant , Patricia Gonzalez , comes in with a printout .
The Enquirer has n't won anything .
The Pulitzers for investigative reporting go to the Web site ProPublica , for a story about a hospital euthanizing patients after Hurricane Katrina , and the Philadelphia Daily News , for a series on corrupt cops .
People trickle back to their desks ;
Levine reads from the list of finalists .
" In investigative reporting , Sarasota Herald - Tribune , for reporting and computer analysis that unraveled $ 10 billion in suspicious Florida real estate transactions .
And members of the New York Times staff , for their reporting on contaminated hamburger and other food - safety issues . "
Levine does some phone interviews , mentions Pulitzer and Hearst , mentions Spitzer .
" I think that [ the Times 's ] reporting on Spitzer , while it was great reporting , was a drop in the bucket compared to the effort that we had to go through , " he says , " particularly being the Enquirer .
Because unlike The Times , we have very little access to the people involved .
We 're outsiders ; we 're rebels . "
I ask Levine , How do you compete with contaminated hamburger ?
" It 's all good journalism , " he says , " but you have to wonder if these editors did not have some built - in bias against the Enquirer because we 're a supermarket tabloid . "

AFP reports :
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Friday called for an immediate end to Israel ’s Gaza blockade , as an aid flotilla prepared to set sail for the enclave despite the embargo .
“ The continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive , ” she said in a statement .
“ We would like to reiterate the EU ’s call for an immediate , sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid , commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza . ”
In spite of this appeal , the government of Cyprus has taken the extraordinary step of preventing members of the European parliament from joining the Freedom Flotilla .
The Cyprus Mail reported today :
Cypriot authorities prevented pro-Palestinian activists , including 30 MPs from nine European countries , from leaving the island yesterday to join a flotilla in international waters , which is on its way to blockaded Gaza .
In addition to issuing an edict banning ships headed for Gaza to set sail from the island ’s ports , or dock on the island on their way back , the authorities yesterday forbade any small vessels from leaving Cyprus in case they were on their way to the flotilla of eight ships carrying around 700 peace activists , and 10,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid .
The government denied it bowed to pressure from Israel to put the ban in place .
The European Union guarantees the right of freedom of movement of its citizens within the territory of its member states .
Cyprus has been a member of the EU since 2004 .
A Tweet @freegazaorg said at about 11 AM Eastern :
Twenty have left from Famaghusta , [ Turkish controlled ] Northern Cyprus , four German MPs , one Swedish MP , all the passengers from Challenger 1 .
Hedy [ Epstein ] not going .
Meanwhile , Haaretz reports :
The Hamas leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh said Saturday that if Israel behaved like pirates and attacked the international Freedom Flotilla carrying 10,000 tons of aid meant for Gaza , then the Palestinians will have won .
“ The flotilla ’s message is clear and it will reach the entire world , ” Haniyeh said Saturday morning during a press conference held at the Gaza port where the ships were expected to dock .
“ The meaning of the flotilla is that the entire world opposes the siege on the Gaza Strip , and if Israel behaves like pirates and sea-terrorists – we will win , ” he added .

APRIL 8-- In a police report that reads as if it was written for the Howard Stern show , an Oklahoma man who enjoys ' the sound and smell of farts ' has told cops that he was sexually assaulted by a man he met online .
As detailed in this Oklahoma City Police Department report , the men met in a chat room in February and subsequently exchanged a series of sexually charged text messages .
The 27 - year - old victim , who cops report has autism , told investigators that he was lonely and was seeking to ' make friends that had the same fetish for ' farts . ''
However , when the pair met ten days ago , the victim claims that he was forced to engage in a variety of sexual acts while in the suspect 's bedroom .
The encounter ended , the victim said , when the man told him , ' My mom is going to get up and go to work soon , so you need to go . '
Police , who redacted the names of both men from the crime report , have not made an arrest in connection with the alleged incident .
Asked why he still met with the suspect after receiving the lewd text messages ' if he did not want to do any of it , ' the victim answered that he ' thought they could just ' fart ' and be friends . ' ( 3 pages )
Para muchos , la energía nuclear sigue siendo algo diabólico y execrable .
Se le condena por los desechos radiactivos que produce , por sus supuestos riesgos , y por su costo .
Sin embargo , la energía nuclear es una alternativa indispensable para combatir el calentamiento global , para un sector energético con cero emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y cero contaminación , y para una economía en pleno crecimiento que depende cada día más de un suministro de electricidad limpia , confiable , estable y a gran escala .
Las plantas nucleares generan electricidad de carga básica con un muy alto factor de capacidad y confiabilidad , es decir , funcionan alrededor de 93 % del tiempo ( tenemos en México el ejemplo de Laguna Verde ) , mucho más que las plantas hidroeléctricas , eólicas , solares , y de gas natural .
La disposición adecuada y segura de residuos nucleares es más bien un problema político ; no técnico o ambiental .
En Estados Unidos los residuos de las plantas nucleares son almacenados transitoriamente in situ en ataúdes de acero y concreto , y más de 90 % puede ser reciclado ampliando su vida útil virtualmente durante siglos .
Por otro lado , en Carlsbad , Nuevo México , existe una gran instalación de disposición final y aislamiento de materiales transuránicos que podría acoger residuos nucleares en forma segura durante miles de años debajo de una capa geológica de sal de más de 2,000 metros de espesor .
Esta formación geológica abarca varios millones de hectáreas , incluso en territorio mexicano .
Finlandia construye en la actualidad un depósito de residuos nucleares dentro de un estrato geológico de granito de más 400 metros de espesor debajo de una isla en el Mar Báltico .
Se han registrado sólo tres accidentes nucleares significativos en el mundo .
El primero , en Three Mile Island en 1979 , implicó el derretimiento del reactor .
Fue un desastre para la empresa , pero no conllevó ninguna exposición significativa de la población circundante a niveles de radiación superiores a los normales , ni tampoco , afectaciones a la salud .
El segundo , en Chernobyl en 1986 , fue el peor accidente nuclear de la historia , en gran medida provocado por la impericia e irresponsabilidad de los operadores .
Causó la explosión y destrucción de un reactor moderado con grafito y enfriado con agua ( tecnología soviética en desuso ) .
Murieron 29 trabajadores y rescatistas .
En años posteriores la UNSCEAR ( Organismo Científico de Naciones Unidas sobre Efectos de Radiación Atómica ) no ha identificado consecuencias graves a largo plazo en la salud de la población expuesta , además de 6,500 casos de cáncer tiroideo en niños y adolescentes que bebieron leche contaminada con iodo radiactivo .
Sólo se han documentado 15 muertes en consecuencia , en Ucrania , Bielorrusia y Rusia .
Los niveles de radiación recibidos por la población en general tampoco fueron significativamente superiores a lo normal .
La zona evacuada en el entorno de Chernobyl se ha convertido en un caso excepcional de restauración ecológica .
( Ver el documental en YouTube Radioactive Wolves ) .
El tercero fue Fukushima en el 2011 , donde un tsunami provocó el derretimiento y explosión de los reactores .
No obstante , no se registró ni una sola muerte ni afectaciones a la salud atribuibles a radiación .
( Por cierto , las plantas de carbón liberan más material radiactivo al ambiente que las plantas nucleares , dado que este mineral contiene importantes concentraciones de uranio en forma de triuranio octóxido ) .
En lo agregado , la generación de electricidad nuclear provoca muchas menos muertes y afectaciones a la salud por cantidad de energía producida que las plantas de carbón , gas , e hidroeléctricas .
En cuanto al costo de la energía nuclear , sería necesario internalizar y considerar costos ambientales y climáticos de opciones fósiles para hacer una comparación objetiva .
Ni el mundo ni México pueden soslayar la importancia de la energía nuclear en el contexto del cambio climático , como cimiento de una matriz energética de cero emisiones construida conjuntamente con energías renovables .
The lower half of a man ’s body was found in a bag in an alley outside a northwest suburban shopping center Friday night .
The body was found after someone called in a foul odor coming from the trash at 21 N. Dryden Place in Arlington Heights around 4:30 p.m .
When police arrived , they saw a human foot sticking out of a plastic bag next to a Dumpster , and immediately sealed off the area , according to a police news release .
That address is the Marketview Apartments near Dryden Place and East Kensington Road , just east of the Arlington Market Shopping Center .
Police think the body had been there at least a couple of days before it was found .
Police transported the body , still inside the plastic bag , to the Cook County Medical Examiner 's office , which identified the contents as the lower extremities of an adult white man .
The body is separated just above the pelvis , but what kind of instrument was used to sever the body in two is still unclear .
A Saturday autopsy was inconclusive pending police investigation , according to the medical examiner ’s office .
Officials are scouring through missing person reports as they work to identify the remains .
Arlington Heights police and Major Case Assistant Team are investigating .
Four Saharan desert states are to open a joint command headquarters in Algeria to co-ordinate efforts to counter the growing regional threat from al - Qaeda .
The Joint Military Staff Committee of Algeria , Mali , Mauritania and Niger will be based in Tamanrasset .
They want to increase co-operation and move towards joint operations against terrorism , kidnappings and trafficking .
Militants have exploited a lack of co-ordination in the past , evading capture by crossing from one state to another .
The US and other Western countries have warned that unless the governments of the region join forces , al - Qaeda could turn the Sahara desert into a safe haven and use it as a base for launching large - scale attacks .
Al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb last year killed a British hostage
Last year an affiliate of the militant network , al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , killed a British man , Edwin Dyer , who was kidnapped on the border between Niger and Mali , and shot dead a US aid worker in Mauritania .
Members of the group are also believed to be holding hostage two Spaniards who disappeared in November in Mauritania .
An Italian married couple seized in December were last week freed in Mali .
The countries did not say what powers the command centre would have , but a military source in Niger told the Reuters news agency they planned to " move towards joint military operations against terrorism , kidnappings and the trafficking of drugs and weapons " .

Goldman Sachs is expected to earmark about $ 5 bn ( £ 3 bn ) for staff pay and bonuses this week , days after being accused of securities fraud by the US regulators , fuelling the controversy over bankers ' rewards in the teeth of the financial crisis .
Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein is expected to unveil revenues of $ 11bn for the first quarter of this year on Tuesday , up from $ 9.4bn in the same period of 2009 .
About 47 % of that will go into a " compensation pool " for bosses and employees .
The bank , along with Fabrice Tourre , one of its vice presidents , is the subject of a civil fraud complaint by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
It denies the accusations and is understood to believe they are the result of a politically motivated witch - hunt – timed to coincide with a drive by President Obama to get tough on banks , and to come just ahead of its results .
The bank has been aware of the SEC 's investigation for two years but had not spoken to investigators since September 2009 and is thought to have been taken by surprise by last week 's events .
Tourre has been interviewed by Goldman 's internal compliance department but is still employed by the bank and has not been suspended .
Speculation over Blankfein 's future is seen by insiders as " silly " .
However , the episode is likely to have incurred the ire of US investor Warren Buffett , who lost more than $ 1bn on paper in 24 hours on warrants held by his Berkshire Hathaway investment fund as Goldman shares plunged .
Buffett endorsed the bank by loaning it $ 5bn at the height of the crisis at 10 % interest .
He is an outspoken critic of Wall Street sharp practice and excessive pay .
Senior Goldman executives have held talks with major investors , thought to include Buffett , over the SEC accusation .
Blankfein is also anticipating tough questioning later this month on Capitol Hill .
Along with other financiers he is expected to testify before the Senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations .
The panel 's head , Democratic senator Carl Levin , said it had discovered levels of greed that were " frankly disgusting " .
Goldman made record profits of $ 13.4bn last year , after net revenues more than doubled to $ 45.2bn , racking up at least $ 100 m in net trading revenues every other working day .
This came after the demise of several rivals and despite the bank coming close to disaster itself when the crisis was at its height .
It took $ 10bn of US government money , which it has since repaid .
Amid widespread popular anger against the banks , Goldman last year shrank its bonus pool to 36 % of revenues rather than the usual 50 % .
Despite reining in , however , it still paid out a total of $ 16.2 bn .
Blankfein was awarded a $ 9 m bonus in shares in 2009 , down from the $ 68 m he received in cash , shares and options in 2007 .
Due to accounting rules , Goldman sets aside a higher proportion of revenues for staff rewards at the start of the year .
The rate at which they are accruing for 2010 overall is likely to drop in subsequent quarters , to end up at about the same as in 2009 .
A week ago , Republicans were united and on the verge of completely commanding the political narrative between now and November .
Now , with their entire strategy having been upended by the Democratic health care victory , the party is in disarray .
There is no fallback on health care -- none -- except to call for repeal , as conservative House lawmakers and congressional candidates have already begun to do .
But what to repeal ?
The " bad " stuff -- tax increases and such -- kick in later .
Most everyone who will feel reform 's touch within the next year or so will get benefits , be it in the form of not having their coverage rescinded , or be it a $ 250 rebate check from the government .
Today , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged as much by refusing to say whether Republicans actually would move to repeal legislation , or parts of it , if they manage to take control of the Senate .
The bundled issue - history of health reform remains unpopular enough for Republicans to campaign on repealing it , but it's hard to imagine the enthusiasm gap between high - interest voters widening any further .
The price of health care , and its repeal , has been factored in to the Republican midterm base .
( That 's not to say that the arguments , substantively , are n't there : see Megan 's 8 predictions . )
For Democrats , though , there is upside potential .
Other Republicans will go ahead with lawsuits , challenging Congress 's presumed lack of authority to force citizens to buy health coverage or be punished by the government .
( Andrew Cohen explains why this reasoning is fairly specious . )
Let 's move beyond health care for a moment .
Today , the White House welcomed faith - based groups who are demanding a vote on immigration reform .
Congressional leaders do n't know whether one will be in the offing by November , but the debate is certain to flare up .
And the business lobby , which had united against health care reform , will suddenly find itself split : the same would be the case if the president were to try and use his political capital to push through climate change legislation .
Doubtful he would , but he if he did , there would be many megaphones at work .
If Jesus Were Alive Today , He ’d Be A Liquid Mountaineer !
Now here is a sport I think Jesus would have excelled at .
It is called Liquid Mountaineering and the objective is simple : run on water for as long as you can .
These guys may not be the son of God or even Chris Angel , but they seem to be pretty damn good at high - stepping their way across this lake .
This looks like something Usain Bolt would be perfect for .
Perhaps they should consider teaming up with the world ’s fastest man , and this dirt biker ( who can ride across water ) for a worldwide tour .
And maybe once they are done mastering this sport , they can try parting the sea .
After all , it appears as though the sky is the limit for these guys .

NVIDIA and Intel have n't been shy about their differing visions of the future of computing in the past year or so , but it looks like Team GPU just upped the rhetoric a little -- a Forbes column by NVIDIA VP Bill Dally argues that " Moore 's law is dead . "
Given that Moore 's law is arguably the foundation of Intel 's entire business , such a statement is a huge shot across the bow ; though other companies like AMD are guided by the doctrine , Intel 's relentless pursuit of Gordon Moore 's vision has become a focal point and rallying cry for the world 's largest chipmaker .
So what 's Dally 's solution to the death of Moore 's law ?
For everyone to buy into parallel computing , where -- surprise , surprise -- NVIDIA 's GPUs thrive .
Dally says that dual quad - and hex - core solutions are inefficient -- he likens multi-core chips to " trying to build an airplane by putting wings on a train , " and says that only ground - up parallel solutions designed for energy efficiency will bring back the golden age of doubling performance every two years .
That sounds fantastic , but as far as power consumption is concerned , well , perhaps NVIDIA had best lead by example
The automatic graphic switching capabilities in the new 15 - and 17 - inch MacBook Pros are accomplished with a solution created entirely by Apple , and do not rely on Nvidia 's established Optimus technology .
An Nvidia spokesperson confirmed to AppleInsider Tuesday that Apple 's new high - end MacBook Pros include an automatic graphics switching solution that is the Mac maker 's own creation .
Nvidia had no input on Apple 's solution and would not comment on the utilized technology .
Earlier this year , Nvidia introduced a new technology called Optimus , which is designed two work alongside Nehalem notebook designs — like the Core i5 and Core i7 — that include Intel 's integrated graphics processor , as well as a discrete Nvidia graphics chip .
The feature chooses the best of the two processors for running a given application .
While the end result is similar , Apple 's automatic graphics switching solution is not Optimus , Nvidia said .
This switching is accomplished on - the - fly with no input from users .
Apple also offers users the option to switch solely to discrete graphics and turn off the automatic switching .
The top -tier MacBook Pros include the Nvidia GeForce 330 M graphics processor , which is more than twice as fast as the low - end 320 M found exclusively in the new 13 - inch model .
The 330 M , however , is not an exclusive GPU , as it has been found in competing PCs that have already come to market .
Apple on Tuesday introduced its new line of MacBook Pros , with the 15 - and 17 - inch models sporting the proprietary graphics switching capabilities .
The feature dynamically switches between the 330 M for peak performance , and the integrated Intel HD Graphics for more energy efficient operation .
Apple said the tightly integrated software and hardware solution allows battery life of 8 to 9 hours on the new MacBook Pros .
It was in October 2008 that Apple jettisoned Intel 's supporting chipsets from its MacBook line , and opted instead for the better performance offered by Nvidia 's GPUs .
MacBook Pros received similar treatment , with the addition of a secondary , more powerful Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT discrete graphics processor for higher performance operations .
Apple had to rely on graphics switching capabilities in its new notebooks introduced Tuesday because the new Arrandale processors feature the major northbridge chipset memory controller components built in .
The architectural changes through Arrandale and an ongoing lawsuit that has forced Nvidia to halt the development of future chipsets have required PC manufacturers like Apple to rely on proprietary Intel chipsets and their integrated graphics processors .
Apple 's automated switching solution provides use of both the Intel integrated graphics processing power , as well as Nvidia 's 330M GPU .
Apple has touted that the 330 M is the " fastest graphics ever " found in a Mac notebook .
The high - end discrete graphics processor is available only in the 15 - and 17 - inch MacBook Pro models .
The week after Stancl 's arrest , The New York Times ran a story about the case , headlined sex predator accusations shake a wisconsin town .
In it an Eisenhower mother was quoted as saying , " It was beyond what the kids could imagine , you know ?
They see a lot of things , they go to the theater and everything else , but this is so shocking . "
Like most people in town , she sees Eisenhower as a bastion of innocents , blindsided by a monster among them .
Certainly , that 's the most comforting way to look at it .
at 12:40 p.m. on Wednesday , November 12 , 2008 , two frightened Eisenhower students told a teacher , who told the principal , that they had seen the phrase bomb 11/14/08 written on the wall above a urinal in a downstairs boys ' bathroom .
The principal , Michael Fesenmaier , had dealt with bomb threats before , but not during his four years at Ike .
By the following afternoon , authorities had found no sign of a bomb and no solid clues as to the source of the threat .
In his office , Fesenmaier had corralled a few known troublemakers in an attempt to get them to confess to vandalizing the bathroom wall .
Midway through one interrogation , Fesenmaier was interrupted , and when he turned around he was surprised to see Tony Stancl .
A stooped boy of five feet eleven , Tony was a familiar figure in the school 's front office .
The previous year , he worked there part - time , and people thought he was pleasant enough , if kind of lazy .
He was prone to officiousness , but even for him this drop - by was pushing it .
" Mr. Fesenmaier , " he said sternly , " what are you doing to protect us ? "
Fesenmaier assured him , " I 've got it under control , " and turned back around .
Rebuffed ,
Tony shuffled into the hall and pulled out his BlackBerry .
It was against school rules to use your cell phone in the building , but Tony had been surreptitiously Twittering about the bomb threat ever since school started that morning :
7:28 a.m. School is like prison now .
No one is allowed in the halls unless they are supervised .…
Cops are in the hallways too .
9:04 a.m. Update : school is officially on lock down .
I hate being suppressed .
1:28 p.m.
Maybe we will have off tomorrow since the " bomb " is suppose to go off tomorrow …
That afternoon he walked out of the building and got in his crappy green Civic .
There were times when he wished he still had his old car — a blue Audi A4 he'd kept wad and spotless .
He 'd sold it the previous spring and planned to use the proceeds to do something constructive :
He wanted to go to Peru that summer to build houses for the poor .
He might have imagined the trip as a kind of homecoming — Tony and his sister , Stephanie , were adopted as babies from an orphanage in Lima — but his parents told him the trip was too dangerous .
Instead , he bought a forty - two - inch plasma TV that he hung in his bedroom in the Stancls ' effusively gabled home in Country Estates , one of New Berlin 's grandest developments .
Tony could be arrogant about his family 's wealth .
He signed e-mails " Tony $ " or " To$y , " and on his MySpace profile he wrote , " Some people consider me rich , but i do n't like that saying , i prefer ' financially fortunate ' lol . "
Physically , Tony was less fortunate .
Whereas his sister was a jock — she played on Ike 's basketball and softball teams —
Tony 's most striking feature was his disproportionately large head .
His efforts to connect with girls were awkward at best .
" He would try to flirt with you and it would be , like , creepy , " says a girl who graduated in the class ahead of Tony's .
" He would say things that would bring the conversation to a total stop , and you 'd look at him and wonder , What was that about ? "
The closest he got to sports was Academic Decathlon , where he was the team 's history whiz .
He was also treasurer of the Eisenhower chapter of SADD , which stands for Students Against Destructive Decisions .
As part of SADD , Tony did seat - belt checks on the long row of cars driving out of Ike 's parking lot after school .
He stood with a New Berlin cop , stopping each vehicle to offer a friendly reminder to buckle up .
This is pretty funny .
They do n't have the nerve to fire Steele , so they simply do an end run around him :
As troubles at the Republican National Committee continue , a group of former Republican officials are starting an outside political group that could compete with the RNC for wealthy donors and prominence .
The group , American Crossroads , hopes to raise $ 52 million from wealthy Republicans and corporations , according to officials involved with the organization .
The goal is to mount an independent campaign to help Republican candidates win in the November elections .
It is the latest – and most ambitious – effort by conservatives to create outside campaign groups that can compete with those run by Democrats .
Labor unions and Democrats generally outspend Republicans on independent political activities .
In the last few months , Republicans have announced the creation of several outside organizations that plan to raise money from corporations and wealthy conservatives to support Republican candidates .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it plans to spend as much as $ 50 million on advertising to support pro-business , mostly Republican candidates .
The new American Crossroads organization will be run by former RNC Chairman Mike Duncan and Joanne Davidson , a onetime RNC co-chair .
Former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie and former White House adviser Karl Rove are informally advising the organization .
The day - to - day operations will be handled by Steven Law , who is leaving a top role at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Republican consultants Jim Dyke will also be involved .

Kubuntu was my favorite distribution for a time , back during the KDE 3.5 series .
I was a KDE user all the way back to 2.0 .
Before Kubuntu I used mainly Debian unstable on the desktop , and Debian stable on servers .
Way before that , Red Hat and Slackware .
Red Hat 5 was my first Linux , on actual 3.5 " diskettes .
Somewheres in there I used Libranet , which was a super - nice Debian derivative , but sadly it died with the passing of its founder .
Back in those olden days Corel Linux and Mandrake Linux put a lot of effort into making Linux friendly to inexperienced users , and there are a lot of Linux users who got their start on these after being frustrated with trying to install other distributions .
I think one of the greatest strengths of Linux is its easy installation , and bootable live CDs , DVDs , and USB .
Make it easy to get up and running , and then you can explore and learn all about it .
Ever since KDE4 hit the scene I 've been shopping for an everyday desktop Linux again .
Speed and efficiency are everything ; if the computer gets in my way then something has to change .
So I 've been testing different graphical environments : GNOME , XFce , LXDE , and ICEwm are all nice , though GNOME seems rather heavyweight for the level of functionality it delivers .
I 'm very spoiled by Debian ; it supports more packages than anyone , and is the easiest of any Linux to maintain .
Somewheres in my distro travels I got distracted from Sidux , which is a nice Debian Sid implementation .
( Probably by the * buntus , bless their noisy little hearts . )
That is next in line for testing as my main desktop Linux .
I 've been testing Arch Linux for my music studio PC , and while it 's early to say for sure , so far I like it a lot .
It is sleek , clean , very stable , and feels sensible .
I use a very customized Debian for servers .
I 've been able to trim it down to about 150 megabytes , and then I just add whatever services I need .
It 's real Debian , with all the usual Debian goodness , just skinny .
Ratpoison is an awesome super - lightweight window manager for running a herd of remote servers from the console .
The Gentoo - based SystemRescue CD / USB still gets my vote as best rescue Linux , supporting advanced things like RAID , LVM , and new filesystems ; all manner of testing and diagnostic utilities , and even some accessibility applications .
Clonezilla is a great disk - cloning tool that supports Linux , Mac , and Windows , and can even do mass - clones over a network .
The GParted LiveCD is a wonderful little distro for partitioning hard disks .
It even brings sanity to Windows systems ; you know how flummoxed Windows gets when it comes to doing anything more than totally overwrite a FAT or NTFS - formatted disk .
I 've been playing a bit with the XMBC media server , and am impressed .
Eventually I want to digitize all of my movies and music , and have them all on a central server .
XMBC also supports Internet streaming .
Then I will park in my comfortable chair with the remote control and never leave it ever again .
If you 're thinking of building your own video surveillance system , check out ZoneMinder .
It is sophisticated , reliable , and cram - full of features , more than most commercialware .

As strange as it may initially seem , there are atheists who believe in ghosts .
Since atheism refers to one 's lack of belief in gods , there is nothing about the definition of atheism that makes this problematic .
While most atheists do seem to be materialists in the sense that they do not believe in anything outside of nature ( i.e. , anything supernatural ) , atheism does not require this sort of materialism .
So yes , someone can be an atheist and still believe in ghosts , spirits , and the like .
But for those of us who arrived at atheism via skepticism , critical thinking , and empiricism , the presence of ghost - believing atheists is a bit odd to say the least .
While playing with StumbleUpon this morning , I happened across an atheist blog written by someone who was trying to reconcile atheism with " spirituality . "
I have no interest in this and moved on quickly .
Moments later I found myself at Atheist Nexus , shaking my head in disbelief over a thread in which someone was asking about others ' experiences with " hauntings . " Maybe I need to make more of an effort to understand atheists who believe in ghosts , spirits , monsters , etc .
Clearly , the path by which they came to atheism is very different from mine .
Perhaps such individuals could teach us something .
How about you ?
Do you believe in ghosts ?
Mushrooms which have been exposed to pulses of intense ultraviolet light to boost Vitamin D levels will soon be on Australian supermarket shelves .
After two years of trials , Greg Seymour from the Australian Mushroom Growers ' Association says the industry is preparing to adopt UV light technology .
" Mushrooms have been grown in the dark in modern times simply because they do n't need the sun to actually grow , " he said .
" What we did n't realise from some recent research is that they need the sun to make Vitamin D , just like you and me .
" Vitamin D insufficiency is a big thing in Australia .
Fifty per cent of the population for 50 per cent of the year do n't have enough Vitamin D . "
Horticultural scientist Tony Biggs , who is working for the industry , recommends mushroom farmers add the American technology to their packing lines .
" They will be exposed we think to three pulses of one third of a second each , so a total of one second of pulsed light , and that will bring a level of Vitamin D in the mushrooms that 's at least equivalent to 100 per cent of the daily requirement . "
He says the light does not pose any health risks and will not cause the mushrooms to brown .
The technique already has the support of Doug Schirripa , who owns Adelaide Mushrooms , the second biggest farm in the country .
" We 're certainly looking at bringing that in probably around July [ or ]
August ... when the research is finished , " he said .
Another interested South Australian farmer is Patrick Newenham , who owns the much smaller Fresh Fields Mushrooms near Victor Harbour .
But with the technology costing between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 , he says he will not be able to afford vitamin supplementation at the speed of light .
" We may just have to say pass that one by for the moment and continue producing a good product , " he said .
Tony Biggs says there will be cheaper options .
" For smaller growers we will be using a system where they use less intense ultraviolet light but for a longer period of time to achieve the same result , " he said .
Vitamin D rich mushrooms are already commercially available in the United States but Greg Seymour says the jury is still out on whether they are a success .
" It has n't sold enormous amounts yet , but the market is maturing very , very quickly there as health authorities are starting to warn people that they need to get their Vitamin D levels up , and I suspect a similar thing will happen here in Australia , " he said .

With the proliferation of " small plates " restaurants serving what often amounts to complete , multicomponent chef - designed courses in miniature , it 's easy to forget where small plates began : simple , intensely flavorful Spanish tapas .
Intended as a cheap way to draw customers into drinking establishments , the most traditional tapas are easy to make , inexpensive , and go perfectly with booze .
Nobody wants throwing a party to be a chore , least of all the cook .
In that spirit , here are four simple tapas that , asides from salt , pepper , and olive oil , require only four ingredients and are guaranteed to get the mixers mixing and the shakers shaking .
Escalivada Catalana is traditionally made by placing fresh eggplant , peppers , and onions next to the slowly dying embers of a fire overnight , retrieving them from the ashes in the morning , and chopping them together with olive oil and sherry vinegar into a smoky , robust vegetable stew perfect for topping on crusty toasted bread , or serving alongside grilled meats and sausages .
This version is made in the oven , but if you 've got a grilling bent ( and who does n't have at least a minor grilling bent ? ) , it fares even better over an open flame .
Adding olive oil and aromatics to mildly smoky Idiazábal cheese and calling it a dish is about as lazy as you can get away with being before somebody should intervene and call your mother , but it 's delicious nonetheless .
There 's nothing like a good Spanish sausage , and thanks in large part to their spicy smokiness , Garbanzos con Chorizo has a complex flavor that belies its simplicity .
The starchy liquid inside the can of chickpeas helps thicken up the sauce into a stew - like consistency .
Finally , everyone knows Gambas con Ajillo — tiny shrimp cooked in a sizzling cazuela of garlic - spiked olive oil .
Well , cauliflower works just as well , if not better .
It achieves a nutty sweetness when caramelized , and has plenty of nooks and crannies to soak up the garlic - scented oil .

New Caledonian crow .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- New Zealand scientists studying New Caledonian crows have found they can use three different tools in succession to gain a food treat .
The crows are known to solve problems and fashion and use tools in the wild , but their clevernes and innovation in the experiments astounded the researchers .
Investigations into the abilities of the New Caledonian crow ( Corvus moneduloides ) revealed the birds can create tools out of unfamiliar materials , and they can also use several tools in succession .
The scientists , led by Professor Russell Gray from the University of Auckland , captured seven wild crows and placed them in an aviary where they were presented with a complex problem in which meat was placed out of reach .
It could be drawn out by a long stick , but the stick was out of reach inside a barred toolbox .
The long stick could be retrieved using a short stick , but this was attached to a string tied to a branch .
So to win the treat , the birds had to first pull up the string to retrieve the short stick , then use the short stick to pull out the long stick , and then use the long stick to draw out the meat .
The crows were split into two groups .
Birds in the first group were allowed to try out every step in the problem before being presented with the complete task .
All the birds in this group succeeded in the multi-stage task on their first attempt .
Birds in the second group were shown situations in which food was attached to a string and where sticks could be used to reach food , but they had never experienced a situation in which one tool was used to collect another .
Even so , the birds in this group also succeeded in reaching the food in the multi-stage task , although two of them took three or four attempts before they succeeded .
One of the birds ( nicknamed Sam ) spent the first 110 seconds simply inspecting the parts of the task , and then completed it the first time without error .
Another ( Casper ) found the string puzzling , but also completed the task on the first attempt .
Sam 's successful first trial
Lead author of the research , published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , was Dr Alex Taylor .
He said finding the birds could solve a problem requiring two new behaviors was “ incredibly surprising , ” even though crows and related birds have been studied for decades because of their intelligence .
The experiments showed the performance of the birds in solving the problem was consistent with a thought process — tools can be used to retrieve unreachable objects — rather than a process of trial and error and learning from mistakes .

A witness who testified against the man accused of breaching Sarah Palin's Yahoo !
Mail account has criticized federal prosecutors for distorting the facts in an attempt to score legal points .
Gabriel Ramuglia said the episode left him so disenchanted that he 's changing the logging policy for Ctunnel.com , the anonymity proxy used to access Palin 's Yahoo account while she was running for vice president in 2008 .
Before , he collected the IP address of each user along with the time and address of each web visit and stored it for seven days .
Now , he logs the minimum required by law .
Ramuglia said he 's taking the step because he believes prosecutors exaggerated entries in the log information when presenting it to the jury in the case .
On several occasions , he said assistant US attorneys told him privately they wanted to " show as much commerce as possible " by emphasizing connections his proxy made to ad servers , even though his site almost always filters out their content .
Based on the evidence in Ctunnel logs , Ramuglia said , he believes Kernell " should have got in some trouble . "
But he went on to say that he believes prosecutors are attempting to win enhancements to Kernell 's potential sentence by ginning up findings that the breach disrupted interstate commerce .
" My objection is that they seem to be more interested in getting a maximum sentence than with prosecuting what actually happened , " Ramuglia , 26 , told The Register on Tuesday .
" They really do n't need to try to get 50 years on this by drumming up all these other irrelevant charges . "
Ramuglia testified last Wednesday in the trial of 22 - year - old David C. Kernell , who is charged with four felonies for allegedly breaking in to the Palin account .
Kernell has pleaded not guilty to the charges .
His attorney has insisted there was no criminal intent in the intrusion and during closing arguments told jurors : " not every choice we make at age 20 defines who we are . "
The jury began deliberating on Tuesday after a week of testimony .
When FBI agents contacted Ramuglia in September 2008 , the webmaster and entrepreneur said he was happy to turn over the logs showing the IP address of the person who accessed Palin 's account without access .
He said it was only recently that he learned that if Kernell is convicted on all four charges , he faces a maximum sentence of about 50 years .
( Legal experts say based on the facts , he would probably get much less ) .
After objecting to prosecutors ' court tactics , Ramugila said that Ctunnel will no longer proactively log any information at all on servers located in the US .
In the UK , in keeping with laws there , he will store information for 48 hours .
He said he may still narrowly log on a case - by - case basis , say , in instances where a user repeatedly abuses his terms of service .
US attorneys handling the case could n't be reached for comment .
In their defense , it should be noted that it 's not unusual for attorneys on either side to emphasize facts that are favorable to their side , and there 's nothing in Ramuglia 's account that suggests any wrongdoing on the part of prosecutors .
It 's also unclear what sentence prosecutors will seek should Kernell be found guilty .
Still , it says something about the nation 's uneven sentencing guidelines when someone like Ramuglia says he's no longer willing to serve as a witness for prosecutors , even in cases where he believes an offense has occurred .
" I would rather not have anything useful to provide to law enforcement and him get away with it than them put on this dog and pony show and try to get him put away for the rest of his life , " he said .
" It 's just wrong .
To the extent I can legally do so , I 'm not going to be a part of it . " ®

One of the bloodiest wars in the world is taking place just next to America ’s southern border , among Mexican drug cartels battling for control of illicit narcotics .
As rival gangs stake their turf , the death toll is on the rise :
Last year , 6,600 lives were claimed by the war , up from 5,800 the year before .
In Ciudad Juarez alone , 550 people have been murdered so far this year , compared to 449 during the same period last year .
The bloodshed is n’t just affecting gang members .
In January , 16 innocent teens were killed at a party in Juarez .
And earlier this month , two students at Monterrey ’s Technological Institute were murdered in crossfire .
In response to the carnage , the American and Mexican governments have announced an extensive overhaul of their policing efforts .
There will still be troops — 50,000 have been dispatched over the past three years — but the countries will also focus on social program development , intel sharing , and more efficient cops and courts .
The effort will kick off with pilot programs in Juarez and Tijuana , the largest border cities in Mexico .
In Tijuana , the setting of this photo essay , 700 people lost their lives to the drug war last year .
Whether or not this new effort will work remains to be seen .
As Charles Bowden recently wrote in Mother Jones :
There are two Mexicos .
There is the one reported by the US press , a place where the Mexican president is fighting a valiant war on drugs , aided by the Mexican army and the Mérida Initiative , the $ 1.4 billion in aid the United States has committed to the cause .
This Mexico has newspapers , courts , laws , and is seen by the United States government as a sister republic .
It does not exist .
There is a second Mexico where the war is for drugs , where the police and the military fight for their share of drug profits , where the press is restrained by the murder of reporters and feasts on a steady diet of bribes , and where the line between the government and the drug world has never existed .
These photos are part of a larger , multiyear project called Narco - Land , shot by San Francisco - based photographer Eros Hoagland , represented by Redux Pictures .
Hoagland ’s project is an intimate look at the impact of the Mexican drug war and efforts to stem the tide of violence .

Perhaps wishing to offset the US 's booming birth rates , Raina Kelley tells us the " 8 ways her son is torturing her . "

Just to give you the idea of where Kelley 's coming from : " Before I had a kid , I was funnier , more spontaneous , less judgmental , better dressed , and a good cook .
Now I 'm guilt - ridden , smelly stress ball who 's getting more strident by the day and eats cashews and licorice for dinner . "
She then gives us a litany of the humbling moments , stresses and petty tyrannies her adorable toddler has imposed on a previously well - ordered existence .
It 's cute ( I especially liked that little Gabe reserves the title of " Mom " for his beloved toy cars ) and designed , as the author tells us , to dispel the myth that she , as a dispenser of advice , has any more answers than any other new mom .
But two things really niggled at me as a young woman contemplating procreation ( someday ) :
First - she does actually like licorice and cashews , right ?
I happen to heartily dislike both ( black jelly beans are an exception ) and hate to think that along with everything else , the advent of a small child would somehow cruelly impose upon me a diet of only my least - favorite candies .
Or do the hormones change your tastes to the extent that you suddenly like heretofore despised foods ?
That would n't be so bad !

But more pressingly , I was left , as I often am by pieces on parenting , at sea .
Nowadays , there is such a dichotomy at work : the hazy romanticizing of baby culture wars with the it 's - a - nightmare / I - don't - love - my - child / I- wanted - another - sex " backlash and while one is surely designed to remedy the other , those of us who have n't had a baby are left , ironically , with no very clear idea of the reality .
Which is maybe the point that every single account - whether glowing or traumatized - is really getting at .
Thank goodness Babies will be out in a few weeks .

Code completion is one of the more useful features when you ’re developing since it allows you to write code faster .
While Code completion should be activated by default in newer versions of Xcode , it ’s easy to enable and use if it is n’t .
You can also improve the usability of Xcode ’s code completion with a great third party plugin , skip to the bottom of the article for that .
Enable code completion in Xcode
* Within Xcode , go to Preferences
* Click on the “ Code Sense ” icon
* Look for the “ Code Completion ” section and select ‘ Immediate ’ from the “ Automatically Suggest ” drop down menu
* Click “ OK ”
Using Code completion in Xcode
Once enabled , Xcode will now offer code completion based on what you have typed and offer suggestions for completing the syntax .
* You accept the code suggestion by pressing the Tab key or Return
* You can see a full list of completion suggestions by hitting the Escape key
It ’s interesting to note that Apple says Code completion is disabled by default , but in newer versions of Xcode it seems to be enabled by default instead .
Improve Xcode code completion with Auto Assistant plugin
Code completion is n’t perfect in Xcode , but that does n’t mean there are n’t solutions from third parties .
A very helpful Xcode plugin for developers is called Xcode Auto Assistant , and it offers the ability to popup the completion list automatically , all the time , when a character it recognizes is entered .
The behavior then becomes closer to how things like Coda , BBedit , Espresso , etc handle code completion .
The plugin is a lot more consistent than what Apple offers by default , although I would n’t be surprised if this is changed soon with an update to Xcode .
Until Apple adjusts the behavior , you can download the plugin from Google Code here .
After you download the Auto Assistant plugin , you ’ll need to drop the plugin into the following directory :
~/ Library / Application Support / Developer / Shared / Xcode / Plug-ins
If / Plug - ins / does not exist , just create the directory .
Relaunch Xcode and the plugin is installed and works immediately .
Tapeworm infections of the brain , which can cause epileptic seizures , appear to be increasing in Mexico and bordering southwestern states , Loyola University Health System researchers report .
In Mexico , up to 10 percent of the population may have the infection , neurocysticercosis .
While many people never develop symptoms , neurocysticercosis nevertheless " remains a serious health concern , especially among the poor , " Loyola researchers wrote in the journal Neurological Research .
Their article is among several articles in the journal 's April issue that describe neurological infections in Latin America .
Guest editor is Dr. Jaime Belmares , assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases , Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine .
Neurocysticercosis is caused by a tapeworm found in pigs called Taenia solium .
A person can get infected with the parasite by eating undercooked pork .
That person then can excrete tapeworm eggs .
The contamination spreads through food , water or surfaces contaminated with feces .
A person can become infected , for example , by drinking contaminated water or putting contaminated fingers in the mouth .
Neurocysticercosis is most common in poor rural communities in developing countries with poor sanitation and hygiene and where pigs are allowed to roam freely and eat human feces .
Once inside the stomach , the tapeworm egg hatches , travels through the bloodstream and ends up in the muscles , brain or eyes .
The worm , which can grow to more than one - half inch long , becomes enveloped in a fluid - filled cyst .
Cysts in the muscles generally do n't cause symptoms .
But cysts in the eyes can cause blurry vision , while cysts in the brain can cause headaches , encephalitis and seizures .
Less common symptoms include confusion and difficulty with balance .
Seizures occur in up to 70 percent of patients .
" They 're pretty dramatic , " Belmares said .
" Every seizure needs to be properly evaluated . "
The article on neurocysticercosis was written by Dr. Adolfo Ramirez - Zamora , a former resident at Loyola now at the University of California at San Francisco and Tomas Alarcon , who did a rotation at Loyola during medical school .
Other articles in the April issue of Neurological Research describe other neurological infections in Latin America , including Chagas disease , hydatid disease of the central nervous system , neuroschistosomiasis , meningococcal disease and rabies .
Our appearance speaks louder than our words …..
Every day we pass by hundreds of people on the subway , in hallways , or on the streets , never saying a word .
Yet despite the lack of verbal communication , decisions are being made as to the trustworthiness and intentions of those around you .
Doubt this ?
Try wearing a ski mask and trench coat while gesturing wildly with your arms .
In the 15 minutes you have before the police show up , take note that despite not saying a single word your appearance has sent a message .
Yes , what I just said is unfair .
Right now you may be thinking “ Judge me not by my clothing , but by the integrity in which I live my life ” — and I could n’t agree more .
But life is n’t fair , human beings have and will continue to judge others based on the information presented to them — and in most situations this is at first our physical appearance .
Dress like a thug and people treat you like one ; dress like a professional and you ’ll have doors opened for you .
A Man ’s Wardrobe
There are many things that we ca n’t control — the weather , the economy , the fact that college football needs a playoff system .
How we present ourselves to strangers and new acquaintances , however , is not one of them .
When you shake hands with a potential partner , they form an instant impression of you which is not easily dislodged .
First impressions are powerful because until we begin to speak , they are the only bits of information we have to make a snap decision as to whether we like or trust someone .
Countless communication studies have shown a man ’s visual appearance is initially more powerful than what he says ; ignore your wardrobe at your own risk .
There will be three articles in this series :
Part 1 : How to Build Your Wardrobe — Making the Commitment & Understanding Your Needs
Before a man begins anything that will require substantial time and resources , he has to be committed to the change .
In this article we break men up into defined groups based on their lifestyles and we then address their specific needs .
The goal is to give you a quick checklist of items you should consider investing in depending on your career choice and personal requirements .
Part 2 : How to Build Your Wardrobe — Clothing Specifics
In this article we address specific menswear questions such as the order in which you should assemble your clothing , which suit colors and style should you choose if you only own one suit , which shoe styles you will get the most wear out of , and how you mix casual wear into the wardrobe .
We ’ll also talk about where those on a very limited budget should invest the bulk of their money if they are starting from scratch .
Part 3 : How to Build Your Wardrobe — Accessories , Maintenance , & Storage
In this final article we ’ll cover the often neglected points of a man ’s wardrobe such as how to incorporate hats , watches , and other accessories along with clothing storage and protection .
Part 1 : How to Build Your Wardrobe – Making the Commitment & Understanding Your Needs
1st – Learn and Then Commit to Improve Your Personal Presentation
First , before spending a dime , you must commit to making the change .
Do this by going through your current clothing and setting aside everything that you 1 ) have not worn for two years , 2 ) is noticeably stained , and 3 ) fits so poorly not even a master tailor could adjust it to fit .
Package it all up and mark it for the Salvation Army or eBay .
Now over the next week verbally inform a few close friends and family member as to what you are doing — perhaps even promise a new profile picture on Facebook of you decked out in your new clothing .
The goal here is to create a network of supporters and audience ; this puts pressure on you to fulfill your promise .
And do not forget to gain the support of your spouse or the person who will be helping you to pay for all this .
I find my clients ’ wives are ecstatic and fully supportive of their husband ’s efforts to dress better .
If you keep your partner out of the decision , however , you could be met with unexpected resistance .
2nd – Understand the Basics of Style and Your Specific Needs
You have to understand why you need professional clothing in your wardrobe .
I ’ve written about this point quite a bit ; if you need further convincing check out past Art of Manliness articles such as Your Personal Appearance :
The Importance of Being a Sharp Dressed Man or explore the writings of former FBI counter intelligence agent Joe Navarro — he blogs extensively about the importance of proper presentation and the power of your curbside appeal .
Next , build a foundation in understanding the rules of dressing well .
I ca n’t stress the importance of a man taking control of his own image .
Handing the responsibility over to your wife or girlfriend , however well meaning they may be , is a dangerous option ; you may end up looking like a Ken doll .
These resources will give you the basics –
And make sure to supplement these guides with modern style blogs such as Street Etiquette and Put This On .
Types of Men and Their Clothing Needs

Rather it gives you a chance to better express it without compromising your chance for opportunity .

1 Suit & 2
Ties ( Just in case ! )
1 Pair Dress Shoes

3rd – Allot the Time and Resources
Your Wardrobe Budget —
How much time and money do I need ?
Ideally a man should build his wardrobe a few pieces at a time over a decade .
In tune with his clothing needs , he should be on the lookout for missing pieces to be had at a value price .
Slowly integrating these finds into his closet , he will be ready at a moment ’s notice for whatever event is thrown his way .
If you have time on your hands , develop a basic understanding of style and shop in thrift shops and bargain bins , and you can piece together a respectable wardrobe for around $ 300 to $ 500 .
When time is a premium , the cost of a wardrobe can rise dramatically .
If you do not have years to piece your wardrobe together , you may end up spending ten times the numbers above as you ’ll be paying full retail for most items .
If your wardrobe is going to be suit heavy , expect to spend well over 5 K .
The one upside to purchasing quite a few items at once is that you may be able to negotiate a discount for a large purchase — I do this quite often with my clients as it is a win - win scenario for both of us .
Finally , remember that purchasing quality is an investment ; purchasing quantity on the other hand is an expense .
It ’s better to own a few well made garments that you wear often than a full wardrobe of cheap & poorly - fitted clothing that , well , looks cheap and poorly - fitted .
What to look forward to !
In part 2 we will cover the specifics of the garments listed above — what colors and style to purchase first , how to spend your limited funds on good shoes or shirts , and how to get the most miles out of a small set of clothing .
Please stay tuned !

EXPOSING THE ATHEIST
1
The following articles are samplings of principles that demonstrate atheism is pure heathenism and error .
They present some of the reasons why you should turned away from atheism and nonbelief - to a staunch belief in the Almighty GOD .
I ask you to examine these articles very carefully .
The best way to understand the nature of atheism is to understand its author .
satan is its author .
It 's important to remain conscious of the fact that satan had his origin in heaven , and is thoroughly familiar with the fact of the existence of God , heaven , the angels , hell and etc .
Thus despite what you have been previously deceptively taught and despite the deceptive dictionary 's meaning of atheism , atheism is properly defined as a denial of the existence of God in the midst of full knowledge that the true God does indeed exist .
Atheism knows
God exists ; it is quite familiar with that fact , but it says " under no circumstance or situation will I admit to God 's existence . "
Atheism clearly perceives the fingerprints of God on all of creation , but refuses to admit He is the Creator .
Atheism perceives the divine authorship of the TEN COMMANDMENTS , but refuses to admit that God is their Author .
Atheism perceives the decorousness and perfection of the TEN COMMANDMENTS , but refuses to admit they are superior to all other laws .
Atheism clearly perceives the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ , but refuses to admit His divinity .
If an atheist could see the wounds in the body of Christ and actually feel them with his hands , he would deny that the wounds are there .
Atheism is deliberate effort to never admit the existence of God .
Atheism is the ultimate of satanism .
Ask satan does God exist and he will deny it .
Ask him does satan exist and he will deny his own existence even while in your presence .
Atheism holds the Bible in one hand , but deny its existence by denying its truth with the other .
In order to properly understand the nature of atheism , one must understand the natures of righteousness and sin .
The two principles are antithetical to one another .
Since sin is antithetical to righteousness , its very antithetical nature seeks to nullify righteousness .
Since it is an antithetical principle to righteousness , it must remain true to its nature even in the most insane instances .
Therefore it must hate God even though God is righteous and has given it no just cause for its hatred .
It is this antithetical principle , called " the law of sin " which is at work in the hearts of atheists causing them to reject God .
The law of sin is none other than the law that governs satan 's kingdom .
Below are articles I 've presented in effort to expose the true satanic nature of atheism , the great harm it is doing to the american society and the world community and to prove and demonstrate that atheists and all other nonbelievers in the true God are the actual criminals of the world community .
I hope these articles will enable people to see that atheists are extremely dangerous people .
Therefore laws should be made against them by all the governments of the world community .

ATHEISTS , AGNOSTICS AND NON BELIEVERS ARE THE TRUE CRIMINALS OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY
By : Robert T. Lee
God commands all mankind in the TEN COMMANDMENTS to : " Honor your father and your mother , " " You shall not murder , " " You shall not commit adultery , " " You shall not steal , " " You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor , " and etc , ( Exodus 20:1 - 17 ) .
Is any atheist , agnostic or unbeliever foolish enough to publicly deny the decorousness of those laws ?
OK , there 's no disagreement with the fact that those Laws are righteous and honorable .
But since atheists deny God 's existence , they do n't have the ability to realize that God is the Author of the TEN COMMANDMENTS .
This forces them to attribute their authorship to a human .
But since atheism is opposed to the decorous TEN COMMANDMENTS , even while being forced to deceptively think they were authored by a human , this clearly shows evidence that atheism was and is incapable of authoring , realizing and honoring such decorous and noble laws .
If in the view of the atheist the TEN COMMANDMENTS were authored by a human , and since it is rightly established that those laws are decorous and honorable , but are hated by atheists , and atheists are said to comprise the most " educated " segment of the human race , then it would have taken a more decorous and honorable human to author them than even the most highly educated atheist .
Atheism , by means of its opposition to the decorous TEN COMMANDMENTS is none other than an antithetical principle to God and His Holy Law .
This antithesis is the actual principle at the heart of atheism 's inability to love such decorous laws as : " honor your father and your mother , " " You shall not kill , " and etc .
Therefore , it is right to conclude that atheism is none other than raw depravity - the diabolical principle at work in people who dishonor their parents , murder , lie and commit every other moral crime .
So now you realize that it is atheists ( and other nonbelievers ) who are in favor of putting their " terminally ill " parents to death ; who are in favor of murdering innocent human embryos and fetuses ; who are perpetuating homosexuality , lesbianism , bestiality , pornography , pedophilia and etc ; who are responsible for all the violence in the movie industry ; who are responsible for all the smut on the web ; who bear false witness against the existence of God ; who bear the false testimony that the earth came into being by a cataclysmic explosion ; who bear the false testimony of evolution ; who bear the false testimony that man descended from the ape ; who worship the creature rather than the Creator ; who are responsible for all the moral decline in America and the world community .
Atheists and all other nonbelievers in the true God - regardless of their level of " education " and position in society - are therefore the true criminals of the world community and if there is a sane government , it should treat them accordingly .
ATHEISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUTH CRIME
I 'm sure you are aware of how violent America 's and the world 's community of youths have gotten , even at very young ages .
Consider the following cases : " A 15 years old girl was strung up in a tree and a friend clubbed her to death with a rock for threatening to reveal plans by a group of teens to run away to Florida , police said .
" Snitches get hurt , " the friend told the victim , according to witnesses .
Kimberly Jo Dotts ' body was found by hikers Tuesday in a clearing called Gallows Harbor , named after a hanging in the 19th century .
Her friend , Jessica Holtmeyer , 16 , and Aaron Straw , 18 , were arrested Wednesday , 10 days after the slaying .
They were charged with homicide and are being held in the county jail .
Police said more arrests were possible .
An investigator said other teens were present during the attack but walked away .
Police did get an anonymous call a few days before the body was found , but did not elaborate on what was said .
11 people - the two suspects , Kimberly Jo , her 24 - year - old cousin , Tracy Lewis , and seven teenagers - were planning to run away to Florida , but got angry at Kimberly Jo when she backed out a !
nd threatened to reveal their plans .
The group toyed with Kimberly Jo by putting the noose around her neck , then removing it .
At one point , she was dragged around the wooded clearing by her neck . "

" Three sixth - grade boys had a " hit list " and were plotting to kill fellow classmates on the last day of school in a sniper attack during a false fire alarm , police said .
The plan was modeled after a recent ambush at a Jonesboro , Ark. , school that left five dead , Lt. Dave Todd said .
Police learned of the plan after they responded to a fight at Becky Davis Elementary School in rural St. Charles County Thursday .
Todd said what officers found was far more serious than a schoolyard brawl .
The boys planned to pull a fire alarm and shoot students as they fled the school , Todd said .
He said they got the idea from the March 24 incident in Jonesboro where an 11 - year - old boy and his 13 - year - old friend allegedly opened fire on classmates after pulling an alarm .
Four pupils and a teacher were killed and 10 people were wounded .
The sniper attack was to be carried out June 6 , the last day of school . "

Now do you realize who the people are who are responsible for children having gotten so violent ?
The answer is ATHEISTS and other non-beleivers in the true God .
So you may ask how can this be ?
The reason why they are responsible is because they hate God and teach their children against God ( which is the highest form of child abuse ) .
For example : Atheists hate the TEN COMMANDMENTS because God is their Author .
In the TEN COMMANDMENTS , God commands all mankind not to kill , not to steal , to honor our parents and so forth .
Since atheists hate God and His Commandments , they teach their children and the children they have authority over against God and against His commandments .
There is no other morality other than God 's Moral Law .
God is the Author of all morality .
Since atheists teach children against God 's morality , they have to in turn be teaching them to do the very things God says not to do .
Some of the many ways atheists are doing this are through anti-God and anti-moral parental attitude , violence in the movie and music industries , anti-moral attitude on the web and etc .
All the anti-God and anti-moral attitudes found in these fields come from atheists and other non believers .
ATHEISM - A DOCTRINE OF DEMONS
Imagine that you could listen to or talk face - to - face with satan about any subject that has to do with God .
Then bring to remembrance anything you 've heard atheists say against God .
( Or if you are an atheist , you know your own sentiments and thoughts ) .
Now , if you try , you will find that it is impossible to imagine satan expressing sentiments about God different than what atheists express .
Satan certainly is not going to speak positively about God , and neither are atheists .
So , what both think and verbalize is in complete harmony with one another .
Atheism is therefore a doctrine of demons , and in many , if not all cases , atheists are demon-possessed .
So it is quite possible that when you read the writings of atheists , or heard them speaking , all you heard was demons ranting against God .
We know that no Atheist has the ability to author them
" Honor your father and your mother ... "
" You shall not murder . "
" You shall not steal . "
" You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor " ( Exodus 20:12-13,15,16 ) .
Those are just four of God 's holy TEN COMMANDMENTS which
He has made every person of mankind responsible to obey ( Romans 3:19 ) .
Atheists foolishly deny that God is the Author of the TEN COMMANDMENTS .
They say that they were authored by a human .
Some atheists even deny that the TEN COMMANDMENTS exist ( Romans 2:14 - 15 ) .
So , lets assume ( in order to prove a point here ) that atheists are right .
If a human author them ( and I speak as if insane ) , then we know for sure that no atheist , agnostic nor any other unbeliever had sense enough to author them .
Why is that so ?
Because atheists are OPPOSED to GOD and His Holy COMMANDMENTS .
And again , some even say the TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't exist .
So if a human authored them , it was a person who had far more intelligence than any atheist , agnostic or unbeliever .
However , the deep wisdom contained in the TEN COMMANDMENTS is far beyond human capabilities .
The deep wisdom and righteousness contained in them proves their Divine authorship .

THE BIGGEST FOOLS ON EARTH
In the above articles I 've presented some evidence that shows that even when one foolishly assumes that the TEN COMMANDMENTS were authored by a human , atheism , by virtue of its rejection and enmity against the TEN COMMANDMENTS cannot elevate itself to such a noble height to author such decorous laws as " Honor your father and your mother , " " You shall not murder . "
" You shall not steal , " and etc .
Since atheism is hotly opposed to the TEN COMMANDMENTS and in order for the TEN COMMANDMENTS to have been authored by a human , it would would have require a more sensible , noble and wise human than even the most highly " learned " atheist .
The COMMANDMENTS
I presented in the above paragraph are just three of the latter six of the COMMANDMENTS which atheism could not have authored .
But there are TEN commandments .
Since atheism could not have risen to such a level to author or appreciate any of the latter six of the TEN COMMANDMENTS , it is no wonder that atheists can't understand that God exists -- which pertains to the first four of the commandments .
That is , atheism , by virtue of its inability to author laws on a lower noble level that pertains to the welfare of mankind , could not have risen to a higher level to understand the existence of God so as to devise laws in honor of mankind 's Creator .
These facts explain why atheists interpret the Bible as they do -- as a volume of " babble " and full of nonexistent contradictions .
Atheism is not elevated enough to allow even its most educated subjects to understand the Bible .
Therefore the Bible puzzles them as calculus puzzles the dimwitted .
Atheism make dimwits of all its subjects and makes the most " learned " or " educated " more dimwitted than the ignorant .
Not only does atheism prevent atheists from properly understanding the TEN COMMANDMENTS and the Bible , but it prevents their minds from being elevated enough to understand the simplest common sense facts .
For example :
It is the educated atheist who get the roles of males and females mixed up , and who think homosexuality and lesbianism are normal .
It is the atheist who can't tell whether a human is human while he or she is yet in the womb .
It is the atheist who gets justice mixed up and who thinks the innocent human embryo and fetus should get the penalty of death and the criminal murderer ought to get life for his death worthy crime .
It is the atheist who thinks the terminally ill ought to receive the sentence of death for their noncriminal sicknesses .
It is the atheists who condemns the righteous and exonerates the wicked .
The list of examples can go on and on .
When you talk with atheists , agnostics or any unbelievers in the true God , you are talking with some of the biggest fools on the face of the earth .
The atheist is like one who plucks out his eyes and then tries to see .
He is like one who closes his ears and then tries to hear .
Alas , how true it is that the so called " educated " atheists are the biggest fools on earth !

There 's no greater argument for the existence of God than the truth of His existence .
Atheists completely discount this truth , while challenging every true Christian to present proof .
Since it is impossible to prove the existence of God beyond the fact itself and beyond the overwhelming evidence in all of God 's creation , the type challenge atheists make to Christians is both a foolish challenge and an impossible task for the Christian .
Since atheists recognize that it is impossible to prove the existence of God beyond the truth itself and beyond the overwhelming evidence that they deliberately discount , they blindly and deceptively regard such impossibility as real proof that God doe not exist .
This deceptive principle has been exemplified time - after - time in courts of law .
For example : A person commits a very heinous crime .
All the evidence that prove the person 's guilt is presented in court by the prosecutor .
The evidence overwhelmingly prove the person 's guilt .
However , the criminal denies he committed the crime , and his lawyers , while seeking to deceptively prove his innocence , do all they can to discount the evidence presented by the prosecutor .
And while discounting the evidence , the defense attorneys constantly challenges the prosecutor to prove their client is guilty .
What the defense attorneys do is cleverly discount the evidence in the minds of the jurors and shift focus from the overwhelming evidence to challenging the prosecutor to prove their client 's guilt to the jurors beyond the evidence .
This becomes an impossible task and the jurors are deceived into regarding this impossibility as an inability of the prosecutor to prove that the criminal is guilty .
Therefore the jury regards the criminal as not guilty .
Juries are deceived by this diabolical tactic all the time .

THE FINGERPRINTS OF GOD
All of God 's creation has the fingerprints of God all over it .
These fingerprints witness to the fact that God CREATED or brought into being from nothing the heavens and the earth and all therein .
An atheist sent me email challenging me to prove this fact .
Here is my response to him :
" The fingerprints of God are clearly seen in many ways :
One is the fact that no creature has the ability to CREATE .
Man can take what has already been created and change it or make a mixture of something with what has already been created ; but man as well as every other creature and thing is totally void of the ability to actually BRING INTO BEING SOMETHING FROM NOTHING . "
I challenge any atheist , agnostic , freethinker or unbeliever to show a single simple example of anything any man , creature or thing has brought into existence from nothing .
The only One who has and who can do that is the ALMIGHTY GOD .
Behold the beautiful fingerprints of God !

GOD'S WRATH ABIDES AGAINST ATHEISTS
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of ATHEISTS who suppress the truth in unrighteousness , because that which is known about God is evident within them ; for God made it evident to them .
For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes ,
His eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly seen , being understood through what has been made , so that ATHEISTS are without excuse .
For even though ATHEISTS know God , they do not honor Him as God or give thanks , but they have become futile in their speculations , and their foolish heart are darkened .
Professing to be wise , they are fools , and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four - footed animals and crawling creatures .
Therefore God has given ATHEISTS over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , so that their bodies will be dishonored among them .
For they exchange the truth of God for a lie , and worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever .
Amen .
For this reason God has given them over to degrading passions ; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural , and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another , men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error .
And just as ATHEISTS do not see fit to acknowledge God , God has given them over to a depraved mind , to do those things which are not proper , being filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , greed , evil ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malice ; they are gossips , slanderers , haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boastful , inventors of evil , disobedient to parents , without understanding , untrustworthy , unloving , unmerciful ; and although ATHEISTS know the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , they not only do the same , but also give hearty approval to those who practice them .
England coach Fabio Capello has included injured the Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry in his provisional 30 - man World Cup squad .
Sunderland 's Darren Bent and West Ham United 's Scott Parker are also named , while Jamie Carragher and Ledley King are included among the defenders in the 30 - man squad .
But there is no place for Manchester United 's Owen Hargreaves , or the Fulham striker Bobby Zamora .
Neither Carragher nor King has played under Capello , although the Tottenham Hotspur man was called into the squad for a double header against Slovakia and the Ukraine last year .
However , with doubts over Rio Ferdinand and John Terry , and Wes Brown and Joleon Lescott ruled out through injury , Capello has talked Carragher out of retirement and will have a look at the Liverpool man , plus King , who has just played four games in 15 days , before finalising his 23 - man squad for South Africa .
" The FA got in touch a few weeks ago and asked if I would have a rethink , due to injury problems .
I said I would make myself available , " explained Carragher .
" The World Cup and Champions League are the highest levels of football .
I 'm not getting any younger , we have no Champions League football next season and I am keen to work under Fabio Capello . "
Joe Cole also features , despite not having been involved since the win over Croatia in September 2008 .
Manchester City's Adam Johnson is one of two uncapped players – the other being Tottenham 's Michael Dawson .
Among the other players who were mentioned as candidates but did not receive a call were Phil Jagielka , Gary Neville , Stewart Downing , Gabriel Agbonlahor , Ashley Young and Carlton Cole .
But missing out on today 's squad does not necessarily end all hope of reaching the World Cup .
Once his final 23 - man party is named after the second of two forthcoming friendlies , against Japan in Graz on 30 May , Capello can still make changes due to injury , and those replacements do not have to come out of the original 30 .
England 's 30 - man provisional squad
Goalkeepers : Joe Hart , David James , Robert Green .
Defenders : Leighton Baines , Jamie Carragher , Ashley Cole , Michael Dawson , Rio Ferdinand , Glen Johnson , Ledley King , John Terry , Matthew Upson , Stephen Warnock .
Midfielders : Gareth Barry , Michael Carrick , Joe Cole , Steven Gerrard , Tom Huddlestone , Adam Johnson , Frank Lampard , Aaron Lennon , James Milner , Scott Parker , Theo Walcott , Shaun Wright - Phillips .
Forwards : Darren Bent , Peter Crouch , Jermain Defoe , Emile Heskey , Wayne Rooney .

As the NFL Draft gets under way , one of the hot topics inside the league is the growing number of top prospects who have admitted smoking pot or have been caught doing so .
Based on information obtained from NFL team executives , agents , scouts and trainers , just under one - third of the 327 players who attended this year 's NFL pre-draft scouting camp , or combine , had some incident involving marijuana turn up in interviews or background checks — which NFL teams collect and share before and during the event .
This number represents ...
OVER the weekend , I mentioned some research indicating that rapid population growth can tighten housing markets , helping to reduce the incidence of liquidity traps .
As it happens , population trends might also shape the path of equity returns :
Geanakopoulos and his co-authors consider an overlapping generation model in which the demographic structure mimics the pattern of live births in the US , that have featured alternating twenty - year periods of boom and busts .
They conjecture that the life - cycle portfolio behaviour – which suggests that agents should borrow when young , invest for retirement when middle - aged , and live off their investment once they are retired – plays an important role in determining equilibrium asset prices .
Consumption smoothing by the agents , given the assumed demographic structure , requires that when the middle - aged to young population ratio is small , there will be excess demand for consumption by a large cohort of retirees and for the market to clear , equilibrium prices of financial assets should adjust , i.e. decrease .
The result is that saving is encouraged for the middle - aged .
As the dividend / price ratio is negatively related to fluctuations in prices , he model predicts a negative relation between this variable and the middle - aged - to - young ratio .
In a recent CEPR Discussion Paper ( Favero et al. 2010 ) , we take the Geanakopoulos et al. model to the data via the conjecture that fluctuations in the middle - aged - to - young ratio could capture a slowly evolving mean in the dividend price ratio within the dynamic dividend growth model .
We find strong evidence in favour of using this variable together with the dividend / price ratio in long - run forecasting regressions for stock market returns ...
Somewhat reminiscent of a 2005 paper by Dean Baker , Brad DeLong , and Paul Krugman :
We in America are probably facing a demographic transition — a slowdown in the rate of natural population increase — and possibly facing a slowdown in productivity growth as well .
If these two factors do in fact push down the rate of economic growth in the future , is it still prudent to assume that the past performance of assets is an indication of future results ?
We argue “ no . ” Simple standard closed - economy growth models predict that growth slowdowns are likely to lower the marginal product of capital , and thus the long - run rate of return .
Moreover , if you assume that current asset valuations represent rational expectations , simple arithmetic tells us that it is next to impossible for past rates of return to continue through a forthcoming growth slowdown .
Only a large shift in the distribution of income toward capital or current account surpluses larger than those of nineteenth century Britain sustained for generations give promise for reconciling a slowdown in future economic growth with a continuation of historical asset returns .
More attention should probably be paid to the effect of long - wave demographic shifts on markets and economies , as especially on divergent reactions to shocks .

Times are tough , which is why most Americans are taking their coffee with two tablespoons of cheap .
Inexpensive coffee is being poured by the bucketload at fast food restaurants like McDonalds , with its successful McCafe line , and Burger King , which is planning a nationwide Seattle 's Best roll - out this summer .
Even slightly swankier Starbucks is offering totally credible coffee that 's no more than a buck and change .
So what could possibly make a cup of joe worth $ 13 ?
According to Jay Caragay , speaking to The Baltimore Sun , it 's " very fruity , juicy , good mouth feel , [ and ] full bodied . "
And Caragay should know , because it's his Baltimore coffee ship Spro that 's selling a 12 - ounce cup for $ 13 .
Apparently , even during lean times there are fat cats prowling for novel luxuries .
For that much money , one might expect the coffee to be served in a Swarovski crystal goblet , or brewed in an expensive brass machine with dozens of tubes and loud , steam - spewing valves .
But how you brew is n't as important as what you brew , according to Alan Kaiser of the National Coffee Association .
He claims the quality and flavor of your coffee is as dependent on the type of coffee you select , as it is the brewing process .
So it 's all about the bean .
For instance , Spro uses Aida Grand Reserve , which is grown in El Salvador by Aida Battle .
Once brewed , this bean is almost worth $ 1 an ounce .
The most expensive coffee bean in the world is the legendary Kopi Luwak , a bean that is eaten , partially digested , and excreted by the rodent - like Common palm civet .
These legendary beans are worth $ 600 a pound , or $ 50 a brewed cup .
So what does a pricey quaff of coffee taste like ?
Caroline Bell is the co-owner of high - end coffee shop , Cafe Grumpy , in Brooklyn , New York .
It 's sold a $ 9 cup of coffee -- Panama Hacienda Esmeralda -- that was high in demand , in limited supply , and therefore , expensive .
Expensive , but special .
" The cup was very balanced , with slight orange notes .
It had a clean finish , " says Bell .
Bell adds that a great cup of coffee is " dynamic . "
" In the start and through the finish , in the aroma and in the taste , you can identify many different notes . "
To the uninitiated , a fancy cup of coffee should taste bright , and balanced .
It changes as it cools ; in some instances the coffee can become sweeter .
An experienced coffee palette is able to discern various pronounced flavor characteristics .
And milk and cream are a no - no .
Unless , according to Bell , you 're drinking the instant stuff .
Which is good in a pinch if you need a caffeine fix ... or just love the taste of saving money .

WASHINGTON —
In the hope of expanding a controversial form of organ donation into emergency rooms around the United States , a federally funded project has begun trying to obtain kidneys , livers , and possibly other body parts from car accident victims , heart attack fatalities , and other urgent - care patients .
Using a $ 321,000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services , the emergency departments at the University of Pittsburgh Medical CenterPresbyterian Hospital and Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh have started rapidly identifying donors among patients doctors are unable to save and taking steps to preserve their organs so a transplant team can rush to try to retrieve them .
Obtaining organs from emergency room patients has long been considered off - limits in the United States because of ethical and logistical concerns .
This pilot project aims to investigate whether it is feasible and encourage other hospitals nationwide to follow if it is .
Neither hospital has gotten any usable organs .
“ This is about helping people who have declared themselves to be donors , but die in a place where donation is currently not possible , ’’ said Clifton Callaway , an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh who is leading the project .
“ It ’s also about helping the large number of people awaiting transplants who could die waiting because of the shortage of organs . ’’
Critics say the program represents a troubling attempt to bring a questionable form of organ procurement into an even more ethically dicey situation : the tumultuous environment of an ER , where more than ever it raises the specter of doctors preying on dying patients for their organs .
“ There ’s a fine line between methods that are pioneering and methods that are predatory , ’’ said Leslie Whetstine , a bioethicist at Walsh University in Ohio .
“ This seems to me to be in the latter category .
It ’s ghoulish . ’’
For decades , most hearts , lungs , kidneys , livers , and other organs obtained for transplants in the United States have come from patients who have been pronounced dead in a hospital after a complete cessation of brain activity , known as brain death , was carefully determined .
But because thousands of people die each year waiting for organ transplants , the federal government has begun promoting an alternative that involves surgeons taking organs , within minutes , from patients whose hearts have stopped beating but who have not been declared brain - dead .
The faster organs are retrieved , the better the chances they will be useable .
Although increasingly common , the practice remains controversial because of questions about whether organ preservation and removal might begin before patients are technically dead , and because of fears that doctors might not do everything possible to save patients and may even hasten their deaths , to increase the chance of obtaining organs .

A top Russian official Thursday dismissed criticism from the Iranian president as “ emotional , ” and expressed frustration over what he portrayed as Tehran ’s obstinate refusal to confront suspicions over its nuclear program .
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov lashed back at Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who a day earlier described the Kremlin as a potential enemy that was overly susceptible to pressures from the international community .
" Russia has never been manipulated by anyone , ” Lavrov told reporters .
“ It has always been guided by national interests . ”
The many attempts made by various levels of Russian leadership to help Iran end the impasse are too numerous to name , Lavrov said .
“ Years , not months , have been spent on that , ” he said .
“ Iran ’s response was unsatisfactory , to say the least . ”
On Wednesday , Ahmadinejad accused Russian President Dmitry Medvedev of bending to U.S. pressure to pass new United Nations sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program .
“ Our people are in doubt about Russia ’s intentions , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ I hope that the Russian leaders would take into consideration our sympathy and keep the Iranian nation from counting them among its historic enemies . ”
The Russian leadership was outraged by his remarks .
A Kremlin aide , foreign policy advisor Sergei Prikhodko , on Wednesday accused Ahmadinejad of “ political demagoguery . ”
The rhetoric reflects a new depth of Moscow ’s impatience with Tehran , which has long depended on Russia and China , both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , to blunt Western pressure .
After resisting for years , the Kremlin has come around reluctantly to the notion of imposing tougher sanctions on Iran , where Russia has developed thriving trade partnerships and built a nuclear reactor .
Moscow has generally supported a nuclear fuel swap deal struck last week by Iran with Turkey and Brazil and presented as a possible way forward .
The United States has dismissed the deal as a ploy to buy time and avoid sanctions .
Lavrov also expressed reservations Thursday .
There was no “ 100 % guarantee ” that Tehran would uphold its obligations under the deal , Lavrov said .
He pointed out that much of the recent agreement was recycled from a proposal made in 2009 by the International Atomic Energy Agency , and criticized Iran for wasting time by rejecting the earlier offer .
But it was n’t all tough talk .
The deliberate ambivalence that has long characterized Moscow ’s stand on Iran was still in full view Thursday as Russian officials made a deliberate show of calling for further negotiations to help Iran sidestep sanctions .
Despite the sharp tone from the podium , Lavrov phoned his Iranian counterpart and pledged to “ actively work to promote ” further nuclear talks , the Foreign Ministry said .
Moscow has long maintained an essentially noncommittal position , cutting trade deals with Tehran while also accepting the courtship of the United States and Israel to join the Western camp seeking sanctions .
On Thursday , another Russian official hastened to explain that new sanctions would have no bearing on existing trade deals with Iran .
“ It is most important to us that the possible sanctions that could follow the passage of this resolution should not affect the existing contracts , ” Mikhail Margelov , Russian Federation Council Foreign Affairs Committee chairman , told Interfax news agency .

Stephen Byers , the former transport secretary , today insisted he had complied with the MPs ' code of conduct after a group of Labour MPs were targeted in an elaborate sting operation in which journalists set up a bogus lobbying company and offered to pay them in return for political influence .
Byers , an arch Blairite , was filmed describing himself as a " bit like a sort of cab for hire " and offering to trade Westminster contacts for £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 a day .
Amid condemnation from senior cabinet ministers , the Labour party tried to limit the damage by saying some MPs were " mortified " by how stupid they had been , and promising a crackdown on lobbying by former ministers , rushing forward a manifesto pledge for tighter regulation and monitoring .
Others who were targeted in the undercover operation included former cabinet ministers Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt .
Margaret Moran , Labour MP for Luton South , was also involved .
The chancellor , Alistair Darling , said it was ridiculous that the MPs had been caught out in the sting .
He told BBC1's Andrew Marr show : " The best answer when you get a call like that is to put the receiver back down again .
It 's obvious .
" There are rules about serving MPs ‑ we 've said that we 're going to have to , I think , get a statutory - backed code of contact to deal with former ministers .
But really , what on earth did they think they were doing ?
And equally for a company , you do n't need a lobbyist .
If you 've got something to say , go directly to the government department and make your case .
It 's just ridiculous . "
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , said he was appalled by today 's revelations .
He told Sky News : " There is absolutely no room for anyone to trade on their ministerial office .
People come into politics ‑ whether Labour , Tory or Lib Dem – because of what they want to do for the country .
And I believe that 's true for MPs across all parties , I do n't think this is a partisan point .
" Anything which sullies that reputation or gets in the way of that public service is completely inimical .
I think it 's right that we have tightened up the rules already ... but the Labour manifesto is going to say more about the need for a statutory register of the lobbying industry , because there is absolutely no room for the sort of innuendo or promises that seem to have been floated in this case . "
In the sting , 20 MPs were invited to attend meetings to discuss joining an advisory board and 10 turned up .
The meetings were mainly held at offices in London 's St James 's Square .
An undercover Sunday Times journalist asked them how the company could go about influencing policy and how it could improve its chances of winning a government contract .
In a statement issued this afternoon , Byers said : " I am confident that any investigation from the standards commissioner will confirm that I have always fully complied with the MPs ' code of conduct .
I have never lobbied ministers on behalf of commercial organisations and have always fully disclosed my outside interests . "
Byers had told the bogus lobbyists he had saved hundreds of millions of pounds for National Express through his contact with Lord Adonis , the transport minister , and had influenced food labelling proposals for Tesco after phoning Lord Mandelson , the business secretary .
The MP said that his friendship with Mandelson was one of his " trump cards " .
However , the next day he sent an email to the meeting 's organisers saying he had " overstated " the part he had played in trying to secure changes to the way in which the government deals with issues .
" This means that I have not spoken to Andrew Adonis … or Peter Mandelson about the matters I mentioned , " he wrote .
Byers issued a statement last night saying that at an informal meeting about a potential job opportunity he had made some exaggerated claims .
" Having reflected on my comments I knew that I should immediately put the record straight .
I did so the following morning by making it clear that I have never lobbied ministers on behalf of commercial interests .
I later withdrew my name for consideration .
I have always fully disclosed my outside interests , " he said .
Byers described the set - up as a " massive deception " .
A statement issued by Adonis 's office today said : " There is no truth whatsoever in the suggestion that Stephen Byers came to any arrangement with Andrew Adonis on any matter relating to National Express .
It is equally untrue to suggest that National Express were allowed by the government to avoid any of their rail contract obligations . "
A spokesman for Tesco said : " We did not speak to Mr Byers on food labelling , regulation or indeed any other issue .
These claims are completely fictitious and Mr Byers has acknowledged this to us . "
The operation features in a Dispatches programme to be aired tomorrow on Channel 4 .
The journalists set up a lobbying company known as Anderson Perry Associates , supposedly based in the US .
Its website described it as a " bespoke consultancy that helps organisations and individuals maximise and exceed expectation " .
It claimed to have 120 clients in Europe , the Middle East and the US , operating in the health and defence industries .
Another of those filmed was the ex-health secretary Patricia Hewitt , who said she " completely rejected " the suggestion that she helped obtain a key seat on a government advisory group for a client paying her £ 3,000 a day .
She stressed that the role she had been discussing would only have been taken up after she stepped down as an MP at the imminent election , and insisted there was " nothing unusual or improper in the business appointments that I have taken up since leaving government " .
Hoon said he had not offered to lobby government , nor had he broken any rules .
" I was written to by what seemed to be a reputable American company .
They had a website , and addresses in both the United States and St James 's Square , London , " he said in a statement .
" I was asked to visit their offices to have what they described as ' an informal chat ' .
This took place after the announcement of my decision to leave parliament before the next election .
I have not been a minister since June 2009 .
" In the course of what I assumed to be a private conversation , I was asked whether I might be interested in joining the advisory board of a UK company that they were thinking of establishing .
" There was a discussion about my qualifications and experience for such a position .
I made clear in the course of the conversation that I would not lobby government and that I was not interested in work of that kind .
" At no stage did I offer , nor would I attempt to sell confidential or privileged information arising from my time in government .
I did not break any parliamentary or ministerial rules in the course of the conversation . "
Hoon told the undercover reporter he was interested in " translating my knowledge and contacts about the international scene into something that frankly makes money " .
But he went on : " I do not want to be seen to leave politics and go back as some sort of lobbyist .
I am quite happy with strategic advice ... and in the right circumstance I do n't mind leading a delegation in to see a minister , but that 's not what I want to spend my life doing . "
The exposé is likely to thrust the issue of standards back to the heart of the election campaign as party leaders battle to show they will clean up parliament .
David Cameron promised tougher controls last month , warning that secret corporate lobbying was the " next big scandal waiting to happen " in Westminster after expenses .
He wants ministers to be forced to wait two years after leaving government before being allowed to lobby – twice the present limit – and harsher penalties for those who breach the rules .
Tony Wright , the Labour MP who chairs the select committee which called for a statutory register , welcomed the government 's change of policy .
" Our report both made the case for effective regulation of lobbying and showed how it could be done .
We need to know who is lobbying whom about what , and that needs a statutory register .
This is becoming normal in many other countries but we said at the time that it would probably take a lobbying scandal before we got action here .
Now that we have had a scandal , let 's hope effective action of the kind we proposed will follow . "
KHIMKI , Russia — Mikhail Beketov had been warned , but would not stop writing .
About dubious land deals .
Crooked loans .
Under - the - table hush money .
All evidence , he argued in his newspaper , of rampant corruption in this Moscow suburb .
“ Last spring , I called for the resignation of the city ’s leadership , ” Mr. Beketov said in one of his final editorials .
“ A few days later , my automobile was blown up .
What is next for me ? ”
Not long after , he was savagely beaten outside his home and left to bleed in the snow .
His fingers were bashed , and three later had to be amputated , as if his assailants had sought to make sure that he would never write another word .
He lost a leg .
Now 52 , he is in a wheelchair , his brain so damaged that he cannot utter a simple sentence .
The police promised a thorough investigation , but barely looked up from their desks .
Surveillance videos were ignored .
Neighbors were not interviewed .
Information about politicians ’ displeasure with Mr. Beketov was deemed “ unconfirmed , ” according to interviews with officials and residents .
Aston Villa Owner Randy Lerner : We Are Aiming For The Champions League Next Season
Chairman 's desire is 'as alive as ever '
However , the amiable American also stressed that spending vast amounts of money , similar to Manchester City , is not the answer .
Villa were pressing for a top four spot this season until two defeats in the final two games condemned them to sixth .
" The ambition and appetite to compete for the top four spot and qualify for Europe is as alive and well as it's ever been , ” Lerner told the official Aston Villa website .
" Exactly how to do that is a little bit more of an open question than simply spend to get there .
" I think from an anecdotal perspective , if it was simply spend to get there then the composition of the top four might actually be slightly different .
" I think there are other strengths that yield likelihoods of getting there - continuity of the manager , being able to target a player , bring him along and be acknowledged as Young Player of the Year , anecdotally - speaking .
" I guess it 's my way to try and say that yes , the appetite and ambition to get there is very real and exactly what the path is and whether it's as brutally raw to spend there and get there is an open question in my mind . ”
Yet , despite talks of Villa boss Martin O’Neill working under a sell - before - you - buy policy this summer , Lerner will back his manager if the opportunity to bring in players of the required quality arises .
" There ' a sell - to - buy policy in nearly every organisation on the planet .
It 's good business to try to sell to buy , ” continued Lerner .
" On the other hand , if opportunities arise in which the net number of sell - to - buy does n't equal what is required to take advantage of an opportunity , then you may spend the money . "

Ballack was injured in the 35th minute of the FA Cup final
Germany captain Michael Ballack has been ruled out of this summer 's World Cup because of the right ankle injury he suffered in Saturday 's FA Cup final .
The 33 - year - old Chelsea midfielder has made 98 appearances for his country and played in the last two World Cups .
A scan showed damage to two ligaments but it is expected to be eight weeks before he can resume training and Germany 's first match is on 13 June .
" It 's bitter to get a diagnosis like that before the World Cup , " he said .
Ballack was injured after a challenge by Portsmouth 's Kevin - Prince Boateng .
Ironically , Boateng could be part of the Ghana squad that will face Germany in Group D at the finals in South Africa .
606 : DEBATE
Surely that was his last chance at winning the World Cup
Mad_for_Chelsea
The former Tottenham player was born in Germany and represented German youth teams but chose to play for Ghana , his father 's country of birth .
After Fifa removed the age limit for players who want to switch national allegiance , the 23 - year - old was cleared to appear for Ghana in the finals and has been named in a provisional 30 - man squad .
The Portsmouth midfielder 's late tackle in the 35th minute of Chelsea 's Cup final victory at Wembley led to Ballack limping off .
An early X - ray at the stadium showed no broken bones but a further scan in Germany on Monday highlighted the full extent of the problem .
The German Football Federation said Ballack 's right ankle will be placed in a cast and he will have to wear a special shoe for two weeks after the cast is removed .
A Chelsea statement confirmed : " The German national team doctor Hans - Wilhelm Muller - Wohlfahrt , estimates the earliest possible return to training for the player is in eight weeks . "
Ballack , who joined Chelsea in 2006 after four years with Bayern Munich , sustained a tear of one ankle ligament and a partial tear of another .
" There 's naturally a lot of disappointment , " he said .
" But that 's football .
That happens .
Life goes on . "
Germany coach Joachim Loew said : " We were all naturally shocked this morning when we got the news .
I talked to Michael .
He 's deeply disappointed .
He put all his energy and power into playing in this World Cup .
" He 's near his 100th cap .
That would have been a match in Frankfurt against Bosnia .
" That 's an immense disappointment for him to not be able to play in this World Cup . "
Loew hopes the setback might galvanise his squad as the World Cup unfolds and added : " I called the team together and spoke with the team and passed along the information .
" It 's very , very unfortunate for us .
But it shows we have to pull all our strength together and look forward .
We 've got a lot of young players .
" We 've now got to get to that point that our younger players get this self - confidence and can grew into the roles . "
Boateng 's half - brother Jerome , the Hamburg defender , is in the German provisional squad and the coach has requested that he is not targeted by fans and the media .
" I have spoken with Jerome Boateng , " Loew explained .
" I told him that we absolutely unreservedly stand by him .

Introduction
For the first several hundred years of research in cellular biology , the main bottleneck to scientific progress was data collection .
Our newfound data - richness , however , has shifted this bottleneck from collection to analysis [ 1 ] .
While a variety of options exists for examining any one experimental dataset , we are still discovering what new biological questions can be answered by mining thousands of genomic datasets in tandem , potentially spanning different molecular activities , technological platforms , and model organisms .
As an analogy , consider the difference between searching one document for a keyword and executing an online search .
While the tasks are conceptually similar , they require vastly different underlying methodologies , and they have correspondingly large differences in their potentials for knowledge discovery .
Large - scale genomic data mining is thus the process of using many ( potentially diverse ) datasets , often from public repositories , to address a specific biological question .
Statistical meta-analyses are an excellent example , in which many experimental results are examined in order to lend statistical power to a hypothesis test ( e.g. , for differential expression ) [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
As the amount of available genomic data grows , however , exploratory methods allowing hypothesis generation are also becoming more prevalent .
The ArrayExpress Gene Expression Atlas , for example , allows users to examine hundreds of experimental factors across thousands of independent experimental results [ 4 ] .
In most cases , though , an investigator with a specific question in mind must collect relevant data to bring to bear on a question of interest .
Some examples might be :
If you 've obtained a gene set of interest , in which tissues or cell lines are they coexpressed ?
If you assay a particular cellular environment , are there other experimental conditions that incur a similar genomic response ?
If you have high - specificity , low - throughput data for a few genes , with what other genes do they interact or coexpress in high - throughput data repositories ?
Under what experimental conditions , or in which tissues ?
Bringing large quantities of genomic data to bear on such questions involves three main tasks : establishing methodology for efficiently querying large data collections ; assembling data from appropriate repositories ; and integrating information from a variety of experimental data types .
Since the technical [ 5 ] – [ 7 ] and methodological [ 8 ] – [ 10 ] challenges in heterogeneous data integration have been discussed elsewhere , this introduction will focus mainly on the first two points .
As discussed below , the computational requirements for processing thousands of whole - genome datasets in a reasonable amount of time must be addressed , either algorithmically or using cloud or distributed computing [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
Subsequently , data collection is sometimes easy — as is increasingly the case for high - throughput sequencing , individual experiments can themselves be the sources of large data repositories .
In other cases , a biological investigation might benefit from the inclusion of substantial external or public data .
Methods and Pitfalls in Manipulating Genomic Data
A point that must be emphasized when dealing with very large genomic data collections is that many convenient computational tools for individual dataset analysis will scale poorly to repositories of hundreds or thousands of genome - scale experimental results .
Scripting environments such as R / Bioconductor [ 13 ] and MATLAB ( The MathWorks ) should be used with caution to avoid excessive runtimes .
Similarly , data storage can be as great or greater a concern as data processing : plain text or XML storage formats , while conveniently human - readable , can waste unsustainable amounts of space for large repositories .
Solutions to these technical issues include software and data access methodologies specifically tailored to large - scale data manipulation .
Three broad categories of solutions exist :
Web applications that aggregate information from multiple sources , programmatic APIs that allow sophisticated computational queries of individual large data sources , and do - it - yourself solutions that rely on manually obtaining and processing bulk data from public repositories .
In the first category , most current bioinformatic systems include online interfaces , but these generally provide analyses of individual datasets rather than large compendia .
Notable exceptions include the STRING [ 14 ] and BioMart [ 15 ] tools , which aggregate a large number of functional and sequence annotation data sources , respectively .
Integrated results and data portals are also available for many model organisms , including HEFalMp [ 16 ] , Endeavour [ 17 ] , and the Prioritizer [ 18 ] for human data , integrated within- [ 19 ] and across-species [ 20 ] results for Caenorhabditis elegans , bioPIXIE [ 21 ] and SPELL [ 22 ] for Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and a variety of tools for other systems [ 23 ] – [ 25 ] .
While these online tools provide pre-computed data mining results , a second option is to perform tailored queries of experimental results from one or more large public repositories .
This adds a level of complexity , since you must still decide on appropriate downstream analyses of the retrieved data , but the heavy lifting of data normalization , filtering , and search is still done by the remote system .
Manual portals to such information are the core of canonical interfaces at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [ 26 ] and European Bioinformatics Institute [ 27 ] , and workflow systems such as Taverna [ 28 ] and Galaxy [ 29 ] are emerging to automate significant portions of these analysis pipelines .
Most major data repositories now offer programmable interfaces using one of several common protocols : HTTP ( i.e. , programmatic URLs or REST ) [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , SOAP [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , or bioinformatic services such as DAS [ 7 ] , BioMOBY [ 32 ] , or Gaggle [ 33 ] .
These protocols provide a way to pose sophisticated queries to a data repository , leaving you to examine only the end products of interest .
The greatest level of flexibility in large - scale biological data mining is offered by manually processing bulk experimental data , which of course also incurs the greatest level of time commitment and overhead .
However , this is currently one of the only ways in which sophisticated multifactorial queries can be executed .
If you 're interested in identifying potential targets of yeast cell cycle kinases under a variety of culture growth conditions , even a relatively complex large - scale computational screen will likely be simpler than running new corresponding high - throughput assays :
By examining the S. cerevisiae Gene Ontology ( GO ) [ 34 ] annotations at the Saccharomyces Genome Database [ 35 ] , we find that the intersection between the cell cycle process ( 669 genes ) and the protein kinase activity function ( 135 genes , both terms downloadable at AmiGO [ 36 ] ) yields a list of 51 genes .
By downloading the DIP [ 37 ] , MINT [ 38 ] , and bioGRID [ 39 ] interaction databases ( discussed below ) in bulk and searching for all interactions in which these genes ' products participate , we obtain 7,830 potential kinase - target pairs .
By downloading all Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) [ 40 ] yeast expression data in bulk ( also discussed below ) , calculating all normalized correlations using Sleipnir ( [ 11 ] , a calculation taking < 1h ) , and listing only correlations stringently significant at a corrected 0.01 level ( p = 1.2×10 −5 , z = 4.22 ) , we find 81 cell cycle kinase - target pairs with high correlation under some experimental condition .
It is vital to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions , although since GO was used as part of the input data , care must be taken to avoid a circular evaluation .
In this case , the non-kinase interaction partners were predicted solely based on experimental interactions and coexpression , and we find that 45 of them ( ∼25 % , hypergeometric p < 10−8 ) indeed have known roles in the cell cycle .
Note that in each of these steps , experimental data of several different types is processed using a uniform network model , and this workflow for large - scale biological data analysis is summarized in Figure 1 ; a description of the analysis is provided in Box 1 and detailed commands are listed in Text S1 .
This small example is obviously biologically somewhat naive , but it demonstrates the remarkably nuanced questions that can be answered using large - scale data mining even without complex machine learning methodology .

Note that both the “ output ” pathway model and the “ input ” experimental data are represented as networks : directed regulatory binding site targets , undirected weighted coexpression , and undirected interactions , respectively .
As demonstrated by the sample analysis in Box 1 , biological networks provide a uniform framework within which both experimental data and predicted models can be represented , facilitating integrative analyses .

Retrieve lists of known yeast cell cycle and protein kinase genes from the Gene Ontology [ 34 ] using the AmiGO [ 36 ]
Web service .
Intersect these two gene sets to find protein kinases potentially involved in the cell cycle .
Retrieve lists of experimentally determined protein–protein interactions from the DIP [ 37 ] , MINT [ 38 ] , and bioGRID [ 39 ] databases .
Map all appropriate gene identifiers to gene symbols using information from BioMart [ 15 ] .
Taking the union of these three databases , identify any pairs of interacting proteins in which at least one partner is a member of the cell cycle protein kinase list .
Note that this will provide a conservative underestimate , since many transient kinase–target interactions are difficult to detect based on high - throughput data .
Retrieve yeast expression data from GEO [ 40 ] and convert each dataset into a normalized coexpression network using the Sleipnir software [ 11 ] .
Extract all gene pairs correlated above a multiple hypothesis corrected 0.01 significance level , and intersect these pairs with the list of cell cycle protein kinase interactions .
This produces a list of potential cell cycle - linked phosphorylation targets that is based on protein kinases known to be involved in the cell cycle , interacting with the putative target , and coexpressing strongly with it under some experimental condition .
Finally , evaluate the proposed list 's plausibility by examining how many of the non-kinase partners are known cell cycle genes .
Unsurprisingly , a number of common technical pitfalls arise in large - scale data analysis .
Even structured databases can break down in the face of thousands of whole - genome interactomes , leading most current large - scale data repositories to employ some combination of file system - based flat file storage archives and binary formats ( including GenBank 's ASN.1 PER [ 26 ] , BioHDF [ 41 ] , and Sleipnir 's DAB [ 11 ] ) .
Data transfer mechanisms for bulk data are often limited to FTP or Aspera ( http://www.asperasoft.com), although experimental metadata is often available through sophisticated programmable interfaces [ 40 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
Several reviews have been written dealing with inter-study data normalization [ 8 ] , [ 44 ] , particularly for microarrays [ 45 ] – [ 47 ] — although perhaps the simplest yet most important normalizations required are often chromosomal coordinates and gene , transcript , and protein identification schemes [ 48 ] .
Genomic Data Resources
Three practical impediments to large - scale integrative data mining are data availability , data size , and algorithms and models for integration .
As discussed above , the challenges inherent in manipulating large data can often be overcome through compact encodings and awareness of efficiency issues .
Similarly , although many sophisticated systems for biological data integration exist [ 8 ] – [ 10 ] , [ 49 ] , they are not always necessary in order to discover new biology in large data collections .
As demonstrated by the toy analysis above , simply asking the right questions of several different data repositories can rapidly generate novel biological hypotheses .
It remains to discover and catalog the availability and scope of these repositories ; the annual Nucleic Acids Research database issue [ 50 ] is an excellent resource for this , as are online database aggregators ( e.g. , [ 51 ] – [ 53 ] and http://biodatabase.org), and several primary biological data types and sources are presented here in summary .
High - Throughput Sequencing Next - generation short - read DNA sequencing is rapidly becoming a current - generation technology and producing ever - longer read lengths .
While the purpose of this manuscript is not to address the ( serious ) informatic requirements needed for processing raw sequence data , several points raised by [ 1 ] are worth summarizing .
Current sequencers can generate up to 400 million 50 – 100 - bp reads per run , and this number will be obsolete soon after this manuscript is published .
Performing even the simplest analyses on this data , let alone assembly , polymorphism detection , annotation , or other complex tasks , requires sophisticated computational hardware and software .
Few cookie - cutter solutions are available , given how rapidly the technology continues to change , but online forums such as SEQanswers ( http://seqanswers.com) are currently one of the best resources for up - to - date information on short - read sequencing .
When investigating individual organisms ' genomes ( discussed below in more detail ) , many of the tools for large - scale sequence mining are focused on the study of variation : across disease state , tissue , or pathogen samples ( e.g. , The Cancer Genome Atlas [ 54 ] and the Cancer Genome Project [ 55 ] ) , structurally or polymorphically across individuals ( e.g. , the 1,000 Genomes Project [ 56 ] and the Personal Genome Project [ 57 ] ) , or phylogenetically across species ( e.g. , Genome 10 K [ 58 ] ) .
Particularly for phylogeny and evolutionary relationships , a variety of tools are available online that efficiently summarize very large sequence collections ; EMBOSS [ 59 ] , MEGA [ 60 ] , MEGAN [ 61 ] , and mothur [ 62 ] are only a few of the creatively named systems available in this area .
An interesting large - scale data mining opportunity afforded by modern sequencing techniques is provided by metagenomic repositories such as CAMERA [ 63 ] , MG - RAST [ 64 ] , and IMG / M [ 65 ] , all of which offer tools for inter-study comparisons of multiple environmental or microfloral datasets .
For instance , an experimenter can easily upload an entire metagenome to MG - RAST and receive a detailed profile of the community 's metabolic potential ; using CAMERA , fragment recruitment profiles can be generated comparing any pair of metagenomes .
Simultaneously considering the functional diversity of a metagenome , its constituent organisms , and the associated experimental metadata allows a single analysis to scale from molecular mechanisms to global ecology [ 66 ] .
Whole - Genome Sequences
The first widely used large - scale biological data repositories were ( arguably ) for reads deposited during the Human Genome Project and other pioneering sequencing projects , and these remain important sources of annotated genomic sequences .
GenBank [ 67 ] has diversified to include a variety of online and offline tools such as the Genome Workbench , and Ensembl [ 68 ] provides an invaluable online window into a number of genome builds .
The Sanger Institute hosts a number of additional genome resources ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/), and the Joint Genome Institute provides several microbial genomes and associated tools [ 69 ] .
Sequence annotations have been reviewed elsewhere [ 70 ] and include everything from open reading frames through regulatory sites to chromatin structure and epigenetics ; much of this information is available through a uniform interface at the UCSC Genome Browser [ 71 ] .
Sequence data have been highly standardized over the years , with most raw sequences provided as FASTA or its variants , detailed annotations provided as GenBank / EMBL files , and brief annotations as GFFs .
Most sequence manipulation software will recognize all of these formats [ 72 ] .
Microarrays Similarly , gene expression microarrays were the first functional data to be analyzed on a large scale , although applications of high - throughput sequencing are poised to overtake them in widespread data availability .
The GEO [ 40 ] and ArrayExpress [ 42 ] databases are the most common sources of array data , with Celsius [ 73 ] , field - specific resources such as Oncomine [ 74 ] , and institute - specific databases [ 75 ] providing additional datasets .
Both GEO and ArrayExpress provide programmatic interfaces and structured FTP file systems for bulk analysis .
GEO data are standardized around the SOFT text file format [ 40 ] and ArrayExpress around the MGED MAGE format family [ 76 ] ; both are variants of tab - delimited text and can be manipulated by a variety of publicly available tools [ 77 ] , [ 78 ] or custom software .
Physical , Genetic , and Regulatory Interactomes Interactomes are significantly more diverse than sequence and expression data , both in their biological grounding and their electronic availability and distribution .
For a subset of the many available physical , genetic , and regulatory interaction databases , we refer the reader to previous articles in the PLoS Computational Biology Getting Started series [ 79 ] .
These data are distributed in a range of formats and with a variety of experimental metadata .
The fundamental computational data being communicated is most often an unweighted ( possibly directed ) graph , and interactome data thus lends itself well to large - scale exploration using simple Boolean operations and graph mining algorithms [ 80 ] , [ 81 ] .
More biologically focused investigation can be done using , for example , PSI - formatted files containing experimental and biological metadata [ 82 ] .
Other Genomic Data Types and Sources
This is only a small selection of the data resources that can be mined integratively to address biological questions , with structural [ 83 ] , [ 84 ] , proteomic [ 85 ] , [ 86 ] , and metabolic [ 87 ] databases being obvious large - scale omissions .
A final data type that must be considered , however , is not directly experimental ; curated pathway and structured knowledge resources are invaluable in the planning and validation of large - scale data mining [ 34 ] , [ 88 ] – [ 90 ] .
Two vital considerations when using such resources are , first , that they are originally based on published literature and experimental results .
Subtle issues of circularity can arise when curated resources are used to supplement or validate data mining results , since the data being analyzed may itself have contributed to the curation process .
Second , we have as yet to discover and catalog all biological knowledge — when used as gold standards , even the best - curated resources can be incomplete in the face of the billions of datapoints now being generated by the field on a regular basis , with important consequences in computational learning and evaluation [ 91 ] .
Outlook
With almost every type of biological data accumulating at an exponential rate , large - scale genomic data mining is increasingly becoming a necessity .
For computational investigators , this represents a clear opportunity for methodology development ; since data are becoming available at a rate that outpaces even Moore 's law , it is not enough to wait for faster computers to execute longer and longer queries , and new bioinformatic tools must be developed with an eye to scalability and efficiency ( e.g. , through massive parallelization ) .
However , the opportunity for biological investigation is at least as large .
Nature has already harnessed scalability to her own advantage , and the combinatorics of the genetic code , multimodal and combinatorial regulation , cellular differentiation , and temporal development ensure that even our current wealth of data provide an incomplete view of biological complexity .
A simple justification for broad - ranging computational screens of genomic data is their speed and low cost as a precursor to more extensive laboratory work .
An even more compelling motivation , though , is the fact that the extent and complexity of biological systems may best be discovered by simultaneously considering a wide range of genome - scale data .

Drug studies financed by pharmaceutical companies frequently show positive results in favour of the sponsor .
In the current issue of Deutsches Ärzteblatt International ( Dtsch Arztebl Int 2010 ; 107 ( 16 ) : 279-85 ) , a research group headed by the Chairman of the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association , Prof .
Wolf - Dieter Ludwig , describes the influence of sponsoring on the results , protocol and quality of drugs studies .
The authors conclude that pharmaceutical companies exploit a wide variety of possibilities of manipulating study results .
Apart from financing the study , financial links to the authors , such as payments for lectures , may tend to make the results of the study more favourable for the company .
Not only the results themselves , but also their interpretation , are significantly more often in accordance with the wishes of the sponsor .
In some publications , the authors detected evidence that sponsors from the pharmaceutical industry had influenced study protocols .
For example , placebos were more frequently used in drug studies than was the case with independently financed studies .
On the other hand , some favourable effects were linked to financial support from the pharmaceutical industry .
The methodological quality of studies with industrial support tended to be better than with independent drug studies .

Friends of the financially fortunate are trying to turn reality upside - down — and save our undertaxed rich mega billions in the process .
By Sam Pizzigati
Taxes on the wealthy in the United States run low .
Many wealthy Americans want these taxes to run even lower .
But the American people , for some strange reason , have never rallied around candidates who champion tax cuts for the richest among us .
So rich people - friendly politicos do the next best thing .
They champion tax cuts for everybody .
But this approach can prove problematic , too .
Across - the - board tax cuts for everybody , the rich included , can quickly end up gutting the revenues that fund the public services average Americans depend upon and appreciate .
How do friends of the fortunate sidestep this inconvenient reality ?
They wildly exaggerate the tax burden that falls on average Americans .
They endeavor to convince America ’s non-rich majority that we ’re deeply and terribly “ overtaxed . ”
Last week brought two new data dumps that challenge this “ overtaxed ” claim .
One compares what U.S. taxpayers pay now to what they used to pay in years gone by .
The other compares tax bills in the United States to tax bills elsewhere in the developed world .
The two analyses , in the end , tell the same tale :
Any candidate or lawmaker who calls the United States “ overtaxed ” is running interference for America ’s rich .
The first new analysis — from the U.S. Commerce Department — shows that total income , property , sales , and various other taxes together equaled 9.2 percent of all U.S. personal income in 2009 , the lowest such rate since 1950 .
The second , an analysis from the industrial world ’s official economic research agency , found that the average married couple with two kids in the United States has a tax burden one - half the size of the comparable average family in the developed world as a whole .
This second analysis zeroes in on what the Paris - based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , or OECD , calls the “ tax wedge , ” the difference between what an employer has to spend to employ someone — both in wages and the employer ’s share of social security taxes — and what that employed person actually nets , after taxes , in take - home .
In 2009 , for the developed world as a whole , the “ tax wedge ” — or , more simply put , the tax burden — stood at 26 percent of the employment costs for average - wage couples with two children .
In the United States last year , that average family tax burden ran 13.7 percent .
Only five of the nations the OECD tracks had a lower tax burden than this U.S. rate .
Twenty - four had higher .
The bottom line ?
By any rational historical or global standard , we do n’t have an “ overtaxation ” problem in the United States .
Our problem lies elsewhere .
We have an undertaxed rich .
Under current U.S. tax law , the wealthy in the United States do n’t have to pay much in taxes .
Even worse , they do n’t even pay what they owe .
Another reminder of this systematic shortchanging of Uncle Sam emerged last week — from the independent panel that Congress created in 1998 to monitor the IRS .
According to the latest available figures , this IRS Oversight Board notes in its new annual report , $ 290 billion a year in taxes due is going uncollected .
Not all of that , to be sure , reflects tax evasion by the rich .
But tax evasion by the wealthy represents an oversized share of that gap .
In 2008 , one study broke the IRS “ tax gap ” data down by income level and found that Americans making between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million a year were underreporting their incomes at triple the “ misreport ” rate of taxpayers making between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 .
What ’s the IRS doing about all this ?
The Oversight Board sees some promise in recent IRS action .
The agency , notes the Board , “ initiated a major effort in 2009 to identify taxpayers who were hiding money in offshore tax jurisdictions . ”
As part of that effort , the UBS Swiss banking giant has agreed to turn over the names of 4,450 U.S. taxpayers who had been stashing dollars in secret Alpine accounts .
And 14,700 U.S. taxpayers have agreed to reveal details on their own offshore accounts after the IRS set up a voluntary disclosure program .
Data from these 14,700 affluent taxpayers , says the Oversight Board , will hand the IRS “ a wealth of information to mine for future enforcement efforts . ”
Unfortunately , on the audit front , the IRS does n’t seem to be moving with the same sense of urgency .
Close examinations of high - income returns remain relatively rare .
The exam rate for taxpayers making over $ 200,000 a year has essentially remained flat for the past three years , hovering around 2.9 percent .
And the IRS still lacks an up - to - date sense of how much in taxes America ’s rich are evading .
The $ 290 billion “ tax gap ” estimate the IRS Oversight Board cited last week comes from data collected way back in 2001 .
This failure to update the tax evasion stats , notes the Oversight Board , makes it “ difficult , if not impossible , for the Oversight Board , the IRS , or any other member of the tax administration community to determine with any degree of certainly that the IRS is making progress in reducing the tax gap . ”
We need that progress .
In troubled economic times , we need that money .

The guys over at AndroidPolice claim to have a Nexus One running Android 2.2 .
They conducted a few performance tests on the device and the result was astounding .
The Nexus One will run up to 450 % faster than it does on 2.1 .
When you take into account that the Nexus One already could be the fastest phone on the market now , more than quadruple the speed and you will have a true “ Super phone ” on your hands .
If this is true , Google use of that term will be cemented after the release of Froyo .
By now we ’ve all seen Flash 10.1 running on a Nexus One outfitted with 2.2 .
It appears the real reason why apple did n’t want Flash on the iPhone is because it could n’t handle it , Android after Froyo has more than enough horse power to shoulder the load of running Flash .
A few other things that are rumored to be included in 2.2 are the ability to save apps to the SD card and the introduction of JIT .
These gains in performance can be directly connected to the implementation of JIT .
The Nexus One running Android 2.1 without JIT gets about 6.5 - 7 MFLOPS .
And the same device running 2.2 with JIT enabled gets a whopping 37.5 MFLOPS .
That ’s over four times the performance and that ’s crazy .
Google is keeping 2.2 under tight wraps , usually by now we would have a leak , we ’re going to have to wait for the I/O this time around .

HP released a new video showing off its upcoming " iPad killer " -- the Slate tablet PC .
The video is reminiscent of Verizon 's " Droid Does " campaign highlighting all of the capabilities of the Android - based Droid that the Apple iPhone can't deliver .
In a mere 30 seconds HP manages to demonstrate that its tablet is -- in a nutshell - - everything Apple 's iPad is n't .
The Apple iPad launched this past Saturday and has been a tremendous success .
Even those who are n't captivated by the iPad have been forced to admit a healthy respect for what its capable of .
For all the iPad does well , though , it can't seem to escape the fact that it wo n't completely replace your desktop or notebook PC .
The HP Slate , on the other hand , may be another story .
All of the features and functions lacking in the Apple iPad as a business tool or notebook replacement , exist on the HP Slate .
Apple has succeeded in bringing the tablet PC concept to the mainstream consciousness , but HP has the benefit of riding the tablet wave , while also learning from Apple 's mistakes and introducing a tablet that fills the perceived holes in the iPad .
• Camera / video .
The camera , and the ability to record video may be more consumer gadget than business tool , but video conferencing is becoming mainstream and mobile business professionals rely on it .
The HP Slate video demonstrates a two - way video call using Skype -- indicating that the Slate will have both front and rear - facing cameras .
• USB ports .
Apple is known for creating exemplary user experiences , but those user experiences come with locked - down , proprietary hardware .
The HP Slate has USB ports -- enabling attachment of external storage , and other USB - enabled devices just like on a standard desktop or notebook PC .
• SD memory expansion .
USB devices can be used to expand storage capacity on the tablet , but SD memory cards are a much less obtrusive way to do so .
With the Apple iPad , whatever storage capacity you purchase is the storage capacity you are stuck with -- there is no option to expand it if necessary .
The Slate has an SD memory card slot .
• Software .
The HP Slate is a Windows 7 - based device .
You can install the software you are used to rather than just the apps approved by Apple .
Granted , there are 150,000 apps in the Apple App Store , and already thousands of iPad - specific apps , but there will inevitably be software you use on a daily basis that just wo n't work on an iPad .
The video shows the HP Slate with iTunes , Skype , and the Mozilla Firefox Web browser installed .
• Adobe Flash .
Arguably one of the most - discussed gaps in iPad functionality is the lack of support for Adobe Flash .
I am of the opinion that the Web should be standards - based and not rely on a proprietary technology like Flash , but its hard to argue with the fact that Flash is fairly ubiquitous on the Web today .
As much as the community at large has debated the value of the iPad as a business tool -- Apple failed to hold up its end .
Apple was so focused on building a consumer gadget that it left off critical elements that could have let the iPad not just be used as a business tool -- but dominate as a business tool .
The iPad is a success , and it has significantly more business functionality than iPad naysayers would have you believe , but Apple left the door open for HP and others to ride on iPad 's coattails and deliver a true business - capable tablet device .
Apple will end up either accepting its role as a niche consumer gadget - - a role it is familiar and comfortable with -- or be forced to play catch up with devices like the Slate as it develops the iPad 2.0 .
The bottom line is that the HP Slate is a significant device .
It may not " beat " the iPad in total sales , and it may not cause the sort of hyperbole and excitement that Apple brought with the iPad , but even if it ends up as only the second - best tablet on the market , it will be a win for HP and a significant step for Windows 7 - based tablets .

A rounded , plasticky take on the iPad .
That 's how Nvidia 's latest Android tablet prototype struck me .
It 's pretty nice .
But not as nice as the inside .

Inside this 8.9 - inch tablet , you see , is Nvidia 's Tegra 2 , the heart of which is a dual core ARM Cortex A9 — a chip that 's a generation ahead of the silicon the iPad 's A4 is based on — meaning this thing will zooooom .
It 's also got a gig of RAM ( the iPad 's biggest technical limitation now is its puny amount of RAM ) , two USB ports , and a front - facing camera .

Given that both of the units we handled were running just one app each — pretty snazzy looking games — it 's hard to tell what it 'll be like to use generally , like with the front - facing camera and how the widescreen aspect ratio feels outside of a game , but the games did feel and look great , as you 'd expect from the kind of horsepower inside .
I wish the screen , which is capacitive for multitouchness , was n't quite as glossy as the iPad though .
Oh well .
None of the devs who had one at their disposal knew when the tablet would actually be coming out , only that it would , one day .
It 's no Adam , but it 's like actually here , almost .

COLLINGWOOD , ONT . — Smaller class sizes are “ ludicrous ” and a waste of money , according to bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell in a keynote address to the provincial Liberal party faithful at a “ big think ” conference .
Gladwell , who was raised in southwestern Ontario , spoke at the “ Imaging Ontario's Future ” conference at the Blue Mountain resort here .
“ I was very grateful this invitation came from you and not the Tories , ” he joked .
“ Otherwise my mother would have disowned me . ”
Gladwell , whose books include The Tipping Point , Blink and Outliers , is a graduate of the University of Toronto 's Trinity College .
He spoke of making the case for a “ new kind of liberalism ” and the importance of a proactive government with a clear message and agenda .
Everything the world has learned about education shows that the quality of the teacher is the most important factor in a student 's success , Gladwell said .
“ I know that from time to time there is a lot of interest in the power and importance of reducing class size but the data shows class size is the biggest dead end in the world , ” Gladwell said .
Sitting in the front row listening to Gladwell was Premier Dalton McGuinty , whose key election promise in 2003 was reducing class sizes for elementary students .
“ Even if you were to cut every class in Ontario in half , you 'd improve the performance of Ontario 's schoolchildren by about 5 percentile points , ” Gladwell said .
But changing teacher quality has a “ massive impact ” on student outcome , he said .
“ If a child is unlucky enough to have a bad teacher three years in a row they will fall three years behind a child lucky enough to have a good teacher three years in a row . ”
The question is how do you improve the quality of teachers , Gladwell said .
Raising academic requirements is n't the simple answer .
Teaching is complicated in this modern world , he said .
“ We are asking them to play six , seven , eight different roles in the classroom .
The best thing we can do for teachers is to simply let them teach .
That requires a government that is activist ... that is not afraid to try something radically new , ” he said .
On Saturday , McGuinty told reporters he was n't bothered by Gladwell 's opinion on class sizes .
The party invited a slew of different academics , consultants and speakers to challenge Liberal minds as they hunt for new ideas ahead of next year 's provincial election , he said .
Economist Jeff Rubin is an example of someone who has fundamentally different thoughts than most Ontario Liberals , McGuinty said .

“ We are trying to provoke ourselves with new kinds of thinking , ” he said .
“ Jeff Rubin this morning ( Saturday ) said we should n't have bailed out the auto sector , and Malcolm Gladwell last night said he did n't like our smaller class sizes .
That is great ; we are open to that .
“ Provoke us .
Help us better understand the consequences of the decisions we make so we can plan better for the future , ” he said .
( CNN ) -- Concerns over Facebook 's new privacy policy and the online social network 's recent efforts to spread its information across the Web have led some of the site 's faithful to delete their accounts -- or at least to try to .
On Wednesday 's episode of a podcast called This Week in Technology , host Leo Laporte , a well - known tech pundit , said he had to search wikiHow , a how - to site , to figure out how to delete his Facebook account permanently .
After finding the delete button , which he said is hidden deep within the site 's menus , Laporte proceeded to delete his account during the online broadcast .
" That 's it .
It 's gone , " he said during the show .
" And I think that 's the right thing to do . "
It 's unclear how many people have chosen to delete their Facebook accounts in recent weeks .
The popular social network does n't publish statistics on how many people quit the site .
But there has been much uproar online about Facebook 's alleged lack of concern for the privacy of its users ' personal information , and its clear that some people have become so upset that they 're leaving the networking site , which has more than 400 million members .
Still , the account deletions likely are n't numerous enough to affect the site 's overall size .
Facebook spokeswoman Annie Ta said in an e-mail that Facebook has grown by more than 10 million active users since late April .
i Report : Are you done with Facebook ?
In recent weeks , the site has been hit with several privacy bugs and scares that , among other things , made private chat conversations briefly visible to Facebook friends .
And on April 21 , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a new Facebook feature called the " Open Graph , " which essentially brings Facebook - like functionality to a number of websites .
CNN.com is one of several dozen sites that partner with Facebook to display and share users ' interests .
Some Facebook users , including Sam Schreiber , say they are bothered by the fact that their online preferences are showing up all over the internet now , instead of just on Facebook.com .
Schreiber , a 24 - year - old who considers herself social - media savvy , says she may delete her account soon because she does n't understand Facebook 's privacy settings well enough to know that her information is being kept safe .
" People already use them like it 's crack , so I do n't see what the next step is aside from world domination , " she said .
" So I just think it 's too much . "
She was particularly concerned when one of her Facebook friends saw on the music site Pandora that she likes the band " New Found Glory . "
" I was like , that 's really creepy .
I have n't logged in .
I did n't give it permission .
I did n't do anything , " she said .
Schreiber said she tried to change her Facebook privacy settings to keep that from happening again , but had to turn to news articles for information about how to do so , which she thought was unreasonable .
Facebook : Read the site 's privacy policy
Facebook appears to be rattled a bit by these changes .
The blog All Facebook reports that the site 's executives called an " all hands " meeting Thursday to discuss its privacy policy in light of recent criticism .
And there are rumors that the site may amend its policies , as CNET reports .
The site has had its detractors before .
Each time Facebook makes changes to its privacy policy , thousands of users tend to complain .
But interest in deleting Facebook accounts appears to be rising .
If you type in the phrase " How do I " on Google , one of the first suggested searches that comes up is " How do I delete my Facebook account , " a factoid discovered by Danny Sullivan , a blogger at Search Engine Land .
Sullivan looked at similar searches over time and published a graph that shows searches about deleting Facebook accounts have been on the rise sharply since 2009 .
" Yes , there 's definitely a rising trend , " he writes in a blog post on the matter .
" Over time , more and more searches at Google have involved [ deleting Facebook accounts ] , it appears .
In fact , if you go back to Google and start typing in ' del , ' you get ' delete facebook account ' as the top suggestion . "
A number of tech pundits , including Laporte , have also written recently about deleting or deactivating their accounts .
The blog Silicon Alley Insider posted a list of these on Friday with a headline that says , " Suddenly , everyone is quitting Facebook ! "
The blog lists Peter Rojas of the blog GDGT and Matt Cutts from Google as among those who have deleted or deactivated their accounts .
That blog also posted a list of 10 reasons most people will not be able to part with their Facebook accounts , an apparent nod to the fact that , as Facebook continues to grow and to spread into other websites , it may become necessary to have an active Facebook account to make full use of the Web .
The New York Times also reports that people who once made a career promoting Facebook now may cancel their accounts .
The newspaper says Deanna Zandt , author of a book called " Share This !
How You Will Change the World With Social Networking , " may delete hers .
" It 's getting harder and harder for me to say , yes it 's worth it , you 're giving up your privacy to get these services , and I have to put my money where my mouth is , " she told the paper .
Tech blogs have asked whether a " Great Facebook Deactivation Wave " is about to take off , and have listed reasons people should ditch the popular site .
Meanwhile , there is a second set of concerns about how difficult it is to delete your Facebook account if and when you decide that 's what you 'd like to do .
Facebook says on its website that you can " deactivate " your account by following these steps :
" To deactivate your account , navigate to the ' Settings ' tab on the Account Settings page , " the site says .
" Deactivation will remove your profile and content associated with your account from Facebook .
In addition , users will not be able to search for you or view any of your information . "
But the social network will hold onto your photos and posts if you only " deactivate " your account .
If you want to completely " delete " your account -- meaning that all of your information will be deleted from view , although some of it may remain on Facebook 's servers for a bit -- you can follow these instructions from wikiHow .
The user - edited site lists several methods for deleting a Facebook account .
One of them is a seven - step process .
In his podcast , Laporte said one of the main reasons he felt he needed to delete his Facebook account is that having one gives his friends and family members an incentive to join , too .
And , because many people do n't understand that everything on Facebook can be public , Laporte does n't think it 's responsible to have an account .
By having a Facebook page , he said , " I 'm coercing people I 'm in relationships with to do something bad . "
A UK killer is getting married behind bars after being switched to a womens jail following a sex - change operation - and falling for a lesbian murderess .
The Sun reported Douglas Wakefield , 61 , who was jailed 36 years ago for killing his uncle , has won permission to get hitched in the prison chapel of New Hall Prison near Wakefield , West Yorkshire .
Criminals will be guests at the civil partnership ceremony as Wakefield - who underwent a taxpayer - funded " gender reassignment " and is now called " Tai " - recites vows with mother - of - three Thelma Purchase , 45 , a fellow killer serving a life sentence .
It follows another wedding earlier this month at the New Hall Prison - of killers Amanda Fitzpatrick and Debbie Ware .
Fitzpatrick , 25 , was jailed for life for the murder of her brother - in - law with scissors and lesbian Ware , 31 , stabbed a shopkeeper in a robbery .
Furious Tory MP , Philip Davies , blasted the prison nuptials .
" It is incredible this can be allowed .
The criminal justice system is becoming a joke , " he said .
Wakefield was jailed for strangling his uncle , beating him with a hammer and stabbing him 48 times with a garden fork in Gipton , Leeds .
The father - of - two became notorious as one of the most dangerous men in jail after killing an inmate at Parkhurst and twice taking prison officers hostage .
He has been married twice , once behind bars .
His £ 11,000 ( $ 19,000 ) sex operation in the '90s came after he started wearing earrings and decorated his cell with lace curtains and flowers .
Wakefield was then transferred to New Hall , where Purchase began her life sentence two years ago .
Purchase was jailed for a minimum of 30 years after getting a job caring for a disabled man - who she suffocated to get her hands on £ 70,000 he left her in his will .
The pair must pay their £ 345 wedding costs out of money they have saved .

Chris Johnson has skipped the Tennessee Titans ' voluntary practices this offseason as he hopes to get a bigger contract after his 2,000 - yard 2009 season .
One of the best running backs in NFL history applauds his stance .
Marshall Faulk told The ( Nashville ) Tennessean that Johnson is doing the right thing .
" Without a doubt , if more money is what he wants , he has to hold out , " Faulk , who is now an NFL Network analyst , told the newspaper .
" You have to know who you are dealing with .
The Titans are n't known for caving in or paying , it does n't matter who you are .
In my opinion , there is no way he can come in and play under the current contract . ''
Johnson is expected to be absent when the Titans take part in their fifth practice of the offseason Tuesday .
Johnson has three years left on the $ 12 million contract he signed in 2008 that featured $ 7 million guaranteed .
But his base salary for 2010 does n't even put him close to being one of the best - paid players on the Titans , let alone the NFL .
Johnson is due $ 550,000 for 2010 .
Faulk told The Tennessean that Johnson has to use his leverage with the Titans while he still has it .
" Chris has outplayed his rookie deal .
He has beyond exceeded the expectation where he was drafted , '' Faulk told the newspaper .
" When you are drafted you are paid as to where you were drafted , not to how you play .
And then after you play and prove your worth you are then paid as to how you play .
He has exceeded the money he is making , the Titans know it and everyone in the league knows it . "
Johnson also has some online fan support in his bid for a big pay hike .
A new petition titled " Pay CJ2K ( Get Chris Johnson A New Contract ) " has been set up to support Johnson and had 64 signatures by Tuesday afternoon .
Johnson retweeted the link Tuesday to his more than 73,000 followers on Twitter .
The running back , picked No. 24 overall in 2008 , started talking of wanting more money as he wrapped up his second season as The Associated Press ' 2009 Offensive Player of the Year .
" That 's something my agent has got to take care of , my agent and upstairs , " Johnson said in January , the day after the season ended .
" I 'm not sure .
I need to get [ owner ] Bud Adams ' number . "
Johnson ran 358 times for 2,006 yards as the NFL's leading rusher , 590 yards more than Steven Jackson of the St. Louis Rams .
Johnson also set the single - season record for yards from scrimmage with 2,509 , topping Faulk 's mark of 2,429 set in 1999 with St. Louis .
He became the first player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards and catch 500 yards in the same season .
He also became the first player in NFL history to rush for three touchdowns of 85 yards or longer in a career , which he did in one season .
Through two seasons , Johnson ranks third in NFL history with 3,234 yards to start his career .
Only Eric Dickerson ( 3,913 ) and Edgerrin James ( 3,262 ) ran for more in their first two seasons .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
With over half a billion in box - office receipts and counting , Iron Man 2's blockbuster reign continues unabated .
But Shell - Head 's also taking over Marvel Comics as well , with new variant covers from animation auteur Genndy Tartakovksy , psy - fi artist Alan Aldridge and more , as part of the publisher 's Iron Man by Design series .
The singular Aldridge 's variant cover for Avengers issue No. 2 ( pictured above ) is a perfectly destabilizing merge of 20th - century psychedelia and 21st - century militarism .
Aldridge illustrated sci-fi covers for Penguin and even designed graphics for legends like The Beatles , The Rolling Stones and The Who .
But his rendering of Earth 's capitalist superhero is a mind - wipe of another type .
Meanwhile , the mad genius Genndy Tartakovksy takes comics fans on a different kind of head trip in his variant cover for Invincible Iron Man Annual 's first issue .
It features the kind of raw mechanical sweetness found in almost of all his impressive work , from Dexter 's Laboratory and Samurai Jack to Star Wars : The Clone Wars and his forthcoming animated series Sym - Bionic Titan .
Other variant covers ( pictured below ) also arrived this week from a pair of Pixar superstars partially responsible for the eye candy of Up , Wall - E and Ratatouille .
Ronnie del Carmen rustled up a steampunk cowboy for Invincible Iron Man issue No. 27 , and Bill Presing hit escape velocity with a recombined World War II variant cover for Iron Man Legacy issue No. 3 .
All of the respective comics are released in June , but the burning question comes now :
Do these all - star variant collectibles make a persuasive argument for the predominance of paper comics ?
Or do they call to your wallet just as convincingly in the age of the iPad ?

Detail of Telemaco Signorini's masterpiece " The Riverbank " ( " L'alzaia " ) , painted in 1864 .
It shows the hard work of five men pulling a heavy barge against the current along the Arno river , near Florence , in Italy .
Most likely the barge was loaded with coal .
In this post , I start from this image to tell the story of coal in Italy and how the fortunes of the country went in parallel with those of coal well until mid 20th century .
( Click on the image for the full painting . )
I have a special emotional relationship with Telemaco Signorini 's painting " The Riverbank . "
The area shown in the panting has changed very little from the time when the painting was made - mid 19th century - and , today , I could take you to exactly that place , in Florence , Italy .
It is not far from where I was born and raised ; it is the area where my family used to live for generations .
Everytime I see that painting ( and I have seen the original twice , in two different expositions ) I can't avoid the sensation that those men , so hard working , could be ancestors of mine .
" The Riverbank " is correctly considered a masterpiece ; just look at it and you 'll see that it is truly exceptional .
Not only the composition of the figures is original ; think of the contemporary French impressionists .
None of them , great masters as they were , ever painted anything like that .
They never seemed to be worried about the social problems of their time as , instead , Signorini was .
So , he shows us the tremendous effort of these five men pulling something unseen , but that can only be a heavy barge .
Almost certainly that barge was loaded with coal .
It was coal from England that had been unloaded in the port city of Livorno and that was slowly making its way up to Florence .
When " The Riverbank " was painted , in 1864 , the age of coal was in full swing .
Already in medieval times people had started using coal as fuel but the 19th century saw an enormous expansion of production .
It was in 1866 that William Stanley Jevons said in his " The Coal Question " that , " Coal in truth stands not beside but entirely above all other commodities .
It is the material energy of the country — the universal aid — the factor in everything we do .
With coal almost any feat is possible or easy ; without it we are thrown back into the laborious poverty of early times . "
But coal had a problem : it was not easy to transport .
Coal is heavy ; it is unthinkable to cart it for long distances on roads .
For this reason , the first railroads were developed in early 19th century expressly to transport coal .
But rails were expensive , prone to failure , and the first steam engines were so inefficient that they would use up most of the coal transported unless the distance covered was really short .
These early railroads could be used only to move coal from mines to river ports , where coal was loaded on sailing ships called " colliers . "
Only using waterways it was possible to transport coal over long distances .
Gradually , railroads and steam engines became more efficient , but wherever sea and canal transportation was available , it remained always the cheapest way of transporting coal .
In the early times of the coal age , the cost of transportation set a limit to coal diffusion .
Only those mines which were near waterways could produce coal and only those areas which were accessible by waterways could use coal .
That condition held in most of Northern Europe and it was there that the use of coal grew most rapidly , fueling what we call the industrial revolution .
More coal extracted meant more industries , and more industries meant more coal extracted .
More coal meant also more steel , and more steel meant larger and more efficient armies .
Coal was the origin and the fuel of the British Empire , but Britain 's production was so large that there was coal available for export .
With British coal , and later German coal , the industrial revolution spred all over Europe , even to countries which had no coal mines .
With imported coal , waterways were the necessary and sufficient condition for having industries .
But most of Southern Europe and North Africa were cut off from the coal revolution : too dry or too mountainous for waterways .
The southernmost limit of waterways in Europe in 19th century was Tuscany , where the River Arno connected the main city , Florence , to the port city of Livorno .
Already in the 18th century , the Arno River had been artificially transformed into a waterway .
With this vital line , Tuscany could import coal in large amounts from England and start her own industrial revolution .
It was a small revolution compared to that of the Northern European countries , but manpower in Tuscany was cheap , and it attracted capital from the rest of Europe .
Just as today manufacturing is exported in the poorest areas of the world , by mid 19th century , Tuscany had become a manufacturing center -- with industries mostly created and managed by Northern European businessmen .
The Grand - Duke of Tuscany of that time , Leopoldo the 2nd , was praised by everyone as a good man .
He was also a politician and , as such , he tended to promise gifts to his constituency .
One of these gifts was the public lighting of Florence .
Already in 18th century , a public lighting system based on oil lamps had been installed , but it was dim , limited to a few places , and the lamps ran out of fuel by midnight .
In 1845 , things changed with the first gas lamps .
Those lamps were fueled by a " gasometre " , a giant tank where coal reacted with steam to form " town gas " that then was piped all the way to each street lamp ( that old gasometre still stands , nearly forgotten , in a public garden in Florence ) .
It was bright light that lasted all night ; a revolution .
So , thanks to coal , Florence was beautifully lighted at night .
But coal had also a dark side : those people whom Telemaco Signorini shows to us laboriously pulling a heavy coal - loaded barge upstream .
With time , barges were gradually superseded by the railroad .
It is likely that , by the first decades of the 20th century , very few people were still pulling heavy loads upstream .
But the nature of the problem had changed : coal was not infinite .
In the 19th century , coal for Italy came mainly from Britain and the commerce of coal was a strong link that connected the two countries .
The Italian state had been created in 1861 , uniting the statelets which had been ruling the Italian peninsula .
It had been , in part , the result of the work of British diplomacy .
There were evident advantages for Britain in having a strong Italy as counterweight to the French ambitions of expansion in North Africa .
But the creation of Italy had not been just a cold political calculation .
There was a genuine liking of the British for Italy and for Italian traditions .
In some ways , Italy was a daughter country to Britain .
Over the years , the British flocked to Italy ; they loved the climate , the people and the relative freedom of the place .
Some Italians also moved to foggy Britain , although not as tourists .
The invention of fish and chips is claimed sometimes by Italians from the Tuscan town of Barga , who had emigrated to the British islands .
But the relationship of Italy and England went sour with peak coal in England , in the early 1920s .
After the first world war , Italy desperately needed coal to rebuild her industries .
But Britain could no longer provide coal as liberally as before .
Italy started importing coal from Germany , but that was not sufficient : coal consumption in Italy stayed flat between the two world wars .
Italy 's economy was also dragged down by war debt , and it never really recovered after the trauma of the first world war .
All that had political consequences .
The sympathy for England and for everything English evaporated in Italy and the Italian press started vituperating Britain and complaining about " the coal issue " .
D.H. Lawrence , in his " Sea and Sardinia " ( 1921 ) tells us that the coal problem was one of the main subjects of conversation among Italians .
In 1922 , Mussolini and the Fascist party took power , in large part also exploiting the resentment of the population for the bad economic situation .
It is said that Mussolini made the trains run on time .
Perhaps it is true , but he could do nothing to create coal that was n't there .
The crisis of 1929 was a bad hit on the Italian economy and - perhaps as a reaction - the government tried to vent the nation 's frustration by invading Ethiopia in 1935 .
There were several official justifications for the invasion - the most common one was that Italy needed " a place in the sun " - a curious justification from a country which has plenty of sun anyway .
But , clearly , the invasion was meant to be a slap in the face for Britain .
It was a way to tell to the British that the Italians could have their empire , too , that they could do that alone , and that they did n't need no damned British coal for that .
It was a mistake ; a colossal mistake .
Mussolini had n't understood that it was coal that made empires , not the reverse .
No coal , no empire ; it was as simple as that .
Conquering Ethiopia , Italy had dissipated immense human and material resources and had gained a bad reputation as the rogue country of the time .
All that for a piece of a dry land and the dubious honor for the King of Italy of taking the title of " Emperor of Ethiopia . "
That land was also strategically impossible to defend , as it would be seen just a few years later .
Britain reacted to the invasion of Ethiopia by stopping the exports of coal to Italy .
That , and other international economic sanctions , pushed the already crippled Italian economy on the brink of collapse .
The government reacted furiously , pushing a series of measures called " autarchy , " the use of national resources only .
It was mainly propaganda and some ideas that never worked , such as trying to make shoes out of cardboard and clothes out of fiberglass .
The attempt to develop new coal mines could not work as a substitute for imports .
The Sulcis mine in Sardinia was the main national source of coal , but it could never produce much more than 10 % of of Italy 's consumption between the two wars .
The lack of coal and the strain of the Ethiopian war weighted on Italy 's economy with almost 25 % of the state budget dedicated to supporting the costs of the military occupation of the overseas colonies .
Given the situation , events played out as if following a prophecy written down long before .
Italy had to rely more and more on German coal and that had political consequences .
You can read the story in these paragraphs written in 1940 by Ridolfo Mazzucconi , a popular Italian journalist and writer of the time .
Mazzucconi , among other things , had popularized in Italy the concept of " perfidious Albion , " that had originated in France at the time of the French revolution .
( from the ASPOItalia blog . )
England ordered , with a repentine action , the suspension of the shipping of German coal directed to Italy from Rotterdam .
As a compensation , England offered to replace Germany in coal shipping .
But this service was subordinate to conditions such that accepting them would be to be tied to the British political interests and grievously damage our war preparations .
The Fascist government responded with suitable roughness ; and German coal , which could n't come any more by sea , found its most comfortable and short road via the Brennero pass .
Ths matter of coal was a healty and clarifying crisis of the political horizon .
On March 9 and 10 ( 1940 ) Ribbentrop was in Rome and the visit gave rise to a clear and precise statement .
The axis was intact .
The alliance of Germany and Italy was continuing .
A few days later , on the 18th , Mussolini and Hitler met for the first time at the Brennero pass and then even the blind were forced to see and the dim witted to understand .
You can read the same story as it was seen from the other side of the Atlantic in this article in Time magazine titled , " Hot Coal " .
It shows , among other things , how the Allies had completely misunderstood the Italian situation of the time .
It is a tradition of fuel producers to use embargoes to try to gain political power over fuel importers but , usually , it does n't work .
In this case , Britain had tried to bully Italy into submission using the coal weapon .
It was another colossal mistake that forced Italy to rely fully on German coal .
It also fueled even more the resentment of Italians against Britain and that gave to Mussolini sufficient political leverage to push Italy into the war as an ally of Germany .
What followed was , perhaps , unavoidable , but it did n't have to be .
It would have been enough to glance at the coal statistics for " the blind to see and the dim witted to understand " as Mazzucconi tells us .
At that time , the size of a nation 's economy could only be proportional to the amount of coal consumed and , by this measure , Italy could n't even remotely match Britain .
In 1940 , despite having passed the peak , Britain still produced more than 200 million tons of coal per year and used most of it for its national economy and for that of the British Empire .
Italy , instead , consumed just a little more than ten million tons of coal per year .
The British economy was twenty times larger than the Italian one .
The " blind and the dim witted " ones were all in the Italian government who grossly overestimated the military potential of the country .
They were still thinking that a war was fought by peasants armed with bayonets .
They had completely missed the dark side of coal .
It is said that history repeats itself ; the first time it is a tragedy , the second is a farce .
After the tragedy of the first world war , the second had some elements of farce .
Mussolini often looked like a clown during the war and Italy took some truly farcical decisions , such as that of sending a small force of bombers and fighters to join Germany during the Battle of Britain .
The absurdity of the idea was n't so much in seeing outdated Italian biplane fighters desperately trying to battle Spitfires and Hurricanes , but in the very concept that Italy was trying to bomb a country that had been her traditional ally : Britain .
There is a tradition for fuel importing countries to bomb exporting ones , but even Mazzucconi himself , with all his rethoric about the " Perfidious Albion " seems to be perplexed about this idea when he tells us of the bella fratellanza " good fellowship " between Italy and Britain .
In the end , it did n't matter how clownish Mussolini looked and how stupid his military decisions were -- there was nothing farcical in an unprepared army sent to its destruction and in a whole country destroyed and humiliated .
It was the dark side of coal , again .
Time has passed ; coal is not " king " any more .
The countries destroyed during the second world war have rebuilt their economies using crude oil and natural gas .
The dark side of coal , today , seems to play out more in terms of environmental damage : coal is the fuel that generates the most greenhouse gases for the same energy generated .
Coal mining has also become a hugely destructive activity with " mountaintop removal " becoming a commonplace method to get at the coal seams .
But coal is not any more a global commodity that leads to wars , as it was until mid 20th century .
That role has been taken over by crude oil .
The descendants of those men who pulled coal - loaded barges upstream in 19th century now drive shiny cars powered by oil and work in front of computer screens .
But the problem of oil is the same as it was for coal : it is not infinite and there is not enough of it for everyone .
It is now crude oil that makes and destroys empires .
History repeats itself again and it will do that until we have fossil fuels to burn .
I published another paper on the subject of coal in Europe on the " ASPO neesletter " n. 73 of january 2007 .
You can find it here : http://www.energiekrise.de/e/aspo_news/aspo/newsletter073.pdf
A figure taken from this paper shows the British coal production , here :
A quantitative figure showing how coal imports to Italy varied over time can be seen here , taken from a paper by Walter H. Voskuil " Coal and Political Power in Europe " published in Economic Geography , Vol. 18 , No. 3 ( Jul. , 1942 ) , pp. 247-258
A post in Italian that I wrote on this subject can be found at http://aspoitalia.blogspot.com/2007/01/davvero-viviamo-in-tempi-oscuri.html .
It is a discussion of the role of coal in Italy between the two wars .

When photographers ask for a vertical shot , they do n’t mean this .
The 70 – 200 mm telephoto lens that Mike Shore of Austin , Texas , used to grab this Douglas DC - 3D created a compression effect , “ in which the subject appears a little more extreme in comparison to the background , ” he says .
“ This is all in the glass , and it ’s a great technique to capture the eye . ”
The airplane landed in Bend , Oregon , around sunset on January 14 , 2007 .
Shore asked to make an air - to - air shot , and owner Jonathan Phelps agreed .
Helicopter pilot Sharon Vickers took Shore to 1,500 feet in a Robinson R44 , where he set his Canon 20 D at 1/125th of a second , f/3.2 , and ISO 800 .
“ It was really dark out , ” he says .
Pilots Steve Dunn and Paul Bazeley flew the airplane about 15 to 20 feet off the runway at almost full speed , about 140 knots , then performed a two - G , 40 - degree pullup .
Shore made the photo as the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 - 94 Twin Wasp radial engines , each with 1,350 horsepower , clawed their way to a thousand feet , at which point the pilots banked right at about 100 knots .
“ At low altitude and low speed , safety is power , ” says Dunn , who was in the left seat .
“ Always leave yourself a way out . ”
The finely restored DC - 3 — “ You could eat off her , anywhere on the airplane , ” says Dunn — will join a flyover of 25 to 30 DC - 3s at the AirVenture gathering in Oshkosh , Wisconsin , this summer .
Men are bigger liars than women , says poll
" I did n't have that much to drink " is a man 's favourite lie Men are more likely to tell lies than women and feel less guilty about it , says a survey .
In a poll of 3,000 people , researchers found that the average British man tells three lies every day , that 's equivalent to 1,092 a year .
However the average woman appears more honest , lying 728 times a year - around twice a day .
Mums are the people mostly likely to be lied to , says the Science Museum who commissioned the survey .
Twenty - five per cent of men say they 've lied to their mother , but only 20 % of women admit to having lied to their mum .
In comparison , only 10 % of people said they are likely to lie to their partner .
MEN'S TOP 10 LIES 1 .
I did n't have that much to drink 2 .
Nothing 's wrong , I 'm fine 3 .
I had no signal 4 .
It was n't that expensive 5 .
I 'm on my way 6 .
I 'm stuck in traffic 7 .
No , your bum does n't look big in that 8 .
Sorry , I missed your call 9 .
You 've lost weight 10 .
It 's just what I 've always wanted Concerning the kind of lies we tell , men said that they most often lie to their partner about their drinking habits .
" I did n't have that much to drink " is men's most popular fib .
Whereas women use the line , " Nothing 's wrong , I 'm fine " most often to hide their true feelings .
" It 's just what I 've always wanted " is the tenth most likely lie to be told to a loved one by either men or women , suggesting that men and women are quite discerning when it comes to buying presents for each other .
WOMEN'S TOP 10 LIES 1 .
Nothing 's wrong , I 'm fine 2 .
I do n't know where it is , I have n't touched it 3 .
It was n't that expensive 4 .

Oh , I 've had this ages 9 .
No , I did n't throw it away 10 .
It 's just what I 've always wanted Women are most likely to feel guilty after telling a lie .
Eighty - two per cent say it eats away at their conscience , compared to just 70 % of men .
Is there such a thing as an acceptable lie ?
Eighty - four per cent of people think there is .
Three quarters of those surveyed believe it 's alright to fib if it's to save someone 's feelings .
When it comes to the quality of the lie , 55 % of Brits think women are the better liars , even though they tell fewer lies .
The survey found that 71 % of people think it is fine to protect someone by telling a lie , and 57 % would be happy to fib if they did n't like a gift they 'd been given .
Katie Maggs , associate medical curator at the Science Museum , says the jury 's out as to whether lying is a result of our genes , evolution or our upbringing .
" Lying may seem to be an unavoidable part of human nature but it's an important part of social interaction , " she says .
The museum in west London is launching a gallery called " Who am I ? " which makes sense of brain science , genetics and human behaviour .

Has the promotional campaign for " Iron Man 2 " finally gone too far ?
After the introduction of the Whiplash Whopper - one of the only marketing tools in the entire world guaranteed to turn your bowels into mush - I 'm pretty sure we 're already over the line , but still , decimating a castle in the name of Tony Stark is a little much .
Alright , so England 's Rochester Castle is still intact , but you would hardly know that based upon a recent event put together by Sony Music in promotion for the recently announced " AC / DC Iron Man 2 " soundtrack .
According to io9 , a company called Seeper turned Rochester Castle - " the site of a thousand years of violent history " - into a canvas for a wild display of visual shenanigans designed to shock and awe both comic book fans and the mainstream public alike .

Ron ’s pitch :
Legendary computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra once said : “ Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes . ”
But if programming is not about the computers , what IS it about ?
I want to give you three strange definitions of computer programming that will forever change how you think about software .
Exploring the true nature of programming requires tracing its connections with philosophy , psychology , evolution , and physics , and following these threads leads to a startling conclusion : computer programming is not a product of the mind of humans – it ’s a product of the mind of the universe !
About Ron Burk
Ron Burk has been a programmer for 30 years , a magazine editor ( Windows Developer ’s Journal ) for 10 years , and an amateur medical researcher for 5 years ( publishing papers on treating the anemia of cancer , and the relationship of melatonin to chemotherapy symptoms ) .
He is currently writing “ The Pop Psychology of Programming ” , a synthesis of psychology and computer programming .
You can find Ron on his blog and on Twitter @ronburk .
He 's hairy , boisterous and kids love him but to Perth Zoo , Semeru symbolises something much more ... hope .
Semeru the Sumatran orangutan is being trained to climb a Ficus tree , build a nest , eat new foods and even understand Indonesian as he prepares to make history as the first male orangutan released into the wild from a zoo .
Perth Zoo achieved a world first in 2006 when the first female orangutan Temara was released into a protected part of Indonesia .
The zoo's chief executive Susan Hunt says there are only about 6,000 Sumatran orangutans left so the zoo , as well as breeding , developed a release program .
" We 've got a really critical issue and with Sumatran orangutans it 's just too serious not to do anything . "
The orangutan keeper Kylie Bullo , who has been working with the animals for 10 years , says it 's hard to see them go .
" You form a very , very close bond with them , and I mean you really spend more time with them as a keeper than you do your own friends and family so they really become a big part of your life . "
The six and a half year old is already trying to escape from his overprotective mother and Ms Bullo says he was specifically chosen for the release program .
" You have to pick orangutans that are very mentally healthy and can adapt , not all orangutans can .
We could n't release all of our orangutans so we pick them according to their personality and how smart they are . "
Ms Bullo says she 's confident Semeru will do well in the wild .
" It 's a soft release , so we follow them and give them back up food if they need it .
They 're not just dumped in the jungle and expected to be fine .
It 's a long process . "
She says Temara , an adult female , has responded well to being in the wild .
" We give them the highest quality of care at Perth Zoo but you can't beat a rainforest .
" You know , Temara wakes up every morning and what she does is her choice and that 's the most power you can give an animal and the highest welfare so even though we think we look after them well here , I do n't think really anyone could say it 's better than the rainforest . "
Kylie says she hopes other zoos will adopt a similar program in the future .
" We definitely hope that other zoos would take this on board and the best way to protect the orangutan is to save their habitat so they 're going into the protected area . "
" That 's our aim and once we 've released Semeru , we 'll have two orang - utans that have gone out and we 're also putting a transponder in Semeru which is new technology that 's been developed so we can track him and if he does evade the trackers after some time , we could do searches for him , so I think this would probably give other zoos more confidence as well if they can track their animals . "
Conservation key
The Perth Zoo is the most visited zoo per capita with almost 640,000 visitors last year .
Susan
Hunt says the zoo uses the crowds as an opportunity to engage the community in conservation .
" With all those visitors through the gate , that 's a great vehicle for getting them involved in conservation , to remain relevant and keep demonstrating that we are actually making a difference .
" I would hate it if the zoo moved backwards to be just a place you came to look at the giraffe and elephants because they 're weird because they 're not .
She says the zoo linked up with the only orangutan reintroduction program in Indonesia .
" The only remaining Sumatran orangutan population is in Aceh Provence which is in the north of Sumatra , and what this program is doing is creating another population of orangutans . "
Susan says for the zoo to continue such programs , State Government funding needs to keep coming .
" We have been fairly resource - limited at Perth Zoo .
" We have n't had big dollars .
In other zoos , for example , the elephant exhibit at Taronga Zoo was some $ 40 million , our elephant exhibit was upgraded a few years ago and it cost us about $ 4 million so we have n't had big money . "
Ms Hunt says the zoo needs to keep upgrading and that needs capital .
" Unless we can keep our facilities ... number one for the welfare of the animals and two , as a vehicle for people who want to see how beautiful the environment here at the zoo is , that 's going to be pivotal to keeping them ( people ) coming . "
At least 65,000 mobile phones powered by Google 's Android operating system are being shipped every day , Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said Thursday .
Schmidt , speaking at Google 's annual shareholder meeting at the company 's headquarters in Mountain View , California , said the open - source Android system is now being used on 34 mobile devices in 49 countries .
Google 's Nexus One sold in the US .
" It looks like Android is going to be either the number one or number two player " in the mobile phone market , he said at the meeting which was streamed live on Google - owned YouTube .
Google makes its Android software available to handset manufacturers and also sells its own smartphone in the US , the Nexus One .
mayansmoke : Ergonomic light - background color scheme .
script karma Rating 285/103 , Downloaded by 13025 Comments , bugs , improvements
Vim wiki created by Jeet Sukumaran script type color scheme description
This is a pleasant and ergonomic light - background color scheme , designed for long hours of coding and working .
The UI elements are muted without being drab , the syntax elements are colorful without being garish , and the background is relaxing without being soporific .
It is of a low - enough contrast so as not to cause eye - burn , but high - enough contrast so as not to cause eye - strain .
The syntax coloration offers just a little higher resolution than most , distinguishing between class names vs. functions , strings and numbers vs. other constants , etc .
Many of the colors in this color scheme are drawn from Mayan murals , paintings and codices , and thus the name .

W HEREAS , it is important for all Virginians to understand that the institution of slavery led to this war and was an evil and inhumane practice that deprived people of their God - given inalienable rights and all Virginians are thankful for its permanent eradication from our borders , and the study of this time period should reflect upon and learn from this painful part of our history ...
Yesterday , an explosion in the Upper Big Branch Mine in Montcoal , West Virginia , killed 25 miners .
Four others are still missing .
It 's the largest mining disaster the U.S. has seen in decades .
The explosion was massive .
" Rails used to move heavy equipment inside the mine were left ' twisted like pretzels ' by the force and heat of the blast , " according to the Washington Post .
Right now , nobody knows what caused the blast , but one likely candidate is a build - up of methane — natural gas — in the mine .
I called Christopher Bise , Ph.D. , chair of West Virginia University 's Mining Engineering department , to find out how methane gets into the mines , why the weather matters for mine safety and how one of the best ways to protect miners from methane can actually improve the mine 's bottom line .
Maggie Koerth - Baker :
How does methane get into the mines to begin with ?
Christopher Bise : Methane is natural gas — colorless , odorless and tasteless .
It just flows through sedimentary strata around coal seams and other rock strata .
It 's just naturally there and it's highly explosive , if the concentration is between 5 % and 15 % .
The most violent explosions happen around 9 % methane concentration .
In underground coal mines , they try to control it by pumping in vast quantities of air to keep the concentration below 1 % .
MKB : Why is it only dangerous in that narrow range ?
CB : You need the right mix of methane and oxygen .
Just like any other kind of explosion , you need fuel , oxygen and something to ignite it .
The methane is the fuel .
If you get too much fuel , you do n't have the right ingredients for an explosion .
MKB : What about the ignition source ?
Where does that come from ?
I 'm sure they 're pretty careful about open flames down there .
CB : Oh , yes , they 're very careful about open flames .
But let 's say the mining machinery was ripping away at the coal seam and one of the bits happened to strike a rock and make a spark , like a boy scout starting a fire .
Sparks occur .
That 's why all the machinery has detectors on it .
If the methane concentration gets above 1.5 % , the detectors are supposed to automatically de-energize the equipment .
But that 's not foolproof .
You could get a rush of methane that happens too fast .
MKB : Are there characteristics that make a methane explosion more likely ?
CB : Weather can actually play a role .
If the atmospheric pressure is lower , more methane comes out of the rock .
The depth of the mine also makes a difference .
If a coal seam is 1000 ft. down , it 's very hard to have the methane travel and be exposed to atmosphere and move out .
If a coal seam is close to the surface and outcrops , that 's where methane can escape into atmosphere .
MKB : Is there any reliable way to remove methane from coal mines , or is it a fact of life that you can mitigate , but not really control ?
CB : Some companies are using a successful approach called coal seam degasification .
In advance of opening a mine , they drill the coal seem and drain off the methane .
That way they 're getting rid of the natural gas and then they turn around and they 're selling it .
They 're producing an energy product rather than wasting it , and they 're making the mine safer .
Consol Energy is one of the largest coal mining companies , and they also have a gas division and they make a lot of money selling gas drawn off from their gassy coal mines .
For more information on yesterday 's disaster , check out this live - chat interview with Jeff Goodell , author of Big Coal : The Dirty Secret Behind America 's Energy Future .
He 's got a lot of insight into the politics side of mine safety .

In the spirit of Halloween , I ca n’t help think back to my childhood fascination with the Mummy , the Wolfman and Frankenstein ’s monster , which can be traced to my love of the famous black - and - white films from Universal .
Over the years , these classic creatures often took breaks from terrorizing local villagers to also wreak havoc on Memphis wrestling .
In an interview conducted with Jerry Lawler in 1985 , a freelance mainstream magazine writer asked the King how the Memphis wrestling promotion differed from others around the country .
“ Ours is a very innovative program , ” he explained .
“ For example , we were the first to use music videos , and now every promotion has them . ”
Although the rest of the piece was standard kayfabe fare , Lawler spoke the truth on that one .
Even today , the booking influence of Lawler and partner Jerry Jarrett from the mid-’70s to the mid-’80s is far - reaching .
But in the case of Lawler , a self - avowed comics / horror film fanboy , the results could sometimes be a real horror show by design .
Luckily for the rest of the country , a few things that I saw while growing up in Memphis stayed in Memphis .
While I ’ve used KFR to sing the praises of Memphis wrestling ( actually , I lip - synched them in honor of “ the Singing Cowboy ” Don Bass ) , I would be remiss I did n’t highlight some of the territory ’s most dreaded booking moves .
Although the Mummy had been unearthed years earlier during Lawler ’s brief feud with former manager Sam Bass , Dr. Frank is the earliest memory I have of movie monsters invading the territory .
Lawler and manager Mickey Poole opened an episode of the Memphis show in January 1977 by bringing out a huge wooden box that contained the King ’s new ally .
Throughout the show , grunts and groans could be heard through the makeshift tomb .
When Lawler unlocked the top portion of the box to reveal Dr. Frank — think Boris Karloff from the original — my 5 - year - old self screamed before quickly changing the channel .
( Amazingly enough , I had the same reaction years later watching WWE ’s necrophilia angle with Triple H and the late Katie Vick . )
And much like the Universal classic , the Monster eventually turned on Lawler , forcing the King to burn his creation with a ball of fire .
( Brief clip of Lawler vs. the not - so - jolly green ( in every sense of the word ) giant from a 1978 bout in Tupelo at the 1:36 mark below .
)
When Darth Vader suddenly showed up at the WMC - TV Studios in 1978 , it had Lawler ’s influence all over the gimmick .
The wrestler walked to the ring wearing a Darth Vader mask , black tights / trunks and a black cape .
Upon entering the ring , he removed the helmet and cape … and worked under a standard black hood ( mask ) — and without the heavy breathing and control panel on his chest .
Even as a kid , it was tough to buy this gimmick .
Besides , did n’t Darth have enough problems with the Jedi and Chewbacca without crossing the King ?
The real giveaway that this guy could n’t possibly the disgraced Jedi from the Dark Side : Would n’t Vader simply use a lightsaber — the ultimate foreign object — to finish off his opponent ?
I ’ll hand it to King Fanboy , though :
He got to live out every geek ’s fantasy by battling some of his favorite pop-culture icons in a wrestling ring .
( Well , that was always my fantasy , anyway . )
And when Lawler scored a pinfall over Vader ( Darth , not Big Van ) in what might have been wrestling ’s only Texas Tornado Death Star match , it proved that he was not only monarch of the Memphis mat , but also the King of the whole friggin’ universe .
( For the longest time , I could n’t figure out why Burger King did n’t offer a glass with Lawler ’s likeness ; after all , Luke Skywalker had one . )
Over a period of six months at Mid-South Coliseum in 1978 , three of the biggest icons from my childhood all made appearances : Lawler , Vader and a bald wrestler billed as Kojak ( Len Shelley ) .
That same year , the Kisser ( Wayne Ferris , the future Honky Tonk Man , dressed up like Gene Simmons from KISS ) appeared to wrestle Danny Davis , years before Eric Bischoff had the same masterstroke to bring in the Kiss Demon .
The only hero of mine missing that year was Spider - Man .
But that was only because the promotion had already brought Spidey in as well to work Memphis , on Oct. 30 , 1977 .
( Lawler apparently had been impressed with the way young Parker handled himself against Crusher Hogan in Amazing Fantasy # 15 . )
Memphis grappler Ratamyus must have been a tough customer , because he managed to hold Web - Head to a time - limit draw .
And then , of course , there was the epic showdown between SuperKing ( Lawler in full Superman attire ) and Batman ( the costumed Adam West from the camp 1960s TV show ) , which culminated with the TV actor threatening to inform his pal “ Supes Baby ” that Lawler was stealing his gimmick .
Perhaps Batman had been tipped off that the Riddler had been signed to appear in Memphis on the Sept. 27 , 1977 , card at the Mid-South Coliseum . )
Lawler was fortunate Superman never made it town , though I ’m sure the King of heels would not have been above pulling some Kryptonite out of his tights if the situation had called for it .
( From the clip below , it ’s amusing see West wearing the mask … dressed in a track suit ; he had supposedly been notified by DC ’s attorneys to refrain from wearing the Bat - suit for any televised personal appearances . )
In April 1984 , the Memphis promotion , attempting to capitalize on the popularity of the Road Warriors , Hawk and Animal , whose reputation was spreading like “ Wildfire ” Tommy Rich on the ever - expanding WTBS stage , introduced the apparent third member of the team : Road Warrior Humongous .
Based on the Lord Humongous character in ‘ The Road Warrior ” movie , the sequel to “ Mad Max , ” the role was originally played by former Memphis State University football player Mike Stark ( whom I later had the displeasure of playing for in high school ) .
The gimmick would go on to spawn several imitations , most notably with Jeff Van Kamp in Mid-South and Southeastern / Continental , where Humongous was so over he even received an NWA title bout vs. Ric Flair in Alabama .
With the threat of terror across the nation very real with the release of “ Ghostbusters ” in summer 1984 , Lawler pulled down the strap to protect his then wife , Paula , from the most vile creatures known to man…including Jimmy Hart .
( Warning : Careful before you click .
Much like the “ The Exorcist , ” it ’s hard not to look away … though you know you probably should . )
If it sounds scary , it was .
But it got even scarier when Beelzebub himself , Lucifer ( Frank Morrell ) , and his tag - partner the Prince of Darkness ( Duke Meyers ) showed up wearing red bodysuits and rubber devil masks with horns .
Kevin Sullivan would have cackled with delight .
When Andy Kaufman needed a tag partner against Lawler in 1983 , he did n’t call on Ken Patera .
Instead , the comedian visited Parts Unknown to secure the services of the Colossus of Death ( Meyers again under the hood wearing a rubber movie - monster mask ) .
Eddie Gilbert ’s father , Tommy , and later , his brother Doug , transformed into Freddy Krueger in 1989 .
( Not to be confused with Lawler ’s son Kevin , who became “ Freddy Gilbert ” in ECW . )
Memphis Freddy ’s finisher ?
The claw , of course .
( Most area fans would have taken Freddy over Kerry Von Erich at that point , anyway . )
Unfortunately for serious fans like me , Tommy initially got over so strong as Freddy that the gates of hell ( located somewhere right outside Jonesboro , Ark. , I believe ) opened , spawning the Memphis debuts of Jason Voorhees of “ Friday the 13th ” fame , the Wolfman and The Undertaker ( not the WWE ’s Dead Man , but some guy wearing a rubber mask that looked like Albert Einstein with mixed - up chromosomes ) .
Ironically enough , the Memphis Undertaker worked the territory around the same time The Master of Pain ( Mark Calaway , the future WWE Phenom ) , who had been introduced weeks earlier by Ricky Morton as an ex-convict discovered when the Rock ‘n Roll Express worked a show in an Atlanta prison .
( No word if the Big Bossman was a guard at that same facility , or if Morton was an inmate at the time . )
After months of these gimmicks in 1989 , the movie maniacs had killed the houses to the point that Jarrett was finally able to convince Lawler to turn heel again for the first time in a decade .
Although this move did n’t resurrect the houses of the glory days , the TV show at least became watchable again , if only for Lawler ’s one - liners .
Then came the Texas vs. Tennesee feud in the USWA in 1991 , when Memphis jobber — and CWA World tag champion — Ken Raper ’s career was suddenly reborn as the Leatherface character of “ The Texas Chainsaw Masscare , ” as part of Eric Embry ’s Lone Star stable .
( Raper may have been picked for the role only because he was the only jobber around who actually owned a chainsaw . )
For those horrified at today ’s wrestling product , take heart .
If history is any indication , the wrestling business often gets worse before it gets better .
This weekend , I had a conversation with someone non-crazy who thinks there is a not - insignificant chance that the Supreme Court will overturn health care reform , or at least the individual mandate ( it 's not clear what happens to the rest of the law if the mandate goes down ; there 's some possibility that this would invalidate the entire law ) .
Mind you , this person was not suggesting that the chances were , say , 85 % ; more like 25 % .
But in a case like this , 25 % is a big chance .
So we spent a bit of time speculating about what would happen next .
We know what happens if the court simply invalidates the mandate : you get New York State , where the cost of insurance spirals out of control , until the few remaining people in the individual market are so sick that the death spiral bottoms out .
Adverse selection does have its limits , which is why , even before lemon laws , there was a market ( however imperfect ) for used cars .
What happens after that ?
That would leave politicians deciding whether to repeal the most popular features , or end individual health insurance as we know it .
Fun choice .
My guess is that we'd get some weird hybrid model of corporate and state - sponsored insurance -- but the state sponsored insurance would probably itself be overwhelmed by adverse selection , or ( if we simply funded universal coverage out of tax dollars ) , by employers dumping their employees onto the public plan .
But I have no idea where the money would come from .

Beijing : Archaeologists in China have claimed that they have unearthed at least 2000 - year - old primitive " icebox " from the ruins of an emperor`s residence in northwest Shaanxi Province .
The cylindrical icebox of 1.1 - meter diameter and 0.33 - meter height was excavated in Qianyang County , Tian Yaqi , a researcher with the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology , said .
The box also contains several clay rings .
" The loops were put together to form a shaft of about 1.6 meters tall , " Tina was quoted today by the state news agency .
The shaft was found three meters from the surface in the ruins of an ancient building , which experts believed was a temporary imperial residence during the Win Dynasty ( 221 – 207 BC ) .
" The shaft led to a river valley , but it could not have been a well , " Tina said .
The researcher said that it can not be a well because the underground water level is much deeper than just three meters in the arid northwest China .
" Nor would it have been possible to build a well inside the house , " the researcher said .
Tina and his colleagues believe the shaft was an ice cellar , known in ancient China as " ling yin , " a cool place to store food during the summer .
Reference to the ice cellars could be found in " Book of Songs " , a collection of poetry from the Western Chou Dynasty ( 11th century - 771 BC ) to the Spring and Autumn Period ( 770 - 475 BC ) , which says that food kept in " ling yin " can stay fresh for three days in summer .
" If ice cellars were popular more than 2,000 years ago , it certainly sounds reasonable that the emperor and court officials would have one in their residence , " said Tina .
Covering an area of about 22,000 square meters , the shaft and the residence were first discovered by villagers in 2006 .
The area was immediately fenced off by authorities to protect the heritage site .
Research work , which began in March , ended last week .

Reform of Nato is essential if the organisation is to be effective in meeting its responsibilities in the 21st Century , a panel of experts says .
The alliance must retain the ability to act beyond its territorial limits , said the panel , led by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
It also must be better at communicating its achievements , or risk losing public support , the report concluded .
Nato is due to agree on a new strategic concept at a summit in November .
The Afghan war has been Nato 's largest and deadliest mission .
NATO 's central purpose is to safeguard - by political and military means - the freedom and security of all its members
Nato 2020 report
See full report
It has placed a huge strain on the alliance and fuelled tensions on whether its future focus should be on distant missions or closer to home , says the BBC 's defence and security correspondent , Nick Childs .
The report underlines the alliance 's commitment to Afghanistan , and said it will need to remain able to guard against threats around the world .
" Nato must be versatile and efficient enough to operate far from home , " Ms Albright said .
But it must also better inform the public in Europe and North America how they are getting value from the organisation , Ms Albright and Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said at a press conference on Monday .
New challenges
Ms Albright said the organisation now faces a variety of " new threats from non-state actors " , including terrorism , cyber-crime , and maritime piracy .
The alliance also faces internal differences over its relationship with Russia .
While some countries are keen to improve relations with Moscow , some new members from central and eastern Europe have deep - seated suspicions about Russia 's plans , our correspondent says .
The report calls for efforts to engage Russia in any plans to deploy missile defence systems in Europe .
Moscow 's opposition to a US missile umbrella in Europe has been one of the key sources of tension between the countries in recent years .
" Missile defence is most effective when it is a joint enterprise , and co-operation ... between the alliance and its partners - especially Russia - is highly desirable , " the report said .

I have recently gotten into tiling window managers .
Awesome being the one I 've found I like to use the most .
There are others and they all have their merits , I just settled on this one , and then got comfortable .
I also am a bit of a mutt in what distro's I use .
Work they put ubuntu on my box , home I have usually used fedora but now it 's fedora on the desktop and arch on the laptop .
So the issue was arch and ubuntu both had awesome in the package repos , and fedora did not .
There is discussion out there as to why this was , and you might be interested in it .
Me , I just wanted to use awesome .
So using the directions from the awesome wiki and grabbing the required source rpms cairo - 1.8.8-3.fc12.src.rpm and awesome -3.4.4-1.fc12.src.rpm , I now have awesome on my desktop .
Here are some of the docs and sources I used :
ABOUT 15 YEARS ago , I received a desperate phone call from a woman named Irene .
She had found me by contacting the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation and asking for someone who might help her with her hoarding problem .
Irene was 53 and had just separated from her husband .
She had two children — a 13 - year - old daughter , Julia , who was away at boarding school , and a 9 - year - old son , Eric , who lived at home .
Her husband , an engineer , had been after her for years to get rid of her clutter , which waxed and waned but never went away .
Finally , he told her to clean it up or he would leave .
She could n’t , so he did .
Now she was worried that she would lose her children , in the upcoming divorce , because of the conditions she lived in .
I spotted Irene ’s home immediately after my 90 - minute drive from Northampton , Mass .
Despite its commanding view from atop a hill , the house was dark and gloomy .
Overgrown trees and bushes hid much of it from the street .
Its paint was peeling , and its fence needed mending .
A car parked in the driveway was packed with papers and clothes .
I had brought along a student assistant , Tamara , and as we walked toward the house , we could see boxes , newspapers , clothes , and an assortment of unidentifiable objects pressed against the windows .
We knocked on the front door but got no answer .
We found a side door and knocked .
Something stirred inside the house .
Behind us , a door to the garage opened , and out stepped Irene , slightly overweight and rumpled , with straight brown hair and a friendly smile .
She introduced herself with a nervous laugh and invited us in : “ You ca n’t get in that way .
You ’ll have to come through the garage . ”
Inside the garage we found a narrow path — through a chest - high jumble of boxes , tools , and bags — to the only door in her house not blocked by debris .
IN IRENE , IT turned out , we had found an extraordinarily articulate and insightful subject .
The foreboding exterior of the house belied her personality .
She was friendly , bright , and engaging .
Like other hoarders Tamara and I came to know , though , she was tormented by her situation and demoralized by her inability to do anything about it .
While she was happy to see us , she worried that she was wasting our time , since her problems were of “ no consequence to anyone but me . ”
In reality , the chances are that all of us know someone with a hoarding problem .
Recent studies of hoarding put the prevalence rate at somewhere between 2 percent and 5 percent of the population .
Moreover , the boundaries between normal and abnormal behavior blur when it comes to hoarding .
We all become attached to our possessions and save things other people would n’t .
The passion of a collector , the procrastination of someone who has n’t taken the time to put things away , the sentimentality of someone who saves reminders of important personal events — all these are part of the hoarding story .
Why do certain people go too far ?
Some researchers have posited that people with hoarding tendencies form attachments to possessions instead of people .
The social psychologist Erich Fromm claimed that a “ hoarding orientation ” leads to social withdrawal .
Hoarders , he suggested , are remote and suspicious , preferring the company of objects to that of people .
Irene , however , defied this categorization .
She had a wide circle of friends , and it was easy to see why people liked her .
She laughed easily and was often amused by the ironies of her plight .
One day , as she pondered why she had saved a newspaper ad for new tires , she fell into gales of laughter when she noticed the headline : SAVE THIS AD .
As Irene came more and more to seem like a model subject , the classic definition of hoarding as a socially isolating syndrome appeared to be flawed .
One of Irene ’s favorite things , she said , was to make connections between people with mutual interests .
Unfortunately , her gift for seeing such connections was a factor in her keeping virtually everything she acquired .
Irene was well educated and had a wide range of interests .
She seemed to know something about almost every subject , and she had a story to tell about each possession — most of them remarkably detailed and engaging .
One day she found a piece of paper with a name and phone number on it among the pile of things on her kitchen table and excitedly recounted its history : “ This is a young girl I met at a store about a year ago .
She ’s Hawaiian and had such wonderful stories about Hawaii that I thought Julia would like to write to her .
They are about the same age .
She was such an interesting person , I was sure Julia would enjoy getting to know her . ”
Her face lit up at the prospect of making this connection .
“ But Julia was n’t interested .
I thought about writing her myself , but I never did .
Still , I do n’t want to get rid of the contact .
Julia might change her mind . ”
I had met few people who were as interested in the world around them as Irene , though I later learned that this attribute is fairly common in people with hoarding problems .
As Irene talked , I could see the way her possessions formed the fabric of her life .
The advertisement for the tires led to a story about her car , which led to a story about her daughter wanting to drive , and so on .
A piece of the hoarding puzzle seemed to be falling into place : Instead of replacing people with possessions , Irene was using possessions to make connections between people and to the world at large .
DURING THAT FIRST visit , Irene gave us a tour of her house .
We moved through each room on “ goat paths ” ( a term well - known in the hoarding self - help world ) — narrow trails , not more than a foot wide , where the floor was occasionally visible .
The dining room was the worst room in the house .
Every surface was covered , and the clothes , containers , books , and newspapers climbed above my head .
In the kitchen , a pile of unwashed dishes balanced precariously in the sink , and the countertops were strewn with containers , piles of pens and pencils , bottles of pills .
Only a small corner of the kitchen table was visible , about the size of a dinner plate .
One very small corner of the couch in the TV room was also clear .
That was Irene ’s sorting spot .
She reported that she sat there for at least three hours every day trying to sort through her papers , but the pile was growing steadily despite her efforts .
Irene was apologetic to the point of tears about her situation .
Yet despite being able to talk generally about the irrationality of her behavior , she had difficulty changing the behavior .
When faced with deciding whether to discard a 5 - year - old newspaper , she could not see the absurdity of keeping it .
“ I know I am smart and capable , so why ca n’t I manage my stuff ? ” she asked .
“ I see other people do it .
Why ca n’t I ? ”
In the beginning , I had no answer for her .
But as we learned more about her and her home , the pieces of a new theory about hoarding began to develop .
MOST DESCRIPTIONS
OF hoards include piles of worthless and worn - out things .
Initially , the clutter in Irene ’s kitchen seemed consistent with this model — expired coupons , old newspapers , plastic forks and spoons from fast - food shops .
But mixed among the empty cereal boxes and old newspapers were pictures of her children when they were young , the title to her car , her tax returns , a few checks .
Once when I had convinced her to experiment with getting rid of an old Sunday New York Times without first looking through it for interesting or important information , she agreed but said , “ Let me just shake it to make sure there is nothing important here . ”
As she did so , an ATM envelope with $ 100 in cash fell out .
This illustrated something important .
Irene ’s clutter contained a mixture of what seemed to me both worthless and valuable things but what was to her a collection of equally valuable items .
She described it herself one day as we worked through one of her many piles : “ It ’s like this newspaper advertisement is as important to me as a picture of my daughter .
Everything seems equally important ; it ’s all homogenized . ”
Early on , we asked her to sit in her sorting spot in the TV room and show us how she worked .
Irene agreed , and began by picking out a newspaper clipping from the pile .
It concerned drug use among teenagers and the importance of communication between parents and teens on this issue .
The clipping was several months old .
She said she intended to give it to her daughter as a way of initiating a conversation about drug use .
However , since her daughter was away at school , she would have to wait until she got home .
She said she would put it “ here , on top of the pile , so I can see it and remember where it is . ”
She then picked up a mailing from the telephone company offering a deal on long distance .
She said she needed to read it to tell whether she could get a better price on her long - distance plan .
She put it on top of the pile so that she could see it and would n’t forget it .
She followed a similar logic with the third item , and about a dozen more .
The clipping about drug use was soon buried :
The result of all her effort was that the papers in the pile got shuffled , but nothing was actually thrown away or moved to a more suitable location .
This behavior is so common among people who hoard that we have given it a label : “ churning . ”
The churning we saw in Irene ’s TV room was driven in part by a simple problem with making decisions ( a dysfunction that may reflect common problems with how the brain operates in people who hoard ) .
With each item Irene picked up , she failed to figure out which features were important and which were not , in the same way that she struggled to distinguish important from unimportant objects .
Moreover , she thought of features and uses most of us would n’t .
When she picked up a cap to a pen , she reasoned that the cap could be used as a piece in a board game .
She could n’t throw it out until we had talked through whether this was a reasonable purpose for the object .
The same problem arose with a piece of junk mail from a mortgage company .
She could n’t get rid of it until she figured out what was really important ( or unimportant ) about it .
Sometimes she could decide to throw things away , but often the effort to make the decision was simply too much , and things went back on the pile .
ONE OF THE great challenges in helping a hoarder is distinguishing what is positive in their behavior from what is pathological .
More than anything , hoarding represents a paradox of opportunity .
Hoarders are gifted with the ability to see the opportunities in many things .
They are equally cursed with the inability to let go of any of these possibilities .
When I began working with Irene , a crucial goal was to teach her to tolerate uncertainty regarding unrealized opportunities .
Irene and I eventually worked out a filing system for her papers .
In the beginning , she could tolerate very little of the work I asked her to do .
“ Can we stop now ? ” she asked just five minutes into our first treatment session after she had discarded one scrap of paper .
But she persevered , and worked very hard for the next year and a half to clear out her home .
Each step brought her more of a normal life .
When her kitchen table was cleared , she and her children started sitting down to eat together .
When her whole kitchen was cleared , she resumed cooking .
By the time we stopped working with her , the majority of her home was virtually clutter - free .
And it remained so for a number of years — until her son , too , went away to school .
Then she started hoarding again .

TORONTO —
In a move that will surprise many , Ontario consumers will get a taste of the province ’s dreaded new harmonized sales tax ( HST ) beginning Saturday , two full months before it is fully implemented .
The early start applies to all products and services to be consumed after the 13 per cent tax ’s official start on July 1 .
Airline tickets for fall travel , for example , will be subject to the new blended HST , as will gym memberships , theatre tickets and a range of other goods and services .
( Click here for an HST calculator that will show you how much you 'll pay )
“ I think this takes people by surprise , ” says David Docherty , a political science professor at Wilfrid Laurier University and veteran Queen ’s Park watcher .
Provincial revenue minister John Wilkinson on Thursday defended his decision not to publicize the early transitional start .
He said the rules have been posted on a government website since October .
He blamed businesses for failing to inform the public about the changes .
“ The decision of businesses as to whether or not they marketed that is up to them , ” he told reporters .
“ But this information has been available broadly to the public since ( October ) . ”
Satinder Chera , director of provincial affairs at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , blasted Wilkinson for that response .
“ That ’s quite frankly a little rich , ” Chera said .
“ This is their tax .
This is their timeline …
And they ’re trying to take a back seat on this . ”
The HST , which blends the five per cent GST with the eight per cent retail sales tax , is designed to shift the tax burden from business to consumers .
The change will boost competitiveness in the province , adding jobs and increasing output , according to most economists .
However , it is deeply unpopular with consumers , who will pay eight per cent more on about one in five items previously exempt from the retail sales tax , including hair cuts , gym memberships , home heating bills and gas at the pump .
Many small - and medium - sized businesses are also against the tax , according to Chera .
His members worry the sudden increase in costs will cause consumers to spend less money .
At the same time , he says , they are afraid it will cause the underground cash economy to flourish .
Docherty believes innate unpopularity of the new tax is behind the government ’s decision not to publicize the early transition .
He says governments of various stripes typically advertise major changes of the kind happening now .
“ They have n’t done any of that public advertising that usually you find in a sales tax type of policy change , ” he said .
“ I think the government hoped it would be kind of a sleeper . ”

An Alarming Sign
In a recent column , I referred to the “ Prussianization of American political culture . ”
That means , in other words , the growing tendency of ordinary civilians to defer to people in uniform as persons superior in status or authority , rather than as simply functionaries who get paid to perform a task .
For example , I mentioned the evolution of professional law enforcement officers from being a sort of permanent civic militamen or town watch , salaried officers who got paid to exercise full - time the same posse comitatus rights possessed by ordinary citizens , to possessing an order of authority entirely different from that of the ordinary citizen ( hence the popularity in the press of the gag - inducing term “ the authorities ” ) .
This is a reversal of the progressive development celebrated by Henry Sumner Maine in “ Ancient Law , ” the evolution from societies governed by status to societies based on contract .
The Prussianized deference to anyone in uniform is a regression to society based on status , with titled nobilities whose aura of authority ultimately derived from conquest by the sword .
When those in uniform possess status as a caste , and not as individuals , it ’s a sign we ’re returning to a society of stations or estates , rather than of free and equal individuals whose obligations derive entirely from voluntary agreement .
Lest anyone think this is hyperbole , Keith Taylor ( a PhD student in community economic development at the University of Illinois ) has this interesting anecdote from his trip back from a cooperative conference in Washington :
There were two soldiers on the plane .
When we landed and “ parked , ” this dude behind me says in a loud voice “ I was hoping that the cockpit crew would ask everyone to remain seated so you gentlemen could get off the plane first and reconnect with your families right away . ”
Myself and others acted like we did n’t hear his pandering .
He then utters audibly “ I guess no one is going to respect these guys . ”
Then , as if he can’t handle it , he shouts out “ would y’all please stand aside out of respect to the returning soldiers to let them get to their families as soon as they get off the plane ? ”
At least the guy was n’t snatching food off the trays in - flight to feed “ our hungry heroes . ”
Classic example of showing one ’s belly to ingratiate oneself to the alpha male .
“ I , for one , welcome our new uniformed overlords . ”
I cringe when I hear the words “ thank you for your service . ”
I ’m sure that many people in military uniform joined out of a sincere , albeit misguided , belief that that the wars they were fighting were in some sense to defend American lives and freedom .
But it ’s utterly nonsensical .
Every time I hear someone say the troops in Iraq are “ fighting for your right ” to do this or that , or “ fighting for our freedom , ” I have to restrain myself from going ballistic .
Gary Trudeau even ( even ? ) got into the act .
In a recent Doonesbury strip , the wounded Iraq vet kid with the stutter told one of the open - carry people at Starbucks “ I spent two years behind an M - 60 defending your right to be a moron about guns . ”
No kidding ?
How exactly would those guys ’ rights to pack heat at Starbucks have been threatened if Bush had n’t invaded Iraq ?
I think “ freedom , ” among the “ 100 % Americans ” set , is about like “ Freiheit ” in Nazi propaganda : devoid of content .
“ Freedom ” is just whatever the government ’s “ protecting ” by its wars , by definition .
As Bush said after 9 - 11 , every time we go shopping we ’re proving that we ’re still a free society .
Excuse me ?
I must have missed the place in Rise and Fall of the Third Reich where Hitler tried to discourage good Germans from going shopping .
Real freedom is n’t about doing the kind of stuff government wants us to do .
Real freedom is about doing stuff the government does n’t like , without being wiretapped or herded into a “ free speech zone . ”
I guess all foreign wars are about the “ defense of our freedoms ” in one sense : by definition , there are n’t as many troops still at home to threaten our freedoms ( unless the government hires some folks from Blackwater or Pinkerton to do it instead ) .
The earliest known domestic horses are around 4,600 years old .
They were originated in the steppes between modern Ukraine and Kazakhstan .
Using this evidence , two different hypotheses have been suggested :
1 ) domestic horses spread from this area over the rest of Eurasia ;
2 ) horse domestication was a multiregional process , having occurred several times in different local places .
" Previous analysis on mitochondrial DNA from modern Iberian horses pointed to the D1 haplogroup as the most likely group involved in an independent domestication event , maybe in Iberia or in North Africa " explains Anders Götherström from the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Uppsala University , who headed the project together with Juan Luis Arsuaga of the Centro Mixto UCM - ISCIII from Madrid ( Spain ) .
The researchers have compared the ancient Iberian sequences from Iberian Neolithic , Bronze Age and Middle Ages obtained in this study with more than 1,000 modern horse sequences from different Iberian and non-Iberian breeds , as well as with ancient sequences from other studies .
The researchers found the earliest occurrence of the D1 group in Iberia in a medieval horse .
" We have not found sequences from the Neolithic or the Bronze Age period associated to the most important modern Iberian haplogroup , the D1 group .
That means that D1 group can be a foreigner group , which entered in Iberia during historical times " says Jaime Lira , of the Centro Mixto UCM - ISCIII from Madrid and the main author of this study .
Furthermore , wild horses from Iberia contributed to the domestication process , and the Lusitano group C is a witness from this event .
" The Lusitano C is a small group constituted only by modern horses from Iberian origin .
We have found that maternal lineages from this group were already present in wild Iberian horses from the Early Neolithic , continuing through the Bronze Age until nowadays . " explains Juan Luis Arsuaga .
These results suggest the possibility of a completely independent domestication episode , or the use of Iberian maternal lineages in a restocking process from the wild .
Collaborators on the research included scientists from Centro UCM - ISCIII de Investigación sobre Evolución y Comportamiento Humanos in Spain , Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Spain , Stockholm University in Sweden , Universitat Jaume I in Spain , Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences , University of Copenhagen in Denmark and Uppsala University in Sweden

Comcast cable internet users across the country can now keep track of their data usage to make sure they do n't go over their 250 GB a month data allowance , thanks to bandwidth meters deployed to customers nationwide Thursday .
Comcast will send users an e-mail with a link to the meter , which can be found on their Comcast .
net user page .
As of Thursday , the meter is now available more than 25 states including all or parts of : Oregon , Washington , Maine , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Nevada , New Hampshire , New York , Connecticut , Vermont , Arkansas , Kansas , Missouri , Colorado , Utah , Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Tennessee , South Carolina , Delaware , Maryland , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Virginia , and Washington , D.C.
Comcast , which was dinged by the FCC for throttling peer - to - peer traffic , instituted its 250 GB per month cap in August 2008 – as a way for it to cut down on its heaviest bandwidth users without picking on specific kinds of net usage .
It still sells its internet based on a connection 's speed , not the amount of data used .
Time Warner Cable , among others , have tried testing metered broadband pricing plans , where users paying for the amount of data rather than the throughput .
Time Warner canceled its tests after massive user outrage , and a revolt that eventually got New York 's senior senator involved in the backlash .
Satellite internet providers , as well as most mobile broadband providers , also charge overage fees or penalize users when they go over 5 GB per month .
By contrast , Comcast 's cap is high enough that few users will ever reach , mainly those who download large torrents or stream many movies or share their connections with others .
A typical movie on a peer - to - peer network is about 1 GB .
It remains unclear whether metered broadband – rather than cheap and unlimited service – is the wave of the future , but Comcast cares enough to institute them .
Certainly , if many people start getting cut off or charged extra based on these meters , you can expect that you 'll have a chorus of geeks calling for third - party certification ( if not an outright ban ) on the meters .

After just a couple more weeks of work , we 've made tremendous progress and brought Android to the iPhone 3G .
Although this port is slightly more rough than the previous Android on first - generation iPhone port , this marks an important milestone for the more DIY - minded owners of the millions of iPhone 3G devices that are out there .
Now you can use the Android OS to browse the web and run any application that does not require audio support , as well as send and receive SMS text messages over the cell phone radio .
If you want to try it yourself , you 'll have your chance in a couple of days when the packaged binaries and instructions for the 3G are posted .
We 've also made several other improvements to the original port in this version .
Along with many under - the - hood improvements and bug fixes , the Wi-Fi driver has been fleshed out with all the Android - specific extensions , making it more stable and reliable .
We 've also added an Android icon to the boot menu to make it more easily accessible ..
Next up is audio support -- we've already laid the groundwork for audio support on the 3G and gotten it working in our homemade bootloader , so support for audio in Linux / Android will be coming in a few days .
Also , look forward to improved power management and backlight control very soon .
The hope is that you should soon be able to carry around your first - generation iPhone or iPhone 3G running Android and use it just as normally as you would any other Android phone .

Iteratees Step By Step ( Part 1 )
As you may be aware , iteratee - based I / O is trendy right now .
While I normally avoid trendy things , there are enough smart people talking about how iteratees solve real problems that , just this once , it ’s probably worth taking the time to figure them out .
What I ’ve found , though , is that a lot of the existing resources on these things try to present them in their fully formed state , as a collection of a bunch of weird - looking types and examples , which little introduction to why those choices were made .
That ’s certainly not how I come to understand things !
This is my attempt to fill in the gap .
I present to you a step by step process by which one might have started from a general goal , and arrived at the design of iteratees .
For this part , we ’re ignoring enumerators , or enumeratees , or general iteratees , and instead just deriving a design for pure iteratees .
Believe me , it ’s hard enough just to get that far !
I do not claim that this is the actual thought process that anyone went through , nor that I even understand any number of subtle issues that may arise .
However , that said , I do think that the steps below are plausible , and each of them for the most part motivated by flaws or limitations in the previous stage , such that it ’s reasonable to imagine following this thought process .
Warning :
This is n’t written by someone who is an expert on these concepts .
It may be that there are ideas or important concerns missing here .
If so , I hope others may point them out in the comments .
Step 0 : Taking Stock of the Situation
What everyone knows about iteratees is that they address the problem of doing incremental , composable I /O without being lazy .
It ’s worth taking a moment to familiarize ourselves with the status quo , the thing our iteratees are meant to replace .
First of all , they replace explicit use of file handles .
Explicit use of file handles is generally not composable , involves manipulation things with global state … in short , not very functional !
One of our goals will be to take care of this in one place ; a place that does n’t have to know anything about the application , and therefore can be written once and for all , and reused across applications .
By contrast , lazy I/O is very attractively nice to use .
You interact with the file handle only once , and then are able to write purely functional code on lists .
Unfortunately , it ’s well - known that doing unbounded amounts of lazy I/ O in long - running processes just does n’t work very well .
File handles may be left open indefinitely , and you have no way to do anything about it .
It ’s simply not possible in a long - running application , like a network server of some type , to give up that kind of control completely to non-deterministic subsystem like the garbage collector .
We ’ll be approaching the problem from here on as if we ’re writing a network server where this matters a lot .
So , in contrast with lazy I/O , we ’d like to make sure we know exactly when we ’re done with the file handle , and can pass it off , look for another request in it , etc .
We ’re now left with the question of what to do to meet these goals .
Step 1 : The Starting Intuition
First , to avoid the problem of lazy I/O , we clearly need some deterministic piece of code running somewhere that opens and closes file handles at well - understood times .
Second , though , to avoid the problems of explicit use of file handles in the application code , that piece of code should be separate from the application .
So we need some piece of code whose job it is to manage the file handles , read the data , and …. do what ?
Well , pass it off to some application , which it knows nothing about , and such application in turn knowing nothing for sure about where the data came from !
In other words , instead of the application being in control , and calling the I/O layer as a service , we instead have some piece of core server code in control , doing the I/O and then calling the application as a service to handle the result .
As a first approximation , we expect the server code to look something like this :
server :: Handle -> Application -> IO ( ) server input app = do c <- readSomething input app c
Of course , this is impractical and oversimplified , but it ’s a starting point !
Then it ’s natural to ask what the application does .
Well , it takes a value , and … well … does something !
type Application = Value -> IO ()
This might seem a little unusual if you ’re starting out thinking of a console application , which is run first , and then decides to do some I/O .
It ’s not really all that weird , though , from a server standpoint .
Practically every web application framework in every programming language under the sun does something like this : reads the incoming request and passes it off to the application .
That ’s promising ; at least others have settled on the same kind of answer for the high level problem .
We ’re not off into anything very that unusual yet …
Here ’s where we start to get unusual :
type Value = Char readSomething = hGetChar
Remember all those web application frameworks that we were happy to have as company ?
We ’re parting company now .
They do a lot of the work of reading and handling fairly high - level web - related concerns long before they get into any kind of a event - based mode of doing things .
The high - level interface between the application server and the application might be a nice callback - based one where the server handles the I/O and then calls the application … but dig down a few inches , and the server implements most of the protocol in good old imperative code .
Why ?
They lack composability .
We ’re trying to perform this inversion — the transition from a standard imperative interface to an event - dispatch sort of interface — at a much lower level , by providing data to the “ application ” a character at a time , so that even something like input parsing is done from within the event - based framework !
That ’s where this gets a bit radical .
But it makes , sense , too .
If we truly had a composable way of building applications in this sort of framework , then it should be possible to use it to implement parsing , right ?
Well , not yet , but that ’s our goal .
To illustrate where we are , I ’ll write a simple application : it takes a character you type , and repeats it in upper case .
upperEcho :: Application upperEcho c = putChar ( toUpper c )
Okay , pretty basic , but it ’s working so far !
If it ’s not obvious that this code works , you can build and run it in GHCi .
You ’ll just need to add some imports ( Data .
Char , System .IO ) , and run it with stdin as the handle .
Server only handles a single client request .
That ’s okay : in practice , we probably want to handle one request from a client network connection and close it anyway .
To get a long - running server here , we can always wrap it with Control .
Monad .
forever to handle plenty of sequential incoming requests .
Step 2 : More Input
There ’s one fairly obvious disadvantage to the arrangement we had above .
( Okay , there are many , but we have to start somewhere ! )
It ’s great for applications that need to do something with a character , but it ’s rather awkward to handle applications that might need to wait for a whole word , or even ( gasp ! ) a sentence before responding .
Of course , how characters are grouped into words or sentences is application - specific , so we need to be a bit abstract here .
We ’d like the application to be able to consume some number of characters , and after each one , decide whether to do something now , or hold on and wait until later .
In fact , we already have an intuition for how this ought to work , simply by remembering how to curry functions of multiple parameters .
We need the application to be able to consume the input , and morph itself into a new application that ’s only waiting for the tail of the input .
Time to modify the application type .
This time we need a newtype to avoid a cyclic synonym .
newtype Application = App { runApp :: Char ->
IO Application } server :: Handle -> Application -> IO ( ) server input app = do c <- hGetChar input app ' <- runApp app c server input app '
This is the curried version of our application .
I can now use it to write applications that expect more than a single character of input .
Let ’s try using it to build an application that simply reads a word and prints it in reversed order .
wordReverser :: Application wordReverser = App ( go [ ] ) where go xs c | not ( isSpace c ) = return ( App ( go ( c:xs ) ) ) | null xs = return wordReverser | otherwise = putStrLn xs >> return wordReverser
That ’s not too bad .
A far cry from the ease of using lazy I/O , where we ’d just use the standard library ’s words , then map reverse over the result .
But , at least we ’re able to keep track of all the incremental state using closures , and it ’s sort of fun to build this and play around with it in GHCi using stdin as the stream .
( You ’ll need the imports for Data .
Char and System .
IO that I left out again . )
Unfortunately , it now never stops … but , we ’ll handle that in a bit .
Step 3 : Can We Be More Functional ?
At this point , we may start to get concerned that the IO monad is playing too strong a role in the code .
In particular , we ’ve interweaved IO and input processing in a way that really was n’t done even with lazy I /O .
There , one could have just applied the built - in words function to the lazy input stream , and then only worried about IO once that was done .
Here , even the breaking up of characters into words is being handled by code running in the IO monad .
Let ’s see if we can separate the incremental input from the final IO that happens at the end .
This is going to require dividing the Application type into multiple constructors , one indicating the need to ( in a purely functional way ) partially apply some input , and the other for doing the resulting I / O once enough input has been read .
This also gives us termination back , since we have to define when we ’re done .
data Application = Enough ( IO ( ) ) | Partial ( Char -> Application ) server :: Handle -> Application -> IO ( ) server input ( Enough a ) = a server input ( Partial f ) = do c <- hGet Char input server input ( f c )
Okay , not bad !
Not even significantly longer .
Now I can rewrite my word reverser against this new interface pretty easily .
wordReverser :: Application wordReverser = Partial ( go [ ] ) where go xs c | not ( isSpace c ) = Partial ( go ( c:xs ) ) | null xs = Enough ( return ( ) ) | otherwise = Enough ( putStrLn xs )
That ’s a bit clearer , and the I/ O appears only in one place : inside the Enough constructor .
I do want to point out one thing , though : we ’ve lost a bit versus the previous implementation .
In particular , the previous implementation could have evolved its behavior over time , since we built a new application every time .
We could have preserved that , by having the Enough constructor provide a new Application and have it not terminate ( or only optionally terminate ) again .
However , most network servers do n’t actually want to change their behavior over the long term , so I ’m just sticking with this one .
Step 4 : Handling End of File
One rather glaring omission of everything we ’ve done so far is that we assume that the input stream is infinite .
In the real world , input streams end .
This is easy to handle : we can expand the vocabulary of inputs from Char to something that includes an EOF indicator .
We basically want Maybe , but I ’ll define a new type for the ability to use better names .
data Input = EOF | More Char
( A quick note : Oleg ’s Iteratee code calls this Stream .
I refuse to do so , because it ’s not a stream ; it ’s just one piece of what will eventually be a stream .
But there you go , that ’s the name used elsewhere . )
Then server needs to detect end of file and do the right thing with it .
Our server provides an infinite stream of EOFs when the end of file is reached .
We hope , though , that the application just finishes with Enough as soon as one of them pops up .
data Application = Enough ( IO ( ) ) | Partial ( Input -> Application ) server :: Handle -> Application -> IO ( ) server input ( Enough a ) = a server input ( Partial f ) = do eof <- hIsEOF input c <- if eof then return EOF else fmap More ( hGetChar input ) server input ( f c )
Easy enough .
Now we just need to modify the application one more time .
wordReverser :: Application wordReverser = Partial ( go [ ] ) where go xs ( More c ) | not ( isSpace c ) = Partial ( go ( c:xs ) ) | otherwise = finish xs go xs EOF = finish xs finish [ ] = Enough ( return ( ) ) finish xs = Enough ( putStrLn xs )
That ’s it .
I pulled out the I/ O stuff into finish , since we ’d like to use it from a couple places .
Aside from that , it ’s completely straight - forward .
Step 5 : Chunking the Input
Reading from input streams a character at a time is inefficient .
We ’d like to modify the code so that we can read a bunch at a time .
It would also be very nice to use the ByteString type rather than String , when we choose to do so .
All of this presents a small issue , though .
Often , chunking in an input stream is rather arbitrary , depending on buffer sizes of various software layers in the local server , remote server , or even network routers in between !
It ’s entirely possible that the application might be given too much data .
So we need to add another quirk to the Enough constructor for the application : in addition to the final action to perform , it should tell us the ( possibly empty ) left - over data that it did n’t need .
We also want to be able to compare the leftovers with an empty value , so a derived Eq instance is added .
data Input i = EOF | More i deriving Eq data Application i = Enough ( IO ( ) ) ( Input i ) | Partial ( Input i -> Application i)
It ’s convenient to have a way to append inputs , and noting that EOFs will repeat infinitely anyway , we can do that by throwing away an EOF on the right , and ignoring anything to the right of an EOF .
instance Monoid i => Monoid ( Input i ) where EOF `mappend` _ = EOF x `mappend` EOF = x
More a `mappend` More b = More ( a `mappend` b ) mempty =
More mempty
The types are now parameterized over a “ chunk ” type i , which might be , say , String or ByteString , etc .
Instead of the server using hGetChar , we want to be able to read a chunk at a time .
Time to pick a representation , since the I/ O code ca n’t very easily be type - agnostic .
We use strict ByteStrings , which I ’m assuming are imported qualified with the name B .
hGetChunk :: Handle -> IO ( Input B.ByteString ) hGetChunk h = do eof <- hIsEOF h if eof then return EOF else do b <- hWaitForInput h ( maxBound :: Int ) if not b then return ( More B.empty ) else do fmap More ( B.hGetNonBlocking h maxChunkSize ) where maxChunkSize = 32768
Finally , we ’re ready to rewrite the server , which is now a bit more complex due to the need to handle leftovers from chunking .
server :: Input B.ByteString -> Handle -> Application B.ByteString -> IO ( Input B.ByteString ) server rem input ( Enough a rem ' ) = a >> return ( rem `mappend` rem ' ) server rem input ( Partial f ) | rem == mempty = do c <- hGetChunk input server mempty input ( f c ) | otherwise = do server mempty input ( f rem )
The interface change for server is worth noting .
Running the application might result in a leftover bit of input , so the return type has changed from IO ( ) to IO B.ByteString .
We might also want to then run a second application against the remaining stream , so an Input B.ByteString has been added as a parameter as well .
This lets us put together multiple application pieces later on .
Finally , we ’d like to rewrite the application to make use of this new chunking feature .
Fortunately , the ByteString API contains functions analogous to a lot of the list processing API from the prelude .
wordReverser :: Application B.ByteString wordReverser = Partial ( go [ ] ) where go xs ( More chunk ) | B.null chunk = Partial ( go xs ) | isSpace ( chr ( fromIntegral ( B.head chunk ) ) ) = finish xs ( More ( B.tail chunk ) ) | otherwise = let ( a , b ) = B.break ( isSpace . chr . fromIntegral ) chunk in go ( reverse ( map ( chr . fromIntegral ) ( B.unpack a ) ) ++ xs ) ( More b ) go xs EOF = finish xs EOF finish [ ] rem = Enough ( return ( ) ) rem finish xs rem = Enough ( putStrLn xs ) rem
There it is .
The longest yet , but we ’ve come a long way in robustness and performance .
We now handle incrementally consuming input , EOFs in the stream , and chunked I /O for better speed .
Step 6 : Generalizing the Interface
The applications we ’ve been building have turned an input stream into an I /O action .
But did we really need to turn it into an I /O action ?
What if all we really wanted was to extract out reversed words for use in some other part of the application ?
Then in addition to parameterizing our application based on the input type , we also want to change what it might give back .
This might also be a good time to change a word .
We are n’t really talking about complete applications any more , but rather about ways of getting “ things ” from a stream of input .
We introduce the word Iteratee to represent these mini-application pieces .
data Input i = EOF | More i deriving Eq data Iteratee i a = Enough a ( Input i ) | Partial ( Input i -> Iteratee i a )
We can leave the Monoid instance and hGetChunk alone , which is a nice consequence of having written them separately , so now we ’ll just adapt our server implementation to the new interface .
server :: Input B.ByteString -> Handle -> Iteratee B.ByteString a -> IO ( a , Input B.ByteString ) server rem input ( Enough a rem ' ) = return ( a , rem `mappend` rem ' ) server rem input ( Partial f ) | rem == mempty = do c <- hGetChunk input server mempty input ( f c ) | otherwise = do server mempty input ( f rem )
The implementation looks almost identical ; indeed , there ’s only one change .
Instead of performing the output as an I/O action and then returning the remaining part of the stream , we instead just get the result value and packing it up with the tail in a tuple .
In the spirit of this change , we ’ll change wordReverser to return its result as a String rather than printing it out to the console .
wordReverser :: Iteratee B.ByteString String wordReverser = Partial ( go [ ] ) where go xs ( More chunk ) | B.null chunk = Partial ( go xs ) | isSpace ( chr ( fromIntegral ( B.head chunk ) ) ) = finish xs ( More ( B.tail chunk ) ) | otherwise = let ( a , b ) = B.break ( isSpace . chr . fromIntegral ) chunk in go ( reverse ( map ( chr . fromIntegral ) ( B.unpack a ) ) ++ xs ) ( More b ) go xs EOF = finish xs EOF finish [ ] rem = go [ ] rem finish xs rem =
Enough xs rem
Much more general , and with very few changes !
Note that now , wordReverser is a component that is n’t tied to where its underlying data comes from , nor what we do with its result .
We might begin to see how we might compose this with some other pieces to build a larger application …
Step 7 : Combining Iteratees
In this step , we are n’t going to modify any of the preceding code .
Instead , we ’ll just add a Monad instance for Iteratee .
This will give us powerful tools for combining iteratees together , and building up more complex ones from smaller , simpler ones .
All we need are the two monad operations , return and bind .
Return is an easy one .
If I have a plain value , then the corresponding iteratee consumes no input , produces that value as its result , and the leftover string is empty .
I ’ll rely on the Monoid type class for a suitable definition of “ empty . ”
pureIteratee :: Monoid i => a ->
Iteratee i a pureIteratee x = Enough x mempty
Implementing bind requires a bit more thought .
Remember , the type we want is this :
bindIteratee :: Monoid i => Iteratee i a -> ( a -> Iteratee i b ) ->
Iteratee i b
Hmm .
First of all , if the first iteratee is Enough , then we can just extract its value , and apply the function to get an Iteratee i b .
But what about the leftover piece from the first Iteratee ?
Well , we ’ve already dealt with this once , in the implementation of server from the previous two steps !
Back then , we decided what to do : if the second iteratee is also done , then we append the leftovers to its own .
If not , then we apply the first level of partial evaluation immediately .
bindIteratee ( Enough a rem ) f = case f a of Enough b rem ' ->
Enough b ( rem `mappend` rem ' ) Partial g -> g rem
Now what about when the first Iteratee is not yet complete ?
In that case , we want to pass the second iteratee down the line until it is .
bindIteratee ( Partial f ) g = Partial ( \ c -> bindIteratee ( f c ) g )
With those two operations , we now define a Monad instance .
instance Monoid i => Monad ( Iteratee i ) where return = pureIteratee ( >>= ) = bindIteratee
As a trivial example of what one can do with this interface , I ’ll now refactor wordReverser as the combination of simpler iteratees .
itChar :: Iteratee B.ByteString ( Maybe Char ) itChar = Partial $ \ i -> case i of EOF -> Enough Nothing EOF More c | B.null c -> it Char | otherwise -> Enough ( Just ( chr ( fromIntegral ( B.head c ) ) ) ) ( More ( B.tail c ) ) itWord :: Iteratee B.ByteString ( Maybe String ) itWord = do c <- it Char case c of Nothing -> return Nothing Just ch | isSpace ch -> itWord | otherwise -> wordFrom [ ch ] where word From s = do c <- it Char case c of Nothing -> return ( Just s) Just ch | isSpace ch -> return ( Just s ) | otherwise -> wordFrom ( s ++ [ ch ] ) wordReverser :: Iteratee B.ByteString ( Maybe String ) wordReverser = do s <- it Word return ( fmap reverse s )
Okay , that ’s a bit longer , but the important bit here is that it was built up logically from simpler pieces , all of which can be easily reused .
Step 8 : Iteratee Error Handling
So far , so good .
It certainly seems much easier to deal with our iteratees now that they can be built compositionally using monads .
It was a little awkward , though , to handle the Nothing cases in all of the code above .
It would be nice if , instead of having to handle error conditions everywhere they occur , unexpected errors could be propogated for us to the end .
In other words , we ’d like our iteratees to have an error state , which , once it ’s entered , simply remains there so that the error is reported at the end .
An obvious design would be to have constructors Enough , Partial , and Error for the Iteratee type .
However , to make a little jump here just to stay with Oleg ’s design even when I do n’t think it ’s so obvious , we ’d like to have errors be recoverable .
That is , we note that the error has occurred , and the user can choose to fix the error , and then provide new input that succeeds .
To do so , an error will be considered to be a Partial , but with an error message .
data Input i = EOF | More i deriving Eq data Iteratee i a = Enough a ( Input i ) | Partial ( Input i -> Iteratee i a ) ( Maybe String )
The second field of Partial is the current error message .
If it ’s Nothing , then there is no error .
If it ’s something , then there is an error , which is recoverable by providing an appropriately fixed input chunk .
Of course , our generic server can’t really do anything with errors except give up and fail .
So we just add a case for it to do so .
server :: Input B.ByteString -> Handle -> Iteratee B.ByteString a -> IO ( Either String a , Input B.ByteString ) server rem input ( Enough a rem ' ) = return ( Right a , rem `mappend` rem ' ) server rem input ( Partial f Nothing ) | rem == mempty = do c <- hGetChunk input server mempty input ( f c ) | otherwise = do server mempty input ( f rem ) server rem input ( Partial f ( Just err ) ) = return ( Left err , mempty )
The server gives up early , true , but we do want to do the right thing with errors during the plumbing with the Monad instance , so that another , smarter server may still do something more interesting .
We do so here .
I also inline the named functions from the previous section , for brevity ( the inlining related changes are not in bold , breaking my convention , but so that the actually relevant changes are more obvious ) .
instance Monoid i => Monad ( Iteratee i ) where return x = Enough x mempty ( Enough a rem ) >>= f = case f a of Enough b rem ' ->
Enough b ( rem `mappend` rem ' ) Partial g Nothing -> g rem i -> i ( Partial f err ) >>= g = Partial ( \c -> f c >>= g ) err
Given this new error handling framework for iteratees , one would hope that we could simplify the code for some of the previous code .
Alas , in general , this is not possible , because we did n’t want to treat end of stream as an error ; just as a termination condition .
If we were willing to treat it as an error , though , we could write some shorter code .
itChar :: Iteratee B.ByteString Char itChar = Partial go Nothing where go EOF = Partial go ( Just " unexpected EOF " ) go ( More c ) | B.null c = itChar | otherwise = Enough ( chr ( fromIntegral ( B.head c ) ) ) ( More ( B.tail c ) ) itWord :: Iteratee B.ByteString String itWord = do ch <- it Char if isSpace ch then itWord else wordFrom [ ch ] where word From s = do ch <- it Char if isSpace ch then return s else word From ( s ++ [ ch ] ) wordReverser :: Iteratee B.ByteString String wordReverser = liftM reverse itWord
This is the same as the previous code except that the end of file is NOT accepted as a valid terminator for the word , which instead must be followed by a space character .
Errors are fully recoverable ( but not recovered in the server code above ) , and propogated automatically through the monad .
Step 9 : Underlying Stream Error Handling
This is a minor detail to handle .
Currently , we have no idea what to do with errors in the underlying stream .
For example , if reading from a file on disk fails not due to end of file , but rather because the disk is corrupt , there ’s no way to catch and handle that scenario .
In other words , entirely separate from there being processing errors at the iteratee level , there may also be physical errors on the stream .
These should mostly be handled like EOF ( there ’s little point in “ trying again ” to read from a failed stream . )
But it would be nice to keep track of the fact that an actual error occured rather than an EOF .
The change is to the Input type .
data Input i = EOF ( Maybe String ) | More i deriving Eq data Iteratee i a = Enough a ( Input i ) | Partial ( Input i -> Iteratee i a ) ( Maybe String )
Then we just need to propogate that around .
The Monoid instance just keeps track of errors .
The only non-obvious bit is that we sometimes append an empty value to the left , and when we do so , we ought to preserve the error rather than throwing it away .
instance ( Eq i , Monoid i ) => Monoid ( Input i ) where EOF err `mappend` _ = EOF err x `mappend` EOF err | x == mempty = EOF err | otherwise = x
More a `mappend` More b = More ( a `mappend` b ) mempty =
More mempty
We also need to add an Eq context for the Monad instance , as follows .
instance ( Eq i , Monoid i ) => Monad ( Iteratee i ) where
The higher - level iteratees that we ’ve written do n’t need to be modified .
Instead , we just need to modify the “ low - level ” one , itChar .
Even if only gets a trivial modification .
itChar :: Iteratee B.ByteString Char itChar = Partial go Nothing where go ( EOF ( Just err ) ) = Partial go ( Just ( " Error in stream : " ++ err ) ) go ( EOF Nothing ) = Partial go ( Just " unexpected EOF " ) go ( More c ) | B.null c = itChar | otherwise = Enough ( chr ( fromIntegral ( B.head c ) ) ) ( More ( B.tail c ) )
The final change we need is to hGetChunk , which should now detect errors in the stream , and report them .
hGetChunk :: Handle -> IO ( Input B.ByteString ) hGetChunk h = handle ( return .
EOF .
Just .
( show :: IOException -> String ) ) $ do eof <- hIsEOF h if eof then return ( EOF Nothing ) else do b <- hWaitForInput h ( maxBound :: Int ) if not b then return ( More B.empty ) else do fmap More ( B.hGetNonBlocking h maxChunkSize ) where maxChunkSize = 32768
Those are all of the necessary changes to propogate underlying stream errors around the system .
Step 10 : Take a Break !
We ’ve done a lot , so this is is where I ’ll stop for now .
This gets you all the way through pure iteratees , which is the first of a number of topics in the iteratee - based I /O world .
I hope to write another installment where we do a bit more , working with some of the other concepts that arise .
For example , our server function is a bit of an ad hoc thing that just sort of organically appeared , so we can poke at it to see where it goes ( enumerators and enumeratees ) , and we might be interested in doing incremental effectful stuff as we do the processing of the input , so we would then need to generalize the iteratees to effectful ones .
That ’s all a task for a later day , though .
We ’ve come rather a long way , though .
The composability of the code above is the most important thing .
Once can easily see a path from something like itChar to something like this :
myWebAppHandler :: Iteratee B.ByteString ( IO ( ) ) myWebAppHandler = do req <- itHTTPRequest let username = getParam " username " req let password = getparam " password " req ...
So we ’ve really built , in a sense , the core of a composable network server application .
Australia 's policy of restricting antibiotic use in food - producing animals may be linked with lower levels of drug - resistant bacteria found in its citizens , according to an article in the May 15 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases , now available online .
Campylobacter jejuni is a leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness in industrialized countries .
Drug resistance can make Campylobacter infections difficult for physicians to treat , and can result in longer bouts of diarrhea and a higher risk of serious or even fatal illness .
Bacterial resistance to drugs is generally attributed to inappropriate prescribing or overuse of antibiotics .
An Australian solution to the drug resistance problem has been to prohibit the use of certain antibiotics , called fluoroquinolones , in food animals such as poultry .
Such a policy puts Australia in a relatively unique position , since its animal and food production levels are comparable to those of other industrialized nations , but it has avoided using the antibiotics that have been standard in the other countries ' food animal production .
To evaluate whether the country 's restrictive antibiotic policy has affected bacterial drug resistance , Australian researchers examined C. jejuni isolates collected from 585 patients in five Australian states .
None of the patients had received fluoroquinolone treatment within the month prior to becoming ill .
The researchers discovered that only 2 percent of the locally acquired Campylobacter isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin , a type of fluoroquinolone .
Countries that allow fluoroquinolone use in animals may have a drug resistance prevalence of up to 29 percent .
Ciprofloxacin can be used to treat severe Campylobacter disease , so a low level of bacterial drug resistance should lead to better treatment efficacy .
" There are different causes that lead to bacterial antibiotic resistance , and use of antibiotics in food animals is only one of the multiple causes , " said lead author Leanne Unicomb , an epidemiologist with OzFoodNet and Australia National University .
However , the evidence indicates that " use of fluoroquinolones in food animals in other countries has increased the risk of resistance in [ Campylobacter ] isolates infecting humans , " she said .
The researchers concluded that the low drug resistance they found " probably reflects Australia 's policy of prohibiting fluoroquinolones for animal use . "
Other industrialized nations have also realized the apparent benefits of restricting antimicrobial use in animals .
Sweden prohibited the use of fluoroquinolones for food animals in 1986 , Norway has never licensed their use in food animals , and both countries have reported low trends -- similar to Australia 's -- in fluoroquinolone - resistant Campylobacter infecting humans .
The United States , in a recent effort to reduce American levels of Campylobacter drug resistance , has taken a cue from other countries ' success .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed banning fluoroquinolones in poultry in 2000 , but one drugmaker fought the ban until it was finally enacted in September 2005 .
Reducing the use of antibiotics in food animals , coupled with the authors ' additional recommendation of " sensible use of fluoroquinolones in clinical settings , " seem to be steps in the right direction toward curbing harmful foodborne bacterial drug resistance .
