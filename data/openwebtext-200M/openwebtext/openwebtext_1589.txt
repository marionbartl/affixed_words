You probably heard Cevat Yerli ( CEO of Crytek ) talking about the ‘ end of free demos ’ last week , if not here ’s a link to the interview .
None of his comments make any sense to me .
Let ’s take them one by one :
1 . “ I think that we ’ll see more and more games not carrying a demo in the future , because it becomes prohibitively expensive . ”
How does a demo become prohibitively expensive ?
You are not going to be creating demo- specific assets apart from some splash screens , a bit of coding to cover the premature ending and the ‘ wrapper ’ for console demos .
It is only on PS3 that Sony charge you for each download of a demo – Xbox 360 and PC are free .
And if you have scheduled in the demo- specific requirements from the beginning ( and you have done that have n’t you Mr Yerli and you ’re not just trying now to ‘ fit in ’ the demo before you go gold ? ) then you have already factored in the man -hours expenditure .
2 . “ Also , given the time pressures in making a demo – in fact given the time pressure of making a quality demo – I think it all becomes really difficult to work with … ”
Again , if already scheduled in , as any competent producer should have done , there are no time pressures .
Therefore there is no concern about making a quality demo .
Certainly there can be bugs and development issues that you do n’t want affecting the quality of the demo ( which is typically taken from pre-Gold code so that it can be released prior to the full game ) but that ’s why the demo is planned in , to take account of these recognised difficulties .
It only becomes “ difficult to work with ” if you have n’t planned properly .
3 . A free demo is a luxury we have in the game industry that we do n’t have in other industries such as film .
A couple of points here :
He is deliberately conflating game demos with price to try to create a duality that does n’t exist .
Game demos ARE free .
That ’s the whole point of them .
PAID demos do not exist .
They never have ( unless you count those £ 1 demo discs you very rarely get in games stores ) .
By this reasoning no one would ever give away up to 1 / 2 of their entire game content for free to entice customers to buy .
Good grief , it ’s like shareware never existed .
And he obviously has n’t watched many film trailers recently .
Or development diaries by the director / actors / production crew / special effects team featuring behind the scenes and actual film footage , released for free on official websites to promote the picture .
An absolute luxury with no function I can discern for the film or their potential customers .
/ sarcasm
4 . “ Because we ’ve had this free luxury for so long , now there are plans to change this people are complaining about it . ”
Again with the ‘ free luxury ’ falsity .
Cevat , your customers are complaining because they do n’t want to pay for your advertising .
Also , a minor technical point regarding PC demos : many people use these not just to sample the game , but also to see if it will actually work on their near - infinite combination of graphics cards , sound cards , drivers , memory , OS , installed software etc , etc .
Demos have been used for decades to allow the player to sample the game to see if they want to purchase the full title .
Start charging for demos and they are going to start NOT buying the demo OR the full game .
This is another example of companies trying to ‘ lock in ’ their content to try and squeeze more money from it .
Where next – no gameplay videos unless you pay to subscribe to their website ?
Each screenshot you view on EuroGamer swipes a 2 p micro-payment ?
The more you lock in content designed to advertise the game , the fewer people see it so the fewer people buy , because they either did n’t know about your game or did but never had the chance to sample it so are n’t going to chance £ 40 .
Bit of a shame he has such blinkered thinking on this issue , as some of the other points he talks about in the interview are valid .

Young says :
Randy and I at Nerd Merit Badges made special attendance badges for JSconf ( a Javascript developers ' conference ) this year .
The conference had a pirate theme , so we used an iconic skull from Noah Scallin 's Skull - A - Day font .
We thought it turned out GREAT , and so did Noah .
And so did Girl Scout Troop 202 in California , who asked us to make them an actual troop crest .
As in a REAL troop crest , which means that some sort of Velveteen Rabbit magic has happened , and now we at Nerd Merit Badges have now ended up making real insignia .
The skull is in metallic gold thread , against green twill — we think these scouts will be the toughest - looking troop out there !
When asked what animals symbolise China and India , most people would probably say the dragon and the elephant .
In terms of long - term economic prospects , however , the hare and the tortoise may well turn out to be the more appropriate choice .
While India is moving more slowly than China at this point , there is a real possibility that over the next decades , we may see it catching up and , ultimately , pulling ahead .
With the exception of some patriotic Indians , most people will find this point surprising , if not far - fetched .
Certainly , on its past and present form and record , China has been winning the contest hands down .
Adjusted for differences in purchasing power , China ’s total GDP in 2008 -- the latest year for which confirmed World Bank statistics are available -- was more than twice that of India .
If we standardise by population , India narrows the gap somewhat , but China ’s per capita GDP is still about twice that of India -- approximately US $ 6,000 .
This is even more remarkable given that China ’s per capita GDP in 1978 , the year Chinese economic reforms began , was just slightly more than half that of India .
Absolute poverty rates in China , which used to be one - third higher than in India in 1981 , are now half those of India .
And despite Indian economic reforms from 1991 , the economic output gap has been growing further : between 2004 and 2008 , China ’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 10.8 per cent , compared with 8.7 per cent for India ’s economy .
There are good reasons for China ’s ability to pull so far ahead of India .
One centres on economic fundamentals .
Scholars usually attribute economic growth in the early stages of development mostly to mobilisation of capital and of labour into productive processes .
There is obviously no shortage of capital for large Chinese firms today , but even in the early 2000s , China ’s real interest rates for listed firms were less than half those paid by their Indian counterparts .
China also continues to attract vastly more foreign direct investment , by a factor of 2.5 , though India has been catching up in this area .
Yet mobilising capital is the easy part .
Building up a good basis of human capital is even harder , and here India has been severely handicapped .
Labour regulations in India have prevented the mass mobilisation of people into industry .
In addition , even basic skills are often missing .
Average illiteracy rates in India are about 40 per cent , compared with less than 10 per cent in China .
Among the young , China is achieving almost universal literacy ; India ’s education system still fails to reach about a quarter of this cohort .
Underlying these differential developments are variations in the roles played by the state .
The World Bank ranks India 133rd out of 183 economies in terms of ease of doing business , while China is placed at 89th .
In fact , Indian businesses tend to succeed where they can evade state rules and regulations .
For instance , India ’s comparative advantage in services such as business process outsourcing can , in good part , be explained by two factors .
First , the state never got around to regulating it .
And second , unlike for manufactured products , the export of these services is not hamstrung by bad roads and lengthy customs procedures ; as long as the data and phone lines are operational , business can proceed .
And at an even more fundamental level , Chinese culture is arguably more conducive to economic development and growth than India ’s .
Both countries were historically subject to caste structures -- in China along Confucian lines , in India following Hindu precepts .
But there was one very important difference : mobility between the castes .
In India , there was none , short of rebirth in a higher caste .
Any attempts to stretch beyond the limits of one ’s caste were , at a minimum , discouraged .
Conversely , in China , mobility was built into the system through education , and in principle , anyone , no matter how humble in background , could reach the apex of the caste pyramid and become a mandarin in the capital if he succeeded in passing the state examinations .
Just as the caste system and its limitations linger on in India , and in its rural parts continue to hold people back , the notion that educational attainment is the road to success remains deeply ingrained in the Chinese mindset .
It goes without saying that the latter mode is much more conducive to economic growth .
In short , China looks like the sure winner .
But so did the hare , and the tortoise beat him nonetheless .
China is not going to fall asleep by the wayside , as the hare in Aesop ’s fable .
But a number of developments may conspire to allow India to catch up and , in the long run , perhaps even to surpass China .
One of these developments is demographic change .
As a consequence of its one - child policy , China is set to undergo demographic ageing so rapid that China has been said to be likely to grow old before it grows truly rich .
Indeed , in twenty years , China ’s percentage of old people is likely to reach about the same level as in the more developed countries today .
This raises the question of how to devise social security and medical systems to take care of the elderly .
It also means that the proportion of young , and typically highly productive , workers is falling fairly rapidly .
Abolishing the one - child policy might reduce the scope of the problem , but it will not eliminate it .
India does not face this problem , though it remains to be seen whether government policies will adjust sufficiently for the country to be able to take advantage of this “ demographic dividend . ”
A second point pertains to the finding that high economic performance requires good institutions , or ways of running and doing things .
As it turns out , the real challenge in economic development is not getting to a per capita GDP of US $ 3,000 , or 6,000 , or even 10,000 .
Rather , economies tend to hit a wall once they reach about US $ 15,000 per capita .
China is likely to reach this barrier around 2020 , while India will probably take about a decade longer to get there .
It is hard to predict which of them , if any , will succeed in scaling this wall of institutions .
As the examples of Hong Kong and Singapore suggest , Western - style democracy does not seem to be a necessary condition , so China is not necessarily at a disadvantage .
At the same time , it has only about 10 years left to start approximating conditions in these two places .
India , by contrast , has the luxury of a 20 - year reform period , though success is contingent on whether its political system will make the most of this opportunity .
A third , and perhaps decisive , factor concerns geopolitics .
Here , most models of international relations point to the same conclusion : China is heading for a period of increasing conflict and rivalry with the United States .
The so - called realist school frets that the change in balance of power between the nations is likely to lead to conflict .
The liberal school points to numerous points of disagreement , ranging from economic frictions about trade and exchange rates to matters such as Tibet and Taiwan and human rights , on which constituents on both sides maintain different views .
The institutionalist school of thought would hope that the World Trade Organisation , the United Nations and other bodies can keep these tensions in check ; at the same time , neither nation has a spotless record in terms of compliance with international institutions .
It is in this context that India may emerge maybe not triumphant , but possibly privileged .
For realists , a stronger India represents a useful ally for balancing China ’s increasing economic and military strength .
For liberals , India tends to be more palatable as a partner because it is a fellow Western - style democracy , albeit an imperfect one with a poor human rights record .
It is consequently possible that the United States will begin to offer preferential treatment to India just as friction with China grows .
Such a move would not be unprecedented .
During the Cold War , the United States promoted economic growth and development among allies such as Japan , South Korea , and West Germany by providing , among others , access to finance and markets .
First signs of such balancing behaviour have begun to emerge , such as the 2005 US - India Civilian Nuclear Agreement .
The overall effect does not need to be that China will be cut off from the world economy in the same way the Soviet Union was during the Cold War .
But at a minimum , India is likely to gain an advantage relative to China , that in the end may enable this particular tortoise to beat the hare .

Sprint's Prepaid Multi-Brand Strategy Focuses on Distinct Customer Segments
Differentiated Brands Old & New Aim to Serve Increasingly Diverse Audiences , Tackle Specific Competitors
WARREN , N.J. , May 06 , 2010 ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Sprint [ NYSE:S ] today officially unveiled its comprehensive multi-segment approach to the prepaid wireless marketplace .
Since Sprint 's acquisition of Virgin Mobile USA , Inc. , the company has rolled out a series of new prepaid products , enhancements and industry - advancing products , each designed to appeal to specific customers in the wireless space .
" We brought together the resources and experience of the Boost and Virgin Mobile teams in late 2009 , " said Sprint CEO Dan Hesse .
" Since that time , we have been developing the critical pieces of our multi- brand prepaid strategy .
Our approach to the prepaid market can truly set us apart from the competition with tailored offers that will address specific needs in this growing market . "
" This is the year that prepaid moves to the forefront of the wireless industry , " said Dan Schulman , president of Sprint 's prepaid group .
" In the first quarter of 2010 , more than half of the mobile gross additions in the U.S. selected prepaid , and we predict that approximately 70 % of the net adds in 2010 will choose plans without a contract . "
" With almost 60 million people now on prepaid service , " Schulman continued , " the no-contract market has clearly moved beyond the credit - challenged and lower income segments .
The prepaid market has changed dramatically , with customers across multiple demographics and lifestyles demanding a wide variety of handsets , features , and plans tailored to their specific needs and wants . "
Sprint 's prepaid portfolio will initially be driven by four brands , with each focused on a specific audience .
" The launch of this portfolio goes far beyond changing prices , " explained Schulman .
" We are introducing innovative and attractive offers for specific groups of customers based on usage and habits - from those who are on limited budgets and use their phones infrequently to those who want high - end devices to use for all their communications , entertainment and social networking . "
Virgin Mobile USA
Reinventing prepaid wireless once again , Virgin Mobile will introduce an innovative new value proposition that focuses on serving customers who use text and data services to power constant connection with their social networks .
With unlimited messaging , email , data and web included on all plans starting at just $ 25 a month and a new high - end handset lineup , Virgin Mobile will offer a clear alternative for customers who want a data - driven service without expensive annual contracts and thousands of unnecessary voice minutes .
With the addition of the lowest - priced BlackBerry ( R ) service plan in the market , Virgin Mobile will provide real value for individuals looking to stay connected without compromising on handset or service quality .
The way youth and young adults communicate has changed dramatically over the past few years .
Data from Nielsen shows that usage patterns for postpaid mobile subscribers aged 18 - 34 shifted from 2007 to 2009 .
Minutes of talk dropped over 10 % while messages sent and received grew by more than 150 % .
The amount of data usage within this group grew by over 1800 % during the same time period .
Beyond Talk ( TM )
On May 12 , Virgin Mobile will unveil three new " Beyond Talk " plans that all include unlimited messaging , email , data and web [ with no incremental fees or taxes ] :
* The revolutionary $ 25 plan is the industry 's lowest price point for unlimited messaging , email , data and web with 300 minutes of voice per month , ideal for high - end device users seeking an unbeatable price to enable the text and data services they need .
* The $ 40 plan includes unlimited messaging , email , data and web with 1,200 minutes of voice per month -- the perfect value for those seeking an affordable plan with everything they need .
* The $ 60 plan includes unlimited messaging , email , data and web with unlimited voice to offer great value for high - end smartphone users expecting an unlimited plan to cost much more .
For the first time , Virgin Mobile customers can add Blackberry ( R ) data service to any of these plans for just $ 10 more , enabling an unprecedented $ 35 plan consisting of both voice calling and Blackberry data service .
" Our new offers target a continuing evolution in wireless consumer behavior - increased use of text and data services as a form of wireless communication over talk , " explained Schulman .
" These Beyond Talk plans offer the most accessible solution for customers seeking that data - driven lifestyle -- unlimited text and data on their terms without a contract , at prices they will love , without requiring them to buy extra minutes they do n't need . "
New Handsets
Virgin Mobile 's new handset lineup proves that a two - year contract is n't necessary to get a hot data - driven device :
* The Blackberry Curve ( TM ) 8530 smartphone is a particularly desirable device without a contract .
Key features include an approachable form factor , full - QWERTY keyboard , optical track pad , Wi-Fi connectivity , dedicated media keys , and 2 MP camera .
The Blackberry Curve 8530 smartphone will be available for $ 299.995 at retail and at www.virginmobileusa.om at the end of May .
* The LG Rumor Touch ( TM ) at $ 149.99 is the first full touch interface handset from Virgin Mobile and is only available without a contract on these plans .
Customers can use all the data they want and message all of their friends easily and simply with a Beyond Talk plan .
This handset is ideal for the super - connected with an external memory drive that can store up to 16 GB of data .
* The very popular LG Rumor 2 ( TM ) QWERTY launched last year , also only available without a contract from Virgin Mobile .
For $ 89.99 , it allows customers to message quickly and easily with preloaded apps like the Ultimate Inbox , threaded messaging and Connect social networking .
The popular Opera Mini web browser is included as well .
* The Kyocera Loft QWERTY for $ 69.99 suits message - savvy customers perfectly with an embedded instant messaging and email application , and message threading for SMS and MMS in a single inbox .
The camera phone includes the networking features mentioned above as well as a Google Maps and other navigational applications .
Virgin Mobile USA continues to serve its current base of prepaid customers with a wide range of handsets , monthly unlimited plans , Minute Packs , Texters Delight and Broadband2 Go .
Broadband
Broadband2
Go , launched last year under the Virgin Mobile label , also targets the needs of the high data - using crowd that wants easy wireless Internet access wherever they are but does n't want to sign a long - term contract .
" Since we expanded distribution , lowered the price , and added more data capacity without changing prices , sales have tripled , " said Schulman .
" We 'll continue to enhance this product line as well , possibly under multiple brands to include new services and the very latest in high speed networks , including 4G where available . "
Broadband2
Go operates on Sprint's Nationwide Network , unlike other prepaid broadband offers .
Boost Mobile
Boost Mobile continues its popularity by focusing on consumers who love to talk and text and stay connected with the best value and straightforward monthly unlimited pricing .
With more than 25 % of U.S households now wireless - only for voice6 , Boost offers value and service that is second to none .
This week , Boost added unlimited 411 calls , email and instant messaging to its $ 50 Monthly Unlimited plan , which also features unlimited talk , text and web access .
Boost 's ever - increasing suite of CDMA handsets , introduced in late January , is driving significant consumer demand .
The Blackberry Curve 8830 smartphone , launched earlier this year , is joined by the Samsung Rant ( TM ) and , from Sanyo by Kyocera , the Incognito ( TM ) , Mirro ( TM ) SCP3810 and Juno ( TM ) on the CDMA side .
Depending on a customer 's choice of features , Boost Mobile also is available on the Nextel National Network for push - to - talk technology .
Assurance Wireless
First launched late last year , Assurance Wireless is a free wireless service developed specifically for the 37 million eligible low - income households who need it most .
Qualifying customers - often cash - constrained individuals eligible for government - assistance programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP , or food stamps ) - receive a free cell phone and 200 free minutes of airtime for local and long - distance calling every month .
Sprint is " proud to offer this valuable program , " according to Schulman , which is currently available in Michigan , New York , North Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia and will continue to expand as individual states approve the program .
To date , hundreds of thousands have signed up for this uniquely tailored offer .
Sprint anticipates that Assurance Wireless will be available in approximately 25 states by the end of 2010 .
A New Pay By the Minute Brand
During Sprint 's first quarter earnings call , reference was made to another new brand to launch this month targeting budget - conscious customers who spend less than $ 30 per month and are focused on the value they pay per minute .
Roughly 63 % of the no-contract market chooses to pay by the minute or by the day .
" There are millions of people who do n't want or can't afford smartphones and expensive data plans , " said Schulman .
" This is the traditional no - frills prepaid customer base .
For these ' basic communicators , ' we are creating a fresh brand with industry - leading value and consumer - friendly offers . "
Designed to resonate directly with cost - conscious consumers , this new brand is expected to initially debut at retail in approximately 16 markets .

It ’s easy to think that fortune favours the beautiful and too often we assume that Heidi Klum , Victoria Beckham and Taylor Swift had their success handed to them .
That assumption however , would be wrong .
Here are our favourite quotes by 11 inspirational women who have got to where they are through motivation , determination and a lot of hard work …
1. Heidi Klum
‘ It ’s not as if I sit back and watch things fly onto my plate .
I went for a lot of the things .
Success does n’t happen by waiting for things to happen because there are other people who are hungry .
The early bird catches the worm . ’
2. Emma Watson
‘ I ’m my own worst critic .
I think that ’s really hard , but it also spurs me on .
I always want to do better .
I ’m always striving towards the next thing . ’
3. Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen
‘ It ’s just the way we are , the way we were raised .
Our work ethic was everything , and that never left us .
We like to work hard , and we like to try to do everything 100 percent . ’
4. Sarah - Jessica Parker
‘ We did n’t have a lot when I was growing up , and it ’s the best thing that happened to me because I appreciate everything .
I developed a strong work ethic , and I do n’t take anything for granted . ’
5. Victoria Beckham
‘ I ’ll admit it : I ’m a control freak .
I am .
If I ’m going to do something , I ’m going to do it 110 % or there ’s no point in doing it at all , especially if the work takes me away from time with my husband and children . ’
6. Margot Robbie
‘ Everyone ’s like , “ overnight sensation ” – It ’s not overnight .
It ’s years of hard work . ’
7. Beyoncé
‘ I can never be safe .
I always try and go against the grain .
As soon as I accomplish one thing , I just set a higher goal .
That ’s how I ’ve gotten to where I am . ’
8. Kendall Jenner
‘ Some people might think that what I ’ve done before made it easier for me to get jobs , but it was actually a disadvantage .
I had to work even harder . ’
9. Taylor Swift
‘ My parents raised me to never feel like I was entitled to success , that you have to work for it .
You have to work so hard for it .
And sometimes you do n’t even get to where you need to go . ’
10 . Lauren Conrad

PyPy : the other new compiler project
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .
net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible .
If you appreciate our content , please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible .
We have recently seen a lot of attention paid to projects like LLVM .
Even though the GNU Compiler Collection is developing at a rapid pace , there are people in the community who are interested in seeing different approaches taken , preferably with a newer code base .
LLVM is not where all the action is , though .
For the last few years ( since 2003 , actually ) , a relatively stealthy project called PyPy has been trying to shake up the compiler landscape in its own way .
On the face of it , PyPy looks like an academic experiment : it is an implementation of the Python 2.5 interpreter which is , itself , written in Python .
One might thus expect it to be more elegant in its code than the standard , C - implemented interpreter ( usually called CPython ) , but rather slower in its execution .
If one runs PyPy under CPython , the result is indeed somewhat slow , but that is not how things are meant to be done .
When running in its native mode , PyPy can be surprising .
PyPy is actually written in a subset of Python called RPython ( " restricted Python " ) .
Many of the features and data types of Python are available , but there are rules .
Variables are restricted to data of one type .
Only built - in types can be used in for loops .
There is no creation of classes or functions at run time , and the generator feature is not supported .
And so on .
The result is a version of the language which , while still clearly Python , looks a bit more like C .
Running the RPython - based interpreter in CPython is supported ; it is fully functional , if a bit slow .
Running in this mode can be good for debugging .
But the production version of PyPy is created in a rather different way : the PyPy hackers have created a multi-step compiler which is able to translate an RPython program into a lower - level language .
That language might be C , in which case the result can be compiled and linked in the usual way .
But the target language is not fixed ; the translator is able to output code for the .NET or Java virtual machines as well .
That means that the PyPy interpreter can be easily targeted to whatever runtime environment works best .
The result works .
It currently implements all of the features of Python 2.5 , with very few exceptions .
There are some behavioral differences due to , for example , the use of a different garbage - collection algorithm ; PyPy can be slower to call destructors than CPython is .
Python extensions written in C can be used , though one gets the sense that this feature is still stabilizing .
PyPy is able to run complex applications like Django and Twisted .
On the other hand , for now , it only runs on 32 - bit x86 systems , it is described as " memory - hungry , " and Python 3 support seems to be a relatively distant goal .
Beyond that , it 's fast .
PyPy includes a built - in just - in - time compiler ( JIT ) ; it is , in a sense , a platform for the creation of JITs for various targets .
The result is an interpreter which , much of the time , is significantly faster than CPython .
For the curious , the PyPy Speed Center contains lots of benchmark results , presented in a slick , JavaScript - heavy interface .
PyPy does not always beat CPython , but it often does so convincingly , and speed appears to be a top priority for the PyPy developers .
It may well be that the speed of PyPy may eventually prove compelling enough that , as Alex Gaynor suggests , many of us will be using PyPy routinely instead of CPython in the near future .
There are some other interesting features as well .
There is a stackless Python mode which supports microthreaded , highly - concurrent applications .
There is a sandboxed mode which intercepts all external library calls and hands them over to a separate policy daemon for authorization .
And so on .
What really catches your editor 's eye , though , is the concept of PyPy as a generalized compiler for the creation of JITs for high - level languages .
The translation process is flexible , to the point that it can easily accommodate stackless mode , interesting optimizations , or experimentation with different language features .
The object model can be ( and has been ) tweaked to support tainting and tracing features .
And the system as a whole is not limited to the creation of JIT compilers for Python ; projects are underway to implement a number of other languages , including Prolog , Smalltalk , and JavaScript .
It could easily be argued that PyPy incorporates much of the sort of innovation which many people have said never happens with free software .
And it is all quite well documented .
This is a project which is not afraid of ambitious goals , and which appears to be able to achieve those goals ; it will be interesting to watch over the next few years .

Talk is reporting that the Cowboys and Rams are closing in on a deal that would send nickel linebacker Bobby Carpenter to St. Louis for offensive tackle Alex Barron .
The St. Louis Post - Dispatch is reporting the deal will happen as soon as tomorrow .
The main deterrents to a possible trade are the contracts of both players .
Carpenter is in the final year of his contract and Barron is a restricted free agent .
Assuming the teams are able to overcome the financial issues , the deal appears to be a good one for Dallas .
In our projected 53 - man roster , we had Carpenter being cut .
We feel the Cowboys will be lucky to receive anything for him .
The Rams likely feel the same way about Barron .
In our Inside Linebacker Grades ( run defense stats shown to the left ) , we gave Carpenter a " D+ " .
He is very limited in Coach Phillips ’ 3 - 4 scheme .
The addition of second - rounder Sean Lee and the possible emergence of second - year linebacker Jason Williams means there is very little room for Carpenter on the Cowboys , even as a nickel linebacker .
A more important question might be how well Barron would fit in with Dallas .
The Cowboys ’ coaches seem confident in newly - appointed starting left tackle Doug Free ( who we provided a solid overall grade of " B - " ) .
Barron would likely compete with Free for the starting gig , with the loser becoming a ( very above - average ) swing tackle .
We ca n’t help but wonder , though , whether the Cowboys would have just been better off keeping Flozell Adams .
To determine the answer , we decided to compare the 2009 statistics of Adams and Barron ( shown below ) .
As you can see , the numbers of the two players are quite similar .
So , the Cowboys would have been just as well off to keep Adams , right ?
Well , not necessarily .
Remember that sacks , hits , and pressures are all dependent on not just offensive linemen , but also the mobility of the quarterback .
With Rams quarterback Marc Bulger basically a sitting duck for opposing defenses , it was very difficult for any St. Louis lineman to attain quality numbers last season .
Further , we consider quarterback pressures to be the statistic which is most indicative of a lineman ’s success in pass protection .
Sacks are a bit too fluky and are represented by too small a sample size to be completely statistically significant .
Moreover , they are much more dependent on the mobility of the quarterback than pressures–a stat which is more ripe for comparison between linemen on different squads .
Adams yielded 1.57 times the quarterback pressures of Barron in 2009 .
We feel confident in saying that the number of sacks and hits Barron gave up would have been significantly lower had he played for the Cowboys ( and consequently protected for an athletic , mobile quarterback ) last season .
Of course , pass protection is n’t the only component of linemen duties .
Without a database of statistics similar to the one we have compiled for the Cowboys ’ 2009 plays , it is difficult to determine how effective Barron was in run blocking .
According to Pro Football Focus , Barron was a slightly below - average run blocker in 2009 .
PFF does a fairly decent job in grading game film , so if we take this assessment to be true , how much of an upgrade ( if at all ) is Barron over Adams ?
Well , we provided Adams with a " D+ " in pass protection and a " B " in run blocking , for a " C - " ( 73.4 percent ) overall grade .
We would give Barron a " B - " in pass protection and ( according to PFF ) a " C - " in run blocking .
This would result in a " C+ " overall grade ( 79 percent ) .
Thus , we feel Barron is an upgrade over Adams .
The increase in pass protection ability from Barron to Adams also makes the upgrade even greater than the 5.6 percent grade differential , as the Cowboys could probably benefit more from a quality pass protector ( particularly on Romo ’s blind side ) than another solid run blocker .
The issue fans should be most concerned about regarding Barron ’s play is his penalty count .
Everyone knows how much Adams struggled with penalties throughout his career in Dallas .
Barron had one more penalty than Adams in 2009 .
If Barron can limit this number to single digits , the upgrade in pass protection that would come with his addition would likely mean a Carpenter - for - Barron swap would bring with it very high upside and opportunity for success .
The magic of knowledge exchange “ If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple .
But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas , then each of us will have two ideas ” .
( George Bernard Shaw ) .
The CERN Global Network is a new , ideal place for past and present members of the CERN community to share ideas and create new links .
“ During the first phase , the Network will be open to current and former members of the CERN personnel , that is , staff , fellows , apprentices , associates , students and users ” , explains Claudio Parrinello , Head of the Knowledge and Technology Transfer Group .
The Network will offer members the possibility to keep in touch or get back in touch with colleagues , identify experts across the Network in specific domains , possibly leading to new partnerships , and participate in groups and discussion forums .
“ There are many existing CERN - related networks ( such as experiment collaborations , the Pensioners ’ Association , etc. ) , which contribute to knowledge exchange , and the Global Network is designed to provide a cross - link between them ” , he says .
In the second half of the year , the Network will be opened to research institutes from all over the world , and to companies in the Member States .
“ We will introduce features , such as the posting of job vacancies , which will connect job seekers with potential employers .
In addition , networking among participating institutions will enable the exchange of best practices ” , adds Parrinello .
Members are strongly encouraged to help to shape the Network .
“ They will be able to submit information about projects and events , and propose activities and partnerships ” , says Linda Orr-Easo , Global Network Manager .
In the People section , members will have the opportunity to share their professional experience .
A unique added value of the Network is that its virtual community will be invited to participate in events organised for its members at CERN or in its Member States .
On 29 April , CERN ’s Knowledge and Technology Transfer ( KTT ) Group launched the CERN Global Network , a tool whose aim is to facilitate knowledge exchanges inside and outside CERN .
" Among the greatest ambassadors of knowledge are people who have been trained and educated at CERN and also at other institutes : here is where the Global Network comes into play " , says Rolf Heuer , CERN Director General .
“ During the first phase , the Network will be open to current and former members of the CERN personnel , that is , staff , fellows , apprentices , associates , students and users ” , explains Claudio Parrinello , Head of the Knowledge and Technology Transfer Group .

Posted May 19 , 2010 , at 3:45 p.m. CSTChempolis Ltd. , a finland - based biofuels producer and developer , has opened a biorefinery in Oulu , Finland .
After completing test runs on the production of nonwood and nonfood cellulosic ethanol in April , the company opened its facility with the Prime Minister of Finland , Matti Vanhanen , in attendance .
Addressing the crowd at the opening , Chairman of Chempolis Matti Sundberg said , " We invited you here today to witness the production of biofuel using Chempolis ' formicobio technology . "
" Unlike the technologies of previous generations , [ the formicobio technologies ] enable the production of various end products utilizing the energy generated in the production process , " said Pasi Rousu , chief technical officer for Chempolis .
" As a result , the same amount of raw material generates more revenue .
Furthermore , our process is based on a closed - loop system for water and chemical circulation , which makes it extremely clean .
"
The process used at the Oulu biorefinery turns reed canary grass into four products .
From the cellulose , it produces papermaking fibers and ethanol , from the hemicelluloses it makes biochemicals and from the lignin it makes biodiesel .
According to the company , the process generates 40 percent more revenue and uses 50 percent less enzymes .
The annual biorefinery capacity is roughly 25,000 tons of nonwood , nonfood materials .
The facility is also used as a testing site for other raw materials and offers the company future opportunity with China phasing out old pulp production for environmental reasons , according to Rousu .

Already in the midst of a massive ratings plunge , the last thing CNN needed was to get savaged by Jon Stewart over its strategy to win back viewers .
The New York Times reported this week that the network “ continued what has become a precipitous decline in ratings for its prime - time programs in the first quarter of 2010 , with its main hosts losing almost half their viewers in a year . ”

CNN ’s strategy has been to position itself as a moderate , nonpartisan alternative to their increasingly ideologically - driven adversaries on Fox News and MSNBC .
Yet the network continues to fall further and further behind .
Counseling CNN on how it can “ get in the game , ” Stewart said , “ They can go partisan , like their brethren at MSNBC or Fox — get themselves a Glenn Olber - Beck or a Sean Hanni - Dow .
Or , CNN could exercise some editorial authority and integrity — start breaking apart the entire right - left politico - journalist symbiotic paradigm , lead a new generation of truth - seekers on an anti-talking point jihad . ”
“ Or , or , they could just throw random bloggers into a hot - to - box and see what sticks , ” he added , before playing a series of clips unveiling the harsh rhetoric of RedState.com founder and conservative writer Erick Erickson , whom CNN recently hired as a paid contributor .
“ We could use that guy to make Mary Matalin seem sane and Carville seem human , ” mocked the host of Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , assailing Erickson ’s “ entire resume ” of “ incendiary political rhetoric . ”
The progressive blog Think Progress labeled Erickson “ unhinged ” upon his CNN hire and pointed to a number of “ racial and violent statements ” he has made in the past , such as telling Tea Partiers to “ send Obama to a death panel . ”

“ CNN : We have no idea what the fuck we ’re doing , ” Stewart concluded .

KABUL , Afghanistan — American troops raked a large passenger bus with gunfire near Kandahar on Monday morning , killing and wounding civilians , and igniting angry anti-American demonstrations in a city where winning over Afghan support is pivotal to the war effort .
The shooting , which killed as many as five civilians and wounded 18 , occurred on the eve of the most important offensive of the war .
In coming weeks thousands of American , NATO and Afghan troops are expected to try to take control of the Kandahar region , the spiritual home of the Taliban .
It was the latest case in which NATO or American forces fired on and killed civilians near a checkpoint or military convoy because they were perceived to have come too close or to be approaching too fast .
Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the American and NATO commander in Afghanistan , has made reducing civilian casualties a priority , and they have gone down over the last year .
But checkpoint and convoy shootings have not declined , worrying commanders who believe that such killings are turning Afghans against foreign forces .

Advertisement Iran 's president has unveiled new " third - generation " centrifuges that its nuclear chief says can enrich uranium much faster than current technology .
The centrifuges would have separation power six times that of the first generation , Ali Akbar Salehi said in a speech marking National Nuclear Day .
Uranium enrichment is the central concern of Western nations negotiating with Iran over its nuclear programme .
The new technology could shorten the time it takes to build a nuclear bomb .
Tehran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes .
Friday 's announcement comes as members of the UN Security Council discuss a new round of sanctions against Iran over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
Ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany - the P5+1 - described the talks as worthwhile , but said their meetings would continue in the coming weeks .

China has been under pressure from the US and others to support new sanctions and took part in the meeting despite its public objections .
In a BBC interview , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Mohamed ElBaradei , said Western nations were seeking harsher sanctions " out of frustration " .
" I do n't think Iran is developing , or we have new information that Iran is developing , a nuclear weapon today , " he said .
" There is a concern about Iran 's future intentions , but even if you talk to MI6 or the CIA , they will tell you they are still four or five years away from a weapon .
So , we have time to engage . "
He said it was a " question of building trust between Iran and the US " .
" That will not happen until the two sides sit around the negotiating table and address their grievances .
Sooner or later that will happen . "
' Successful tests '
In his speech to hundreds of dignitaries , Mr Salehi announced that " considerable " uranium reserves had been found in Yazd province .
URANIUM ENRICHMENT
Iran says it is increasing uranium enrichment from 3.5 % needed for commercial nuclear reactors Iran says it has started enriching to 20 % , needed for a medical research reactor near Tehran Weapons - grade uranium is at least 90 % enriched Experts say achieving 20 % is a key step towards weapons grade
What the IAEA report says
In depth : Nuclear fuel cycle Q&A : Iran nuclear issue
The production of 5 % - enriched uranium was continuing using first - generation centrifuges and a second generation of machines unveiled last year were in use , he said .
He then announced that experts at the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran ( AEOI ) had managed to design a third generation .
" The machines have successfully passed mechanical tests and it is expected that they will have a gas - separation power of nearly 10 , which is six times more than the first generation of centrifuges , " he said .
At the end of Mr Salehi 's speech , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stepped onto the stage and pulled back a curtain to reveal one of the new centrifuges .
" Today , Iranian scientists have command over all nuclear energy fields .
This does not mean that we are at the peak .
But in terms of technical know - how and knowledge , there is no hurdle in their way , " he said .
The centrifuges spin uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) gas at high speeds to separate the fissile U - 235 atoms from the denser U - 238 atoms .
The new models are more advanced than the P1 centrifuge - adapted from a 1970s design , reportedly acquired by Iran on the black market in the 1980s , and prone to breakdowns - in use at the Natanz enrichment facility , in the central province of Isfahan .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , who is in London , says nuclear experts point out that the key question is how many of the third - generation centrifuges Iran can produce .
The IAEA says Iran has 3,772 operating centrifuges , mostly at Natanz
There have already been technical problems with the existing models , so whether it can quickly put the new one into mass production and operation remains to be seen , our correspondent says .
Most of Iran 's uranium is enriched to a level of 3.5 % , but it requires 20 % enriched uranium for its Tehran research reactor , which produces medical isotopes .
A bomb would require uranium enriched to at least 90 % .
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said in a report in February that Iran had achieved enrichment levels of up to 19.8 % , which added to its concerns about the " possible military dimensions " of its nuclear programme .
Experts say the technical leap required to get to 90 % enrichment from 20 % is relatively straightforward , because it becomes easier at higher levels .
Going from the natural state of 0.7 % enrichment to 20 % takes 90 % of the total energy required , they add .
The IAEA report said 8,610 centrifuges had been installed in known enrichment facilities in Iran , of which 3,772 were operating .
Iran says it will eventually install more than 50,000 centrifuges at Natanz , and build 10 more enrichment facilities at protected sites .

Sportscar newcomer Andreas Zuber claimed pole position for the opening round of the new FIA GT1 World Championship in Abu Dhabi after qualifying was abandoned as a result of a serious accident .
The Phoenix / Carsport Chevrolet driver 's time of 2m06.780s around the Yas Marina circuit will stand as pole because it will take up to three hours to repair the barriers at the end of the long back straight , where Natacha Gachnang crashed her Matech Ford GT just over 17 minutes into the opening round of qualifying .
GP2 graduate Zuber , whose team - mate Marc Hennerici will start tomorrow afternoon 's qualifying race from pole , said : " I have to say it was a clear lap .
I did n't push so much , but maybe when you push in these cars , you go slower .
They are a bit different to a formula car [ single - seater ] . "
Austrian Zuber will not get to start the main race from pole even if and his German team - mate win the one - hour qualifying event .
All four Chevrolet Corvette C6.
Rs will be given a 10 - place grid penalty for the championship event because the cars are not in compliance with the sporting regulations concerning the position of the ballast required to bring them up to the new minimum weight of 1200kg .
Hexis Aston Martin driver Frederic Makowiecki was second fastest with a time nearly a second slower than than Zuber .
The Frenchman 's 2m07.705 lap was less a tenth ahead of Enrique Bernoldi in the best of the four Maserati MC12s on the entry list .
Gachnang was helicoptered to hospital after treatment at the circuit medical centre .
The details of her condition released so far are that she was conscious when she was removed from the car and has a suspected broken leg .

Will the IRS need 16,000 new agents to enforce health - care reform ?
" One of the things in the health bill is 16,000 additional IRS agents , " said Newt Gingrich , echoing the latest GOP talking point .
Rep. Paul Ryan joined him , saying the IRS will get " 16,000 agents to police this new mandate . "
But is it true ?
Well , no .
FactCheck.org gives you the rundown here , but just for kicks , let 's track how an estimate becomes spin becomes a lie becomes a sound bite .
First , the estimate :
The CBO predicted that costs related to the Affordable Care Act would " probably include an estimated $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion over 10 years for administrative costs of the Internal Revenue Service . "
This money , incidentally , is n't to audit people or go door - to - door enforcing the individual mandate .
It 's primarily to give subsidies to qualifying small businesses and individuals .
But put that aside for the moment .
On March 18 , the Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee put out a news release saying the " IRS may need to hire as many as 16,500 additional auditors , agents and other employees . "
As you might expect , " may " does some heavy lifting here .
First , Republicans are using $ 10 billion , not $ 5 billion , as the number beneath their estimate .
Second , as FactCheck.org says , the GOP " simply divided the spending ( which they figured could be $ 1.5 billion per year once the law is fully effective ) by the current average payroll cost for the entire IRS workforce . "
In other words :
No money for desks , office equipment , rent or anything else .
Every possible dollar is hiring " IRS agents . "
And it does n't account for annual raises .
Oh , and before I forget , " agents " is also there to mislead .
As FactCheck.org notes , " there ’s a huge difference between an IRS revenue agent — who calls on taxpayers and conducts face - to - face audits — and the workers who make up the bulk of IRS employees .
Those who work at the IRS include clerks , accountants , computer programmers , telephone help line workers and other support staff .
In fact , IRS revenue agents make up only 15 percent of the IRS workforce . "
So let 's go back to Gingrich 's original sentence .
" One of the things in the health bill is 16,000 additional IRS agents , " he said .
First , that 's not a " thing in the health bill . "
It 's an extrapolation from a CBO report .
Second , the word " is " is wrong , as even the original GOP spin only used the word " may . "
Third , the number 16,000 is wrong .
Fourth , the word " agents " is wrong .
But if the statement gets no credit for truth , it 's at least efficient :
Not just anyone could pack four falsehoods into 13 words .
But Gingrich , now , he 's a professional .

On March 8 , Michael Mann ’s lawyers , Cozen O’Connor , sent a legal letter to Minnesotans for Global Warming ( of the famous Hide the Decline video ) threatening them , ironically , with misappropriating Mann ’s likeness and , almost as an afterthought , defaming him “ by leaving viewers with the incorrect impression that he falsified data to generate desired results in connection with his research activities ” :
We are writing to demand that you cease and desist any and all use of Dr Mann ’s likeness , which you have misappropriated in various videos posted on your webpage http://www.minnesotansforglobalwarming.com, including the video Hide the Decline – Climategate .
You are hereby advised that the use of Dr Mann ’s likeness , which you clearly misappropriated from PSU ’s webpage , http://www.meteo,psu.edu/~mann/MRG/index.html , is not authorized and infringes on various copyrights .
Such use also improperly misappropriates Professor Mann ’s likeness for commercial exploitation , given that the video clearly supports Minnesotans for Global Warming ’s efforts to sell various products and merchandize .
Finally , the referenced video clearly defames Professor Mann by leaving viewers with the incorrect impression that he falsified data to generate desired results in connection with his research activities .
This false impression irreparably harms Dr Mann ’s personal and professional reputation .
For these reasons , we demand that you immediately cease and desist using Dr Mann ’s likeness and that you immediately remove the defamatory video from your webpage ( including cashed [ sic ] versions . )
If you persist with this defamatory activity , please be advised that we will be compelled to enforce Dr Mann ’s rights , which may include the recovery of damages from you .
Please contact me to confirm your intentions or if you wish to discuss this matter further .
The letter was copied to Mann and to Tom Cogill , Photographer .
The original video has been removed from Youtube .
However , the story does n’t quite end .
Earlier today , the following announcement was made :
the No Cap - and - Trade Coalition , a group that includes M4GW , responded today at an event at the National Press Club , releasing Mann ’s threatening letter and an updated version of the “ Hide the Decline ” video .
See a release of Hide the Decline II , available here .
The new version carefully avoids any use of the “ copyrighted ” Mann photographs .
It is also more precise in its presentation , evidencing a much clearer understanding of the trick than the wilfully obtuse Oxburgh “ Report ” or Willis Parliament Committee Report .
A blog report here states :
Minnesotans 4 Global Warming hope Mann will proceed with his lawsuit so that the legal discovery process will force exposure of data and methods Mann has still not released and that the official whitewash inquiries refuse to investigate .
Jeff Davis of the coalition stated :
“ I hope Dr. Mann does sue us , ” Said Davis , “ The legal discovery process would give us an opportunity to expose Dr. Mann ’s research – or lack thereof to public and legal scrutiny . ”

Researchers at the University of Toronto have discovered a fundamentally new view of how living cells use a limited number of genes to generate enormously complex organs such as the brain .
In a paper published on May 6 in the journal Nature entitled " Deciphering the Splicing Code , " a research team led by Professors Brendan Frey and Benjamin Blencowe of the University of Toronto describes how a hidden code within DNA explains one of the central mysteries of genetic research -- namely how a limited number of human genes can produce a vastly greater number of genetic messages .
The discovery bridges a decade - old gap between our understanding of the genome and the activity of complex processes within cells , and could one day help predict or prevent diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders .
When the human genome was fully sequenced in 2004 , approximately 20,000 genes were found .
However , it was discovered that living cells use those genes to generate a much richer and more dynamic source of instructions , consisting of hundreds of thousands of genetic messages that direct most cellular activities .
Frey , who has appointments in Engineering and Medicine , likens this discovery to " hearing a full orchestra playing behind a locked door , and then when you pry the door open , you discover only three or four musicians generating all that music . "
To figure out how living cells generate vast diversity in their genetic information , Frey and postdoctoral fellow Yoseph Barash developed a new computer - assisted biological analysis method that finds ' codewords ' hidden within the genome that constitute what is referred to as a ' splicing code ' .
This code contains the biological rules that are used to govern how separate parts of a genetic message copied from a gene can be spliced together in different ways to produce different genetic messages ( messenger RNAs ) .
" For example , three neurexin genes can generate over 3,000 genetic messages that help control the wiring of the brain , " says Frey .
" Previously , researchers could n't predict how the genetic messages would be rearranged , or spliced , within a living cell , " Frey said .
" The splicing code that we discovered has been successfully used to predict how thousands of genetic messages are rearranged differently in many different tissues . "
Blencowe 's group , including graduate student John Calarco , generated experimental data used to derive and test predictions from the code .
" That the splicing code can make accurate predictions on such a large scale is a major step forward for the field , " says Blencowe .
Frey and Blencowe attribute the success of their project to the close collaboration between their team of talented computational and experimental biologists .
" Understanding a complex biological system is like understanding a complex electronic circuit .
Our team ' reverse - engineered ' the splicing code using large - scale experimental data generated by the group , " Frey said .
Prof .
Frey has appointments to the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and the U of T's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , the Banting & Best Department of Medical Research ( BBDMR ) and the Department of Computer Science .
Prof.
Blencowe works in the University 's Donnelly Centre for Cellular & Biomolecular Research and has appointments in the BBDMR and Department of Molecular Genetics
The research was supported by the Government of Canada through Genome Canada and the Ontario Genomics Institute , the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , National Cancer Institute of Canada , and Microsoft Research .
Frey is an NSERC EWR Steacie Fellow and said that the fellowship was critical in freeing up resources so he could complete the project .

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has accused Israel of kidnapping Irish citizens in international waters .
Micheál Martin is furious after Israel announced it would deport all foreign nationals seized from a convoy of ships carrying aid to Gaza .
Israel launched an attack on the flotilla overnight , killing at least 10 people and wounding dozens more .
Seven Irish passport holders have been taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod from where it is planned to deport them .
One has already signed papers agreeing to the move .
But Minister Martin said he has told the Israeli Ambassador Dr Zion Evrony that the Government wants these Irish citizens released immediately .
" The Israeli government requires people to sign papers so that they can be deported , " Minister Martin said .
" But of course these people did not enter Israel illegally .
" They were essentially kidnapped from international waters , taken into Israel ..
And now they are being asked to sign a document almost confirming that they entered illegally .
" And we think that is unacceptable .
" I have said this to the Ambassador - it makes no sense .
These people should be released unconditionally . "
The Israeli Ambassador defended his country 's actions .
Dr Evrony said he is neither ashamed nor embarrassed by what happened , but he stated that he would convey the views of the Irish Government to his country 's government .
He made the remarks after meeting Minister Martin at Iveagh house this evening .
Dr Evrony said he did not belive relations between Ireland and Israel had been damaged .
United Nations ( CNN ) --
The final document from the just - completed U.N. review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty " not only fails to advance regional security but actually sets it back , " the Israeli government said in a statement released Saturday .
The month - long conference , which ended Friday , called for a 2012 conference of all Middle Eastern states to move forward on a 1995 proposal for a nuclear - free Mideast .
The document also calls on Israel to sign the treaty and place " all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) safeguards . "
Israel is not a member of the NPT and has neither confirmed nor denied that it has a nuclear weapons stockpile .
The Israeli government statement calls the conference 's document " deeply flawed and hypocritical " and " ignores the realities of the Middle East and the real threats facing the region and the entire world . "
The statement also complains that Israel is singled out in the document and Iran , which is a signatory to the NPT , is not mentioned .
" The real problem with Weapons Of Mass Destruction in the Middle East does not relate to Israel but to those countries that have signed the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and brazenly violated it -- Iraq under Sadaam , Libya , Syria and Iran , " the statement said .
" That is why the resolution adopted by the NPT Review Conference not only fails to advance regional security but actually sets it back . "
The United States signed onto the final document Friday , but National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones later laid out " serious reservations . "
Jones said the United States supports the idea of a nuclear - free Mideast but believes it must wait for " a comprehensive and durable peace in the region and full compliance by all regional states with their arms control and nonproliferation obligations . "
Jones said the United States and the United Kingdom had agreed to co-sponsor the 2012 conference to ensure that it takes into consideration the issues of all countries in the region and that the consent of all countries in the region is achieved for any action .
" The United States will not permit a conference or actions that could jeopardize Israel 's national security .
We will not accept any approach that singles out Israel or sets unrealistic expectations , " said Jones , adding that the United States " deplores the decision to single out Israel " and " the failure of the resolution to mention Iran . "
In its statement , Israel noted " the important clarifications that have been made by the United States regarding its policy , " but said " the distorted nature of the resolution " would prevent it from participating .
" As a non-signatory state of the NPT , Israel is not obligated by the decisions of this Conference , which has no authority over Israel , " the statement said .
The statement added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would discuss the issue with President Barack Obama during his visit to Washington next week .
A CAR filled with drums of petrol was driven into the CFMEU 's NSW head office before being set alight .
The union believes its office was the target of last night 's firebomb attack on a western Sydney office block .
Construction , Forestry , Mining and Energy Union ( CFMEU ) state secretary Andrew Ferguson said a car filled with drums of petrol crashed into the union 's Lidcombe office before being set alight .
The ground floor of the Railway St premises was extensively damaged in the fire , while upper levels suffered smoke damage .
No one is believed to have been injured in the blaze although it is understood a church community group had been using the building an hour before the attack .
" This was a very determined attack on our building that caused extreme damage , " Mr Ferguson said .
" Our primary concern is for our staff and the community groups who use our offices .
" We are very lucky people were n't killed here . "
Mr Ferguson believed the incident may have been linked to a dispute between the union and a contractor .
Police are continuing to investigate the incident , which occurred about 10.30 pm ( AEST ) last night .

Call them oil droplets with a brain or even " chemo- rats . "
Scientists in Illinois have developed a way to make simple oil droplets " smart " enough to navigate through a complex maze almost like a trained lab rat .
The finding could have a wide range of practical implications , including helping cancer drugs to reach their target and controlling the movement of futuristic nano - machines , the scientists say .
Their study is in the weekly Journal of the American Chemical Society .
Bartosz Grzybowski and colleagues note that the ability to solve a maze is a common scientific test of intelligence .
Animals ranging from rats to humans can master the task .
Scientists would like to pass along that same ability to anti-cancer drugs , for instance , to help these medications navigate complex mazes of blood vessels and reach the tumor .
The scientists describe an advance in that direction .
They developed postage - stamp - sized mazes , and infused them with an alkaline solution , and placed a gel containing a strong acid at the exit .
That created a pH gradient , a difference between the acid - alkaline levels .
Oil droplets containing a weak acid placed at the entrance of the mazes developed convective flows in response to pH differences and propelled themselves along the gradient toward the exit .
Since cancer cells are more acidic than other body cells , the experiment may serve as a model for designing new anti-cancer drugs that move along similar acid - based gradients to target diseased cells , the scientists suggest .

But she was off in Australia , with the reversible flushing toilets , for much of that time , and did n’t have an opportunity to “ defend ” herself .
On Larry King ’s show , after coming out this month , she did just that — against folks like Pastor Bob Botsford , of the Horizon Christian Television , who has no good answer why The Sin Of Homosexuality is any worse than the sins Botsford has himself undoubtedly committed .

President Lech Kaczynski and scores of other senior Polish figures have been killed in a plane crash in Russia .
Polish and Russian officials said no - one survived after the plane apparently hit trees as it approached Smolensk airport in thick fog .
Russian media reports said the pilots ignored advice from air traffic control to divert to another airport .
Poland 's army chief , central bank governor , MPs and leading historians were among more than 80 passengers .
Prime Minister Donald
Tusk said the crash was the most tragic event of the country 's post - World War II history .
The Polish delegation was flying in from Warsaw to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre of thousands of Poles by Soviet forces during WWII .
Obituary : Lech Kaczynski
In pictures : Plane crash Your reaction The BBC's Adam Easton , in Warsaw , says the crash is a catastrophe for the Polish people .
He says Prime Minister Tusk was reportedly in tears when he was told .
After an emergency meeting of ministers , Mr Tusk , who runs the day - to - day business of government , said a week of national mourning had been declared with two minutes of silence on Sunday at midday .
Mr Tusk added : " The Polish state must function and will function " .
Thousands have gathered outside the presidential palace in Warsaw A government spokesman said that according to the constitution there would be an early presidential election , and the speaker of the lower house of parliament , Bronislaw Komorowski , would be acting president .
In Warsaw , people gathered outside the presidential palace to lay flowers and light candles .
" I 'm all broken up ... it cannot be expressed in words , " Ewa Robaczewska told Reuters news agency .
Pilot error ?
The Russian emergencies ministry told Itar - Tass news agency the plane crashed at 1056 Moscow time ( 0656 GMT ) as it was coming in to land .
Smolensk regional governor Sergei Antufiev told Russian TV that no -one had survived .
Adam Easton , BBC News , Warsaw Thousands of people have gathered outside the presidential palace to pay their respects .
There has been a spontaneous outpouring of grief , no matter what people thought of Lech Kaczynski .
He was a divisive figure in Polish society , especially among younger Poles .
People are just stunned , visibly moved and in tears , whether they agreed with the president 's political views or not .
The largest church bell in Poland , at Krakow Cathedral , has been rung .
It never tolls generally , only for very , very solemn occasions .
The last time it did so was for the death of the Polish pope , John Paul II , five years ago .
" According to preliminary reports , it got caught up in the tops of trees , fell to the ground and broke up into pieces , " he said .
" There are no survivors in that crash . "
Polish TV worker Slawomir Wisniewski said he had seen the crash from his hotel near the airport .
" I saw through the fog , the aeroplane flying very low with the left wing pointing to the ground , " he said .
" I heard something being broken and then that thudding sound .
Two flashes of fire next to each other . "
Russian media carried claims that the plane 's crew were at fault for the crash .
" Flight controllers ... suggested that the plane be forwarded to Minsk but as far as we know the crew took an independent decision to land the plane in Smolensk , " Smolensk regional government spokesman Andrei Yevseyenkov told Russian TV .
Russian officials said 97 people were killed in the crash , including eight crew .
Polish officials said that 89 people had been scheduled to fly in the delegation to the Katyn commemoration , but one person missed the flight .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited the crash site , after saying he would personally oversee the investigation into the crash .
" Everything must be done to establish the reasons for this tragedy in the shortest possible time , " he said .
He was to meet his Polish counterpart , Mr Tusk , in Smolensk .
Russian officials said all the bodies had been recovered from the scene and were being taken to Moscow for identification .
Russia 's Emergency Minister Sergei Shoigu said both of the plane 's flight information recorders had been found and were being examined .
Controversial figure
The president was flying in a Tupolev 154 , a Soviet - designed plane that was more than 20 years old .
SENIOR FIGURES KILLED National leader :
President Lech Kaczynski and wife Maria Other politicians :
Wladyslaw Stasiak chief of the president 's chancellery ; Aleksander Szczyglo chief of the National Security Office ; Slawomir Skrzypek National Bank of Poland chairman ;

Senior Polish figures killed in crash World reaction to crash Focus on ageing plane
Our correspondent says there had been calls for Polish leaders to upgrade their planes .
Mr Kaczynski himself had suffered scares while using the plane in late 2008 , when problems with the aircraft 's steering mechanism delayed his departure from Mongolia .
" Any flight brings with it a certain risk , but a very serious risk attaches to the responsibilities of a president , because it is necessary to fly constantly , " he was quoted as saying at the time .
But the head of Russia 's Aviakor aviation maintenance company told Russian TV the plane was airworthy , after his plant fully overhauled it in December .
As well as the president and his wife , Maria , a number of senior officials were on the passenger list .
They included the army chief of staff Gen Franciszek Gagor , central bank governor Slawomir Skrzypek and deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer .
World leaders including Mr Putin , US President Barack Obama , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown offered their condolences to Poland .
Mr Kaczynski's twin brother , Jaroslaw , a former prime minister and now head of the main opposition party , was said to be " devastated " , an aide told AFP news agency .
Lech Kaczynski , who had fewer powers than the prime minister but had a significant say in foreign policy , was a controversial figure in Polish politics .
He had advocated a right - wing Catholic agenda , opposed rapid free - market reforms and favoured retaining social welfare programmes .

' I'm the worst in my acting class ' admits Hollywood 's highest paid actress Emma Watson
She 's Hollywood 's highest paid actress and the star of one of the biggest film franchises of all time .
But Emma Watson has revealed she enrolled in acting classes at her American college .
And in a candid confession , the 20 - year - old said : ' I think actually I 'm the worst in the class . '
Watson , who plays Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films , chose acting class during her first year at the exclusive Brown University in Rhode Island .
[ caption ]
She admitted that she was terrified of going back to school following the phenomenal success of the six Harry Potter films that catapulted her to stardom .
Watson was nine years old when she beat out thousands of other hopefuls to land the role of Hermione alongside Daniel Radcliffe as the boy wizard Harry Potter .
With an estimated fortune of £ 10.5 million , Watson was named last year by Vanity Fair magazine as Hollywood 's highest paid actress taking home £ 20 million .
She earned more than established stars such as Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston thanks to her income from the latest two Potter films , The Deathly Hallows Parts I and II , which will come out in November this year and 2011 .
[ caption ]
Watson stunned many in the film business by turning down other acting roles to go back to school last year having achieved straight As in her A - levels .
She confessed that she had second thoughts about college life after arriving in the US .
' It was just awful , ' she told this month 's Vanity Fair magazine .
' I was like , I must be mad .
Why am I doing this ?'
[ caption ]
Watson said she quickly settled into college life and was helped after meeting Spaniard Rafael Cebrian , an aspiring rock star , who has become her boyfriend .
She studied European history and took acting classes during her first year .
The actress told the magazine , which features her in a photo spread by celebrated photographer Patrick Demarchelier , that having settled into college life she has never been happier .
She said she was worried her fame - she is also the face of fashion chain Burberry and has a £ 3 million deal with Chanel - would prevent her from having a normal life like other students at the £ 25,000 a year college .
' I was scared before I came to Brown - that I was n't going to be allowed to have both a career and a normal life , ' she said .
' People would think that I did n't deserve to have both .
I was afraid they'd think " You 're famous .
You 're given free handbags .
Why should you deserve to be normal ? " '
Watson told the magazine she was able to settle at college after being placed with a room - mate who had no interest in Harry Potter .
She said she was born to play Potter 's feisty sidekick at Hogwarts School .
' If I 'm honest , I was her , ' she said .
' I was very keen .
I was super - eager to please and be good .
And I was always kind of bossy . '
• The full interview is in the June issue of Vanity Fair , on sale now .
“ We came to the conclusion that the NATO patrol was responsible for the killing of the two men and the three women , and that there was evidence of tampering in the corridor inside the compound by the members ” of the assault team , Mr. Yarmand said .
“ There was a mess at the scene . ”
He said he was pleased that the senior American and NATO commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , had accepted findings that all five Afghans were civilians killed during the raid .
An official at the American - led NATO military command in Kabul said the tampering allegations had prompted the military to investigate .
“ We have found no evidence to support tampering , ” the official said .
But , the official added , based on the allegations from the Afghan Interior Ministry , “ We are further investigating to determine if there is any foundation to these claims . ”
Yet to be determined is whether Special Operations forces dug bullets out of the victims ’ bodies in an effort to hide what had happened , as described by family members who survived the raid .
Mohammed Tahir , whose 18 - year - old daughter was killed , said he had watched from the compound through an open door as an American knelt over one corpse with a knife and tried to extract bullets .
“ I saw them working on the bodies , ” Mr. Tahir said .
“ I saw a knife in one of the American ’s hands . ”
Another family member , Abdul Ghafar , said the bullet entry wounds on the bodies had been widened or scraped out in an effort to remove bullets .
“ The holes were bigger than they were supposed to be , ” he said .
The NATO military official said : “ We strongly deny having dug any bullets out of bodies .
There simply is no evidence . ”
In the interview , Mr. Yarmand said he did not know whether bullets had been dug out of the bodies .
He said he would not dispute family members ’ claims , but added , “ We can not confirm it as we had not been able to autopsy the bodies . ”
Yesterday at DrupalCon , representatives of WhiteHouse.gov announced they are making modules of Drupal code they have developed and customized open source , i.e. are giving them away free of charge .
Drupal itself is an open source project and one of the most popular website building tools around .
This CMS powers a sizable chunk of the Internet , from Warner Records artists to World Bank 's data site .
The code WhiteHouse.gov is releasing into the wild deals with three main aspects : scalability , communication and accessibility .
This move is part of the general move toward openness we 've seen in a slew of recent government initiatives online , such as Data.gov .
The opening of WhiteHouse . gov 's platform means that more developers will get to use , review and modify WH code for their own applications , while quite possibly expanding and improving the modules ' capabilities along the way .
Here are some details on what the WH modules can do :
Context HTTP Headers Lets developers add metadata to content .
" We use this to tell our servers how to handle specific pages , such as cache this type of page for 15 minutes or that type for 30 , " wrote WH developer Dave Cole .
" A second module that addresses scalability is called ' Akamai , ' and it allows our website to integrate with our Content Delivery Network , Akamai . "
GovDelivery
For active email programs used for large - scale public communication .
Allows organizations to send " more dynamic emails tailored to users ' preferences . "
Node Embed Manages multimedia content and ensures that all images have the proper metadata to make them machine - readable for those who use screen - reading software .
Cole wrote , " We take very seriously our obligation to make sure WhiteHouse.gov is as accessible as possible and are committed to meeting the government accessibility standard , Section 508 . "
Hat tip to Mark Krynsky for buttonholing us after DrupalCon to share this news .
May 19 , 2010  -- BP has turned to " Waterworld " star Kevin Costner to help clean up the oil slick that is spreading across the Gulf of Mexico .
Costner has been funding a team of scientists for 15 years in hopes of developing a technology to clean up massive oil spills , and his research has created a powerful centrifuge that he claims can separate oil from water and dump the oil into a holding tank .
Costner and representatives of Ocean Therapy Solutions , the firm that developed the machine , demonstrated the centrifugal device for BP officials in New Orleans last week .
" I believe they 'll want to do the right thing , " Costner told reporters at the time .
" We 've agreed to test it , " BP spokesman Mark Proegler told ABCNews.com today .
Officials with Ocean Therapy Solutions have said one of their machines is capable of cleaning up to 210,000 gallons of water per day .
The oil extractor leaves the water 99 percent clean of crude , the firm said in a statement .
" The machines are basically sophisticated centrifuge devices that can handle a huge volume of water and separate at unprecedented rates , " said Ocean Therapy Solutions CEO John Houghtaling .
" They were developed from older centrifuge technology .
Normal centrifuge machines are very slow and sensitive to different ratios of oil to water mixtures at intake . "
The devices , which can be taken to the spill site via barges , come in different sizes .
The largest can clean water at a rate of 200 gallons per minute -- more than 50 gallons faster than the well is leaking , according to the firm .
Depending on the water to oil ratio , the devices are capable of extracting 2,000 barrels of oil per day from the gulf .
BP is employing six of the machines in its tests .
The " Field of Dreams "s star figured if he built it , they would come .
Costner could not be reached for comment today , but last week he told reporters , " Years before I got involved , oil spills came and I would wonder why we could n't clean this up . "
The research team Costner has financed since then has been headed by his brother .
BP has been struggling to stop a torrent of oil pouring into the gulf since an underwater explosion sank the Deepwater Horizon drill ship last month , killing 11 rig workers and creating a massive environmental catastrophe .
Costner 's " Waterworld " Machine to BP's Rescue
Repeated efforts to staunch the flow of oil have failed , although earlier this week BP succeeded in inserting a tube into the shattered drill well , siphoning 84,000 gallons of oil a day to a ship .
Still , oil is seeping from the disaster site and could contaminate the Florida Keys , the Cuban coast and be carried by currents along the East Coast , according to experts .
Some 46,000 square miles in the gulf are now off limits to fishermen .
The spill has not reach beaches and delicate wetlands so far because of favorable winds and tides .
In addition , booms have been used to corral the oil but the spill has breached the booms in some areas .
More than 100 lawsuits have been filed in relation to the oil spill .
Two volcanos have erupted in Ecuador ( pictured ) and Guatemala , forcing thousands of people in the surrounding areas to flee their homes .
In Ecuador , ash and molten rocks from the Tungurahua volcano have forced the closure of a main airport and local schools in the area , 95 miles ( 150 km ) south - east of the capital , Quito .
Strong winds have blown the huge plumes of ash over Guayaquil , choking the country 's most populous city .
In Guatemala , between 1,700 and 1,900 people have had to leave their homes and take refuge in temporary shelters .
Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said at least 100 homes had been destroyed and 800 damaged by the eruptions from Pacaya , one of Central America 's most active volcanos .
Guatemala City was covered in a blanket of ash and dust as people fled the danger zone 50 km ( 31 miles ) south of the capital .
This is just amazing .
In 20 lines of node .js code and 10 minutes of time I was able to write a HTTP proxy .
Take a look :
var http = require ( ' http ' ) ; http.createServer(function(request , response ) { var proxy = http.createClient( 80 , request.headers [ ' host ' ] ) var proxy_request = proxy.request( request.method , request.url , request.headers ) ; proxy_request.addListener(' response ' , function ( proxy_response ) { proxy_response.addListener( ' data ' , function ( chunk ) { response.
write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; proxy_response.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { response.end ( ) ; } ) ; response.writeHead(proxy_response.statusCode , proxy_response.headers ) ; } ) ; request.addListener(' data ' , function ( chunk ) { proxy_request.write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; request.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { proxy_request.end ( ) ; } ) ; }).listen ( 8080 ) ;
And it scales well , too .
It 's not a blocking HTTP proxy , it 's event driven and asynchronous , meaning hundreds of people can use simultaneously and it will work well .
To get the proxy running all you have to do is download node.js , compile it , and run the proxy program via the node program :
$ ./configure -- prefix=/home/pkrumins/installs/nodejs-0.1.92
$ make $ make install $ PATH=$ PATH:/home/pkrumins/installs/nodejs-0.1.92/bin $ node proxy.js
And from here you can take this proxy wherever your imagination takes .
For example , you can start by adding logging :
var http = require ( ' http ' ) ; var sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; http.createServer(function(request , response ) { sys.log(request.connection.remoteAddress + " : " + request.method + " " + request.url ) ; var proxy = http.createClient( 80 , request.headers [ ' host ' ] ) var proxy_request = proxy.request( request.method , request.url , request.headers ) ; proxy_request.addListener(' response ' , function ( proxy_response ) { proxy_response.addListener( ' data ' , function ( chunk ) { response.
write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; proxy_response.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { response.end ( ) ; } ) ; response.writeHead(proxy_response.statusCode , proxy_response.headers ) ; } ) ; request.addListener(' data ' , function ( chunk ) { proxy_request.write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; request.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { proxy_request.end ( ) ; } ) ; }).listen ( 8080 ) ;
Next , you can add a regex - based host blacklist in 15 additional lines :
var http = require ( ' http ' ) ; var sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; var fs = require ( ' fs ' ) ; var blacklist = [ ] ; fs.watchFile ( './ blacklist ' , function ( c , p ) { update_blacklist ( ) ; } ) ; function update_blacklist ( ) { sys.log ( " Updating blacklist . " ) ; blacklist = fs.readFileSync('./blacklist ').split ( '
') .filter ( function ( rx ) { return rx.length } ) .map( function ( rx ) { return RegExp ( rx ) } ) ; } http.createServer(function( request , response ) { for ( i in blacklist ) { if ( blacklist [i].test ( request.url ) ) { sys.log ( " Denied : " + request.method + " " + request.url ) ; response.end ( ) ; return ; } } sys.log(request.connection.remoteAddress + " : " + request.method + " " + request.url ) ; var proxy = http.createClient( 80 , request.headers [ ' host ' ] ) var proxy_request = proxy.request( request.method , request.url , request.headers ) ; proxy_request.addListener(' response ' , function ( proxy_response ) { proxy_response.addListener( ' data ' , function ( chunk ) { response.
write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; proxy_response.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { response.end ( ) ; } ) ; response.writeHead(proxy_response.statusCode , proxy_response.headers ) ; } ) ; request.addListener(' data ' , function ( chunk ) { proxy_request.write ( chunk , ' binary ) ; } ) ; request.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { proxy_request.end ( ) ; } ) ; }).listen ( 8080 ) ; update_blacklist ( ) ;
Now to block proxy users from using Facebook , just echo facebook.com to blacklist file :
$ echo ' facebook.com ' >> blacklist
The proxy server will automatically notice the changes to the file and update the blacklist .
Surely , a proxy server without IP control is no proxy server , so let 's add that as well :
var http = require ( ' http ' ) ; var sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; var fs = require ( ' fs ' ) ; var blacklist = [ ] ; var iplist = [ ] ; fs.watchFile ( './ blacklist ' , function ( c , p ) { update_blacklist ( ) ; } ) ; fs.watch File ( './ iplist ' , function ( c , p ) { update_iplist ( ) ; } ) ; function update_blacklist ( ) { sys.log ( " Updating blacklist . " ) ; blacklist = fs.readFileSync('./blacklist ').split ( '
') .filter ( function ( rx ) { return rx.length } ) .map( function ( rx ) { return RegExp ( rx ) } ) ; } function update_iplist ( ) { sys.log ( " Updating iplist . " ) ; iplist = fs.readFileSync('./iplist ').split ('
') .filter ( function ( ip ) { return ip.length } ) ; } http.createServer(function( request , response ) { var allowed_ip = false ; for ( i in iplist ) { if ( iplist [ i ] == request.connection.remoteAddress ) { allowed_ip = true ; break ; } } if ( !allowed_ip ) { sys.log ( " IP " + request.connection.remoteAddress + " is not allowed " ) ; response.end ( ) ; return ; } for ( i in blacklist ) { if ( blacklist [i].test ( request.url ) ) { sys.log ( " Denied : " + request.method + " " + request.url ) ; response.end ( ) ; return ; } } sys.log(request.connection.remoteAddress + " : " + request.method + " " + request.url ) ; var proxy = http.createClient( 80 , request.headers [ ' host ' ] ) var proxy_request = proxy.request( request.method , request.url , request.headers ) ; proxy_request.addListener(' response ' , function ( proxy_response ) { proxy_response.addListener( ' data ' , function ( chunk ) { response.
write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; proxy_response.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { response.end ( ) ; } ) ; response.writeHead(proxy_response.statusCode , proxy_response.headers ) ; } ) ; request.addListener(' data ' , function ( chunk ) { proxy_request.write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; request.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { proxy_request.end ( ) ; } ) ; }).listen ( 8080 ) ; update_blacklist ( ) ; update_iplist ( ) ;
By default the proxy server will not allow any connections , so add all the IPs you want the proxy to be accessible from to iplist file :
$ echo ' 1.2.3.4 ' >> iplist
Finally , let 's refactor the code a little :
var http = require ( ' http ' ) ; var sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; var fs = require ( ' fs ' ) ; var blacklist = [ ] ; var iplist = [ ] ; fs.watchFile ( './ blacklist ' , function ( c , p ) { update_blacklist ( ) ; } ) ; fs.watch File ( './ iplist ' , function ( c , p ) { update_iplist ( ) ; } ) ; function update_blacklist ( ) { sys.log ( " Updating blacklist . " ) ; blacklist = fs.readFileSync('./blacklist ').split ( '
') .filter ( function ( rx ) { return rx.length } ) .map( function ( rx ) { return RegExp ( rx ) } ) ; } function update_iplist ( ) { sys.log ( " Updating iplist . " ) ; iplist = fs.readFileSync('./iplist ').split ('
') .filter ( function ( rx ) { return rx.length } ) ; } function ip_allowed ( ip ) { for ( i in iplist ) { if ( iplist [ i ] == ip ) { return true ; } } return false ; } function host_allowed ( host ) { for ( i in blacklist ) { if ( blacklist [ i ]. test ( host ) ) { return false ; } } return true ; } function deny ( response , msg ) { response.writeHead( 401 ) ; response.write(msg ) ; response.end ( ) ; } http.createServer(function( request , response ) { var ip = request.connection.remoteAddress ; if ( !ip_allowed ( ip ) ) { msg = " IP " + ip + " is not allowed to use this proxy " ; deny ( response , msg ) ; sys.log ( msg ) ; return ; } if ( !host_allowed (request.url ) ) { msg =
" Host " + request.url + " has been denied by proxy configuration " ; deny ( response , msg ) ; sys.log ( msg ) ; return ; } sys.log ( ip + " : " + request.method + " " + request.url ) ; var proxy = http.createClient( 80 , request.headers [ ' host ' ] ) var proxy_request = proxy.request( request.method , request.url , request.headers ) ; proxy_request.addListener(' response ' , function ( proxy_response ) { proxy_response.addListener( ' data ' , function ( chunk ) { response.
write ( chunk , ' binary ' ) ; } ) ; proxy_response.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { response.end ( ) ; } ) ; response.writeHead(proxy_response.statusCode , proxy_response.headers ) ; } ) ; request.addListener(' data ' , function ( chunk ) { proxy_request.write ( chunk , ' binary ) ; } ) ; request.addListener( 'end ' , function ( ) { proxy_request.end ( ) ; } ) ; }).listen ( 8080 ) ; update_blacklist ( ) ; update_iplist ( ) ;
Again , it 's amazing how fast you can write server software in node.js and JavaScript .
It would probably have taken me a day to write the same in C .
I love how fast you can prototype the software nowadays .
Download proxy.js
Download link : catonmat.net/ftp/proxy.js
I am gonna build this proxy up so I also pushed proxy.js to GitHub .
You can fork and contribute .
Happy proxying !

The festival - friendly city of Leipzig , in Germany , has hosted the 19th edition Wave Gotik Treffen , considered the world ’s largest Goth event .
Around 25,000
Goth fans , from all over Europe , gathered in Leipzig , four a 3 day festival ( 22 – 24 May ) , that started back in 1992 .
Covered in tons of eyeliner and makeup , and sporting shiny jewelry and extreme piercings , attendees paraded their eccentric outfits , on the city streets , and turned Leipzig into a dark fantasy realm , if only for a few days .
During the Wave Gotik Treffen , Goth enthusiasts enjoy Goth rock concerts , theatrical performances , film premieres , exhibitions and discussions on various philosophical topics .
Take a look at some of the coolest costumes from the recently ended Wave Gotik Treffen 2010 :

A tsunami alert has been lifted after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit the Indonesian island of Sumatra .
The quake 's epicentre was 204 km ( 127 miles ) northwest of Sibolga on Sumatra 's coast , at a depth of nearly 48 km , the US Geological Survey said .
Three aftershocks were reported in the northern province of Aceh , but there were no reports of casualties .
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire , one of the world 's most active areas for earthquakes and volcanoes .
It has recently been struck by a string of quakes ; one off Sumatra in September killed more than 1,000 people .
The latest quake - the largest in the area since March 2008 - struck at 0515 on Wednesday morning ( 2215 GMT on Tuesday ) .
Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially said a small tsunami would possibly hit coasts within 100 km of the quake 's epicentre , a destructive widespread tidal wave was said to be unlikely .
Japan 's Kyodo news agency reported blackouts in Medan and Banda Aceh , the capital of Aceh Province .
Local television reported that people rushed to higher ground in some areas .
Thai authorities also warned people in coastal areas to evacuate to a safe place .
In December 2004 , a 9.1 magnitude quake off the coast of Aceh triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed quarter of a million people in 13 countries including Indonesia , Sri Lanka , India and Thailand .

You 're looking at the first multi-cellular , anaerobic organism known to humans .
Anaerobic , of course , means this little critter lives entirely without oxygen .
We 've long known that single - celled organisms could live this way , but this discovery comes as a bit of surprise .
Even more fascinating ( to me , at least ) is the fact that this organism , part of a species called Loricifera , has no mitochondria .
I did n't realize this , but anaerobic organisms have an entirely different organelle , called hydrogenosomes , that power their cells .
I 'm not sure whether hydrogenosomes have the same sort of origin story as mitochondria — i.e. , separate organisms that took up residence in a host cell and became part of its machinery — but that 's the first thing I 'm researching tonight when I get a chance .
The fate of the suburb is one of the most important issues facing Americas metro areas .
While many have decried their environmental unsustainability , even those who do n’t agree on that should worry greatly about their demographic , economic , and fiscal sustainability .
As early inner ring suburbs across America increasingly face decay , poverty , and crime , it is clear that the allure wears off these places once they are no longer shiny and new and people can simply move to another , newer suburb on the fringe that is .
If most of today ’s boomburgs think their fate is any different , they ’ll be for a rude shock 30 years or so down the road .
Most suburbs , though different in form from what she described , are basically Jacobsian “ gray belts ” , and follow her observation that as a rule only the upscale hold their own over time .
But across America suburbs old and new are looking at different paths , some based in New Urbanism , others in different approaches , to try to build a different product , one that will still be worth living and doing business in when the growth wave passes them over .
One of those places is Carmel , Indiana ( pronounced like the Biblical Carmel ) .
It ’s a classic upscale , traditionally car - based suburb ( meaning not a streetcar style suburb ) of about 80,000 people north of Indianapolis , roughly similar to many other prestige business suburbs around the country like Naperville , IL ; Mason or Dublin , OH ; or Cool Springs , TN .
They have one of the most ambitious agendas of suburban retrofit in the country , taking what was once a typical sprawling town in a more urban , dense , mixed use , walkable direction .
I wrote a three part series on Carmel in 2007 called “ Leadership in Action ” you may want to review .
Most material in this post is new and does not repeat the previous installments .
Part One : Strategy
Part Two : New Urbanism
Part Three : Criticisms
Think of this as “ Part Four : Progress Report ” in which I ’ll share some current initiatives of interest .
City Center
This original core of Carmel prior to its big growth phase was a mix of industrial and strip malls , most of which were in advanced states of dilapidation .
This has been an area of focus as the city has tried to reinvent it as a true regional town center .
One of the dead strip malls was acquired by the city and is being turned into the mixed use Carmel City Center project .
Various townhomes and offices have already been built , but the core of the project is a large , mixed use retail / office / hotel / condo / greenspace / theater complex is that is nearing its grand opening .
Here ’s a picture of the main commercial structure :
One can disagree with the aesthetics .
But putting an eight story tower where a parking lot used to be is clearly a bigtime move in a more dense direction – and you ’ll see that these structures follow proper urban form .
And even with the style , which is n’t to my personal taste , I can respect that they ’ve made a deliberate and considered choice .
Behind this building is a new $ 150 million , 1,600 seat concert hall called the Palladium .
As you can see , it ’s done in a neo-classical style with limestone facing .
It is designed after the Villa Rotunda in Italy .
The architect is the same person who designed the Schermerhorn Center in Nashville , Tennessee .
In effect , a suburb in Indianapolis is building a concert hall to the standards of a major urban downtown .
There ’s no real anchor tenant for the building , though the Indianapolis Symphony has promised to play a handful of dates there .
Michael Feinstein is the artistic director , which should give you an idea of what they are thinking .
( The pink color is a temporary reflection off some exposed roof sealant .
And this is the back side of the building .
There ’s a more elaborate ceremonial entrance on the other side ) .
The City Center complex will also house a new , separate $ 10 million home for the Indianapolis Civic Theater ( the oldest community theater in the United States ) , and another 250 seat theater space .
Carmel is betting a lot of chips on the arts , but we ’ll have to see if a suburban city will ultimately be willing to present art of serious ambition vs. just safe crowd pleasers .
Old Town
About half a mile north of City Center is Carmel ’s original downtown , the Old Town area , now called the “ Arts and Design District ” .
This newly opened building there is the Indiana Design Center , which will house several design - related firms .
Just around the corner on Main St. , several new mixed use structures have gone up in recent years .
Here is the latest one under construction .
It ’s a 75 unit upscale apartment complex with ground floor retail and an underground parking structure with public parking .
Village of West Clay
Yes , this is being done in a retro-Second Empire style .
On the west side of Carmel is a classic style New Urbanist master planned community called the Village of West Clay .
Here ’s a picture to give you a flavor of it :
Multi-Use Sidepaths
Click over to my previous series for more new urbanist photos .
But it ’s time to move on to transportation .
Carmel has made a big commitment to pedestrian and bicycle friendliness .
One way it is doing this is by upgrading its old two - lane country style streets into parkways .
Rather than bike lanes and sidewalks , however , Carmel is using its suburban ROW advantage to instead provide fully separated bike and pedestrian access through 8 - 10 foot wide sidepaths on both side of the street .
Here ’s an example on Towne Rd .
This is much better for the numerous children in town , who do n’t have to try to bike on the street .
This photo shows a rare four - lane road in Carmel .
The city has established as a policy not widening roads where possible .
Instead , they have focused on upgrading intersections with modern roundabouts and leaving the roads as mostly two lanes , though with generous lane widths and a landscaped median ( and sidepaths of course ) .
Most of the congestion on these roads was intersection and left - turn related , and this solved the problem without adding mainline capacity .
Here ’s a sample :
Obviously this would look better if it were n’t winter .
The multi-use sidepath has emerged as a sort of suburban standard in Indianapolis .
Many of them have been installed , even in cases where the actual road has n’t been upgraded .
Trail Grade Separations
The Monon Trail is a rail - trail that links Carmel and points north with downtown Indianapolis .
Like many local projects , it was controversial when proposed – the city had to pursue over 250 condemnations to acquire the right of way due to the easement process the railroad had used to build and neighbor opposition – but that now no one can imagine life without .
The picture at the top of this post is the Monon Trail at Main St. I said there are n’t that many four lane roads , but where the trail does cross one , the city grade separated it , usually via a tunnel , but in this case at Carmel Dr. with a bridge .
Roundabout Interchanges
Again , this is all about making it safer and more convenient for cyclists and pedestrians , especially children .
In case you are wondering , there ’s a fairly long slope to that bridge , so the grade is n’t an issue .
I mentioned roundabouts earlier .
These modern roundabouts are n’t like old school traffic circles .
Google them up to find out why they are safer and better than stop signs and signalized intersections .
Carmel is the US leader in these , with over 65 already built .
That represents about 5 % of the entire US total , though as these become more popular that will no doubt go down .
But Carmel recently upped its game with roundabout interchanges .
These are similar to a compressed diamond or SPUI , but instead of stoplights , they use a roundabout ( or roundabout pair ) to control traffic .
Carmel did n’t invent these or even implement the first one in the US , but it is implementing the largest scale deployment to date as it wraps up work converting six signaled intersections on Keystone Ave. to roundabout interchanges .
( Several more are to come on nearby US 31 .
Carmel has even consulted with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation on a major roundabout interchange program there ) .
This was originally a state controlled four lane divided highway with a frankly rural design characteristic .
INDOT wanted to widen it to six lanes but leave stop lights in place .
Carmel had a better idea : give us the road the money you were going to spend on it , we ’ll add zero lanes , but convert those stop lights to roundabout interchanges to make the road safer for traffic , provide a safer path for pedestrians and cyclists to cross over Keystone , and reduce the barrier created by the highway .
Here ’s a picture of the completed interchange at 126th St .
If you ’re asking yourself , “ Where ’s Keystone ? ” , it was depressed under 126th St. to minimize its impact on the neighborhood .
This is the controlling roundabout on 126th St .
It is a single roundabout compressed in the middle to create a dumbbell shape .
This is a simpler design that among other things means you only need one bridge over Keystone and enables extremely tight ramps that minimize ROW impact .
This idea was borrowed from Mallorca , Spain .
This photo shows Keystone under 126th and the extremely tight ramps .
Note the construction truck on the ramp on the left of the photo .
You also no doubt noticed the interesting staining on the retaining walls .
This is part of an overall high level aesthetic treatment .
For example , the human scaled decorative light standards on the roundabout vs. INDOT preferred high mast tower lighting .
Here you ’ll see more of the careful thought and attention to detail that went into this design .
You ’ll have to click to enlarge , but the emblem in the middle of the bridge rail is the city seal , which I think it is nice touch .
Also , given the general ye olde thyme theme in Carmel , I was pleasantly surprised by their choice of fonts here .
The other interchanges are similar enough to provide a common design feel but different enough to provide interest .
Here ’s a shot of the 106th St. interchange , showing both the difference in color and the coloring on the tilted cutouts that are only visible from certain angles – sure to surprise and delight .
Risks and Conclusion
Again , if you want to read more , see my previous three part series .
On the whole , I ’m very impressed with what Carmel is trying to do in terms of new urbanism , pedestrian and bicycle design , and trying to build an environment with long term staying power .
Also , this is a regional amenity .
Clearly , a nice suburb is no substitute for a vibrant urban core .
But a great city needs great suburbs .
In the ever more competitive world we live in today , every part of a region needs to know its role on the team and bring its A - game .
And let ’s face it , not all people are going to want to live in the city .
Some people , whether that be corporate executives who want estate style living or many families or others , will always prefer a suburban environment .
So having a suburb like Carmel that is on the leading edge of practice in many ways is a competitive asset for the whole region .
Frankly , there is a risk that as places like Carmel grow too successful , they will suck up too much life out of the city .
It does worry me .
But I think that means we need to work harder to bring the city up , not that we should cut the suburbs down .
Not all has been positive .
A vocal minority hates the direction the city has gone under Mayor Jim Brainard , and while they have as yet proven a minority , they ’ve grown in strength and there are more battles over these projects than there were a few years back .
The city council is more aggressive these days , and being a checks and balances kind of guy , I think that ’s probably healthy .
The current economy , particularly against the backdrop of a state like Indiana , also has a lot of people questioning the spending levels .
And there have been some embarrassing financial screwups .
The Keystone project was originally estimated to be done with only the money from the state , but costs were higher than anticipated – though still far less than what INDOT could have done the project for .
Carmel had to bond about $ 20 million to finish it – not a minor amount .
A community recreation facility called the Monon Center was supposed to be self - supporting but is requiring tax subsidies .
Dittos for the operations of the Palladium .
Carmel ’s amenity led strategy has paid off in terms of millions of square feet of Class A office and other commercial space .
It has the fourth lowest tax rate of any city in the state – one that has n’t gone up in over a decade – and the second most affluent resident base , so clearly financing is not an absolute constraint .
But Hoosiers are by nature tight fisted with the public purse , and questions have , rightly in my view , been asked about some of these overruns .
But perhaps the best verdict on Carmel was rendered by the Ã¼ber - spending hawk Gov. Mitch Daniels .
He personally built a home in Carmel shortly after getting elected governor and after the transformation plan was well over way .
Daniels voted with his feet – that ’s the ultimate endorsement .
If Mitch Daniels is ok enough with the spending to live there , I ’m guessing the rest of the community probably will be too .
The other storm cloud on the horizon is schools .
The state took over all school operations funding as part of a property tax reform program .
But in the last budget the state implemented a funding formula that gave upscale Indianapolis suburbs the least amount of money in the entire state .
Carmel ’s highly regarded school district received the fourth lowest per pupil funds of any district in the entire state .
That ’s hardly a recipe for economic development .
As no doubt the legislature intended , Carmel and other municipalities had to implement special local tax referendums to keep from implementing draconian cuts .
In effect , the state outsourced the painful and messy business of raising taxes to these local governments .
It was a de facto geographically targeted tax increase to help the state balance its budget .
A collection of these suburbs is presently suing the state over the matter .
Regardless of how it ends up , this is an ominous sign for a state that is ostensibly hanging its hat on new economy businesses , when these places are where it is centered in the state , where the labor force that powers it lives , in a region that supplies 80 % of the state ’s economic growth and a significant slug of surplus state taxes .
Another risk is that the region takes the wrong lesson from Carmel and writes off what it has accomplished as merely being for rich people .
While “ the nicest stuff for the people with the most money ” is the easy default strategy for the upscale suburb , there are many lessons around a civic strategy anchored in a vision of how to differentiate and position a community for the long term future that are more broadly applicable .
That does n’t mean cloning Carmel .
Again , every town needs to know its role on the team .
Not everyone can be the quarterback .
Not everybody is a linebacker .
Not everybody is a center .
Different towns need to find their niche and play their role as good as it can be played .
One positive sign : the old industrial suburb of Speedway is leveraging many of the same techniques in an attempt to create a more year - round motorsports destination .
But that will have to be the subject of a future post , perhaps .

|||Ringerike sykehus må betale en bot på 500 000 kroner etter at en 22 - åring døde som følge av behandlingen han fikk etter en kneoperasjon .
Nå vil sykehuset gå gjennom rutinene sine på nytt .
Boten er ilagt sykehuset som foretaksstraff i form av et forelegg .
Politiet mener sykehuset har brutt helsepersonelloven .
Sykehuset ble siktet 17 .
desember i fjor etter at en 22 - åring fra Modum døde som følge av behandlingen han fikk etter en kneoperasjon i september .
- Ikke tilstrekkelig overvåking - Saken er grundig etterforsket og vi mener sykehuset har overtrådt helsepersonelloven .
Etter vår oppfatning er det bevist at helsepersonellet ikke ga pasienten tilstrekkelig overvåking etter operasjonen , og at sykehusets rutiner vedrørende medisinhåndtering ble brutt , sier politiadvokat Per Thomas Omholt i Nordre Buskerud politidistrikt .
I tillegg mener politiet det er bevist at sykehuset mangler rutiner for blant annet pasienter som er ustabile på sengepost .
- Nå skal vi lese gjennom premissene for den boten som er ilagt før vi bestemmer oss for om vi aksepterer boten eller ikke , sier kommunikasjonssjef i Vestre Viken Helseforetak , Jo Heldaas til NTB .
Gjennomgår rutiner på nytt Han understreker at sykehuset gikk gjennom rutinene sine etter dødsfallet i fjor .
- Vi fant da ingen grunn til å endre på de rutinene vi hadde for overvåking , men når politiet nå sier at disse rutinene mangler , må vi naturligvis gå gjennom rutinene våre på nytt , sier Heldaas .
Politiet har ikke funnet at noen enkeltpersoner kan straffes fordi det ikke er funnet bevis for at de har opptrådt grovt uaktsomt .

First Solar ( NSDQ : FSLR ) has made it to grid parity , according to at least one analyst .
A 12.6 - megawatt system installed by First Solar for Sempra Generation showed that the system can produce electricity at below the price of conventional power in the United States , said Mark Bachman , an equity analyst at Pacific Crest , in a research note Tuesday .
The system can generate 12.6 megawatts of power in direct current , which is then converted to alternating current to feed the electric grid .
First Solar announced the project as a 10 - megawatt ( AC ) power plant earlier this year .
The plant , located in the Nevada desert near Boulder City , costs $ 0.075 per kilowatt hour to install without any subsidies , Bachman wrote .
Conventional power fed into the grid costs $ 0.09 per kilowatt hour .
" In our view , the industry leaders will be those companies that can deliver electricity at or below grid parity pricing without the aid of subsidies while also delivering superior return to shareholders , " Bachman said .
" Currently , only First Solar can claim these achievements , in our view . "
Bachman 's cost calculations , of course , are impacted by a number of factors .
Others will likely come to different conclusions .
Part of the calculation relies on what others are achieving in other locations with different kinds of panels .
Nonetheless , it underscores the progress the industry is making toward the important milestone .
And First Solar is n't the only one narrowing in on it .
Yesterday , Cypress Semiconductor CEO T.J. Rodgers told a group of reporters that power from crystalline silicon solar panels will be cheaper than coal power by 2012 when transmissions lines , utility bureaucracy and other factors are added in .
" We are zeroing in on parity , " Rodgers said .
" We 're going to match PG&E ( Pacific Gas and Electric ) by 2012 .
Within a couple of years , the price of solar will be just as cheap . "
Rodgers invested in SunPower in 2000 when it had 40 employees .
He turned the shares over to Cypress later .
SunPower now sells billions worth of panels a year .
First Solar , based in Tempe , Ariz. , makes thin - film solar panels using cadmium tellurium as the key ingredient to convert sunlight into electricity .
It 's one of a handful of thin - film companies to be producing panels in high volumes and the only one turning out cad tel panels in volume .
Most of the solar panels today use crystalline silicon , which is able to convert more sunlight than materials used by thin - film makers .
Next year , a handful of manufacturers will start making copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) solar cells .
First Solar 's claim to fame for the past several years has been in its ability to churn out large numbers of panels and a fairly low cost .
Last month , the company said it was able to produce panels at $ 1.08 per watt .
The figure , however , is a blended average of all of the company 's factories .
First Solar 's cost out of its Malaysian factories is lower , closer to 75 cents .
The $ 40 million system at Sempra is comprised of 168,300 panels , which First Solar installed at a cost of $ 3.17 per watt , Bachman wrote .
( The installed cost is higher because it includes frames and installation , not just the solar module . )
He cited SunPower 's installation of a 14.2 - megawatt system at the Nellis Air Force base in Nevada for comparison .
Bachman said SunPower 's crystalline silicon panels cost $ 7.04 per watt to install .
After figuring out how much electricity the system is generating , Bachman determined that it costs $ 0.164 per kilowatt hour .
He concluded that for the SunPower system to generate electricity at the same rate ( in kilowatt - hours ) as First Solar 's , SunPower would have to cut its panel prices by 52 percent and sell them at $ 3.4 per watt .
But Bachman went on to argue that the solar industry cares too much about the cost of producing and installing panels , and not enough about the how much a system costs in terms of its power generation , in kilowatt - hours .
He noted that financial analysts should do so when dissecting the average selling price of a company 's panels .
" By focusing on the cost / kWh calculation , we can compare competing business models on a defined metric that is independent of technologies , " he said .
Bachman also figured that First Solar 's system make more efficient use of real estate than SunPower 's , something that contradicts SunPower 's claim and the estimates of others .
SunPower 's system needs more space because it uses a tracking system to point the panels to the sun throughout the day .
Crystalline panels perform the best when facing the direct sun .
By using the tracker , however , the panels need to be farther apart to avoid the shadow cast by other panels as they follow the sun , Bachman said .
That means it would take more space to fit a SunPower system than a First Solar system at comparable capacity , he said .
First Solar tilted its panels at a fixed angle instead .
Its cadmium - telluride panels might not be as efficient as SunPower 's panels under direct sun , but the thin - film panels do better at converting diffused light .
SunPower , however , achieves a far higher efficiency .
It sells panels that can convert 20 to nearly 23 percent of the sunlight that strikes them into electricity .
First Solar 's cad tel panels wallow around the ten percent range .
My previous installments on November 's GNU Hackers Meeting ( hither , and thither ) touched some topics that were important to me , but not as important as the one I 'll mention tonight .
Tonight I want to talk about autonomy and the internet .
I 'll approach it from a roundabout direction .
the facebook problem
Many of you probably know someone who has had their Facebook account disabled .
Here are a couple , and here are some thousands more .
While I 'm probably not the best person to speak of this , as I do n't have a Facebook account , it 's quite irritating to have this happen .
It 's like you 've been unpersoned .
Beyond the individual indignation though , what is really important ( and sometimes missing ) is a more universal indignation : never mind me , what gives a corporation the right to unperson anyone ?
Sure , I hear you arguing that it 's their services , bla bla , but the end of it is that when you use Facebook , you lose autonomy -- communication and identity are needs just like any other .
I might be going out on a limb here , but consider Article 19 of the fine UN Declaration of Human Rights :
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers .
Emphasis mine , of course .
What I 'm saying is that you should n't depend on the government or a corporation or any other entity outside your actual community to be able to actualize these natural rights .
and further : article 12
Though I do n't like the wording of this one as much as the previous article , nor the gendered pronouns , check it :
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation .
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks .
As an American living in Europe , it has taken me some time to appreciate the European focus on privacy .
I do n't think people in the States understand the issues as well as people do here .
OK , so your parents / grandparents lived through fascism : so what ?
On a personal level , whether you 're an industry insider , someone avoiding an abusive relationship , or an Earth Liberation Front activist , privacy is terribly important .
It 's not an exaggeration to say that to cede control over your privacy is to cede control over your identity .
But organizations that control your data on this level usually are n't stupid enough to let you know , or make you think about it .
All that is left is a dull throb of database scandals and terms - of - service changes and wiretaps .
The problem is not the existence of malicious people : the problem is that the your data is out there .
All it takes is one nosy person , or one controlling governmental agency ( cf. A , B ) , or one corporation wanting to monetize ( cf. all of them ) .
There are simply no safeguards .
There is nothing you can do if you want to be a part of the modern web to protect your privacy .
Your data on servers is always available to wiretap , and subpoena if necessary .
Your data is not your own .
origins
Both of these problems ( unpersonage and privacy violations ) stem from the fact that you rely on someone else 's computer to fulfill your personal needs .
RMS wrote about this in an article entitled Who does that server really serve ? , and I agree with all of his points .
Stormy Peters ' recent article , 10 free apps I wish were open source , illustrates many of these misunderstandings .
Besides the misleading terminology , what if Gmail were AGPL - free ?
Would that protect users against the recent Buzz fiasco ?
No , because users are not in control of the software they use .
Users should be able to modify the software they run ; if they cannot , due to that software running on another machine , they should not run software on another machine .
I do n't think Richard 's article goes far enough .
As I mentioned above , the problem is that your data is just " out there " .
Let 's postulate an AGPL Gmail that also allows me to run my own Gmail software on Google 's network .
While this would meet the Free Software definition , it still harms me as a user , because anyone who has access to that server has access to my data .
Besides that , there is the practical difficulty , in that Facebook or Google would never allow you access to the programs that run on your data in that way .
What I 'm building up to is the idea that the client - server paradigm is fundamentally incompatible with autonomy .
Growing your own food is better than sharecropping , better than " web 2.0 " .
what shall we do , sir wingo
A fundamental problem requires a radical ( adj. : to the root ) solution .
As is often the case , the seed of a solution has been with us for a long time : public - key cryptography .
Geeks have long enjoyed mailing each other signed and / or encrypted mails , allowing private communication over insecure networks , relying on webs of trust to ensure the identity of the sender .
Asymmetric cryptography allows you to send and receive private messages over insecure channels , like the internet .
I wo n't belabor the point , as most of my readers have seen GPG ; it is the Right Thing .
But what would GPG - style interactions mean in the context of Facebook ?
All of you are probably cringing at this point , imagining the complexity and security implications .
But let 's bask in that moment for a while , shall we : if it were the case that fellow facebooklicans sent you private messages via GPG , being able to view them sensibly over the web would imply that the Facebook server would have your private key .
Extrapolating this farther , the very set of your " friends " is a kind of private data .
If this data were properly encrypted and signed against your private key , to present the standard facebook view that most people know would again require your private key .
In the end , you can't have web services that access private data .
Not if you want privacy , anyway .
an autonomous facebook ?
To preserve the privacy of your identity , you should never send your private key over the wire .
This is well - known .
But if you are to do computation on your social network , as facebook.com does , then it follows that such computation must be done local to the user 's machine .
But all of facebook on your local machine ?
Surely you 're joking , Mr. Wingo !
Well , yes and no .
Obviously the answer is not " let 's everyone download a program from facebook and run it locally with your private key as an argument " .
Not quite , anyway .
One good part of the so - called " web 2.0 " is that I can code foo - anarchist - commune.org 's web site in Scheme and no one is any the wiser .
It 's easy to deploy in today 's environment ; deploying e.g. a new facebook experience should not cause me to have to click something to install a new binary .
So , the constraints are :
My key pair is my identity .
My public key may be distributed , but my private key must be private .
Since computation needs my private key , computation must happen locally .
Viewing an " autonomous facebook " implies running a program on my local machine , with access to my private key .
Since an " autonomous facebook " would be useless without other people , I need access to other people 's information , I need a network too .
We can already draw a picture of what this looks like .
Let 's assume that the end - user experience is still via the web browser .
I think that my paranoid readers know where I 'm going with this .
My technically - minded readers will be flabbergast , perhaps , at the enormity of the problem of implementing facebook under such constraints .
How does my facebook know that it 's participating in a network ?
How does it know about my friend Leif ?
How does it get updates ?
Where is the database ?
autonomous data model
Well , one thing is clear : someone needs to hold all of that data .
Who to do it ?
In the case of my data ( my photos , my messages to others , etc ) , I should be the one , as it makes me more autonomous .
Everyone needs to seed their own data on the network .
I might choose to seed my data from multiple locations , for reliability .
Beyond that , nodes might cache information that is routed through them .
One way to implement such a distributed store would be git - like , with content - based addressing and consistent hashing ; or like bittorrent .
It would have efficiency advantages .
I thought for a while that this would be the solution , but GHM folk brought up the privacy argument , that your pattern of network access is too revealing .
So my current thought is to use GNUnet somehow .
I 'm not sure how this will go , but it 's worth a try .
new operating system
Currently , to deploy a web application , you have to pay for servers and bandwidth , and this eventually causes your interests to diverge farther from that of your users .
With an autonomous cloud , you could instead deploy web applications using the compute power and bandwidth of leaf nodes -- the power of the people using your software .
This would drastically lower the hacktivation energy for a new project .
The little green sandbox above starts to approach a new kind of operating system , even -- a new program to run your programs .
Obviously , I 'm thinking Guile would be a fine runtime for the sandbox , to run programs written for Guile -- in Ecmascript or Lua or Scheme or Elisp or whatever other languages people implement for Guile .
The user would receive the source code , and running it would automatically compile it on their machine .
The application source would also be available to modify and redistribute .
Having a sandbox for mobile code also raises the possibility of interesting mapreduce - type operations , to index the distributed data store .
Firefox could be modified with a plugin to add a new addressing mode , which would go through the HTTP server running locally to your machine .
You would be browsing the " autonomous web " .
Of course , since the whole thing is based on protocols , one might substitute the Guile environment for something else ; or write an alternate interface to Facebook that works over a console or presents you with a native ( e.g. , Clutter ) interface .
related work
There have been loads of people thinking these ideas ; none of them is new .
My ongoing use of the term " autonomous " is a nod to anarchists , and to the autonomo .us group .
Autonomo.us would be a great organizing place for work around this , but their list server is a bit moribund ; somewhat ironic .
Perhaps we can return life to that group , though .
GNU Social is a project to make a free - as - in - freedom social network .
I think it 's a great initiative , and it 's probably the place to go if you want to build an alternative to Facebook right now .
GNU Social has made the decision to just get something working .
This is the right thing to do , IMO ; but near - term solutions should not prevent concurrent research for the long - term .
In the end if making an autonomous cloud turns out to be possible , perhaps we can rebase GNU Social on top of the autonomous infrastructure .
Is there something else I should really be looking at ?
Let me know !
I do n't think one can ever do a full survey of this field -- better to just start hacking -- but I 'm interested in good ideas , especially to the data storage and access problem .
plan
All of this is a bit pie - in - the - sky , but I am going to see if I can work up a proof - of - concept for the upcoming GHM in July .
If you are interested in helping this project , probably the best thing to do is to code up some little demo application using GNUnet or some other store .
Once you have that , drop by to see me in # guile and we 'll talk .

Dear Messrs Gillett and Hicks ,
On 6 February 2007 , the both of you agreed to take over our beloved Liverpool Football Club .
It was reported in the media that the deal was worth in the region of £ 435 million , with £ 220 million being paid to buy out the existing shareholders , which included around £ 45 million worth of debt , and the remaining £ 215 million earmarked for the proposed new stadium .
Soon after , you graced the hallowed turf of Anfield holding aloft Liverpool scarves and team shirts embellished with your names on their backs .
You talked of understanding the fans that stood on the Kop cheering and singing their hearts out for the team they love and will love till death and probably beyond .
You spoke of acknowledging the great heritage of the club and how its glorious history of yester - years had shaped the modern era club of today .
You paid warm tributes to those souls so needlessly lost on that sad day at Hillsborough .
There were ambitious plans for our new 61,000 capacity stadium , with an all new Kop that would be the envy of all other fans .
There was going to be a healthy transfer kitty for our manager to dig deep into .
David Moores told us that our precious club was being passed on to knowing and loving hands that would see it through to a brighter future than he could provide it .
You two were our saviours , our very own American ‘ dynamic duo ’ who would bring us up alongside Manchester United , Chelsea and Arsenal when it came to stadia , facilities , money , players and those all important trophies .
A great treasure was being placed in your so called capable hands .
The two of you , over all others , were being entrusted with our growth and development into a new era .
There were other suitors , DIC from Dubai were extremely keen and had significant amounts of money too .
But we were told that it was you that had the experience and knowledge of owning sports clubs , of being the perfect owners , of knowing how best to take us to the next level .
The fact the DIC had actual Liverpool supporters in their very upper echelons and were passionate about the club did not sway Mr. Moores , he told us you would be the better owners .
And we lapped it up .
Starved of those glory days , we took it all in .
Hook , line and sinker .
Cameras flashed and you smiled .
All in all , the future looked so bright it was almost blinding .
But from that fateful day in early 2007 , rather that the future having gotten brighter and brighter as you so boldly promised , the skies have clouded over , the sun has shone less and less and on the not too distant horizon monstrously large and deathly frightening storm clouds are forming .
Promises of never crippling our beloved club with lorry loads of debt were never kept .
All your fancy words were simply that , words .
Actions were never forthcoming and rather than see our debt burden reduce , you simply re-financed and delayed and refinanced loan repayments again and again , until now it seems to be threatening the very existence of the club .
The new stadium that looked so magnificent on the plans has never and will most likely never be anymore than that under your stewardship .
Some fans even question whether you even seriously had any intention of making such a substantial investment , as this would have tied you to a club which you do not really love .
Our fear was that other potential owners would simply see our club as a business vehicle .
But in reality it was you that saw our club this way .
For you Liverpool Football Club was and is simply a business .
It seems that you are exactly the types of owners that we dreaded .
At least the likes of DIC were Liverpool fans before they wanted to take over the club .
They would have probably taken more care of it , as they were like us , fans and supporters first and foremost .
The both of you will point to increases in revenues being posted , new sponsorship deals agreed , advances in commercial revenue generation projects and even a posting of a £ 35 million operating profit to the end of July this year .
All this just sounds great to the money men but for us fans , where is all this money going ?
Where is the cash from all these lucrative commercial deals ?
If we are making such a healthy profit then why are we struggling for cash to give our manager to strengthen our squad ?
All this is even before we factor in the lack of Champions League revenue this year and next .
But even before this catastrophe , we were staring into the abyss .
There have been reports in the media in the past days that Liverpool Football Club are close to financial ruin .
The loans that you have been continually re-financing need to be repaid at some point .
The interest alone is a crippling £ 36 million a year .
All we see is re-financing package after re-financing package .
Gentlemen , if you did not have the money in the first place , you had no business buying our club .
If you now do not have the money to keep the club afloat then please , for heaven sake , sell up and move on .
So we come to the question of selling .
Finally , after dragging our club through financial shame and ruin , sucking it of all the financial and commercial money you could get out of it , you put it onto the market for a new buyer to take over .
You have treated an icon of British and European football with disgraceful disrespect .
Shame on you both .
Before the two of you came to our shores , never would we have contemplated Liverpool Football Club being dragged through one embarrassing financial disaster after another .
It simply seems like you do not have any money .
Sorry you have plenty of money , but you will not invest it in Liverpool Football Club .
The awful debts may force us to sell off our prized assets in an attempt to be a viable and sound commercial entity .
We are like a steam train heading on the tracks that Leeds United steamed down not so very long ago .
There are reports in the media that your asking price for Liverpool Football Club is around £ 800 million !
This would suggest that in the time that you have been in charge , the value of the club has increased four times !
This is a preposterous notion .
What the fans see in that figure are two businessmen who are attempting to make an absurdly large profit and have little , actually no , regard whatsoever for the club .
For you , gentlemen , it is all about the money .
What would be best for the club would be for you to sell at a reasonable level , leave and let the new owners pick up the pieces .
It has been reported that the value of the club is in the region of £ 300 million .
This would still represent a profit for you , however Mr. Hicks has been reported as saying he is willing to hold on till a buyer matches their offer and that this could even take up to two years !
Mr. Gillett and Hicks , please , please , do the right thing .
Please accept a reasonable offer for our beloved club .
Sell and leave us to lick our wounds and try to right the wrongs you have perpetuated and let us get back on the road to stability .
For the sake of a great icon of British and European football , just go and leave us alone .
" The EU may seem complicated from the other side of the Atlantic , yet it is better to be boring than warring . "

How to Easily Make “ Ajaxy ” Chat application with PHP + SQL + jQuery
Today I will tell you about another chat system .
After making old - style chat described in previous post I decided to make modern , pretty version .
I made several enhancements :
a ) Login system .
Now it using database to keep members .
Also it have easy methods to take some necessary info about logged member .
b) Chat interface .
Now it much more user friendly .
And show last added messages via toggling ( based on jQuery ) .
Looks fine .
c ) Inner code structure .
Now here are good order .
All libraries in ‘ inc ’ folder , all javascripts in ‘ js ’ folder , all template - related files in folder ‘ templates ’ .
More , class organization : now we have useful DB class , class of login system , chat class too .
d ) of code safety .
Added necessary methods to protect from hack attacks .
As example function process_db_input in our DB class .
So , as result – we will able to chat with our logged members .
We will use database to store messages as usual .
Here is a sample :
Ok , download the example files and lets start coding !
Step 1 . HTML
As usual , we start with the HTML .
This is input text form of our chat .
templates/chat_input.html
< form class = " submit_form " method= " post " action= " " target = " chat_res " > < div > < input type =" text " name = " s_message " />< input type =" submit " value = " Say " name = " s_say " /></div> </ form > < div > You can type anything in chat</div > < iframe name = " chat_res " style =" display : none ; " ></ iframe >
This is login form code .
templates/login_form.html
< form class =" login_form " method= " post " action= " " > < div>Username : < input type =" text " name = " username " /></div> < div > Password : < input type=" password " name= " password " /></div> < div >< input type=" submit " value = " Login " name = " Login " /></div> </ form > < div > You can use username " User1 " or " User2 " and password " qwerty " to login in system </ div > < hr />
Step 2 . CSS
Here are used CSS styles .
templates/css/styles.css
.login_form { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; padding : 10 px ; } h3 { margin - top:3 px;} .chat_main { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; - moz-box - shadow:0 0 10px #ccc ; - webkit - box - shadow : 0 0 10 px #ccc ; width :350 px ; padding : 10 px ; background : #f3f3f3 ; } . message { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; margin : 4 px ; padding : 5 px ; - moz - border - radius :7 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 7 px ; background : # ffffff ; } .textf {- moz - box - shadow:0 0 10px #CCCCCC ; -webkit-box - shadow:0 0 10px # CCCCCC ; border : 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; height :40 px; } . submit { - moz - border - radius : 7 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 7 px ; background : #F3F3F3 ; border : 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; font - size : 16 px ; font - weight : bold ; height :35 px ; margin - left :10 px ; padding : 5 px ; } . message span { font - size : 10 px ; color : #888 ; margin - left:10 px ; } .submit_form { margin : 10 px 0 px ; }
Step 3 . SQL
We will need to execute next SQL in our database .
CREATE TABLE `s_ajax_chat_messages` ( `id` INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , `member_id` INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL , `member_name` VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `message` VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `when` INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ; CREATE TABLE `s_members` ( `id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , `name` varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `pass` varchar ( 40 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ; INSERT INTO `s_members` ( `id` , `name` , `pass` ) VALUES ( NULL , ' User1 ' , 'd8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 ' ) , ( NULL , ' User2 ' , 'd8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 ' ) ;
Step 4 . JS
Here are few necessary JS files to our project .
js/main.js
$ ( function ( ) { getMessages = function ( ) { var self = this ; var _sRandom = Math.random ( ) ; $.getJSON('index.php?action=get_last_messages ' + ' &_r= ' + _sRandom , function ( data ) { if ( data.messages ) { $ ( '.chat_main').html(data.messages ) ; } // start it again ; setTimeout ( function ( ) { getMessages ( ) ; } , 5000 ) ; } ) ; } getMessages ( ) ; } ) ;
js/jquery -1.4.2.min.js
This classe are general – jQuery library .
No need to give full code of that file here .
It always available as a download package
Step 5 . PHP
I hope that most code will easy for your understanding – each function have normal name and commented .
Ok , here are all used PHP files :
index.php
<? php // set error reporting level if ( version_compare ( phpversion ( ) , " 5.3.0 " , " > = " ) == 1 ) error_reporting ( E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED ) ; else error_reporting ( E_ALL & ~ E_NOTICE ) ; require_once ('inc/db.inc.php ' ) ; require_once ('inc/login.inc.php ' ) ; require_once ( 'inc/ajx_chat.inc.php ' ) ; if ( $ _REQUEST [ ' action ' ] == ' get_last_messages ' ) { $ sChatMessages = $ GLOBALS [' AjaxChat ']->getMessages ( true ) ; require_once ( 'inc/Services_JSON.php ' ) ; $ o Json = new Services_JSON ( ) ; echo $ oJson->encode ( array ( ' messages ' => $ sChatMessages ) ) ; exit ; } // draw login box echo $ GLOBALS [' oSimpleLoginSystem ']->getLoginBox ( ) ; // draw exta necessary files echo ' < link type = " text / css " rel=" stylesheet " href= " templates/css/styles.css " />' ; echo '< script type = " text / javascript " src="js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js " ></ script >' ; echo '< script type = " text / javascript " src="js/main.js " ></ script >' ; // draw chat messages $ sChatMessages = $ GLOBALS [' AjaxChat ']-> getMessages ( ) ; // draw input form + accept inserted texts $ sChatInputForm =
' Need login before using ' ; if ( $ GLOBALS ['bLoggedIn ' ] ) { $ sChatInputForm = $ GLOBALS [' AjaxChat ']->getInputForm ( ) ; $ GLOBALS [' AjaxChat ']->acceptMessages ( ) ; } echo $ sChatMessages .
$ sChatInputForm ; ?>
inc/ajx_chat.inc.php
This is our Chat class
<? php /** * Simple ajaxy chat class */ class SimpleAjaxyChat { /** * constructor */ function SimpleAjaxyChat ( ) {} /** * Adding to DB table posted message */ function acceptMessages ( ) { $ sUsername = $ GLOBALS [ ' aLMemInfo ' ] [ ' name ' ] ; $ iUserID = ( int ) $ GLOBALS [ ' aLMemInfo' ] [ ' id ' ] ; if ( $ sUsername && isset ( $ _POST [' s_message ' ] ) && $ _POST [' s_message ' ] != '') { $ sMessage = $ GLOBALS [' MySQL ']->process_db_input($_POST [' s_message ' ] , A_TAGS_STRIP ) ; if ( $ sMessage != '') { $ GLOBALS [' MySQL ']->res ( " INSERT INTO `s_ajax_chat_messages` SET `member_id`='{$iUserID} ' , `member_name`= '{$ sUsername} ' , `message`= '{$ sMessage} ' , `when`=UNIX_TIMESTAMP ( ) " ) ; } } } /** * Return input text form */ function getInputForm ( ) { ob_start ( ) ; require_once ( ' templates/chat_input.html ' ) ; return ob_get_clean ( ) ; } /** * Return last 15 messages */ function getMessages ( $ bOnlyMessages = false ) { $ aMessages = $ GLOBALS [' MySQL ']-> getAll ( " SELECT `s_ajax_chat_messages`.* , `s_members`.`name` , UNIX_TIMESTAMP()-`s_ajax_chat_messages`.`when` AS ' diff'
FROM `s_ajax_chat_messages` INNER JOIN `s_members` ON `s_members`.`id` = `s_ajax_chat_messages`.`member_id` ORDER BY `id` DESC LIMIT 15 " ) ; $ sMessages = '' ; // collecting list of messages foreach ( $aMessages as $ iID => $ aMessage ) { $ sExStyles = $ sExJS = ''; $ iDiff = ( int ) $ aMessage [ ' diff ' ] ; if ( $iDiff < 7 ) { $ sExStyles = ' style = " display : none ; " ' ; $ sExJS = " < script > $ ('#message_{$aMessage [ 'id ' ] }').slideToggle ( ' slow ' ) ; </ script > " ; } $ sWhen = date ( " H:i:s " , $ aMessage [ ' when ' ] ) ; $ sMessages .= ' < div class = " message " id =" message_ '.$ aMessage [ 'id ' ] .

$ sWhen . ')</ span></div>' .
$ sExJS ; } if ( $bOnlyMessages ) return $ sMessages ; return '< h3 > Ajaxy Chat</h3 >< div class= " chat_main " >' .
$ sMessages . '</div > ' ; } } $ GLOBALS [' AjaxChat ' ] = new SimpleAjaxyChat ( ) ; ?>
inc/db.inc.php , inc/login.inc.php , inc/Services_JSON.php

Conclusion
Today I told you how to create own simple and good ajaxy chat application based on PHP , MySQL , jQuery and JSON a little .
You can use this material to create own scripts into your startups .
Good luck !
Enlarge By Jay Reeves , AP Protocol dictates that members of the Supreme Court must refrain from showing their emotions during the president 's State of the Union address , Chief Justice John Roberts said .
WASHINGTON  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts told an Alabama audience Tuesday that he found the atmosphere " very troubling " at January 's State of the Union Address , during which President Obama criticized the high court .
He questioned why justices attend the annual event .
" To the extent it has degenerated into a political pep rally , I 'm not sure why we 're there . "
Roberts ' remarks constituted the latest salvo in criticism between the branches tracing to the court 's January decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , which struck down a federal limit on corporate spending in elections .
Roberts was responding Tuesday to a question from a law student during an appearance at the University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa , which posted a podcast of the event on its website .
The student asked about Obama 's remarks during the Jan. 27 address as six of the nine justices sat before him .
Obama said the Citizens United decision " reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections . "
Roberts first responded , " I think anybody can criticize the Supreme Court . "
Yet he continued , " On the other hand , there is the issue of the setting , the circumstances and the decorum .
" The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up , literally surrounding the Supreme Court , cheering and hollering while the court — according to the requirements of protocol — has to sit there expressionless , I think is very troubling . "
Justice Samuel Alito was unable to stay expressionless .
During Obama 's criticism , he shook his head and apparently mouthed " not true . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that Obama is " committed to reducing the undue influence of special interests .
...
That is why he spoke out to condemn the decision and is working with Congress on a legislative response . "

Chevrolet In The News Circa 2013 - 2014
For a number of years Chevrolet in the News was a site to visit to learn about everything Chevrolet , and maybe even other brands under the General Motors umbrella .
Content is from the site 's 2013 - 2014 archived pages providing a glimpse of what this site offered its visitors ..
About
Now is an exciting time for Chevrolet .
Despite economic factors placing great strain on Chevrolet production , on dealers , and on numerous aspects of their operations , consumers will soon be seeing incredible changes at the automaker , including the new Chevrolet Volt plug - in electric vehicle and other models that will truly surprise new car buyers and push the envelop for innovation in automotive design and marketing .
At Chevrolet in the News , we are going to be blogging about everything coming out of Chevy ’s headquarters , including discussing their products , their dealers , and their strategies in the auto market .
Keep checking back to get all the Chevy new and information you ’ve been craving .
An aside :
My brother is a design snob whether it is cars , furniture , architecture , fashion , or technology .
He is always on the outlook for the newest innovation .
I remember when Salesforce in the early 2000 's began .
Salesforce was right in the midst the dramatic ascent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution as it continues to change the way people work with the use of robotics , AI , the Internet of Things , and more .
Salesforce is the world ’s # 1 Customer Relationship Management ( CRM ) platform .
Their cloud - based applications for sales , service , marketing , and more supposedly do n’t require IT experts to set up or manage .
On their website they tell interested parties to simply log in and start connecting to customers in a whole new way .
But for a large company , such as the one my bother started , you really need a Salesforce implementation consultant to improve the business processes and workflows for optimizing sales .
Needless to say , Salesforce dramatically helped his business 's productivity right away .
So much so , that in 2014 he bought a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 .
He loved this website for keeping up with Chevrolet 's new introductions .
However , as with life , situations change and evolve .
My brother is now eyeing the 2019 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 .
Whoopie !

Chevy Malibu Takes Active Approach to Passive Entry by Chevrolet in the News on April 29 , 2013
When Chevrolet designed the new 2013 Malibu , a key goal was to provide customers with benefits they would n’t normally find in a mainstream midsize sedan — such as four - door passive entry , a feature usually found only on premium vehicles .
But then , engineers added an advantage that ’s rare on any vehicles .
“ This system truly keeps the driver in full control of the car , ” said Ron Asmar , lead engineer for vehicle access at Chevrolet .
“ We investigated fully passive systems where the key fob would automatically unlock the door when a person was within a certain distance , and decided against it .
We wanted to make sure that the system prevented the car from unlocking just because the person and fob were close to it , such as when walking through the garage to take the garbage out . ”
As a result , the Malibu ’s advanced passive - entry system , an option on the Malibu LTZ , relies on a tiny button built into the car ’s door handle to unlock the vehicle .
One tap unlocks the driver ’s door ; two will unlock all four doors and the trunk .
Of course , that only happens when the Malibu ’s key fob is within about three feet of the car .
Since each fob is synched to its specific Malibu , “ there is practically no chance of false unlocks , ” according to the Bowtie brand .
“ Available passive entry on all of the doors was a feature we wanted to offer our Malibu customers , ” said Phil Carlisle , Chevrolet Malibu product manager .
“ It ’s small things like this that can go a long way in making everyday use of your vehicle easier . ”
2014 Silverado High Country Ready to Take on the Lux Trucks by Chevrolet in the News on May 5 , 2013
Chevrolet is expanding its pickup portfolio for the 2014 model year by introducing its most luxurious edition of the Silverado ever .
The 2014 Silverado High Country will enter the lineup in a crew cab configuration this fall with exclusive design cues and a choice of two new V - 8 engines .
When it arrives , customers will enjoy all the advantages built right into the redesigned Silverado , as well as the kind of accoutrements that more and more truck owners expect in a premium full - size pickup , including : Upscale front - end design enhancements like a unique chrome grille , halogen projector headlamps and body - color front and rear bumpers
Model - exclusive 20 - inch chrome wheels , wearing P275/55R20 all - season tires
Chrome body - side moldings , door handles and exterior mirrors
Premium cabin cues such as heated and cooled front bucket seats swathed in perforated leather
Chevrolet ’s MyLink infotainment and connectivity system with an eight - inch touchscreen
A significant audio upgrade , courtesy of Bose
Technologies like front and rear park assist Owners can then pick from a pair of V - 8 engines from the new Ecotec3 portfolio :
The standard motivator is a 5.3 - liter unit that makes 355 horsepower and still rings up 23 mpg on the highway , while those looking for more punch can move up to a 6.2 - liter V - 8 ( that ’s still waiting on its official power and efficiency specs ) .
“ High Country will be the top model in the Silverado lineup , with a higher level of premium features and materials with a rich , Western - themed appearance , ” said Maria Rohrer , Silverado marketing director .
“ But at the same time , High Country is 100 percent Chevy truck , with the capability and dependability customers have relied on for more than 95 years . ”
Chevy Camaro ZL1 Scores as 2013 Automobile All - Star by Chevrolet in the News on May 21 , 2013
While the upcoming 2014 Chevy Camaro Z/28 is getting plenty of buzz , the 2013 Chevy Camaro ZL1 is getting plenty of acclaim — and a spot on this year ’s Automobile All - Stars roster , presented by the long - lived enthusiast publication Automobile magazine .
In writing for the magazine , Michael Jordan ( no , not that one ) raved about the ZL1 ’s supercharged V - 8 engine , which relies on 580 horsepower and 556 lb. - ft. of torque to deliver the fastest production Camaro ever .
The tale of the tape here includes a 0 - 60 time of 4 seconds , a top speed of 184 mph , the ability to cover the quarter mile in less than 12 seconds , and an elite Nürburgring lap time of 7:41.27 .
But what truly elevates the ZL1 above the competition is its road manners .
As Jordan further noted , “ … the miracle of the Camaro ZL1 is your ability to control it .
It ’s not refinement we ’re talking about ( although it indeed is wonderfully refined ) , but instead the ability to command 580 hp and make use of so much muscle in appropriate circumstances . ”
Also coming in for praise were the Camaro ’s launch control system , adaptive dampers , massive Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires and sticker price .
After all , with an MSRP of $ 54,350 , the Camaro ZL1 is a veritable bargain compared to more expensive foreign sports cars that can’t keep up with its incredible performance .
The BMW M6 Coupe , for example , offers less power , a lower top speed and slower 0 - 60 time , all while costing more than twice as much as the ZL1 .
That ’s not even mentioning the fact that the Camaro ZL1 was designed from the outset to allow open - air driving , with significant chassis bracing and an available soft top that , according to Chevy , helps serve up “ a convertible designed to preserve nearly all the acceleration , road - holding and performance capabilities of the Camaro ZL1 coupe .
2014 Corvette Crowned Pace Car King at Indy 500 by Chevrolet in the News on May 2 , 2013
The all - new2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray will find itself in a very familiar position on May 24 , 2013 : ahead of the pack as the pace car of this year ’s Indy 500 .
It will be a record - setting 12th time that a Corvette has had the honors in Indianapolis , where the Greatest Spectacle in Racing will see its 97th running .
As is usually the case , the 2014 Corvette Stingray will need just minor mods to pace the race , too , and those come only in the form of track - mandated safety equipment and strobe lights .
Of course , that ’s primarily because the next - gen Corvette will brandish 450 horsepower and 450 lb. - ft. of torque — in its entry model — courtesy of an equally new and advanced 6.2 - liter LT1 V - 8 engine .
Said motivation delivers 0 - 60 mpg times of under 4 seconds and what will certainly be an Indy - friendly top speed .
Yet because the 2014 Corvette ’s engine also features technologies like direct injection , continuously variable valve timing and cylinder deactivation , the car is expected to achieve up to 26 mpg on the highway .
Other highlights of the 2014 Corvette Stingray include a seven - speed manual transmission with Active Rev Matching , a five - position Drive Mode Selector , a carbon - fiber hood and roof panel ( on coupes ) , LED accent lighting and an available Z51 Performance Package that adds an electronic limited - slip differential , dry - sump oil system , aero upgrades and more .
Now the car comes standard with instant Indy 500 cred , too .
“ It is an honor to help inaugurate the all - new Corvette Stingray at the hallowed Brickyard and further the legacy between Chevrolet and the Indianapolis 500 , ” said Jim Campbell , GM vice president of Performance Vehicles and Motorsports .
“ The 2014 Corvette Stingray ’s performance was influenced by racing , making this prestigious assignment even more fitting . ”
The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray is expected to go on sale this fall with an MSRP that starts at $ 51,995 for coupe models and $ 56,995 for convertibles ( destination fee included ) .
2014 Stingray Starting Point : $ 51,000 by Chevrolet in the News on April 26 , 2013
The stunning 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray , first introduced earlier this year at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit , will go on sale this summer with an MSRP that opens at $ 51,000 for the coupe and $ 56,000 for the convertible .
This means that even though the Stingray was completely redesigned for the new model year , it continues to offer Corvette ’s signature combination of velocity and value .
Consider :
The entry - model Stingray will holster a brand - new 6.2 - liter V - 8 engine that delivers about 450 horsepower and 450 lb. - ft. of torque ; the base model Audi R8 has two fewer liters of displacement , 20 less horsepower , and a top torque marque that ’s more than 100 lb. - ft. below that of the Corvette .
Yet it still sells for more than double the price of a Stingray , but Stingray owners enjoy :
Two transmission choices , including a seven - speed manual transmission with Active Rev Matching or a six - speed paddle - shifting automatic
A five - position Drive Mode system that can tailor up to 12 different vehicle attributes for optimum performance
Weight - saving components like a standard carbon - fiber hood ( on all models ) , a carbon - fiber roof panel ( on coupes ) , magnesium - framed seating , and an aluminum body frame that ’s 99 lbs .
lighter than the previous structure while also being 57 percent stiffer
Advanced lighting , with high - intensity discharge ( HID ) and LED illumination
Dual eight - inch infotainment screens , the next - gen Chevy MyLink system , and a nine - speaker Bose audio system
For convertible models , a new fully electronic top that can be operated remotely with the key fob “ The 2014 Corvette Stingray perfectly embodies Chevrolet ’s mission to deliver more than expected for our customers , ” said Chris Perry , vice president , Chevrolet marketing .
“ The Corvette Stingray delivers a combination of performance , design and technology that very few manufacturers can match , and none can even come close for $ 52,000 . ”

Néstor Kirchner , former president of Argentina , revealed in an interview with Oliver Stone for the director ’s documentary “ South of the Border ” that former US president George W. Bush was convinced that war was the way to grow the US economy .
Here is the video :
And here is the transcript of Kirchner ’s account of the conversation at a summit in Monterrey , Mexico , in January , 2004 :
‘ Kirchner : I said that a solution to the problems right now , I told Bush , is a Marshall Plan .
And he grew angry .
He said the Marshall Plan is a crazy idea of the Democrats .
He said the best way to revitalize the economy is war .
And that the United States has grown stronger with war .
Stone : War , he said that ?
Kirchner : He said that .
Those were his exact words .
Stone :
Is he suggesting that South America go to war ?
Kirchner : Well , he was talking about the United States : ‘ The Democrats had been wrong .
All of the economic growth of the United States has been encouraged by wars . ’
He said it very clearly . ‘
Zaid Jilani at Think Progress points out that job creation under ‘ war president ’
Bush was in fact anemic and the whole house of cards collapsed toward the end of his tenure .
You wonder who else among the Republican elite fell for Bush ’s typical piece of stupidity re : war= growth .
It all depends on lots of other factors .
If you borrow the money to fight the war and pay interest on it and you get no booty to speak of , then the war could ruin you , as happened to many European regimes in the early modern and modern period .
But even more outrageous is the Aztec - like willigness to rip the beating heart out of a sacrificial victim for the sake of an chimerical prosperity !
Here is what was happening in Iraq around the time that Bush was boasting to Kirchner , according to Informed Comment :

Advertisement A notorious National Lottery millionaire from Norfolk says he wants to work as a dustman again after losing his fortune .
Michael Carroll , of Downham Market , was 19 when he won £ 9.7 m in November 2002 .
Mr Carroll , dubbed the " Lotto lout " by the tabloids because of his life of petty crime , collected his jackpot still wearing an electronic tag .
Veolia Environmental Services , which runs the bin service , said : " We are not recruiting for operatives in the area . "
Life and times of Michael Carroll November 2002 : Mr Carroll wins £ 9.7 m jackpot while under electronic tagging order for being drunk and disorderly December 2002 :
He is fined £ 1,300 for dodging two £ 5 train fares June 2003 : Fined £ 12,000 for claiming nearly £ 330 in Jobseeker 's Allowance while working as a dustman July 2004 : Jailed for five months for breaching a court order February 2006 : Sentenced to nine months in prison after pleading guilty to affray January 2007 : Given a two - year supervised community order for abusing train travellers Mr Carroll 's house in Swaffham was recently put up for sale .

Since his appointment as Canadian Heritage minister in 2008 , James Moore has carefully crafted an image as " Canada 's iPod Minister . "
Young , bilingual , and tech - savvy , Moore has expressed regular support for the benefits of the Internet and is always ready with a quick " tweet " for his many followers .
Yet as my op - ed in the Hill Times notes ( HT version ( sub required ) , homepage version ) , according to the scuttlebutt throughout the copyright community , Moore may be less iPod and more iPadlock .
As the government readies its much - anticipated copyright package , Moore is said to be pressing for a virtual repeat of Bill C - 61 , the most anti-consumer copyright proposal in Canadian history .
Moore 's about - face on copyright will come as a surprise to those who have heard his enthusiasm for new technology and the Internet .
In June 2009 , Moore told Industry Minister Tony Clement 's Digital Economy conference that " the old way of doing things is over .
These things are all now one .
And it 's great .
And it 's never been better .
And we need to be enthusiastic and embrace this things . "
Those comments were quickly followed by the national copyright consultation that generated thousands of responses , the majority of which called on the government to abandon the C - 61 approach in favour of copyright rules that struck a better balance between the interests of creators and consumers .
In recent months , Moore seemed to support a more consumer friendly approach .
When NDP MP Charlie Angus introduced a private member 's bill last month to extend the private copying levy to devices such as iPods , Moore was quick to lambaste the proposal as the iTax .
Heralded as an " iPod Freedom Fighter , " Moore proclaimed the bill a serious threat to consumers .
Days later , Moore reserved judgment on the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications broadcast policy decision that opened the door to a new fee - for - carriage system for local broadcast signals .
Once again , Moore adopted a pro-consumer position , indicating that his view on the decision would depend upon its consumer impact .
Moore 's posturing won him few friends in the Canadian cultural community , with some suggesting that the Canadian Heritage minister should spend less time focusing on his iPod and more on Canadian artists .
The copyright bill may still be several weeks away , but reintroducing Bill C - 61 with only minor tweaks – a bit more flexibility for recording television shows or transferring content from one format to another – would leave in place the core provisions of the bill that generated widespread discontent .
These include U.S. - style legal protection for digital locks known as anti-circumvention legislation and a rejection of the flexible fair dealing approach that attracted considerable support during the copyright consultation as a balanced , technology - neutral solution .
What is most surprising with this path is that there are solutions that would toughen Canadian copyright law and provide the flexibility that business , consumers , and creators say they need .
For example , virtually everyone agrees that Canada should implement the World Intellectual Property Organization 's Internet treaties .
Yet there is considerable flexibility in how those treaties are implemented .
Indeed , just last week India , home to a thriving movie and technology market , tabled legislation designed to bring it into conformity with those treaties .
The Indian approach – much like the earlier Canadian Bill C - 60 – sought to maintain the copyright balance that exists offline in the online world .
Similarly , a growing number of countries – led by the United States – have adopted flexible fair dealing or fair use provisions that benefit creators , business , and consumers .
Flexible fair dealing based on existing Canadian jurisprudence would ensure a fair - for - all , not a free - for - all .
Last week , the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage heard about the need to target bad actors .
Canadian law has many tools to do so , with major record labels having pressured some peer - to - peer sites offline ( such as QuebecTorrent ) and gearing up to challenge others in Canadian courts ( isoHunt ) .
Recent experience indicates that the copyright bill is n't final until tabled , but after spending the summer of 2008 fighting Bill C - 61 and the summer of 2009 revisiting copyright reform as part of the national consultation , copyright is unquestionably on the public radar screen .
Canadians had been promised a forward - looking , technology neutral approach , but they may soon find that someone has hit the delete button on those promises .
I 'll be posting more in the coming days about what people can do – in the short term , I 've launched a new Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook page ( distinct from the group ) that can be used to keep current and learn more about what can be done as events unfold .
Ed Balls offered to stand aside so his wife Yvette Cooper could run for the Labour leadershp
Labour leadership contender Ed Balls became the first former cabinet minister to unequivocally come out and say the Iraq War was " wrong " .
In an interview with The Daily Telegraph , the former children 's secretary said the decision to join the invasion in 2003 was an " error " for which Britain had paid a heavy price .
" It was a mistake .
On the information we had , we should n't have prosecuted the war .
We should n't have changed our argument from international law to regime change in a non-transparent way , " he said .
" It was an error for which we as a country paid a heavy price , and for which many people paid with their lives .
Saddam Hussein was a horrible man , and I am pleased he is no longer running Iraq .
But the war was wrong . "
Mr Balls , who was an adviser to Gordon Brown in the Treasury at the time of the invasion , said he had warned his boss it was a mistake to try to blame the French for the break down of international negotiations to find a peaceful resolution .
" I was in the room when a decision was taken that we would say it was that dastardly Frenchman , Jacques Chirac , who had scuppered it , " he said .
" It was n't really true , you know .
I said to Gordon : ' I know why you 're doing this , but you 'll regret it . '
France is a very important relationship for us . "
His comments will be seen as an attempt to distance himself from one of the most controversial legacies of the former Labour government .
Despite his reputation as Mr Brown 's closest lieutenant , he insisted they had often argued .
He said : " I had more blazing rows with him than anyone .
You had to do that sometimes to shut Gordon up . "
Mr Balls also confirmed that he had offered to stand aside to allow his wife , former work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper , to run for the leadership , but she had declined .

Also see : Ceara 's Season , Adam Lynch 's interview with Ceara Sturgis ' family
When Veronica Rodriguez opened Wesson Attendance Center 's Yearbook on Friday , she did n't see her lesbian daughter Ceara Sturgis pictured or named in the senior - portrait section of the yearbook .
The latest blow came after a long battle with school officials to include a photo of her daughter wearing a tuxedo in the school 's 2010 yearbook .
She called the Jackson Free Press Sunday with her disappointing news .
" They did n't even put her name in it , " Sturgis ' mother Veronica Rodriguez said of the yearbook 's senior section .
" I was so furious when she told me about it .
Ceara started crying and I told her to suck it up .
Is that not pathetic for them to do that ?
Yet again , they have crapped on her and made her feel alienated . "
Sturgis ' baby picture did appear in pages following the portrait pages with her name beside it , Rodriguez told the Jackson Free Press .
She was also pictured several times in other sections of the yearbook , in soccer - team photographs , National Honor Society and other sections .
" If she was n't in those groups , she would n't be there , " her mother said .
A photograph her mother took of her in her tuxedo appears on a page purchased by her family .
" I do n't think there was anything they could do about that ; I purchased that , " Rodriguez said of the bought senior page .
Sturgis and her mother commissioned the Mississippi ACLU to protest officials '
October 2009 decision not to allow Sturgis ' photo to appear in the senior yearbook because she chose to wear a tuxedo instead of a dress .
The ACLU wrote an October letter demanding officials use Sturgis ' submitted photo in the yearbook , but Copiah County School District officials refused .
Still , Rodriguez said she expected her daughter to at least be named on the senior page , perhaps with a " photo unavailable " box .
What she discovered on Friday , when the yearbook came in , was that the school had refused to acknowledge her entirely on the senior pages .
" It 's like she 's nobody there , even though she 's gone to school there for 12 years .
...
They 've got kids in the book that have been busted for drugs .
There 's even a picture of one of the seniors who dropped out of school , " Rodriguez said .
" I do n't get it .
Ceara is a top student .
Why would they do this to her ? "
Copiah County School District spokeswoman Martha Traxler refused to comment on the school 's reason for excluding Sturgis from the senior page , and referred all questions to Copiah County attorney Olen Bryant Jr. Bryant did not immediately return calls .
Last year , the school gave no indication that it would withhold Sturgis ' information , but said it had legal justification to not run Sturgis ' photo .
" We have had our legal counsel research the validity of the position of the School District on this matter , " Copiah County Superintendent Ricky Clopton said in the statement .
" We are informed by counsel that this exact issue has been litigated in federal court .
The decisions of the federal courts completely support the policy of the district in this regard .
It is the desire of the Copiah County School District to inform , first , the patrons of the district , and second , all other interested parties , that its position is not arbitrary , capricious or unlawful , but is based upon sound educational policy and legal precedent . "
ACLU legal director Kristy L. Bennett said the district referred to a 2004 settlement of Youngblood v. School Board of Hillsborough County , Fla .
In that case , former Robinson High School principal Kevin McCarthy refused to alter the school 's senior photo dress code that required female students to wear a scoop - necked drape , which ruled out the possibility of student Nicole Youngblood posing in a suit .
Youngblood sued the Hillsborough County School Board that year , claiming the rule was discriminatory .
The resulting settlement allowed seniors 14 days to appeal the dress code prior to photos .
ACLU attorneys maintain that the Youngblood case made no official reference to the student 's sexuality , however .
Shannon Minter , an attorney who represented Youngblood in the 2004 case , said Copiah had chosen a poor foundation upon which to build an argument , considering the school settled with the plaintiff .
" The school agreed to settle the case and changed their policy .
That 's the only reason we dropped our appeal , " Minter said .
" These policies are blatantly unlawful .
Any court of appeals in this country would likely find such policy to be unlawful now . "
The ACLU would not confirm if it planned any legal action on the school 's decision at this time .
Rodriguez said she expected the district to attempt to downplay her daughter 's presence , but not to leave her out of the senior section altogether .
She said officials ' position runs counter to the more accepting opinions of Sturgis ' classmates .
" She basically grew up here , but she feels so isolated .
And it 's not the students .
The students love and accept her , " Rodriguez said .
" The kids even nominated her for prom queen , but she ducked out , knowing the officials would never let her be prom queen . "
CORRECTION , April 29 , 2010 : Thanks to a watchful reader , the Jackson Free Press discovered today that reporter Adam Lynch originally misinterpreted Veronica Rodriguez 's phone call about her daughter 's yearbook .
The above story originally reported that the yearbook contained no mention or photos of Sturgis or her accolades , but we confirmed from her mother today that she is pictured in sections other than the senior - portrait section .
We have edited the above story to reflect this fact , and added the above bolded paragraph based on our conversation with Sturgis ' mother today .
We have requested a copy of the yearbook , and will update this story further if needed once we receive it .
We apologize for the errors and thank the reader who pointed out the mischaracterization .

ID 157429 Comment Stuff like this just really pisses me off , especially since , if true , they put kids who 've dropped out and kids who 've been busted selling drugs in the yearbook but wo n't put one of the smartest kids in the school , in the yearbook - just because she wanted to wear a tuxedo in her picture .

ID 157439 Comment Well make sure you keep calling !
When people do things like this , they are never available for comment .
They wo n't even give a " No comment ! "
That makes me even madder in a way than what they did .
They run and hide when exposed for abiding by their moral code .
They could at least come and say " We believe homosexuality is immoral and we do n't want to condone it by publishing one its apostles in our school - sanctioned publication , " which everyone knows is what they are thinking .
They just run and hide !
Cowards !!
You 're supposed to stand up for Jesus , not run in shame !
You 're hypocrites as well as cowards !

The purpose of the yearbook is to commemorate your school experience , and is especially important for High School Seniors .
Speaking as a former yearbook editor , this is a deliberate injustice !
Not only is this disrespectful to Ceara , but also to her classmates , and all other GLBT students , faculty , and staff in that school !
Trust me , she is NOT alone !
The editors , the sponsors , and everyone in higher authority at that school should be ashamed of their behavior .
Instead of celebrating and respecting diversity , they initialize someone ’s entire existence and replace it with a clear picture of their own ignorance .

The bigotry displayed by these so - called adults towards this courageous young woman is unconscionable .
My lesbian daughter was fully supported in her request to be photographed in a tux ; she felt a drape gown and pearls was a misrepresentation .
She never misrepresented herself before --- why should she be forced to then ?
She also attended her prom with her tux - wearing girlfriend -- without incident .
As a result , she had a happy end to her high school career , which she deserved , as do all children .
We live in a suburban community north of San Francisco , so obviously that made a difference ... but it should n't .

the teachers that sponsored graduation expected you to follow those rules .
it stands to reason if a student at this school wore a ratty t- shirt for their picture it would have been excluded also .
individuality is n't a real focus in secondary education .
plus " teen in twilight tee excluded from yearbook " does n't get much press .

It 's shameful that a school should endeavour to hurt any student in this way .
Disappearing a student ?
You 've got to be kidding .
( Fortunately , they 've been pretty ineffectual , thanks to the internet ... )
Ceara , you are awesome for standing up .
It will be easier for other kids because of you .

ID 157464 Comment Paul , as the founder and editor of the Jackson Free Press , I can tell you that many Mississippians are NOT settling for being backward or regressive in any way .
You would n't believe the progressive movement going on in this state right now -- which includes many progressive people of faith who are supportive of gay rights .
Of course , the national media do not tend to report those things about us , so the story does n't get out .
They blow it up when we do stupid things ( like in the recent gay teenager scandals ) , which is fine , but they seldom balance it by noticing our progress and the very real work on the ground here on racial reconciliation and other human - rights , social - justice issues .
But that 's OK .
We will keep up the good fight , and this newspaper will keep bringing whatever needs to be brought to light , regardless of what any political party or special interest group thinks about it , and without regard to what a woefully un- diverse national media thinks about it .
That is not to be defensive ; it is to tell you that you do not know the whole story about this state because no one is telling you .

This is crazy , folks .
It is also interesting that some of these same folks who aided in the decision to keep the young kid out of her yearbook are the same ones who will ignore the abuse of children .
Why do n't they help with the movement against the Pope who has hidden so much of the Church 's sexual abusive history against young males and females ?
This would seem like a better cause .
Just thinking .

ID 157473 Comment @sinkingship -- The issue here is freedom of gender expression , not whether one has a clean or torn shirt .
The first is about discrimination --- the latter merely petty .
Girls are not required to wear dresses to school ; even in schools where uniforms are required girls wear pants .
So why is a girl required to wear a dress for a senior photo ?
Many girls ( including my own daughter ) are not comfortable in dresses , and never wear one , so to be forced to do something to fit what is basically a social construct ( really , what difference does it make or why is it anyone 's business if a girl want 's to dress in more masculine attire , or a boy in more feminine ? ) , and that misrepresents who they are is inane .
And while individuality may not be a focus in secondary education ... perhaps it should be more so then there would be wider acceptance of diversity , and more children learning to think for themselves , as this young woman does .
It takes an incredible amount of courage to go against the norm --- a norm that is in place to demean , diminish and promote bigotry , prejudice , and intolerance .

Remember when women wore " male " neckties and " male " tuxedos to include the satin strip up the side .
I wonder if any of the women , responsible for this decision , wear pants or must they have on their peticoats , their long dress / skirt , and ruffled panties to make sure that no one mistakes them for a male when posing for a picture ?

ID 157481 Comment @sparkysteph50 - and sometimes a dress is just a dress .
so applaud her for making her statement ; part of the freedom of expression or speech is the consequences you may face as a result .
for the picture she was required to wear a certain outfit .
that 's the issue .
you ca n't distort the facts to " suit " your argument .
i , like most people , attended high school and there was a dress code for senior pics appearing in the yearbook and for the graduation ceremony .
if she wants to exercise her rights in defiance of that then fine .
something as trivial as a yearbook should be immaterial .

i'm sure it 's prominently displayed in your home .

ID 157489 Comment sinkingship : I do applaud her .
But the fact that freedom of speech and expression may have certain consequences does n't negate the fact that the school took discriminatory action against her , singled her out , and negated her high school existence based on an arbitrary , outdated " rule " that has no place in our current society .
Not only that girls must wear dresses , but that they must not wear tuxes , or appear masculine or gender variant , or be gay ... all of which this young woman is .
This is called DISCRIMINATION , not distorting facts to suit an argument .
A dress is only a dress if it 's something you WANT to wear .
Just because the " rules " exist , and existed when you or I graduated ( for me , that was ' 72 , and we were allowed to wear our regular clothes ) does n't make them right .
I 'd like to add , having 3 kids who are all young adults now --- I 've PAID for each and every one of those year books , and they are not cheap .
So why should n't I , or my child , have a say in how they are represented ?
No one has the right to determine what is important to another .
And you and I can agree to disagree .
But discrimination is discrimination .

ID 157500 Comment Okay ... you guys have apparently not picked up one of these year books .
I have , and Ceara is infact in the year book !
The only thing that seems to be missing is her " Senior picture " .
However , her baby pictures are in there , the who's who has her picture , her band picture , soccer team photo , prom photos and a " senior page " of her was allowed .
Note also , that she is in fact shown in a tux in both the " senior page " and prom photos .
She is most definitely included in the yearbook .
Maybe it was wrong to exclude her senior picture from the spread ... but there 's no real evidence of discrimination .
If the officials had allowed a straight female to wear a tux , but not Ceara ... it would shine bigger than anything .
But there was no straight females in tuxes .
It just seems like southern fried tradition has claimed another poor soul in the bible belt .
AND !
Ceara quite possibly could have had a choice to just do a face shot ( which I was allowed to do for my year book ) , showing her in neither a tux or a dress ... and still gotten her photo in the senior spread .
Was n't her choice for a tux based on just being comfortable with what she was wearing for the photo ?
( that 's what some of her interviews say when this story first came up . )
A face shot can be done with just a t - shirt , which is more comfortable than a tux in my opinion .
Back to my point ... either the article or the source for the article has made it seem like the year book has absolutely no trace of Ceara what - so - ever ... when it does .
I do n't know if this is a writers oversight , or a source 's lie ; but it should be noted somewhere that she 's in the yearbook , being acknowledged as a student at that high school ( and a senior ) , but JUST her senior picture is missing .
And its not like the family did n't already know about her senior picture not being published in the year book .
Were they not informed , back in October of 09 , about the school 's positions and the actions they were taking ?
Why is this article and the protests just now coming up .
The year book is out , and there is n't a chance of changing what 's happened .
Protests , from what I know of , happen when a change CAN be made .

Some interesting things about Copiah County School District : Wesson Attendance Center continues to meet the state standards for skills on the MCT tests .
Another school in Copiah County School District , Crystal Springs Middle School has been a failing school for three years .
They have lost 4 teachers since August because of the poor support and working conditions .
Yet the school district has chosen to support the Wesson Attendance Center .
Where is the support and help for the school and teachers in Crystal Springs ?
What are we telling our students when we exclude someone ?
We show them that bigotry and ignorance are okay .
We show them that being different is wrong .
We show them that adults are the powerful ones and they have the control .
Where would the world be without people who are different ?
It is ridiculous that the school and county officials have been so narrow minded and cruel .
The white school gets the attention while the black school is failing .

ID 157537 Comment Bozeman , you would be bringing up some good points if it were n't for the fact that wearing the drape and tux are not rules .
There is no mention of it in the student code of conduct , nor is it a requirement for getting a picture taken .
She did not break any rules by wearing the tux , she broke with tradition .
There is no reason to punish her for breaking with tradition , and an archaic one at that .
Really , the school district had more important matters to pay attention to , and the bible quoting religious principal at Wesson Attendance Center decided not to allow her to break tradition .
The Superintendent is his buddy , so the district picked this fight to fight .
Meanwhile the other schools in the district are not doing well , and are continuing to lose teachers .
It 's ridiculous that they treated a student like this , and it 's even more ridiculous that they have n't been handling their other business .

ID 157540 Comment Joshua , I completely agree with your comment .
If the school had allowed a straight woman in a tux or not have included Ceara 's picture in a dress ( turned in on time ) this situation would be VERY different .
But , I 'm willing to bet , that even a straight man who wanted to be in a white , double breasted tux , with a windsor knot ( instead of a bow tie ) would not have been allowed in that senior spread .
Rules are definitely rules .
Just because she happens to be gay , and not following the rules , does n't mean that the school is discriminating when they deny her request .
And it can be clearly seen in the " backwards pageant " ( mentioned in previous interviews ) and Ceara 's tux photo's that did make the year book , that the school is not against " cross- dressing " .
They just do not allow it for the FORMAL senior portrait spread , and that rule has been the same for longer than most of us have been alive .
Of course it is my assumption that the school has been around that long ... but it CAN be seen in other schools that have .
Author zomgabunny Date 2010-04-29T21:53:08-06:00
ID 157549 Comment I read about this story today in The Advocate ; it 's national news now that Ceara 's senior picture was deleted from the high school yearbook .
I am taking the time to write to the Jackson Free Press from my home in Colorado .
What a petty , cruel thing for the school to do .
They are supposed to provide a role model and adult guidance for the students , and what they have demonstrated instead is that childish hatred , bigotry and intolerance are alive and well in the district .
Ceara 's courage and example to the American people will long outlive the prom and the yearbook since the nation has clearly awakened to the need to expand protections to gay people nationwide .
Best wishes to Ceara , her family , and her supporters , especially those in Mississippi .

It is sobering to look at the " Seniors 2010 " pages ( five of them total ) and see no reference to her whatsoever .
It is clear why she and her family were so upset .
I 'm not going to post those pages because iother young people are pictured and named on the pages .
On the up side , the page her mother bought with a collage of photos and messages from her and " Mawwaw & Pawpaw " are very fun and touching .

After the Constance situation , Mississippi is challenging this again ?
When will they grow up ?
I suppose I 'll see in a couple of years .
I 've planned to wear a tuxedo at least to my senior prom , if not in my photos , for a while .
Dresses make me feel awkward and fake .
It 's just not me .
Anyone that knows me knows I 'll go out in mid-summer wearing jeans and a jacket .
All I can really say is , Mississippi really needs a wake - up call .
It 's absolutely ridiculous what high schools have come to .
I 've had my fair share of butting heads with my school .
I 'm bisexual and participate actively in Day of Silence , something that is rarely heard of in Mississippi .
I colour my hair blue , almost never seen in this podunk state .
I 'm an extremely friendly person and am friends with most of my peers , have had fantastic grades since kindergarten , participate actively in many school activities , so why is it that schools across Mississippi are singling out individuals like this ?
We 've done nothing wrong .
So we 're girls that like girls .
So what ?
Why should they care ?
And why oh why is a tux on the female body so WRONG ?
For most that choose , they feel better , more real , in the tux than a scoop - necked dress .
Just because we 're female does n't mean we 're feminine .
Ceara , I applaud you for standing up for what you are and for refusing to let a petty school full of bigotry change you .
These are turbulent times for people such as you and I , but if this is what it takes , teens being subjugated for who they are , to change society to be more accepting , so be it .
Because in the end , it does n't matter what some school officials think .
You have your individuality and you were rigid to their discriminatory warfare techniques , thus you kept your personality and sent a message saying that you wo n't be changed by bigots in society .
I 'm proud of you and hope to follow strong in your footsteps .
It may take years , but soon enough , people like you and I will make this society accepting for generations to come .
Keep on kicking , and never back down .
Just be yourself and the rest will follow .
Fight for what you believe in !

The priest was moved to another part of the world and I 'm sure his history would repeat itself :
Another place , another time and another person ( young girls and boys ) .
Over my many years in this life , I have had interactions and some real meaniful friendships with gays , lesbians , christains , non-christains , protestants , atheist , agnostics and ect . :
These were good folks with good heart and many did great things .
Knowing the religious and political climate we live in , it is no doubt that you run into problems trying to get to your bottom line .
The world can be unrelenting to one who gives a challenge to santa , the easter bunny , and the cross - All in the same beath .
What I got out of your message was a yearning for the protection and safety of those who are unable to defend / protect themselves : Fairness and equality for all members of our society and without limits based on race , creed , color or sexual perference .
This is the type of world that many of us yearn for .

Very sad how this was even allowed in the " land of the free " , especially in a highschool !
I hope she feels ' free ' to sue and wins .. not only is it defaming ( because the school has acknowledged their dislike of her as a person , by excluding her name and image from her year book , as if she was not a part of the student body , based solely on the fact that she , being a female , wore a tux ( made for a male essentially ) for her yearbook picture , but this is malicious and a damaging misrepresentation of her ...

Intel Corp. announced today that it is shipping to equipment manufacturers its 25 - nanometer ( nm ) NAND flash memory chip , which doubles the capacity of its previous 34nm chip .
Intel announced its new chip , which can hold 8 GB of data , last February .
Manufacturers of solid state drives ( SSD ) , USB sticks and removable and embedded memory cards put multiple NAND flash chips on a board along with multiple I /O paths to create mass storage devices .
The new chip , manufactured by Intel 's and Micron Technology 's joint venture company , IMFT , measures 0.35 - in. by 0.74 - in. , but it can hold 7,000 photos , eight hours of video or 2,000 songs .
The 25nm NAND flash chip is made up of many small 64 G bit NAND chips .
IMFT 's latest lithography technology makes it possible to build products using half as many chips as is possible with the current 34nm lithography technology , allowing for smaller , higher - density designs .
For example , a 256GB SSD can be built with 32 of the 8GB NAND flash dies instead of 64 dies ; a 32 GB smartphone needs just four dies ; and a 16GB flash card requires only two .
The change also cuts the overall cost to produce mobile products .

( CNN ) --
When Wade McGilberry bought a new baseball video game that offered a cash prize to the first player to pitch a perfect game , his wife urged him to skip work and stay home to play .
He did n't listen to her , but things worked out anyway .
On his fifth try with " Major League Baseball 2K10 , " McGilberry achieved the elusive feat and won $ 1 million in 2 K Sports ' Perfect Game contest .
He used Kenshin Kawakami of the Atlanta Braves to record a perfect game -- allowing no batter to reach base -- against the New York Mets .
His entry , recorded on March 2 , was just verified by 2 K Sports .
McGilberry , 23 , of Mobile , Alabama , said he played the demo for a couple of weeks before the game 's release and picked up the game at midnight the day it came out .
His wife , Katy , fully supported his efforts to win the cash prize .
" She told me , if I was going to be serious about this , that I should stay home [ from work ] and play the game , " said McGilberry , a 401 ( k ) record - keeper .
" I decided to go to work anyway . "
McGilberry said that once he got home from work that evening , he immediately turned on his Xbox 360 , determined to play until he completed the challenge .
An hour and a half later , he had done it .
He said he had to hit the reset button only 5 times .
McGilberry believes there is a lot more skill required to play " 2K10 , " which uses avatars of real major leaguers , than just button mashing .
A player must choose each pitch but also know his pitcher 's strengths and each batter 's weaknesses .
There were some tense moments in his perfect game when McGilberry thought he was going to have to start over .
" The very first batter hit the ball up the middle off my pitcher .
It deflected to the shortstop , who threw him out , " he said .
" One guy in the eighth inning hit the ball to the warning track . "
McGilberry got to a full count on only one batter .
His strategy was to pitch to the corners , keep it low and not throw hard .
He said he got a lot of ground - ball outs that way .
" When I got the final out , I was waiting for something to pop up , " McGilberry said .
" I kept waiting for the game announcers to say something .
I was worried I had screwed something up . "
The confirmation code produced by a perfect game appeared on his screen , and McGilberry immediately called his wife .
" She tried to be the voice of reason , " he said .
" She told me that probably some college student who played all day got the perfect game before me . "
The rules of the contest stated that the game had to be recorded with a timestamp and that entries would not be judged until the contest ended May 1 .
2 K Sports received several dozen submissions but said McGilberry 's was the first to meet all the criteria to win the $ 1 million .
Mike Rhinehart , senior product manager with 2 K Sports , and Greg Thomas , president of 2 K Sports , surprised McGilberry at home this week with a giant check to commemorate his achievement .
McGilberry said it had been four or five years since he played a baseball video game .
He and his wife have big plans for their winnings .
" We are going to pay off the house , get our finances in order , " he said .
" We are also going to start a family , which we had planned to do once our finances were together .
They are just together sooner than we thought . "

Description
The second series of sixteen collectable minifigures continued the traditions of the first , by introducing new minifigure roles to LEGO and upgrading some classic ones .
Series 2 was packaged in blind , blue polybags but again featured a barcode system that inadvertently helped collectors to identify the contents before buying - the product was too close to completion for LEGO to be able to alter it .
Each polybag contained the minifigure , a selection of accessories , the distinctive black display stand , and a paper checklist .
Notes
This is currently the only series to not have a minifigure wielding a sword .
This series introduced thirteen new parts , and used three from the previous series .
This Minifigures series has a gender ratio of 3:13 .

Logon scripts are passé .
By submitting my Email address I confirm that I have read and accepted the Terms of Use and Declaration of Consent .
Enjoy this article as well as all of our content , including E - Guides , news , tips and more .
Their text - based configurations are ripe for syntax errors , the " everything for everyone " targeting they employ requires special coding if you want certain users to get special settings , and the fact that they only run at logon means you 're never really sure when they 've fully deployed .
Problematic beasts that they are , logon scripts just are n't really necessary anymore these days -- at least that 's what I wrote in my last article on eliminating logon scripts with Group Policy preferences ( GPPs ) .
There I presented three common configurations that not long ago were only possible with logon scripts : configuring drive mappings , creating printer connections , and customizing applications for users .
Five GPPs you must implement right now While not everyone takes advantage of them as much as they could , Group Policy preferences have a lot to offer the Windows domain .
Check out Greg 's previous article where he shares the top five GPPs that every admin should use .
That article gave you the step - by - step process to yank printer assignments out of your logon scripts .
Using Group Policy preferences , you can accomplish the same task , but in a much more manageable fashion .
In this follow - up , I want to show you how to get that same manageability when you 're customizing user applications .
To begin , think for a minute about the application behaviors that you hate in your environment .
Does WinZip annoy you when it opens up in Wizard Mode instead of Classic Mode ?
What about WS_FTP 's restriction on only allowing a single instance to run at a time ?
Do you hate it when Adobe Acrobat Reader launches inside your browser to view a PDF instead of just running inside its own window ?
You can adjust these and many other application behaviors by tweaking their registry configurations .
While not every application 's configuration is easily exposed in the registry , some are fairly easy to spot and fix yourself .
All you need is a solution to spread those changes out through your network .
That mechanism can be a logon script , or you can manage it through a Group Policy preference .
Eliminating Acrobat Reader 's browser integration
Let 's look at an example of how to use Group Policy preferences to manage one aspect of Acrobat Reader 's behavior .
In this example , we want it to stop viewing PDF files within our browser .
Instead , we want it to launch its own Acrobat Reader window when we click a link on a webpage .
The first step in this process involves a little sleuthing .
In order to instruct Acrobat Reader to stop behaving in a certain way , you first need to figure out how to speak its language .
In this case , the language of Acrobat Reader is the language of the registry .
With a little Google searching , you can quickly zero in on an Adobe knowledgebase article that tells you the exact registry key and value that must be modified to turn off browser integration .
That registry path , at least for the version currently installed on our example computer , is HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software \Adobe \Acrobat Reader\9.0 \Originals .
The key , which is not present and must be created , is bBrowserIntegration .
Assign the REG_DWORD value of 0 to turn off browser integration .
Knowing this exact registry path and key location is the most difficult part .
Modifying behaviors like this can only happen when the application is coded to look for the right values .
That 's why the sleuthing is sometimes necessary ; when the values do n't exist and must be created by you .
Once you 've figured out the keys and values you want , spreading them around your network through a Group Policy preference is honestly the easy part .
Start by launching the Group Policy Management Console ( GPMC ) and creating a new policy .
Once created , open that policy in the Group Policy Management Editor ( GPME ) and navigate to Computer Configuration | Preferences | Windows Settings | Registry .
Simply right - click Registry and select New | Registry Item to create a new preference .
The New Registry Properties console looks a bit like Figure 1 .
Clicking the ellipsis ( … ) button next to Key Path brings forward a tree view of your local registry , enabling you to find and enter the correct key path .
You could also simply enter the correct path into the dialog box .
Figure 1 . The New Registry Properties console
Also needed is the Value name , which in this case is bBrowserIntegration , as well as the REG_DWORD value of 0 .
Selecting an Action is required as well , with four possible options available .
Just like in the example from my previous article , the Common tab ( Figure 2 ) presents five options .
You may wish to set the Group Policy preference to Remove this item when it is no longer applied .
Configuring this setting ensures that the registry update is removed when the policy no longer applies to the targeted user or computer , handily doing away with any trace of your modification when you no longer need it .
Figure 2 . The Common tab when setting GPPs
If your network is like most , then it 's likely that each application is not installed everywhere .
While Acrobat Reader might be common across desktops , you should still want the assurance that you 're only adjusting its behaviors when it 's actually installed to the targeted computer .
It is for this reason that item - level targeting is so important with registry modifications .
With item - level targeting , you can restrict the registry modification to only those computers that have Adobe Reader installed .
This can be accomplished by creating a New Item of type File Match in the Targeting Editor ( Figure 3 ) .
We can then enter in the name of a file that is associated with the application we wish to configure .
Figure 3 shows how the AcroRd32. exe file is checked for existence .
If it exists , then the Group Policy preference is applied .
Figure 3 . The Targeting Editor ( click to enlarge )
That 's all there is to it .
Making even large - scale registry changes with Group Policy preferences is ridiculously easy , especially when compared to the management nightmare of logon scripts .
Your only hurdle in this entire process involves discovering the correct registry keys and values you need to fully control all your applications ' behaviors .

Every computer game is designed around the same central element : the player .
While the hardware and software for games may change , the psychology underlying how players learn and react to the game is a constant .
The study of the mind has actually come up with quite a few findings that can inform game design , but most of these have been published in scientific journals and other esoteric formats inaccessible to designers .
Ironically , many of these discoveries used simple computer games as tools to explore how people learn and act under different conditions .
The techniques that I 'll discuss in this article generally fall under the heading of behavioral psychology .
Best known for the work done on animals in the field , behavioral psychology focuses on experiments and observable actions .
One hallmark of behavioral research is that most of the major experimental discoveries are species - independent and can be found in anything from birds to fish to humans .
What behavioral psychologists look for ( and what will be our focus here ) are general " rules " for learning and for how minds respond to their environment .
Because of the species - and context - free nature of these rules , they can easily be applied to novel domains such as computer game design .
Unlike game theory , which stresses how a player should react to a situation , this article will focus on how they really do react to certain stereotypical conditions .
What is being offered here is not a blueprint for perfect games , it is a primer to some of the basic ways people react to different patterns of rewards .
Every computer game is implicitly asking its players to react in certain ways .
Psychology can offer a framework and a vocabulary for understanding what we are already telling our players .
Contingencies and Schedules
The concrete translation of " What are we asking of our players ? " is " What are our contingencies ? "
A contingency is a rule or set of rules governing when rewards are given out .
The anecdote about this discovery ( as passed to me by one of his students ) is that one day B. F. Skinner ran low on the small food pellets he gave the rats in his experiments .
Rather than risk running out and having to stop work for the day , he began to provide the pellets every tenth time the rats pressed the lever instead of every time .
Experimenting with different regimens of reward , he found that they produced markedly different patterns of response .
From this was born a new area of psychology , and one that has some strong implications for game design .
Some common terms in behavioral psychology as they apply to game design considerations : Reinforcer :
An outcome or result , generally used to refer to a reward .
Examples : an experience point , winning a level , a bigger gun .
Contingency : A rule or set of rules governing when reinforcers are given .
Also referred to as a schedule of reinforcement .
Examples : a level every 1,000 experience points , a bonus level that is only available if you kill a certain opponent .
Response :
An action on the part of the player that can fulfill the contingency .
This could be killing a monster , visiting an area of the game board , or using a special ability .
The contingencies in computer games are more complex , but the analogy is clear enough .
For example , players in an RPG earn experience points to gain levels or collect bonus items to gain extra lives .
In an arcade - style game , power - ups appear at random intervals , or only when certain conditions are met .
As in any contingency , there are actions on the part of the participant which provide a reward under specific circumstances .
This is not to say that players are the same as rats , but that there are general rules of learning which apply equally to both .
Ratios and Intervals
There are essentially two fundamental sorts of contingencies , ratios and intervals .
Ratio schedules provide rewards after a certain number of actions have been completed .
For example , a player might gain an extra life after killing 20 opponents .
This would be called a " fixed ratio " schedule , because the same number of kills is required every time .
Other types of ratios will be discussed later .
One of the most common contingencies found in games , fixed ratio schedules typically produce a very distinct pattern in the participant .
First there is a long pause , then a steady burst of activity as fast as possible until a reward is given .
This makes sense when one considers that the very first action never brings a reward , so there is little incentive to make that first kill .
Once participants decide to go for the reward , they act as fast as they can to bring the reward quickly .
The distinct pause shown under a fixed ratio schedule can be a real issue for game designers .
Having a period of time where there is little incentive to play the game can lead to the player walking away .
Additionally , the length of the pause is a function of the size of the ratio ( the number of actions required ) , so the more actions required the longer the pause .
This means that if the ratio increases over time , such as the increasing number of experience points required to gain a level in Dungeons & Dragons , so does the pause .
Eventually , the pause can become infinite , and the player simply decides it 's not worth it and walks away .
As in any contingency , there are actions on the part of the participant which provide a reward under specific circumstances .
On the plus side , during the pause other , less rewarding activities often come to the fore .
For example , if players know it will take them a long time to gain their next level , they might take the time to test a new tactic or try out different aspects of the game .
There are also " variable ratio " schedules , in which a specific number of actions are required , but that number changes every time .
A player might be required to shoot down approximately 20 enemy fighters to gain an extra ship , but the precise number is randomly generated each time .
It 's important to note that the player does not know how many actions are required this time , just the average number from previous experience .
Under variable ratio schedules , participants typically respond with a steady flow of activity at a reasonably high rate .
While not quite as high a rate as the burst under a fixed ratio schedule , it is more consistent and lacks the pausing that can cause trouble .
Since it 's possible ( though unlikely ) that the player can gain a life for shooting down only one enemy , there 's always a reason to go hunting .
Killing opponents to gain experience points and gain levels is one example of a ratio contingency .
In general , variable ratio schedules produce the highest overall rates of activity of all the schedules that I 'll discuss here .
This does n't necessarily mean they 're the best , but if what you 're looking for is a high and constant rate of play , you want a variable ratio contingency .
On the other side of the coin there are interval schedules .
Instead of providing a reward after a certain number of actions , interval schedules provide a reward after a certain amount of time has passed .
In a " fixed interval " schedule , the first response after a set period of time produces a reward .
For example , the game might introduce a power - up into the playing field 30 minutes after the player collected the last one .
Participants usually respond to fixed interval contingencies by pausing for a while after a reward and then gradually responding faster and faster until another reward is given .
In our power - up example , the player would concentrate on other parts of the game and return later to see if the new power - up had appeared .
If it had n't , the player would wander off again .
Gradually the checks would become more frequent as the proper time approached , until at about the right time the player is sitting there waiting for it .
As in the fixed ratio , there is a pause that can cause problems for a game designer .
Unlike the fixed ratio , there is no sharp transition to a high rate of activity .
Instead , there is gradual increase as the appropriate time approaches .
The pause remains , a period where player motivation is low .
There are also " variable interval " schedules , where the period of time involved changes after each reward .
A counterpart to the variable ratio schedules , these also produce a steady , continuous level of activity , although at a slower pace .
As in the variable ratio schedule , there is always a reason to be active .
The power - up mentioned in the earlier example could reappear immediately after being collected or an hour later .
The motivation is evenly spread out over time , so there are no low points where the players ' attention might wander .
The activity is lower than in a variable ratio schedule because the appearance is not dependent on activity .
If the player looks for the power - up 1,000 times during the interval , it will appear no faster .
Experiments have shown that we are very good at determining which consequences are the results of our own actions and which are not .
These are the basic building blocks , but this is by no means an exhaustive list .
Each contingency is an arrangement of time , activity , and reward , and there are an infinite number of ways these elements can be combined to produce the pattern of activity you want from your players .
The issue of Holocaust denial in the Arab world has been widely covered in the media .
Every public display of Holocaust denial by an Arab source is prominently reported and construed as further evidence of the pro-Nazi inclinations that Arabs , or Muslims , hold in their deepest hearts , especially when they are hostile to Israel .
The deliberate provocations that the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , stages regularly contribute considerably to fostering this image .
There is no dispute that Holocaust denial has been on the rise in Arab countries during the last two decades .
This has been illustrated in a disgraceful way by the hero - like reception that Roger Garaudy , the French former communist turned Catholic , turned Muslim , turned Holocaust denier , received in several Arab countries in the late 1990s , after his sentencing by a French court for a Holocaust - denying book .
Likewise , the rise of Holocaust denial among Palestinian citizens of Israel has been attested by recent opinion polls .
Yet western - style Holocaust denial – that is , the endeavour to produce pseudo - scientific proofs that the Jewish genocide did not happen at all or was only a massacre of far lesser scope than that commonly acknowledged – is actually very marginal in the Arab world .
Rather , manifestations of Holocaust denial among Arabs fall for the most part under two categories .
On one hand , there are Arabs who are shocked by the pro-Israel double standard that is displayed in western attitudes towards the Middle East .
Knowing that the Holocaust is the source of strong inhibition of western critiques of Israel , many Arabs tend to believe that its reality was amplified by Zionism for this very purpose .
On the other hand , there are Arabs who express Holocaust - denying views out of exasperation with the increasing cruelty of Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians .
Unable to retaliate in kind , they believe that they can harm Israel symbolically in this way .
In both cases , Holocaust denial is not primarily an expression of antisemitism , as western Holocaust denial certainly is , but an expression of what I call the " anti-Zionism of fools " .
Yet it remains a minority phenomenon in the Arab world , fought by enlightened intellectuals and politically educated activists who explain that such attitudes are not only based on ignorance but do a disservice to the Palestinian cause .
They point to the way any utterances of Holocaust denial are relayed by pro-Israeli websites , which use them in their propaganda .
Much less reported , however , are public acknowledgements by Palestinians of the Holocaust and of the universal lessons it bears for all persecuted peoples and groups .
When researching my book , The Arabs and the Holocaust , I found innumerable reports about the enunciation by Palestinians or other Arabs of insanities about the Holocaust , while I noticed that expressions of Palestinian compassion with the victims of the Holocaust were barely reported , if not blatantly ignored .
During my public talks in various countries , every time I told the audience about some of the most impressive examples and asked if they had heard about them , I encountered general surprise .
I will mention here only three of the most outstanding cases :
In January 1998 , the Palestinian negotiators in the Oslo process advised Yasser Arafat to visit the Holocaust museum in Washington in order to undo the damage wrought by the Garaudy affair .
The planned visit was , however , aborted by the refusal of the museum 's directors to receive the Palestinian leader as a VIP .
Arafat sought to make up for the missed occasion by visiting the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam three months later , on 31 March 1998 .
Despite its obvious symbolic importance , this visit received very little coverage in the western media .
In Israel , however , it provoked bitter controversy .
On 27 January 2009 , International Holocaust Remembrance Day , an exhibition on the Holocaust , opened in the West Bank village of Ni'lin ( or Naalin ) .
It was reported by Israel News as follows : " Naalin , a village that has become the symbol for the Palestinians ' battle against Israel 's construction of a separation fence in the West Bank , erected a display of photographs purchased from Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and invited the public to learn more about the persecution of the Jews . "
What is remarkably moving is that these victims of the Israeli occupation wanted to " empathise with and further understand their occupier " .
Most stunning of all , on 9 January 2009 , at the peak of the brutal Israeli onslaught on Gaza , inhabitants of Bi'lin , another West Bank village known for standing at the forefront of the struggle against the Israeli occupation , organised a demonstration in protest , wearing striped pyjamas similar to those of Nazi concentration camp inmates .
An account by the Bil 'in Popular Committee states : " Protesters also wore small yellow cutouts in the shape of Gaza with the word ' Gazan ' written on them to symbolise the yellow ' Jude ' stars of David worn by European Jews during World War II . "
The BBC briefly broadcast a glance at this astounding event : a video is still available .
That the message the Palestinian demonstrators conveyed was " exaggerated " is obvious ( and natural ) ; but the point is that they were identifying with the Jewish victims of Nazism and regarding the Holocaust as the highest standard of horror , rather than denying it .
Very few people have ever heard of these occurrences .
In the context of a worrying rise of Islamophobia in the west , most media – often unconsciously – play a negative role in putting much more emphasis on the dark side of the Arab world or the Muslim world than on the bright side .
This increases public prejudices against Arabs and Muslims , and sends back to the latter a detestable image of themselves with damaging consequences .
One would wish that the media instead promoted expressions such as the three reported above .
Unlike counterproductive pronouncements by apostates of Islam busy outdoing the neocons in pro-western or pro-Israeli statements , these are expressions by credible and respected fighters against the national oppression that their people endure .
Such are the most truthful Arab or Muslim upholders of the universal lessons of the Holocaust – like the Palestinian demonstrators in striped pyjamas .

PAMBAZUKA NEWS :
What do you think happened in these elections ?
Was it a genuine outcome ?
Are the accusations of fraud and irregularities accurate ?
Are these legitimate concerns ?
What kind of irregularities took place ?
How have these affected the outcome ?
ASHA ELKARIB :
As an activist organisation and network for justice we were involved in the elections process with activities such as polling registration and mapping of constituencies .
We followed this as closely as possible .
We did not cover the whole country but only certain states , mainly Khartoum , Al Gezira , Kassala , White Nile , and parts of Darfur .
We covered these areas for over a year : from census through to registration .
Based on our work , it is very clear that the election results were engineered in favour of the National Congress Party ( NCP ) .
Tamam is a network of over 3,000 local observers .
We observed initial issues in registration and raised our concerns in three different reports sent to the national election commission before the elections took place .
Our concerns were regarding fraud and the complete rigging of the election .
The indicators were traceable in civil society , such as attempts of corruption , threatening of persons on group and individual levels .
In some rural areas entire villages were sworn on the Qu’ran to vote for the NCP .
I happened to be there just after that .
Many – such as schoolteachers , university lecturers and civil servants – were threatened with the loss of their jobs .
Tactics such as intimidation through the use of religion and direct corruption ( giving money to poor constituencies in exchange for votes ) were also implemented .
In addition there was full - scale monopolisation of the media and use of state resources – cars , money for campaigning purposes .
The media is 100 per cent controlled and the national electoral commission itself is not neutral .
We are 100 per cent sure that these elections were not free or fair .
Most polling stations were in schools .
We have evidence of back doors being controlled to let the same people in to revote for the NCP .
The ink used in voting was found to be removable – it washes away with water and soap and NCP supporters were hence able to re-vote , as the voting system does not require people ’s names or IDs to be noted down on the ballot .
A final indicator is that Bashir got 68 per cent of the total vote .
In the south he got 7 per cent while in the north he got 98 per cent at a parliamentary level .
The NCP has no control in the south and this was evident in their lack of capacity to rig there , but the north shows a different picture .
PAMBAZUKA NEWS : Independently of the ‘ mistakes ’ that took place in the electoral process – is it a concern that a substantial portion of the Sudanese public voted for Bashir anyway ?
Is there not legitimacy nonetheless in the election results – considering a large number of people voted for Bashir anyway ?
ASHA ELKARIB :
It is true some people genuinely did vote for him , but not as many as the results indicate .
A large part of the results in his favour are due to the reasons mentioned above .
In any case this is now a de facto situation we have to deal with .
One way is by not keeping silent and continuing to denounce it .
We have already started working and analysing the situation – we want to base our position on critical analysis of the NCP , international actors and civil society .
We have written a report outlining the most urgent issues .
We have to have a plan of action from now until the referendum in January 2011 .
We are planning to use the action initiated by youth and women ’s groups to challenge leadership and political parties .
There is now a very clear demarcation between separatists and unionists .
We want to go beyond that divide .
PAMBAZUKA NEWS : What were international monitors ’ roles in this election ( such as the Carter institute ) ?
How did their presence / position influence the process ?
What are the wider international community ’s interests in these elections ?
ASHA ELKARIB : Due to their desire to see the referendum for Southern independence go through next year , the international community turned a blind eye to all the fundamental issues in this election and in doing so indirectly supported the NCP .
Also , people stayed at home .
There was no incidence of violence and there was very high presence of security forces .
Khartoum was quiet , which indicated to the international community that Sudanese people were happy with this election – but they were n’t .
The lack of violence is due to the fact that Sudanese people see no use in violence and because civil society had been advocating for non-violence long before the election started .
Assuming that Sudanese people are content with the results is a very naive interpretation .
PAMBAZUKA NEWS : Have the opposition parties done a disservice to the democratic process in Sudan by boycotting the elections and allowing a landslide victory for Bashir or are they standing up for democracy in this sign of protest ?
ASHA ELKARIB :
The opposition parties were not consistent in what they were telling their constituencies .
Up to the very last minute it was unclear whether they were going to go forth or boycott the election .
Some partially withdrew – there was a lot of confusion .
Sudanese people were ready to vote .
This hesitation on the part of the opposition parties frustrated people .
PAMBAZUKA NEWS : What has this election achieved ?
Has it set a precedent for an attempt at democracy and accountability ?
Is that the bigger gain in the long term ?
Or will things simply resume to normal now that the NCP has been democratically elected ?
ASHA ELKARIB :
There is a democratic movement emerging from the civil society groups across the country , including women ’s and youth groups and labour unions .
This is one positive outcome of this election .
If we have to live with this government for the next four years its ok – but it will have to deal with a much more organised opposition which is now concretising .
We are going to hold them to account – freedom of expression , of peaceful assembly , of movement .
This will be observed .
On our part we will have strategic and organised thinking and action .
It will be challenging but we are determined to learn from that process and to bring real democratisation in Sudan .
PAMBAZUKA NEWS : Is Bashir clinging to power because this is his last resort to not be indicted by the ICC ?
ASHA ELKARIB :
It was his driving force – his winning will protect him .
He is using the power of the African Union and Arab League who are supporting him against the Sudanese people .
He ca n’t do that forever .
The ICC knows this .
The ICC indictment was used as a political tactic to increase Bashir ’s popularity .
Darfur is closed off from the northern public – so they support what Bashir is saying without knowing what is really going on .
The media is continuously manipulated and Sudanese civil society is barred form the area .
PAMBAZUKA NEWS : What will happen to the South ?
Do you think the NCP will follow through with the referendum in for the south in 2011 ?
ASHA ELKARIB :
The referendum will affect our current and future political situation and the mobilisation of an independent civil society driven opposition group that we are trying to achieve .
If the south separates or not , it will be a long and painful process – so many issues will have to be addressed such as Abyei , the borders , the Blue Nile , southerners in the north , northerners in the south and a central bank .
It will not be easy .
Other issues will follow the referendum .
These are the new realities we have to think of .
We have to address some serious issues otherwise the violence that did not happen during the elections will happen in the referendum .
We are already mobilising in anticipation .

( CNN ) --
If most new moms would breastfeed their babies for the first six months of life , it would save nearly 1,000 lives and billions of dollars each year , according to a new study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics .
" The United States incurs $ 13 billion in excess costs annually and suffers 911 preventable deaths per year because our breastfeeding rates fall far below medical recommendations , " the report said .
The World Health Organization says infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life " to achieve optimal growth , development and health . "
The WHO is not alone in its recommendations .
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all agree that breast milk alone is sufficient for newborns and infants until they are 6 months old .
However , a 2009 breastfeeding report card from the CDC found that only 74 percent of women start breastfeeding , only 33 percent were still exclusively breastfeeding at three months and only 14 percent were still exclusively breastfeeding at six months .
Dr. Melissa Bartick , one of the new study 's co-authors , says the vast majority of extra costs incurred each year could be saved " if 80 to 90 percent of women exclusively breastfed for as little as four months and if 90 percent of women would breastfeed some times until six months . "
Bartick is a hospitalist -- a doctor who specializes in the care of hospitalized patients -- at Cambridge Health Alliance , an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a mother of two .
Bartick and her co-author Arnold Reinhold found that most of the excess costs are due to premature deaths .
Nearly all , 95 percent of these deaths , are attributed to three causes : sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) ; necrotizing enterocolitis , seen primarily in preterm babies and in which the lining of the intestinal wall dies ; and lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia .
Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of all of these and seven other illnesses studied by the study authors .
Bartick calculates $ 10.56 million for each of the estimated 911 children 's deaths .
Researchers also included the direct costs of health care and parent 's time missed from work .
They did not include the cost of formula , which is another added cost for moms who do n't breastfeed .
There are a lot of factors contributing to low breastfeeding rates in the United States , and Bartick says moms should n't be blamed , because they receive mixed messages and often lack support from the moment their babies are born .
She says the biggest priority should be to improve maternity care practices .
Bartick refers to a 2007 CDC survey of hospitals and birthing centers , which scored each facility to determine how well it complied with recommendations meant to encourage women to breastfeed .
According to that survey , Bartick says , " U.S. hospitals scored a 63 - that 's a D . "
Bartick says many hospitals delay immediate urgent skin - to - skin contact between mom and baby , which can make things harder for the newborn to act on its natural instincts to suckle .
Moms also need to be better educated about the importance of breastfeeding and they need adequate support after they leave the hospital in case they run into problems because the newborn is n't properly latching on and therefore not getting enough food .
Dr. Alan Fleischman , medical director for the March of Dimes , was not surprised by the findings of the report .
Fleischman , who did not work on this study , says if a new mom is struggling with breastfeeding , she may end up in a situation where " grandmother suggests to stop the silliness and give formula instead . "
He believes the mothers and grandmothers of new moms also need to be educated about the benefits of breastfeeding because for their generations , feeding their babies formula was the norm .
As the vicissitudes of cruel fate continue to toy with Lindsay Lohan — spinning complex webs of conspiracy involving nightclub owners , paparazzi , and possibly doors ; subjecting her to drive - by Dr. Drew diagnoses and the stinging , Wildean barbs of George Lopez — there ’s one thing they can never take away , and that ’s the solid acting work that made her such an object of torment in the first place .
Except , it looks like Nintendo has done just that :
The new Mean Girls game ( timely ! ) for the DS features an exact reproduction of the film ’s poster art — including photos of Rachel McAdams , Amanda Seyfried , and Lacey Chabert — but completely omits Lohan .
And while some might assume the decision to erase Lohan ’s likeness from a game where she ’s the central character would have something to do with her controversial stance on human trafficking ( which is why everyone is out to get her , right ? ) , as it turns out , it ’s still “ prohibitively expensive ” to license a photo of Lohan , because clearly photos of Lindsay Lohan are hard to come by .

One common email we have been getting is people notifying us that they see live Humble Bundle key links around the internet on various forums , 4 chan , and even Steam !
I decided to look into this a little bit and try to guess how big of a phenomenon it is .
After some simple math , I estimate that over 25 % of Humble Indie Bundle downloads are ' pirated ' -- that is , users download from shared links from forums and other places without actually contributing anything .
Note : that is not including BitTorrent and other sources .
How do people pirate the bundle ?
When I say this bundle is DRM - free -- I really mean DRM - free .
Not only do the games themselves have no copy protection ( not even a simple serial number check ) , but the Humble Indie Bundle website has limited copy protection .
That means there are no download limits , everything is reachable on the command - line with ' wget ' , you can resume downloads , and do anything else you would expect to be able to do with a personal download link .
25 % seems incredible given that you can simply pay $ 0.01 to be completely legitimate .
Is this figure correct ?
Let 's take a look at some raw download data .
57.3 TB of total bandwidth ( 49.3 TB of edge traffic ) 57.3 TB of total bandwidth ( 49.3 TB of edge traffic )
The 57.3 TB figure is the total volume , including transfer of the origin data to the edge nodes ( learn more about CDNs ) .
The uninflated 49.3 TB figure is the important one as that is the " last - mile " bandwidth from the local edge nodes to the user .
As of this writing , 79,000 people have contributed to the bundle .
When someone contributes to the Humble Indie Bundle , they get the 5 games , plus the Samorost 2 gift .
This adds up to about 746.5 MB per platform .
I think it is reasonable to assume that not everyone will download every single game for their platform ( at least instantly after purchasing or gifting ) .
Is it though ?
I sent my friend Eric Samuel , a statistics graduate from Cal , two days worth of raw download data from the CDN for analysis .
He found that on average a given IP address downloads 490.01 MB worth of data from the bundle .
This is actually likely overstated due to multiple people downloading from the same modem .
For instance , one IP alone downloaded 10.3 GB - not exactly a humble bundle !
So we can divide the 49.3 TB by 490.01 MB and we get 105,497 average downloaders .
Assuming these numbers are reasonable , we get 79,000 / 105,497 = 0.749 are estimated to be legitimate or about 25 % have pirated the bundle -- directly from us .
There are a lot of assumptions here , but I tried to be as conservative and simple as possible .
Why would you pirate a pay - what - you - want bundle ?
So why are people sharing the Humble Bundle , when they could get it just by donating a penny to charity ?
We can only speculate , but here are some possible reasons :
Some might want to donate , but it seems a whole lot easier to just click on a hyperlink than it is to enter a credit card number .
Sure , it only takes a couple seconds , but for many , this is a few seconds too long .
The most successful online stores all allow one - click buying , including Amazon , Steam and iTunes .
In the words of one gamer , Steam showed him that he " was n't cheap , just lazy , " and I 'm sure he 's not alone in that realization .
Some users may want to share the bundle with their friends , and decide that it 's easier to just make one donation for a larger amount than it is to make separate gift donations .
Some users may live in countries where none of our three processors ( PayPal , Google Checkout , and Amazon ) are accepted .
These users might pay if they could , but they feel that they have no choice but to search for shared copies .
Some users just want to " stick it to the man " , and be edgy and rebellious .
It does n't matter if they 're sticking it to indie developers , sick children , and online civil liberties ... they 're sticking it to someone , so they feel cool .
What are we going to do about it ?
Not much .
Should n't we use a percentage of the proceeds to send our indie - lawyers after them ?
Perhaps trace their IP addresses ?
Standard Operating Procedure For IP Tracing
No -- we will just focus on making cool games , having great customer service , and hope for the best .
It sure seems to be working right now !
Should we implement a technical solution to prevent rampant piracy of our download links ?
That might be optimal -- only if done right though .
We have gotten many positive messages ( especially from Linux users ) about our relaxed edge servers like this one from Don :
Hey thanks for putting the downloads on a plain server with no cookie auth required , I hate it when I can't use wget and resumes .
Out in the 3rd world with 256k BURSTABLE DSL that drops on and off at random .
Some websites really make it a pain to download stuff trying to block unauthorized folks , even exporting cookies and using the - - load - cookies trick in wget wo n't work .
There is probably a way to get the best of both worlds , but it 's not my area of expertise .
Making the download experience worse for generous contributors in the name of punishing pirates does n't really fit with the spirit of the bundle .
When considering any kind of DRM , we have to ask ourselves , " How many legitimate users is it ok to inconvenience in order to reduce piracy ? "
The answer should be none .
I do have one humble request though --
If you are deadset on pirating the bundle , please consider downloading it from BitTorrent instead of using up our bandwidth !
Also , even though you are pirating our games , please tell some of your friends about the Humble Indie Bundle .
Posting to Facebook , telling your Twitter followers , ( or simply talking to someone ) sure does n't require a credit card .
I decided to start writing in - depth posts for the devlog instead of doing tweets because I can add explanations to things .
Also , the last devlog was about what I had done before , but from now on , I ’ll be writing about what I ’m doing now .
Clean up and Panels
When I first started working on the Exploding Editor , it was just a personal tool , and I wanted it to get it working fast , so the code was not the best it could be .
After I decided to release this to the public , I decided to go back and clean things up to save myself time and headaches in the future .
While doing that , I also decided to make a major design change to the editor .
Compare the two images below :
Here ’s how the editor used to look .
Here ’s how it looks now .
The biggest change is the panels , but there is also space for a toolbar at the top , and it ’s now possible to add a toolbar to any panel .
If you ’re interested in the programming details , each panel is now in its own dependency injection subcontainer .
I follow the facade pattern , so each panel is a facade and other classes have no access to the panel ’s internals .
You may also notice in the current image that the textfields are a darker color .
I wrote a simple styling system that I can apply to elements .
That way , if I decide to change something , I only have to do it in one place .
If you do things the regular way in Unity and use prefabs , getting everything to match style can be a real pain , so this is a nice simple solution .
public interface TextInputFieldStyle { Color backgroundColor { get ;} Color textColor { get ;} Color selectionColor { get ; } } public static void applyStyle ( this TMP_InputField target , TextInputFieldStyle style ) { target.selectionColor = style.selectionColor ; target.textComponent.color = style.textColor ; target.targetGraphic.color = style.backgroundColor ; } textField.applyStyle(style ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 public interface TextInputFieldStyle { Color backgroundColor { get ; } Color textColor { get ; } Color selectionColor { get ; } } public static void applyStyle ( this TMP_InputField target , TextInputFieldStyle style ) { target .
selectionColor = style .
selectionColor ; target .
textComponent .
color = style .
textColor ; target .
targetGraphic .
color = style .
backgroundColor ; } textField .
applyStyle ( style ) ;
Here ’s the gist of how it works .
Color Picker
People will need to change colors of things in the editor , so I needed to have some kind of color picker tool .
There are several solutions on the asset store , but there ’s no way to try them out or see their code without buying them .
Instead I found a free one and then built my own while using it as a reference when I ran into trouble .
It ’s not completely done , but here ’s how it looks .
Another reason I did n’t want to use any of the asset store solutions is that none of them use TextMesh Pro , the superior text solution in Unity .
Exploding Editor supports retina displays , so it will be especially noticable if any text is low resolution .
The color picker does n’t generate textures for the color box or the hue slider .
They are implemented with shaders so they ’re fast and use little memory .
Reactive Programming Example
The color picker UI is a great example of the benefits of reactive programming .
I think in general not enough people use it , so I thought I ’d show how using it can save you a lot of time and make your code lean and clean .
The following code is in the ColorSliderView class which is used for each of the RGBA sliders shown in the animation .
public IObservable <ColorSliderView > valueChanged => slider . OnValueChangedAsObservable ( ) . Select( x => ( byte ) x ) .Merge( valueInputField.onValueChangedAsObservable ( ) .
Where ( _ => valueInputField.isFocused ) . Select( x => x.safelyParsedByte( ) ) ) .
Do(x => _value = x ) .
Select ( _ => this ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 public IObservable < ColorSliderView > valueChanged = > slider .
OnValueChangedAsObservable ( ) .
Select ( x = > ( byte ) x ) .
Merge ( valueInputField . onValueChangedAsObservable ( ) .
Where ( _ = > valueInputField . isFocused ) .
Select ( x = > x .
safely ParsedByte ( ) ) ) .
Do ( x = > _value = x ) .
Select ( _ = > this ) ;
Take a look at this code .
It ’s generating an IObservable to let observers know when something changes .
It automatically combines changes from both the slider and the textfield , and it stores that value before sending the event .
It also limits the event for the textfield to make sure it only sends it when the textfield has focus .
This is to prevent a stack overflow .
sliders . Select( x => x.valueChanged ) . CombineLatest ( ) . Subscribe ( _ => picker .color = new Color32 ( sliders [ 0].value , sliders [ 1].value , sliders [ 2].value , sliders [ 3].value ) ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 sliders .
Select ( x = > x . valueChanged ) .
CombineLatest ( ) .
Subscribe ( _ = > picker .
color = new Color32 ( sliders [ 0 ] . value , sliders [ 1 ] . value , sliders [ 2 ] . value , sliders [ 3 ] . value ) ) ;
And here ’s where the IObservables are subscribed to .
Whenever any of the sliders change their value , the function in Subscribe is invoked , and the color picker ’s color is updated with the new values .
What ’s Next ?
There ’s a little bit of work left to finish the color picker , and then I have to finish transitioning the rest of the editor to the panel system .
I mainly just have the sprites panel and the panels related to tilemapping remaining .

Formula 1's ruling body , the FIA , has decided to raise the elements behind the kerbs of two chicanes of the Monte Carlo circuit for this weekend 's Monaco Grand Prix .
The FIA said new , higher elements have been placed after the kerbs at the Nouvelle chicane ( Turn 11 ) , as well as the one after the Swimming Pool ( Turn 16 ) .
The move is aimed at stopping drivers from cutting through them at high speed .
The governing body also said several parts of the circuit have been resurfaced .
The pitlane surface is all new , as is the stretch from Ste Devote corner to the junction of Avenue de Monte Carlo .
Also re-surfaced are sections from Place du Casino to the Tunnel du Portier entry and from the tunnel exit to the chicane .
If you know of an event that you feel should be listed on our calendar , please send details to info@mjdispensaries.com ~ Thank You
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Eating bacon , sausage , hot dogs and other processed meats can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes , U.S. researchers said on Monday in a study that identifies the real bad boys of the meat counter .

Eating unprocessed beef , pork or lamb appeared not to raise risks of heart attacks and diabetes , they said , suggesting that salt and chemical preservatives may be the real cause of these two health problems associated with eating meat .
The study , an analysis of other research called a meta - analysis , did not look at high blood pressure or cancer , which are also linked with high meat consumption .
“ To lower risk of heart attacks and diabetes , people should consider which types of meats they are eating , ” said Renata Micha of the Harvard School of Public Health , whose study appears in the journal Circulation .
“ Processed meats such as bacon , salami , sausages , hot dogs and processed deli meats may be the most important to avoid , ” Micha said in a statement .
Based on her findings , she said people who eat one serving per week or less of processed meats have less of a risk .
The American Meat Institute objected to the findings , saying it was only one study and that it stands in contrast to other studies and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans .
“ At best , this hypothesis merits further study .
It is certainly no reason for dietary changes , ” James Hodges , president of the American Meat Institute , said in a statement .
Most dietary guidelines recommend eating less meat .
Individual studies looking at relationships between eating meat and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes have had mixed results .
But studies rarely look for differences in risk between processed and unprocessed red meats , Micha said .
She and colleagues did a systematic review of nearly 1,600 studies from around the world looking for evidence of a link between eating processed and unprocessed red meat and the risk of heart disease and diabetes .
They defined processed meat as any meat preserved by smoking , curing or salting , or with the addition of chemical preservatives .
Meats in this category included bacon , salami , sausages , hot dogs or processed deli or luncheon meats .
Unprocessed red meat included beef , lamb or pork but not poultry .
They found that on average , each 1.8 oz ( 50 grams ) daily serving of processed meat a day -- one to two slices of deli meats or one hot dog -- was associated with a 42 percent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 percent higher risk of developing diabetes .
They found no higher heart or diabetes risk in people who ate only unprocessed red meats .
The team adjusted for a number of factors , including how much meat people ate .
They said lifestyle factors were similar between those who ate processed and unprocessed meats .
“ When we looked at average nutrients in unprocessed red and processed meats eaten in the United States , we found that they contained similar average amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol , ” Micha said .
“ In contrast , processed meats contained , on average , four times more sodium and 50 percent more nitrate preservatives , ” Micha added .
Last month , the Institute of Medicine urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate the amount of salt added to foods to help Americans cut their high sodium intake .
The FDA has not yet said whether it will regulate salt in foods , but it is looking at the issue .
Physicists have created a “ fat ” particle made of a record - breaking five entangled photons in a quantum state with echoes of Schrödinger ’s cat .
Such photons could be put to use in high - resolution imaging .
The physical properties of entangled particles are intimately linked , even across vast distances .
Physicists want to entangle ever - larger numbers of particles to understand why the phenomenon is n’t seen at the macroscopic scale .
It ’s already possible to entangle six photons in a so - called graph state – ideal for quantum computing because each particle occupies a unique mode , or route , through a quantum circuit .
But another form of entanglement that is employed in high - resolution imaging has been stalled at three or four photons – until now .
In a “ NOON ” state , if the entangled photons are given a choice of two paths through an optical medium , all will opt to follow the same one .
As such , a NOON state is comparable to Erwin Schrödinger ’s famous thought experiment , in which a cat can occupy only one of two states – alive or dead – when it is hidden in a box and exposed to a potentially lethal source .

Now Itai Afek , Oron Ambar and Yaron Silberberg at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , have pushed the number of photons entangled in the NOON state up to a record - breaking five .
Split pulses
They used a laser to generate short pulses of infrared light and split each pulse in two .
They then converted one half into a quantum pulse , using a transparent crystal of beta barium borate to cleave some of the photons into entangled pairs that behave in a correlated way .
Finally , they combined this quantum pulse with the other half of the pulse , theoretically generating a NOON state containing up to five entangled photons .
To prove the NOON states ’ existence and measure how many photons they had entangled , the team sent the photons through a two - path device , and detectors recorded their progress .
Entangled photons in a NOON state behave as if they are part of a single bulky photon – a “ fat photon ” , as Silberberg calls it , which will travel down one of the two paths
A fat photon ’s wavelength becomes shorter than normal , and the amount of shortening depends on the number of entangled photons it comprises , Silberberg explains .
So by recording fat photons with a wavelength five times shorter than expected , the team demonstrated that they had succeeded in creating a five - photon NOON state .
The fat photons produced this way are of more than just academic curiosity , says Christoph Wildfeuer at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
Because the infrared photons behave as if they have a much shorter ultraviolet wavelength , they could be used in remote sensing to image objects with the greater resolution ultraviolet light affords , but in situations where such light is scattered or absorbed .
If penetrating the atmosphere with ultraviolet photons is not possible , says Wildfeuer , entangling infrared photons could do the job instead , with the higher resolution of the ultraviolet photons .

I started playing with ASP .
NET MVC almost two years ago and it was pretty much love at first sight .
Granted , the reasons for that love had less to do with the virtues of MVC than with the sins of classic ASP and ASP .
NET :
But traditional ASP.NET web pages are littered with cruft : hidden fields , obscure Javascript , and a ubiquitous < form > element even on pages which do n't look , act , or talk like forms .
The ASP.
NET WebForms infrastructure extracts a price .
That price is the sanctity of your generated markup .
We could almost call clean markup the sacrificial lamb of ASP .
NET WebForms development .
It 's what you give up in order to achieve the illusion of state in that stateless medium known as the World Wide Web .
If you develop in ASP .
NET , then you 've probably spent a lot of time chasing your tail as I have , ferreting out how to clean up ASP .
NET - generated markup to make it palatable ...
Like many otherwise innocent (? ) and well - meaning developers , I 've struggled with the messiness of ASP and ASP .
NET web development for years .
I remember those years as a miserable tour of duty through web development perdition : psychotic VIEWSTATE fields , opaque " what the holy mother of all fuck is that ? "
Javascript invocations , recalcitrant datagrids that never do exactly what you want them to , and those lovable auto - generated HTML element IDs with names like :
ctl_100_really_long_freaking_annoying_name
The Battle of Yonkers print that made the rounds a while back summarizes my feelings exactly .
Developing in ASP.NET is like doing battle with a legion of zombies , only not as fun , because you do n't get to band together with your friends and stockpile supplies and go out on patrols and learn the nuances of zombie tactics and takedowns .
In ASP.NET your zombies are things like VIEWSTATE and you can't kill a VIEWSTATE , more 's the pity .
( Well , actually , you sort of can .
But once you get into VIEWSTATE - removal - and - hiding techniques you really need to ask yourself if your web development platform is helping or hindering you . )
The sickness of ASP.
NET technology ( and it is a sickness , and no , I 'm am not down with the sickness ) can be traced back to ASP .
NET 's overarching goal , which is to make web development as much like desktop development ( i.e. , as idiot - proof ) as possible .
Why ?
You 're an idiot , that 's why .
You need hand - holding .
You 're unfit to work with technologies that do n't hold your hand .
The unspoken message of ASP.
NET seems to be :
Hey , man , forget about all that difficult / confusing HTTP request / response stuff , the web is a design surface , you get ?
( Puff , puff . )
Web development , desktop development , eh .
It 's all one , baby .
( Puff . )
Just drag and drop your controls , set a few properties , and bada - bing .
You 're done .
You wo n't hardly have to write any code at all !
( Exhale . )
And once you start going down this path , you 've entered a world of framework and boilerplate and auto - generated cruft and tricksy little hobbits doing obscene things in the cupboards .
Auto - generated cruft is what 's required to untangle the impedance mismatch that results from trying to manhandle a web page with dynamic and asynchronous behaviors into , essentially , an overgrown dialog box .
Oh , look .
Drag and drop .
How cute .
It 's what Scott Hanselman calls cargo - cult programming ( giving it a slightly different connotation than the Wikipedia definition ) an apt term , and one that describes the typical ASP .
NET programmer to a T .
Ironically , Hanselman has been one of the big proponents and popularizers and explainers of ASP.
NET over the years .
( And if only the average ASP.
NET consultant had one - tenth of Hanselman 's enthusiasm and talent , the ASP.
NET websites of the world might not be the celebration of worst practices , wasting - your - corporate - dollars - by - the - millions boobery that they in fact are .
I say that as a former ASP.
NET consultant who 's participated in this grand fuck - off of money .
No wonder your corporation can't turn a profit .
You spend eighteen months and three million dollars to build an ASP.
NET website any two competent developers could have built in three months for 20 k .
Two six year - olds running a lemonade stand have better fiscal sense than the average corporation , at least when it comes to IT expenditures .
Believe it . )
Do n't be a dragtard , America .
World .
You are being marketed to .
The desktop is a completely broken metaphor for the web .
That ASP.NET is a deft execution of that metaphor does n't make the metaphor itself any less broken .
No matter how many bells and whistles you hang on it , it remains broken .
Under ASP.NET 1.0 it was broken .
And under ASP .NET 4.0 it 's broken .
Broken .
ASP.NET vs. ASP.NET MVC : No Choice At All
The sad truth is that ASP .
NET is simply another throwaway business technology that will one day occupy a proud place of implicit or not - so - implicit deprecation alongside ASP and MFC and ATL and ActiveX and all the other proprietary Microsoft cast - offs , desktop , web , or cloud , in their various stages of decay .
( Nasty , brutish , and short .
So goes life as a Microsoft " business technology " . )
I 'm not saying that ASP .
NET has been or will be deprecated any time soon .
It 's achieved critical mass , and rest assured , ASP.
NET websites around the world will be keeping the Internet in a happy surplus of cruft - laden , obfuscated markup for years to come .
And maybe that 's the real ASP .
NET web development horror ; not that ASP .
NET is doomed to obscurity , but rather that it 's doomed to a long and frenetic sort of half - life , and many of you with it , as legions of developers go forward like zombies to swell the ranks of throwaway high - maintenance ASP.
NET web applications spewing forth broken , bloated markup by the terabyte .
It makes me glad that I was born a human and not a Google spider , because what a shit - eatingly miserable life that must be .
All of which is why I say : the choice between ASP.
NET and ASP.
NET MVC is no choice at all .
Despite having used and endorsed ASP.
NET for years , I would now only recommend classic ASP .
NET for one specific application type : namely , the Throwaway CRUD - Friendly Forms - Centric Line of Business App , little - loved as it always is , used internally by 10 to 100 employees for 2 to 5 years before being shuffled off its mortal coil in yet another inane round of corporate " strategizing " .
But in this arena , you 'll find that classic ASP .
NET is everything you 'd ever want it to be .
Short - lived , high - dollar , with a nice set of drag and drop controls so that you can crank out those crappy UIs in record time , thereby hoodwinking your not -very - technologically - savvy client or manager into thinking value has been added , rather than subtracted , ultimately justifying your paycheck or your project 's existence or your sense of ego or whatever tune you dance to , and allowing the great hamster wheel of clusterfucking waste which we 've all participated in and bought into at one time or another , to continue ...
But for websites that actually matter ?
For blockbuster sites and labors of love ?
For social sites , blogs , and forums ?
For games ?
For any website where subtlety and precision of HTTP request and response are important ?
You either bow to the dirty utility of ASP .
NET , acknowledging it for what it is , or you try to focus on true craftsmanship with ASP .
NET MVC ; trusting that when people like Steve McConnell ( the author of Code Complete ) say things like this , emphasis mine ...
There 's no such thing as a free lunch , and even if there were , there 's no guarantee that it would be any good .
Software development is a far cry from haute cuisine , however , and software quality is unusual in a significant way .
The General Principle of Software Quality is that improving quality reduces development costs .
... that they know what they 're talking about .
ASP.NET is simply not a quality - producing technology .
If anything it 's a quality - nullifying technology .
Labyrinthine , opaque , tightly - coupled , lousy with dependencies , leading to a hodgepodge system that 's difficult to mock up , difficult to test , difficult to debug , and in general , just difficult .
ASP.NET works great , except when it does n't .
When it does n't , you 'll often find yourself drowning in a sandpit of technical debt .
Compared to all of that , ASP .
NET MVC is a breath of fresh air .
Far from being an experimental development curiosity put together by a talented - but - idealistic group of people in some Microsoft white tower , ASP .
NET MVC is a shining example of how good it can be when Microsoft gets something right .
Clean , capable , precise , completely open , extensible to the Nth , partaking generously of the same almost philosophical beauty that we see in certain areas of .NET , and in portions of Java , and in classic Bjarne Strousstrup - style C++. Etc. ASP .
NET MVC is the most encouraging technology to come out of Redmond since .NET itself .
And having sipped but once from the MVC Kool - Aid , I really would rather face zombies than another year — another minute — of ASP .
NET .
And if you give it a try , I 'm reasonably sure you 'll feel the same way .
MIT /GNU
Scheme release notes
Testing release 11.0.90
Changes to the native - code compiler ( LIAR )
Feature MIT
Scheme now has native code ( and SVM ) support on aarch64 .
MIT Scheme now has native code ( and SVM ) support on aarch64 .
Performance The AMD x86-64 ABI has been changed .
Newer Scheme versions must be cross -compiled from older ones using ./ configure -- enable - cross - compiling .
Old .com files must be recompiled .
The changes have performance improvements on many workloads , by reducing the amount of self - modifying code and by making better use of the CPU branch predictor .
The AMD x86-64 ABI has been changed .
Bug fix
A number of bugs on big-endian systems have been fixed : SVM1 byte code interpreter works on big-endian systems now compiler can now cross-compile to big-endian systems fixed wrong byte ordering in MD5 microcode primitive
A number of bugs on big-endian systems have been fixed : Bug fix LIAR previously miscompiled local procedures with optional parameters if they were never passed .
Formerly MIT
Scheme used unassigned reference traps for optional parameters without values ; now it uses a #! default object .
But LIAR had n't gotten the memo , and if every call site omitted the argument , LIAR would constant - fold an unassigned reference trap instead of #! default .
( let ( ) ( define ( test #!optional x ) ( pp ( map - reference - trap ( lambda ( ) x ) ) ) ) ( test ) )
LIAR previously miscompiled local procedures with optional parameters if they were never passed .
Feature New procedure ( bytevector - zero - explicit ! bv [ start [ end ] ] ) intended not to be optimized away .
This is n't correctly implemented yet — an old copy of the data may remain elsewhere in memory after a GC — but it may be useful to mark where you would want to zero the bytevector if we fixed it in the future .
New procedure intended not to be optimized away .
Feature Support for cross-compilation has been improved .
On your x86 workstation , with mit-scheme - x86 - 64 in $ PATH : ./ configure \ --enable-native-code=aarch64le \ -- enable - cross - compiling make toolchain make cross-host
On your aarch64 laptop : make cross-target Eventually , it ought to be possible to run entirely on your x86 workstation , if you have aarch64 -- netbsd - gcc in $ PATH too and a prepopulated installation of the target OS at / path/to/destir.aarch64 : ./ configure \ --host=x86_64--netbsd \ --build=aarch64--netbsd \ --enable-native-code=aarch64le \ --enable-cross-compiling \ CFLAGS=--sysroot=/path/to/destdir.aarch64 \ LDFLAGS=--sysroot=/path/to/destdir.aarch64 \ ac_cv_func_setpgrp_void=no \ ac_cv_func_mmap_fixed_mapped=yes \ HOST_CC=cc make toolchain make cross -host make cross - target ( The ac_cv_ * stuff is because autoconf can't detect some features when cross-compiling . )
However , currently Scheme does not support static linking , only cold - loading code and dumping an image on the target machine .
Changes to the runtime system
Improvement R7RS library support has been greatly improved since the last release .
Many bugs have been fixed , more built - in libraries have been defined , and built - in libraries are automatically loaded as needed .
The procedure ( find - scheme - libraries ! directory ) can be called to pre-register all of the libraries in directory ; once pre-registered , a library is automatically loaded as needed .
When Scheme starts , if the directory $ {HOME}/.mit- scheme/libraries / exists , find - scheme - libraries ! is called on it .
Note that there is no relationship between a library file 's location and its name .
Library files can be organized as desired .
In addition , libraries can now be named using the .sld suffix , which has its own special suffixes for compiled code , or you can use .scm as before .
library support has been greatly improved since the last release .
Many bugs have been fixed , more built - in libraries have been defined , and built - in libraries are automatically loaded as needed .
Feature New pseudorandom number generator algorithm for random API .
The PRNG algorithm is based on the stream cipher ChaCha .
The state is a 32 - byte seed s ; each output x is obtained by breaking the 64 - byte quantity ChaCha_s ( 0 ) into two 32 - byte halves s′ and x , and replacing the state s by s′ .
The state is a little smaller than the old algorithm , and we now implement random - source - pseudo - randomize !
keyed by two 128 - bit integer seeds which can safely be drawn from the random source itself to attain reproducible randomized subtrees of computation with no danger of collisions in the seeds .
( flo:random - unit state ) is now deprecated : use flo : random - unit - open if you must for essentially the same semantics , but prefer flo : random - unit - closed .
( flo:random - unit- open state ) samples from the uniform distribution on real numbers in ( 2 emin − p / 2 , 1 − 2 p / 2 ) rounded to the nearest floating - point number .
Previously , flo : random - unit and random - real were limited to a narrower range and excluded many floating - point numbers in that range .
( flo:random - unit - closed state ) samples from the uniform distribution on real numbers in [ 0 , 1 ] rounded to the nearest floating - point number .
Effectively , though , it samples from ( 0 , 1 ] , because the probability of getting 0 is smaller than 2 emin which is negligible even for IEEE 754 binary 32 ( single - precision ) where it is 2 − 127 , whereas the probability of getting 1 is the small but nonnegligible 2 −p / 2 , e.g. 2 − 54 in binary 64 .
Thus , it is safe to pass the outcome to log , but not safe to pass the outcome to log1p .
WARNING : The SRFI 27 and old MIT Scheme RNG API are not widely implemented as cryptographic PRNGs , so code written against them can't rely on them to be cryptographically secure in general .
Further , anything involving random - integer , random - real , or bignums is likely to be vulnerable to timing attacks .
But if you accidentally do use this API to generate cryptographic key material ( as SRFI 27 suggests ) then you might not be as bad off as you would have been before .
New pseudorandom number generator algorithm for random API .

Incompatible change
When the car of a weak pair is garbage collected , it is now replaced with a unique reclaimed object .
Previous releases instead used #f , which made it clumsy to represent #f as an ordinary value in the car .
This change will likely break any code explicitly using weak pairs .

Scheme now uses / tmp as the default temporary directory , not / var / tmp .
/ var / tmp is conventionally for temporary files that are persistent across reboot , e.g. vi recovery files , not for temporary files that we have no use for after a reboot .
Changes to arithmetic
A huge amount of work has been done on arithmetic , particularly floating - point arithmetic , by Taylor Campbell .
Feature New arithmetic procedures : ( log1p x ) = log ( 1 + x ) for any x in ( −1 , +∞ ) , −∞ for - 1 .
[ The primitive flo:log1p has a range restriction due to the Intel i387 CPU instruction . ] ( expm1 x ) = e x − 1 for any real x .
[ The primitive flo :expm1 has a range restriction due to the Intel i387 CPU instruction . ] ( log1 mexp x ) = log ( 1 − e x ) , for x < 0 ( log1 pexp x ) = log ( 1 + e x ) ( logistic x ) = 1 / ( 1 + e −x ) , inverse of logit ( logit p ) = log p /( 1 − p ) , inverse of logistic ( log-logistic x ) = log 1 / ( 1 + e −x ) , inverse of logit - exp ( logit - exp t ) = log e t / ( 1 − e t ) , inverse of log-logistic ( logit1 / 2+ p ) = ( logit (+ 1/2 p ) ) , inverse of logistic - 1/2 ( logistic - 1/2 x ) = (- ( logistic x ) 1/2 ) , inverse of logit1 / 2+ ( logsumexp ( list x y z ... ) ) = log ( e x + e y + e z + ... ) , guaranteed not to overflow or underflow ( copysign m s ) returns a real number with the magnitude of m and the sign of s. ( modexp b e m ) returns b e mod m .
New arithmetic procedures : Feature New flonum - related definitions : flo:radix Floating - point radix as an integer .
This is essentially always 2 but useful for assertions if you want to future - proof code that assumes it with a noisy failure in case we ever violate the assumption .
flo :radix .
Floating - point radix as a flonum .
flo : precision
Number of digits in a significand , including the hidden one bit for normal binary floating - point numbers .
For binary 64 floating - point , this is 53 .
flo : error - bound Greatest possible relative error in rounding to nearest .
flo : log - error - bound equal to ( log flo : error - bound ) flo:ulp - of - one Distance from 1 to next greater floating - point number .
Equal to twice flo : error - bound .
flo : log - ulp - of - one equal to ( log flo: ulp - of - one ) ( flo:ulp x ) Distance from x to the next floating - point number larger in magnitude with the same sign .
flo : normal - exponent - max Exponent of greatest integer power of flo :radix that is a finite floating - point number , as an exact integer .
Note that there are floating - point numbers greater than ( expt flo:radix . flo:normal - exponent - max ) — the greatest one is just below flo :radix times that .
But there are none that are a greater integer power of flo:radix .
flo :normal - exponent - min Exponent of least positive integer power of flo :radix that is a normal floating - point number , as an exact integer .
( expt flo:radix . flo:normal - exponent - min ) is also named flo:smallest - positive - normal .
flo:subnormal - exponent -min
Exponent of least positive integer power of flo :radix that is a nonzero , subnormal floating - point number , as an exact integer .
( expt flo:radix . flo:subnormal -exponent - min ) is the least positive floating - point number , also named flo:smallest - positive - subnormal . flo:smallest-positive-subnormal
Smallest positive subnormal . flo:smallest -positive-normal
Smallest positive normal .
flo:largest - positive - normal Largest positive normal .
flo:least - subnormal-exponent- base - 2
Least flonum input x for which ( expt 2 . x ) gives a nonzero result .
flo:least - subnormal-exponent - base-e
Least flonum input x for which ( exp x ) gives a nonzero result .
flo:least - subnormal-exponent-base -10
Least flonum input x for which ( expt 10 . x ) gives a nonzero result .
flo :least - normal - exponent - base - 2 Least flonum input x for which ( expt 2 . x ) gives a normal result .
flo : least - normal - exponent - base-e Least flonum input x for which ( exp x ) gives a normal result .
flo :least - normal - exponent - base - 10 Least flonum input x for which ( expt 10 . x ) gives a normal result .
flo:greatest-normal-exponent- base - 2
Greatest flonum input x for which ( expt 2 . x ) gives a finite result .
flo:greatest - normal - exponent - base-e
Greatest flonum input x for which ( exp x ) gives a finite result .
flo :greatest-normal-exponent-base -10
Greatest flonum input x for which ( expt 10 . x ) gives a finite result .
( flo:ldexp x e ) equal to x * 2 e ( flo: scalbn x e ) equal to x * b e , where b is flo:radix and e is an integer ( flo:logb y ) equal to e such that y = x * b e for x = ( flo : scalbn y (- e ) ) , and 1 ≤ x < b , and e is an integer ( flo:classify x ) returns one of the symbols zero subnormal normal infinite nan ( flo:subnormal ? x ) is true if x is subnormal ; false if zero , normal , infinite , or NaN ( flo:safe - zero ? x ) is true if x is zero ; false if subnormal , normal , infinite , or NaN. flo:zero ?
raises an invalid - operation exception on NaN ; flo : safe - zero ?
never does even on signalling NaN. ( flo:sign - negative ? x ) returns true if x has negative sign , false if x has positive sign .
Note that ( flo:negative ?
0. ) and ( flo:negative ? - 0. ) both return false , while ( flo:sign - negative ? - 0. ) returns true .
Also , flo:negative ?
raises invalid- operation exception on NaN , while flo:sign - negative ?
never does even on signalling NaN. ( flo : safe < x y ) ( flo : safe < = x y ) ( flo:safe > x y ) ( flo : safe > = x y ) ( flo:safe= x y ) ( flo:safe < > x y ) ( flo:unordered ? x y ) perform unordered floating - point comparisons and , unlike flo :< &c. , do not raise invalid - operation exceptions on quiet NaNs .
( However , they do raise invalid - operation exceptions on signalling NaNs. ) ( flo : <> x y ) returns true if x is less or greater than y , false if equal or unordered , and raises invalid - operation exceptions on any NaNs. ( flo:total< x y ) is true if x < y in the total ordering defined in IEEE 754-2008 Sec. 5.10 ; ( flo:total - order x y ) is a three - way comparison , − 1 if x < y , 0 if x = y , +1 if x > y. ( flo : total - mag< x y ) equal to ( flo:total < ( flo:abs x ) ( flo:abs y ) ) ( flo:total - order - mag x y ) equal to ( flo:total - order ( flo:abs x ) ( flo:abs y ) )
The eight min/max operations of IEEE 754-2019 are now supported : flo :min flo:max flo : min - mag flo : max - mag flo : min - num flo : max - num flo : min - mag - num flo: max - mag - num
The - mag variants compare magnitudes .
The - num variants treat NaN as missing data — if one operand is numeric and the other is NaN , they return the numeric operand and ignore the NaN , as the minNum / maxNum operations from IEEE 754-2008 did .
( flo : make - nan negative ? quiet ? payload ) returns a NaN with the specified payload , which must not exceed (- ( expt 2 flo:significand - digits - base - 2 2 ) 1 ) . ( flo:nan - quiet ? nan ) returns true for quiet NaNs , false for signalling NaNs. ( flo:nan - payload nan ) returns the payload of NaN , an integer between 0 ( inclusive ) and 2 51 ( exclusive ) .
New flonum - related definitions : Feature Floating - point exceptions are now not trapped by default .
This follows IEEE 754's semantics for the default mode , and it has been the case on some platforms ( e.g , macOS ) for some time .
If you want to trap on ( e.g. ) invalid - operation , you can do ( flo : with - exceptions - trapped ( flo:exception : invalid- operation ) ( lambda ( ) ... ) ) ( flo:trappable - exceptions ) gives the set of all exceptions that can be trapped .
Human - readable names are available by ( flo:exceptions - > names ( flo:trappable - exceptions ) ) .
You can also test for floating - point exceptions after a computation without trapping .
Before you can do this for the first time in any thread , you must clear the floating - point exceptions ( otherwise there may be residual garbage from past computations ) : ( flo:preserving - environment ( lambda ( ) ( flo:clear - exceptions ! ( flo:supported - exceptions ) ) ( let ( (x ( do- big- computation ) ) ) ( if ( not ( zero ? ( flo:test - exceptions ( flo:exception:underflow ) ) ) ) ( warn " underflow " ) ) x ) ) )
Floating - point exceptions are now not trapped by default .
Feature New procedures for floating - point fused - multiply / add : ( flo : *+ u v a ) computes u*v + a correctly rounded with no intermediate overflow or underflow ( flo : fma u v ) is the same , with a more familiar name ( flo : fast - fma ? ) returns true if fma is hardware - supported and false if it is emulated in software with Dekker 's double - precision algorithm
New procedures for floating - point fused - multiply / add : Feature Added support for hexadecimal floating - point notation .
Example : ( parameterize ( ( param : printer - radix # x10 ) ) ( write - to - string ( list # x1.5p10 1.5e10 0.1 ( flo:nextafter 0.1 1.0 ) ) ) ) ; Value : " (#x1.5p+10 #x1.bf08ebp+33 #x1.999999999999 ap-4 # x1.999999999999 bp - 4 ) "
Added support for hexadecimal floating - point notation .
Example : Feature New IEEE 754 procedures : ( decompose - ieee754 x base emax precision if - zero if - subnormal if - normal if - infinite if - nan ) ( decompose - ieee754 - binary x exponent - bits precision ) -> [ sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ] ( decompose - ieee754-binary32 x ) -> [ sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ] ( decompose - ieee754-binary64 x ) -> [ sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ] ( decompose -ieee754-binary 128 x ) -> [ sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ] ( compose - ieee754 - binary sign biased - exponent trailing - significand exponent - bits precision ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - binary32 sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - binary64 sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - binary 128 sign biased - exponent trailing - significand ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - zero sign ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - subnormal sign significand base emin precision ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - normal sign exponent significand base emin precision ) -> real ( compose - ieee754 - infinity sign ) -> real ( compose - ieee 754 - nan sign quiet payload ) -> nan ( ieee754-binary32-exact ? x ) -> boolean ( ieee754-binary64-exact ? x ) -> boolean ( ieee754-binary128-exact ? x ) -> boolean ( ieee754 - binary - hex - string x exponent - bits precision ) -> string ( ieee754-binary32-hex - string x ) -> string ( ieee754-binary64-hex - string x ) -> string ( ieee754-binary128-hex - string x ) -> string
New IEEE 754 procedures : Feature
The reader and printer now support notation for all distinct NaNs .
The sequence is sign type " . " payload , where sign is " + " or " - " , type is " nan " for quiet NaNs and " snan " for signalling NaNs , and payload is an integer represented in the current radix .
The notations + snan.0 and - snan.0 are forbidden because the bit pattern they would mean represents + inf.0 and - inf.0 instead .
The reader and printer now support notation for all distinct NaNs.
Feature

Complex numbers with nonfinite real and imaginary parts can be read and printed in rectangular notation now .
Bug fix Several bugs were fixed involving signed zero and branch cuts in complex numbers : - 0.+i is now correctly parsed as negative zero real part ; previously the negative was discarded and it was parsed as positive zero .
- 0. i is now correctly printed as such , not as +- 0.i . ( atan - 2i ) now returns the same result as ( atan 0. - 2i ) , not ( atan - 0. - 2i ) .
Several bugs were fixed involving signed zero and branch cuts in complex numbers :

Bug fix
The integer ?
procedure no longer returns true for infinities .
A side effect of this bug was that the compiler 's common subexpression elimination would crash when handling infinities , either written literally or due to constant folding : ; Compiling file : " ./floenv.bin " => " ./floenv.com " ...
; The object +inf.0 , passed as the first argument to flonum - normalize , is not the correct type .

Bug fix
The sqrt procedure now correctly propagates NaNs , handles complex numbers with infinities , and raises floating - point exceptions only where appropriate .
Other changes
With this release we are adopting the version - numbering conventions used by Emacs : Unreleased ( HEAD ) versions will be labeled x .
y- 1 .50 , where x is the next major version , and y is the next minor version .
For example , the current HEAD version is 11.0.50 , targeting the eventual release 11.1 .
Pre-release ( testing ) versions will be labeled x .
y- 1 .90 , x . y- 1 .91 , etc. Release ( stable ) versions will be labeled x .1 , x .2 , etc .
Releases after the .1 version are for bug fixes and small improvements only .
The release version is now embedded in the executable and library names , making it easier to have several different releases installed at the same time .
For example , this release 's executable would be stored at /usr / local / bin / mit - scheme - x86-64-11.0.90 while its library would be stored at /usr / local / lib / mit - scheme - x86-64-11.0.90 / .
Stable release 10.1.11
This is the final release of 10.1 ; release 11.1 should be out soon .
Bug fix
Fix printing of vectors , which was throwing an error in common circumstances .
Bug fix
Fix several issues with syntax - rules .
More are known , but they will be fixed in the 11.1 release .
Preparation
Make a small tweak to fasdump needed for building the 11.1 release .
Stable release 10.1.10
Feature Multiple values are now slightly more correct than previously .
But they are still not entirely compliant with R7RS .
Bug fix
Add missing definition to exact to reference manual .
Bug fix
Change write to generate datum labels only when there are cycles in the object being printed .
Bug fix HTTP I/O was failing on some cases with an empty body .
Bug fix Textual input from non-blocking ports was getting stuck in an infinite loop .
Bug fix Edwin was communicating with subprocesses using UTF - 8 encoding but has no support for this ; now it uses ISO 8859 - 1 instead .
Bug fix Several calls to read - bytevector !
were not handling EOF correctly .
Bug fix Interaction between let - syntax and define was incorrect , thinking the defines were in the environment of the let - syntax rather than the environment enclosing it .
Bug fix
Typo in parsing of close bracket caused failure in cases when it should have succeeded .
Bug fix Procedures flo :+inf.0 and flo :- inf.0 were being chosen when the distribution binaries were being built .
But these procedures are system specific , so are now chosen on the target system .
Performance change symbol <? to compare as UTF - 8 bytevector .
This makes it different from string <?
but much faster , which is more important for symbols .
Stable release 10.1.9
Bug fix
Fix botched edit in last release that broke Edwin .
Stable release 10.1.8
This is the " MIT Professors " release , after the two professors who reported the bugs .
Feature
When reading Scheme files , the reader now looks for and obeys a " coding " attribute .
For example ,
;; -*- coding : iso-8859-1 -*-
tells the reader to use iso - 8859 - 1 coding , rather than the default utf - 8 coding .
The file attributes line uses the same format that Emacs accepts ( multiple attributes separated by semicolons ) , except that the right - hand side of each attribute will be parsed by read and consequently must be valid Scheme syntax .
Bug fix
Make sure that Edwin reads and writes files in iso - 8859 - 1 coding .
This is the only coding that Edwin supports since it uses single - byte strings .
Note that there is no way to automatically override the default coding when writing files , other than to use ( port / set - coding port coding ) on the output port after opening it and before writing to it .
Bug fix
Fix a minor bug in IMAIL .
Stable release 10.1.7
Feature Some support for upcoming changes to the ABI and compiler .
Performance More performance improvements for Edwin and IMAIL .

Bug fix
Fix printing of string slices .
Performance Minor tweak to character sets in Edwin regexps .
Stable release 10.1.5
Bug fix Fix problems from X11 graphics support .
Bug fix Top - level definition should return the name when evaluated .
Feature Change param : reader - fold - case ? to be settable .
Stable release 10.1.4
Bug fix
Fix problem where Scheme crashes when running under Emacs using -- emacs .
Bug fix
Fix breakage that caused legacy make - hash - table to throw an exception .
Feature Implement position option for textual ports , export binary - port - position , set - binary - port - position ! , and binary - port - length , and fix bug in position of binary output ports .
Feature Allow use of bundle ?
as a bundle predicate .
Also allow #f to be passed , meaning the same thing .
Feature New printer parameter param : print - hash - number - in - objects ?
controls whether objects with #[...] printed representation will contain the hash number for the object .
By default , it 's true so there 's no change in behavior .
Performance Speed up string operations for Edwin and IMAIL .
These changes should provide noticeable improvements .
Performance
Do n't use general predicate relations for record predicates ; there 's no advantage , and it's far slower than just chasing the parent link .
Stable release 10.1.3
Revise unix installation notes to be more specific .
A bunch of changes to smooth the process of installation .
Bug fix make flo :integer ?
answer true only for finite inputs .
Stable release 10.1.2
Bug fix x11 plugin was n't being recompiled when installing from native distribution .
Stable release 10.1.1
Bug fix
Fix problem that required a working mit-scheme when building and installing one of the distributed native builds .
Stable release 10.1
This release has a few high - level changes in addition to those detailed below :
We are n't distributing any binaries for Windows systems .
The reason for this is that the 32 - bit versions we 've made in the past are nearly unusable in modern Windows systems , and there 's a fair amount of work to get a 64 - bit version that none of the current maintainers is interested in doing .
We 're distributing only 64 - bit binaries for macOS systems because the toolchain in recent releases has deprecated 32 - bit support .
The portable C version is not included in this release because we were unable to get it working in time .
Finally , we hope to have a new point release relatively soon , since there is a long list of minor cleanups that are needed ; it was felt that getting a release out was more important than making it perfect .
Major new features
R7RS !
Most of R7RS is now supported , with some exceptions : Libraries do n't autoload yet ; this will be added in the next release .
Multiple - value returns are usable only in restricted ways .
This can't be fixed without significant compiler work , which probably wo n't happen .
Note that one of the new features of R7RS is parameters , which provide a portable way to do dynamic binding .
As of this release , the use of fluid - let is deprecated ; it will be removed entirely in a future release .
Also note that the REPL has not changed its behavior .
That 's also true of the loader and the compiler , but these automatically detect when a file contains R7RS code and treats it appropriately .
These changes allow existing code to continue working while new code can be written .
!
Most of is now supported , with some exceptions : Support for Unicode : NFC and NFD normalization is supported ; most strings are NFC .
Conversions between strings and UTF - { 8,16,32} bytevectors are supported .
Symbols , the reader , the printer , and textual ports all support Unicode .
Character sets now support Unicode , and have been significantly tuned for space , using an inversion list .
New regsexp regular - expression matcher supports Unicode .
The old regular - expression matcher and rexp do not .
Edwin does not support Unicode .
A foreign function interface has been added to support dynamic loading of C libraries and communicating with them from Scheme .
This interface has been used to replace many of the formerly hand - written interfaces to various libraries , and these are now available as plugins .
A virtual machine , svm , has been implemented and is supported as a " native code " target for building .
Although fairly slow compared to native code , it has the advantage of working on any architecture .
In this release we provide a 64 - bit version .
We 're not currently providing a 32 - bit version , but it can be built if needed .

Thread Events
The definition of block - on - io - descriptor outlines the thread event driven process underlying Scheme 's multi-tasking IO .

The run-shell - command procedure now takes advantage of the ability to block on two IO channels and a subprocess status .
The procedure can do fully asynchronous IO to / from the subprocess and , with output flushing , acts more like a subshell .
Minor new features
Changes to plugins : A new command line option , -- prepend - library , is convenient for testing a plugin before installing it .
The plugins now use libtool .
Plugin package installation scripts can use procedures provided by the C/ FFI to install their code and documentation .
The latter can be added to compressed or uncompressed Info and HTML indices .

X11 support is now dynamically loadable , not a compile - time option .
Stable release 9.0
Preliminary support for symmetric multi-processing has been added , though the core functionality remains on an alternate branch .
A multi-processing Scheme cannot rely onfor exclusive , atomic access to the entire system .
Thusis deprecated .
Many of the system 's uses ofsought only to avoid interruption of a set of data structure modifications that would leave the data in an inconsistent state .
These applications ofwere replaced with applications of a new procedure : .
Users ofandrelied onto ensure a subprocess could not change status between examining the tick and blocking to wait for a tick .
Without , these users needed another mechanism to reliably block for subprocess status changes .
The IO system already does this for IO using thread events , so a procedure similar towas added : GC notifications previously ran in the after - gc interrupt handler , in whatever thread took the GC trap , or no thread at all if the thread system trapped .
Unfortunately the notification procedure wants to write to a thread 's dynamically bound current output port .
Edwin uses this to re-direct the GC notices to itsbuffer .
When the thread system trapped , a random thread 's ( but often the only thread 's ) dynamic state was used to get a current output port .
In anticipation of more finely threaded ( and multi- processing ) worlds , all of the surprising behavior was taken out of GC notifications .
Interested threads are required to register and each runs a thread event soon after the flip ( like an interrupt ) .
( Note that we 're skipping the 8.x version numbers because long ago there was an 8.x series that we never released . )
In the past my ( Chris Hanson 's ) policy for a stable release was that the documentation had to be updated for the release before it went out .
In practice , this has meant that there have been no stable releases in recent years .
As of this release , we will no longer consider updated documentation a prerequisite for a stable release .
Major changes
The compiler has been ported to the x86 - 64 architecture , allowing Scheme programs to take advantage of very large address spaces and improved performance ( due to additional registers ) on that architecture .
The compiler 's C back end has been resurrected , allowing the system to be run on most computer architectures ( under unix - like systems only ) .

The load - noisily and load - latest procedures are now just aliases for load .
System usage changes
The default configuration has been changed to reflect modern usage .
Many command - line options and environment variables have been eliminated or are ignored .
Specifically :
The all.com band is now used by default , meaning that the compiler and Edwin are both loaded .
In order to use the smaller runtime.com band , it must be explicitly specified with the -- band option .
The -- compiler and -- edwin options are now accepted but ignored .
The env vars MITSCHEME_COMPILER_BAND , MITSCHEME_EDWIN_BAND , and MITSCHEME_ALL_BAND are now ignored .
The default heap size is now set at 4 megawords , much larger than our previous large size , and adequate for general use .
The -- large option is now ignored , and all difference between large and small memory sizes is eliminated .
The old MITSCHEME_LARGE_ foo and MITSCHEME_SMALL_ foo environment variables are ignored , replaced by two new vars MITSCHEME_HEAP_SIZE and MITSCHEME_STACK_SIZE .
( There 's no var for constant size since it 's rarely necessary to specify it . )
The compiler now generates type and range checks by default , in order to make compiled code more robust .
The runtime system is now compiled this way as well .
New declarations ( no - type- checks ) and ( no- range - checks ) allow these defaults to be overridden .
This change will cause some performance degredation ; we 're interested in hearing about situations in which this is a significant problem .

Changes to IMAIL
IMAIL has improved sorting that works much better on large folders .
IMAIL can now parse MIME in any folder , not just in IMAP folders .
Testing release 7.7.90
As of this release , MIT Scheme is a part of the GNU project and has been renamed MIT / GNU Scheme .
The project is now hosted on Savannah .
License text in the source files has been changed , and a license / warranty statement is now emitted during boot , to conform to the GNU coding standards .
This is the first testing release of MIT / GNU Scheme .
I had originally planned to do a stable 7.8.0 release , but time pressures have made it difficult to bring the documentation up to date , so this release comes with out - of - date documentation .
Additionally , there will be binaries only for GNU / Linux ; users of other systems will have to wait for the stable release .
Incompatibilities with previous releases
In releases 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 , variable definitions ( i.e. instances of the define special form ) appearing inside let - syntax modified the environment outside of the let - syntax , while syntax definitions ( instances of the define - syntax special form ) modified the environment corresponding to the let - syntax form .
However , according to R5RS this is incorrect : all definitions should modify the environment corresponding to the let - syntax form .
The syntax has been changed to conform to R5RS .
The record abstraction has received a major update .
The primary purpose of this update has been to improve the performance of constructors , and to implement keyword constructors for records .
As a consequence , the representation of record types has been changed .
Because record types are constructed at load time , this has no effect on previously - compiled code .
However , the define - structure macro was also changed to use these new facilities .
The interface between define - structure and the record abstraction was changed to increase performance , and consequently previously - compiled instances of define - structure no longer work and must be recompiled .
A further change to define - structure is that the initial - value expressions are interpreted in a different way .
Previously , an undocumented feature of these expressions was that they could refer to other supplied record field names as free variables .
This no longer works ; instead these expressions are closed in the environment in which the define - structure macro appears .
The default type - descriptor name for define - structure has changed .
Previously , for a structure defined as ( define - structure foo bar ) the type descriptor was named foo .
Now , the type descriptor is named rtd:foo .
This change is useful primarily because it is common to name variables that hold objects of this type foo , and when the type descriptor has the same name , it causes confusion between references to the descriptor and unintended free references to an object .
( After making this change , several such free references were found in the MIT / GNU Scheme code . )
Finally , define - structure now defines a type descriptor for every structure definition , including structures without tags .
Previously this was done only for tagged structures .
The representation of character objects has been changed to provide direct support for Unicode .
Previously , the representation had 16 bits of code and 5 bucky bits .
The new representation has 21 bits of code and 4 bucky bits ( the " top " bucky bit has been eliminated ) .
This allows direct representation of the entire Unicode space .
In addition , the syntax of characters has been extended to allow arbitrary Unicode characters to be represented .
The new syntax is # \U+ XXXX , where XXXX is a sequence of hexadecimal digits specifying a Unicode code point .
This supersedes an undocumented syntax # \< code XXXX > .
The runtime library 's support for Unicode has been completely rewritten , and now has support for UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 , and UTF - 32 encodings , as well as support for wide strings .
The UTF - 8 codec has been fixed to signal errors for overlong coding sequences .
The special form define - syntax has been changed so that the right - hand side may be a keyword .
This can be used to make aliases for existing keywords , such as ( define - syntax sequence begin )
In pre-7.7 versions of MIT / GNU Scheme , the right - hand side of the special form define - syntax was a procedure , such as ( define - syntax foo ( lambda ... ) )
This behavior was preserved in the 7.7 versions by a kludge that made the above equivalent to ( define - syntax foo ( non-hygienic - macro - transformer ( lambda ... ) ) )
With this release , the old syntax has been eliminated .
It is now necessary to use the non-hygienic - macro - transformer special form in these cases .
( Note , however , that non-hygienic - macro - transformer is also a kludge and is not guaranteed to produce working macros .
You should rewrite your macros in hygienic form to guarantee proper operation . )
Command - line options now start with -- rather than - , again for compliance with GNU coding standards .
The older - prefix still works but may eventually be dropped .
The external representation of symbols has been extended to support the quoting mechanisms of Common Lisp .
This means that there is a standard external representation for every interned symbol .
For example , the notations |abcDEF| , foo|BAR|baz , and abc\ def respectively represent the symbols whose names are " abcDEF " , " fooBARbaz " , and " abc def " .
This change introduces an incompatibility in the way that symbols are printed .
Previously , ( write symbol ) was equivalent to ( write - string ( symbol - > string symbol ) ) .
Now , ( write symbol ) always writes the symbol out with appropriate quoting so that it will read back in as the same symbol .
Changes to the runtime system
A new command - line option -- batch - mode disables output of banners , prompts , and values .
This is intended for use with shell scripts , where the Scheme program writes to standard output and the author does n't want the output cluttered by the interactivity cues .
Note that the effect of this option applies only to the top - level REPL ; if an error occurs , all the interactivity cues are re-enabled in the error REPL .
The following SRFI s are now supported : 0 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 23 , and 30 .
The following newly - implemented procedures are notable : exact - positive - integer ?
host - big - endian ?
make - top - level - environment x-graphics / open - display ?
x- graphics / open - window ?
The tcp - server - connection - accept procedure now accepts an optional argument line - translation , which sets the line translation to be used for newly - accepted sockets .
( Thanks to Arthur Gleckler )
Output ports now track the current column .
This is simple minded but should work for ASCII , at least .
The URI support procedures , formerly a part of IMAIL , are now in the runtime library .
Changes to Edwin
HTML mode is now used for " .xml " files , and PHP mode for " .inc " files .
VC mode has a new editor variable vc - cvs - stay - local that implements a small subset of the corresponding functionality in GNU Emacs .
The debug - on -*- error editor variables can now be set to 'ask , which causes the user to be prompted for the debugger when the corresponding error occurs .
The default settings of these variables have been changed to be more appropriate for typical users .
Changes to XML support
Support for XML namespaces has been implemented .
One consequence of this is that the representation of XML names has been changed .
It is no longer the case that XML names can be compared with eq ? ; instead one must use the new xml - name= ? .
Additionally , xml - intern now takes an optional second argument , which is the URI of the namespace .
XML names that do n't have an associated namespace URI are now ordinary interned symbols , which greatly simplifies reference to such names .
Comments are preserved by the parser .
The parser now distinguishes between < foo ></ foo > and < foo /> in its output .
The former has a contents list of ( " " ) , while the latter has a contents list of ( ) .
Optional indentation is supported for DTD and attributes during output .
The parser now supports handlers for processing instructions , which are invoked during parsing .
A handler maps the text of a processing instruction to a list of XML items , which are inserted into the resulting XML structure in place of the processing instruction .
The following new procedures are available to make XML input and output more convenient : read - xml read - xml - file write - xml - file string -> xml substring -> xml xml -> string xml-> wide - string
All the remaining bugs identified by the XML conformance tests have been fixed , except support for UTF - 16 .
Stable release 7.7.1
Release 7.7.1 fixes several bugs in IMAIL ; fixes a bug that prevented the use of server sockets on Windows systems ; and fixes a bug that caused the debugger to generate errors in common circumstances .
Stable release 7.7.0
This release provides hygienic macro support , as defined in R4RS and R5RS .
This is a complete rewrite of the syntax engine , so any program that uses macros should be rewritten to use the new engine .
A subset of the old macro- definition syntax is still supported , but this will eventually be removed .
Note that the new syntax engine has no effect on the compiled - code format ; most binaries compiled by release 7.6.x should continue to work .
User-visible consequences to this change
These syntactic keywords have been eliminated : define - macro in - package macro make - environment scode - quote sequence unassigned ?
using - syntax
The syntactic keyword the - environment has been restricted to use in top - level environments .
It is no longer allowed in the body of any binding form ( e.g. lambda , let ) .
Syntactic keywords are now stored in environments , rather than in a separate syntax - table structure .
The environment abstraction has been enhanced to support this , as well as to make it more general .
The changes are documented in the reference manual .
The syntax - table abstraction has been eliminated , and most procedures and arguments involving syntax tables have been removed .
One exception is the load procedure , which still accepts a syntax - table argument , but ignores it .

I wonder whether Americans realize that they have a Vienna sausage military at filet mignon prices .
The sorry performance in recent wars is just one example of the ongoing rot , but the whole enterprise has become unbalanced , aimed at fighting the kinds of enemies we do n’t have instead of the ones we have recently chosen to make .
The Navy is a fine example .
The carrier battle group , the heart of the Navy , is a hugely expensive way to get relatively few combat aircraft to a remote place .
It is a relic of World War II , for which it was well suited .
Since it was then fighting similar battle groups , the strengths and weaknesses were more or less matched .
But the Navy has not fought a war for 60 years , certainly not one it needed to win , and it shows .
Today ’s battle groups , CVBGs as we say , are almost indistinguishable from those of 1945 , except for the upgrading of weapons .
Instead of five - inch - thirty - eights , we have Standard missiles .
Instead of F4F Hellcats , the F - 18 Hornet .
Yet the carrier is still the Mother Ship , protected by screens of cruisers and destroyers , with interceptors flying CAP .
The problem is that the enemy has changed .
Bear in mind that a great many countries fear attack by the United States , among them such trivial nations as Russia , China , and Iran .
None of these has the money to build carrier groups to oppose those of the Navy .
All of these have thought about cheap ways to overcome the U.S. behemoth .
Four solutions soon came to hand :
Very fast sea-skimming cruise missiles , such as the Brahmos and Brahmos II ( Mach 5 + ) .
Supercavitating torpedoes , reaching speeds of over 200 miles an hour .
Very quiet submarines , diesel - electrics in the case of poor countries .
Anti-ship ballistic missiles , such as the one attributed to the Chinese .
Any military buff knows that the Navy cannot defend itself against these .
It says it can .
It has to say it can .
In fleet exercises against submarines , the subs always win – easily .
The Pentagon has been trying to invent defenses against ballistic missiles since the days of Reagan ( remember Star Wars ? ) with miserable results .
If you have close friends in the Navy , ask them over a few beers what scares the bejesus out of them .
Easy : Swarms of fast , stealthy , sea- skimming cruise missiles with multi-mode terminal guidance .
Add to the brew that today ’s ships are fragile , based on the assumption that they will never be hit .
Go aboard a WWII battleship like the Iowa , BB - 61 ( I have ) and you will find 16 - inch belt armor and turrets designed to withstand an asteroid strike .
Now go aboard a Ticonderoga - class Aegis boat ( I have ) .
You will find an electronic marvel with big screens in a darkened CIC and an amazing SPY - 1 phased - array radar that one burst of shrapnel would take out of commission for many months .
Now note that cruise missiles have ranges in the hundreds of miles .
Think : Persian Gulf .
A cruise missile can be boxed and mounted on a truck , a fast launch , or a tramp steamer .
The Chinese ballistic missile has a range of 1,200 miles , enough to keep carriers out of aircraft range of Taiwan .
I wonder whether the Chinese have thought of that ?
In short , the day of surface navies seems to be coming to a close , at least as strategically decisive forces .
So does the day of the manned fighter as Predator - style " drones " improve .
What happens now ?
Nothing – for the moment .
To understand the problem , assume for the moment that the Navy knew beyond doubt , and openly admitted in internal discussion , that it could not protect its surface ships from modern anti-ship missiles .
What would it do ?
What could it do ?
Nothing .
Why ?
Because , apart from the missile submarines , which have no role in combat , the Navy is the surface fleet .
Many , many billions of dollars are invested in carriers and careers , in escorts for carriers , in countless men trained to run them .
Mothball the carriers , and the Navy becomes a few troop ships useful for unopposed landings .
Maintaining a large fleet only to support the Pentagon ’s preferred role of massacring half - armed peasants would just be too costly .
So , does the Navy say to Congress , " We really are n’t of much use any longer .
We suggest that you scrap the ships and put the money into something else " ?
Mankind does n’t work that way .
The appeals of tradition , ego , and just plain fun run high .
( Never underestimate the importance of ego and fun in military policy . )
A CVBG is a magnificent thing , just not very useful .
The glamor of night flight ops , planes trapping ker - whang ! , engines howling at full mil , 30 knots of wind over the flight deck , cat shots throwing fighters into the air – this stuff appeals powerfully to something deep in the male head .
The Navy is n’t going to give this up .
Thus it ca n’t admit that its day comes to a close , whether it knows it , suspects it , or refuses to think about it .
The carrier is forever .
Unless one gets sunk .
Which ( I suspect ) is unlikely , because the admirals wo n’t risk the test .
I do n’t know what Iran has , but , if a shoot - out came and half a dozen ships appeared on international television smoking and listing with large holes in them , that would be the end of the Navy ’s credibility .
Remember what happened when an Iraqi fighter hit the USS Stark with two French Exocet missiles : the missiles worked perfectly , and the Stark ‘s multitudinous and sophisticated defenses failed utterly .
The Navy produced all manner of face - saving explanations .
Predictably , the military contractors will offer surefire extremely expensive defenses , things like directed - energy , that will develop more slowly than missiles and experience massive cost overruns , which is what weapons are for .
John Paul Jones , slave - trader turned naval hero , once said that he meant to go in harm ’s way .
Today ’s
Navy will stay farther and farther out of harm ’s way , which will be wise of it , and become an immensely pricey collection of symbolic iron yachts .
So what is the cavalry doing as it eyes machine guns and barbed wire ?
Buying a better horse .
The Navy wants the Ford - class ( CVN 78 ) super - carrier , which I think might better be named the USS Thundertrinket .
What will it do that the current Nimitz - class carriers do n’t ?
Cost more ( $ 8 billion for the first copy , plus $ 5 billion R&D. A bargain . )
To the uninitiated , that may seem a lot for a high - tech crossbow , but it will put lots of jobs in Norfolk , Va. , and send money to military contractors .
Good thing the U.S. has a robust economy .
You can put mayonnaise on a Vienna sausage and eat it , but you ca n’t do that with an aircraft carrier .
President Barack Obama said he wanted to honor the legacy of Associate Justice John Paul Stevens with his nominee .
If so , he has chosen to honor it in the breach with a nominee who is likely to dismantle a significant part of Stevens ’ legacy .
As with Justice Sonia Sotomayor , President Obama has decided to nominate someone who is demonstrably more conservative than the person she is replacing on some issues –potentially moving the Court to the right .
I discussed on the nomination on this segment of Countdown .
For many liberals and civil libertarians , the Kagan nomination is a terrible act of betrayal after the President campaigned so heavily on the issue of the Supreme Court during his campaign .
He is now replacing a liberal icon with someone who has testified that she does not believe in core protections for accused individuals in the war on terror .
During her confirmation hearing Kagan testified that she believed that anyone suspected of helping finance Al Qaeda should be stripped of protections and held under indefinite detention without a trial — agreeing with the Bush Administration .
Stevens himself would occasionally vote with the conservative justices .
Thus , it is possible that in those areas , like flag burning , Kagan could shift the vote back to the left .
However , in two of the few areas where she has given her views ( terrorism and free speech ) , Kagan states more conservative views .
In one interesting exchange , Kagan not only states that she believes we are “ at war ” but agrees that we should have considered ourselves at war since the 1990s :
GRAHAM : OK .
Well , that would make him your boss , yes .
But it seems to be — I think he ’ll be a good boss .
And I think you ’d be very qualified for you job . [. . .]
I asked him , “ Do you think we ’re at war ” ?
And he said , “ I do n’t think there ’s any question but that we ’re at war . ”
I think , to be honest , I think our nation did n’t realize that we ’re at war when , in fact , we were .
When I look back at the ’90s and the Tanzania , the embassy bombings , the bombing of the Cole , I think we , as a nation , should have realized that , at that point , we were at war .
We should not have waited until September 11 , 2001 to make that determination .
Do you agree with that ?
KAGAN : It ’s easy to agree with my boss in that circumstance .
Graham also asks her the same question posed to Holder on whether people accused of financing terrorism ( even when not captured on a traditional battlefield ) should be stripped of their rights as enemy combatants .
She answers in the affirmative :
GRAHAM : Well , I certainly do too .
And I told him I thought what he was speaking of was the morale high ground .
There ’s a physical high ground in — in traditional war .
But in this war , there ’s the moral high ground and we have to maintain that moral high ground .
I think at times we ’ve lost it .
We also have to remember they ’re at — we ’re at war .
Now , I asked him this question , “ Now , when you talk about the physical battlefield , if our intelligence agency should capture someone in the Philippines that is suspected of financing al Qaida worldwide , would you consider that person part of the battlefield , even though we ’re in the Philippines , if they were involved in al Qaida activity ” ?
Holder said , the attorney general said , yes , I would .
Do you agree with that ?
KAGAN : I — I do .
Kagan ’s writings ( as little as there is ) is highly problematic for liberals .
Her writings on hate speech indicate a willingness to compromise on free speech issues .
This is a similar view as expressed and criticized with Justice Sotomayor .
Kagan ’s 1996 article “ Private Speech , Public Purpose : The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine ” in the University of Chicago Law Review should make any free speech advocate feel uncomfortable .
In the article , Kagan suggests a broader basis for possible government regulation of speech and suggests that it should be the motives of the government ( as opposed to the right to free speech ) that should control the inquiry .
I argue , notwithstanding the Court ’s protestations in O’Brien , that First Amendment law , as developed by the Supreme Court over the past several decades , has as its primary , though unstated , object the discovery of improper governmental motives .
The doctrine comprises a series of tools to flush out illicit motives and to invalidate actions infected with them .
Or , to put the point another way , the application of First Amendment law is best under - stood and most readily explained as a kind of motive - hunting .
On one level , the article is descriptive of the existing case law while offering a different way to viewing disparate rulings .
However , she appears to support a broader scope for the regulation of hate speech and pornography .
In Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography After R.A.V. in The University of Chicago ( 1993 ) , Kagan explores different ways to regulate both pornography and hate speech .
Kagan latches on to an approach that has long been controversial with free speech advocate — obscenity as a basis for limiting speech in areas like pornography :
The key point here is that regulation of obscenity may accomplish some , although not all , of the goals of the anti-pornography movement ; and partly because of the long - established nature of the category , such regulation may give rise to fewer concerns of compromising First Amendment principles .
Even for those who think that the obscenity doctrine is in some sense a second - best alternative , it represents the first - best hope of achieving certain objectives .
While Kagan refers to such suggestions as “ trial balloons ” it suggests a more fluid notion of first amendment protections :
The presumption against viewpoint discrimination , relied upon in Hudnut and further strengthened in R.A.V. , has come to serve as the very keystone of First Amendment jurisprudence .
This presumption , in my view , has real worth , in protecting against improperly motivated governmental action and against distorting effects on public discourse .
And even if I assign it too great a value , the principle still will have to be taken into account by those who favor any regulation either of hate speech or of pornography .
I have suggested in this Essay that the regulatory efforts that will achieve the most , given settled law , will be the efforts that may appear , at first glance , to promise the least .
They will be directed at conduct , rather than speech .
They will be efforts using viewpoint - neutral classifications .
They will be efforts taking advantage of the long - established unprotected category of obscenity .
Such efforts will not eradicate all pornography or all hate speech from our society , but they can achieve much worth achieving .
They , and other new solutions , ought to be debated and tested in a continuing and multi-faceted effort to enhance the rights of minorities and women , while also respecting core principles of the First Amendment .
It will be interesting to see how this nuanced view of the first amendment plays out in the Snyder vs Phelps case involving the Westboro church , here .
Under the so - called Ginsburg rule , it is unlikely that we are going to get much substantive discussion of such views .
Ironically , Kagan helped create that rule as a staff on Ginsburg ’s nomination .
She once called confirmation hearings “ vapid and hollow ” — a tradition that she may now embrace .
As in earlier hearings , the Democrats are unlikely to call any witnesses on these liberal concerns and the Republicans are likely to support those more conservative views .
The result is likely to be entirely vapid as Kagan suggested .
Unlike Republicans who oppose GOP nominees if they are insufficiently conservative , Democratic senators have shown that they do not fight for such ideological strength in a nominee .
Even in the early commentary , it is distressing how the discussion immediately focused on the politics rather than the substance of the nomination .
As with Sotomayor , the media appears unable to have a discussion about the substantive views of a nominee .
There is no question that Kagan has proven leadership ability , particularly as a consensus builder .
She was able to lead Harvard Law School and end the liberal / conservative fighting on that faculty .
However , she is not considered an intellectual leader in the teaching academy .
She has actually written comparatively little as an academic .
She has written only a few significant law review articles and a collection of shorter pieces .
She appears to have received tenure at the University of Chicago based on a single article — something that would not be permitted at most top schools .
What writing is there is not welcome by civil libertarians , which shows a lack of commitment to the very “ fundamental rights ” that President Obama referenced this morning in his nominating speech .
When it comes to free speech and detainee rights , she ( like the President ) adopts a more legally relativistic approach .
While conservatives are likely to attack her on her banning military recruiters from campus , she has largely avoided controversial writings or positions in her career .
For liberals , the problem is her “ pragmatic ” approach to civil liberties and support for Bush policies .
Stevens was the fifth vote in opposing such policies and Kagan could well flip that result .
Few could have imagined that voting for Obama would have resulted in moving the Court to the right , but that appears to be case with the selection of Kagan .
Obama ’s record on civil liberties has long been attributed to a rather cold calculus that liberals have no where to go and that he should continue to play to the middle and right of the political spectrum .
I am not so certain .
There is no evidence that Obama actually believes in some of the principles that Stevens fought for , particularly in the area of terrorism .
What is clear is that he has selected someone who will honor that legacy by dismantling a significant part of it if her testimony before the Senate last year is any measure .

Suzuki is a Japanese corporation that manufactures automobiles , four - wheel drive vehicles , ATVs , motorcycles and outboard engines .
It is headquartered in Hamamatsu , Japan .
The company was founded as the Suzuki Loom Works by Michio Suzuki in 1909 .
Even though the company was flourishing well , Suzuki decided to expand the business to the automotive industry in 1937 .
The project got off to a good start and the company produced a series of prototypes that were powered by four - stroke , four - cylinder engines .
With the onset of the Second World War , the company was forced to halt any further automotive plans .
After the War , the company returned to manufacturing looms .
The company returned to motor - vehicle production in 1951 , producing its first motorcycle , the Power Free .
It was in 1955 that the company released its first automobile , the Suzulight , a front - wheel drive vehicle with a rack - and - pinion steering .
In 1963 , Suzuki opened its first motorcycle subsidiary in the United States .
In 1968 , the brand released the Jimny , a 2 - door off - road vehicle .
The Jimny was the first vehicle to be marketed in the United States as the Suzuki Samurai in 1985 .
In 1988 , the Sidekick ( also known as Escudo and Vitara ) was rolled out in a joint - venture between Suzuki and General Motors .
In 1995 , the X - 90 , a two - seater SUV was rolled off the assembly lines .
The XL7 , a mid-size SUV that was rolled out in 2001 , was the last three - row vehicle manufactured by the brand .
In 2009 , the brand released the Kizashi , a mid-size car .

The other popular models of the Suzuki lineup include the XL - 7 , Verona and Forenza .
A 15 - year - old Pomona boy was recovering Monday morning after accidentally impaling himself on a javelin .
The accident occurred Sunday afternoon at Westmont Park Community Center on 9th Street in Pomona ,
The boy was apparently running around the center when he somehow ran into the javelin .
A witness told KTLA News that the javelin sliced into the side of his body and he fell to the floor in pain .
He called for help and then pulled the javelin out of himself .
The witness said the boy , whose name was not released by the Los Angeles County Fire Department , appeared to be in shock .

Hedge fund manager paycheck : $ 4 billion
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After plunging during the financial crisis , the income of top hedge fund managers surged in 2009 to a record high as financial markets recovered from historic lows , according to a new survey published Thursday .
Altogether , the 25 top - earning hedge fund managers made a record $ 25.3 billion last year , according to rankings in AR : Absolute Return + Alpha , a magazine dedicated to the hedge fund industry .
The highest paid manager on the list was David Tepper of Appaloosa Management , who made $ 4 billion last year on investments in the financial sector .
" There was a lot of investing in bank stocks last year , " said Michelle Celarier , editor of Absolute Return + Alpha , adding that Tepper braved the sector at a time when most investors were rattled by fears of a financial collapse .
George Soros , a Hungarian - born investor who made his name in the currency market , had the second largest annual income at $ 3.3 billion .
The top earner in last year 's list , James Simons of Renaissance Technologies , came in third with a $ 2.5 billion payday .
John Paulson of John Paulson & Co. , who made billions in 2007 betting against the housing market , took home $ 2.3 billion .
All told , last year was the best year since 2007 , when the top managers brought in $ 22.3 billion , which was the previous all - time high in the nine year history of the survey .
The performance also marked a dramatic comeback from the beating managers took during the financial crisis .
In 2008 , top managers pay fell nearly 50 % to $ 11.6 billion as global financial markets erupted in turmoil and credit evaporated .
After bottoming a 12 - year low in March , however , the stock market staged a powerful rally in 2009 as investors bet the economy was poised to emerge from one of the worst recessions on record .
" The hedge funds that survived 2008 were able to capture the gains on the way up in 2009 , " said Nadia Papagiannis , a hedge fund analyst at Morningstar .
Hedge fund returns rose 19.6 % last year , she said , compared with a loss of 22 % in 2008 .
In addition to market gains , many of the top earners ran funds that avoided major losses during the crisis , she said .
Those funds that stayed above the " high water mark " between profits and losses were able to charge fees of up to 20 % , while funds that fell below could only charge 2 % last year .
However , the outlook for the hedge fund industry is mixed , with many investors moving to the sidelines to await more confirmation that the economy has fully recovered .
As of February , hedge fund returns tracked by Morningstar were down 1 % .
" This year is not going to be as lucrative as last year , " Papagiannis said .
" There 's not enough of room for another rally as big as we saw in ' 09 . "
Hookers Hustle Soccer Suckers !
Prostitutes from around the world are making their way to South Africa hoping to make a fortune from frisky soccer fans at next month ’s World Cup .
Authorities predict 40,000 sex workers will arrive to greet 500,000 foreign fans .
Most are coming from South Africa ’s impoverished neighboring countries , although one hotel boss says prostitutes have arrived from as far away as China , Venezuela , and Pakistan .
Human rights activists warn that many of the women have been trafficked and urge hotels to shun the sex trade .
In desperately poor parts of Zimbabwe , some women have left their husbands to travel to South Africa .
‘ Marriages are fast breaking up with women choosing to stay alone in South Africa ’s hotels and lodges , ” a village elder in southern Zimbabwe tells the Christian Science Monitor .
“ But the most unfortunate part , is what are they going to do after the World Cup ? ”

Whitty worries :
Voiced or not , addressed or not , the problem of overpopulation has not gone away .
The miracle of the Green Revolution , which fed billions and provided the world a sense of limitless hope , also disguised four ominous truths about Earth 's limits .
First , the revolution 's most effective agents , chemical fertilizers of nitrogen and phosphorus , are destined to run out , along with the natural resources used to produce them .
Second , the fertilizers , pesticides , and herbicides that grew the food that enabled our enormous population growth in the 20th century bore expensive downstream costs in the form of polluted land , water , and air that now threaten life .
Third , crop yields today are holding stubbornly stable and even beginning to fall in some places , despite increasing fertilizer use , in soils oversaturated with nitrogen .
The Green Revolution 's duplicitous harvest giving life with one hand , robbing life - support with the other also masked a fourth ominous truth .
We 're running out of topsoil , tossing it to the wind via mechanized agriculture and losing it to runoff and erosion .
THE federal opposition is yet to formulate a position on the proposed internet filter despite Labor flagging its intention to introduce the measure before the last election .
The failure of Coalition leader Tony Abbott or his communications spokesman Tony Smith to indicate whether they would support the bill reflects divisions within the party about the government 's plan to block access to internet sites banned under Australia 's classification rules .
The Greens are opposed to the filter , giving the Liberals the crucial votes in the Senate that determine the success of Communications Minister Stephen Conroy 's plan , which has attracted criticism from Google , the United States and others in the internet industry .
On Monday night , when asked about the filter on the ABC 's Q&A program , Mr Abbott explained key arguments for and against the proposal but did not articulate a definitive position .
'' I want to see protections in place , '' the Opposition Leader said .
'' I do n't want to see our kids exposed to really terrible stuff on the internet .
On the other hand , I do n't want to see the internet destroyed by a filtering system that wo n't work , so I guess for me it 's a factual issue .
[ Update ( 17:00 MT ) : I did it !
Just saw Venus , with the Sun still more than 34° above the horizon .
It was very faint and difficult , but once I spotted it I had it nailed .
Persistence pays off , me droogs . ]
On Twitter last night I mentioned that the thin crescent Moon was near Venus at sunset , and I got a lot of replies from people who ran outside to see .
That was pretty nice !
But that was just after the Sun had set for me here in Boulder , when the sky was getting darker and Venus was easy to spot .
But Venus can be seen in broad daylight , if you know where to look !
Today is a good day to try , because the Moon is still near the planet , and the Moon is slightly easier to find .
My advice is to try sometime after local noon .
Go outside and find the Sun .
Duh , that should be easy enough .
At about 1:00 local time for you it should be in high in the south .
This will put Venus and the Moon about 30° to the left ( if you are in the northern hemisphere ; reverse all this for the southern ) .
When I make a fist with my arm fully outstretched , it spans about 10° .
I have a big hand , so YMMV .
But something like three fist - spans away from the Sun , parallel with the horizon , you should be able to see a very thin crescent Moon .
It wo n't be easy to spot ; binoculars might help .
Be careful not to look at the Sun though !
[ Edited to add : do n't let kids or people inexperienced with binoculars try this ; if they look at the Sun through the binocs Bad Things can happen .
Looking at the sky wo n't hurt , but looking right at the Sun will potentially damage your eye .
In fact , your best bet is to put the Sun behind a roof or a building of some sort , which not only prevents you from hurting yourself , but also makes it easier to spot the Moon . ]
Once you spot the Moon , Venus will be easier .
It 's just about 7 - 8 degrees to the right of and slightly above the Moon , between the Moon and the Sun , but much closer to the Moon ( most standard binoculars have a 6° field of view , so Venus will be a little more than one FOV away from the Moon ) .
The diagram above shows the configuration as I 'll see it here in Boulder , Colorado at about 1:30 p.m. local time .
Hopefully that 'll help you find it .
Finding Venus in the daytime is n't all that easy , and can be frustrating .
If you can't find it , do n't sweat it .
But if you do , I think you 'll be amazed .
I still remember the first time I did , when I was about 15 .
It 's weird to see something that looks like a star when the Sun is blazing away , so it 's worth the effort .
By tomorrow ( Monday ) the Moon will have moved farther to the east ( left ) , so it 'll be farther from Venus , making this harder to do .
So try for it today !
5 Steps to making a good role - playing character !
Step one :
You may have already done this but you need to generate a name for your character .
I can usually come up with fantasy names pretty quick however , if you lack a bit in the imagination department , try out
Step two :
You need to choose your alignment now .
I would suggest being a similar alignment to your other characters in your parties so you can all get along .
A chaotic good character would not get along with a lawful evil character in the same party !
I would n't suggest choosing a random alignment either , as alignments influence how you role - play your character .
Step three :
Character physical traits .
You need to think about how the character looks physically , firstly deal with height , weight , hair colour , eye colour , face shape , body shape ( muscular / lean ? ) and then beards ( if a male of course ! ) .
Now , add one or two physical attributes that will make your character even more unique , as a rule of thumb I have at least one unique trait on the face and maybe at least one unique body trait .
Regards to the characters face , does he or she have a scar ?
A patch over one eye ?
Different coloured eyes ?
An ear missing ?
A tattoo on his face ?
A birth mark ?
Does he have a lisp when he talks ?
A high pitched voice ?
When thinking about the body , does the character have a missing limb ?
Does he walk in a funny way ?
Does he have a tattoo on his arm ?
A magical tattoo that glows ?
A missing finger ?
I 'll let you decide that lot !
You 've just filled in your character sheet ... and now possibly wandering how to make a good back ground for your character , never fear because I have 5 easy steps to make a great background for your character !
So here it is : You may have already done this but you need to generate a name for your character .
I can usually come up with fantasy names pretty quick however , if you lack a bit in the imagination department , try out Wizards of the Coast name generator , it provides a real name and some alternatives that your character could be known as by the commoners .
You need to choose your alignment now .

Step four :
Step five :
The final step , and usually the biggest step .
You need to write a background for your character .
You can be as imaginative as possible but there are limits , such as it's not a good idea to say your human character was born on another planet ... however you need to check with your DM to say if it 's ok or not .
The thing is , writing this part of your character wo n't be as bad as it seems , a good idea to start is to write a couple of sentences about how your character aquired their personal and physical attributes .
Did you say your character was a ladies charmer ?
Maybe your father did it alot and you wanted to follow in his foot steps .
Does your character have a fear of spiders ?
Maybe he had a giant spider try and attack him when he was younger .
You also need to think about your parents , they either are alive , or they died , or your character is unaware of their parents and were adopted .
Regards to where your character grew up , the most popular choices would be either in a city or a country side , however you could have been brought up in a cave or in a tree .
I hope this helps to create some awesome characters out there !
You think anything else needs to be added ?

Now you need to develop your character 's personality .
From your alignment that your character has , you can visit this page and choose traits that suit your character best .
Once you 've picked a few , if any at all , you need to think about other behavioural aspects of your character .
Try to think about at least 2 to describe your character .
For example , does your character have strange habits ?
Does he like / dislike particular creatures ?
Is he incredibly shy ?
Is he mute ?
Does he like to attempt to charm the ladies ( halarious if you have low charisma ! ) ?
Is he fussy ?
Does he hate seeing blood ?
Is he focused on being clean all the time ?

The political media remains obsessed with the propriety of using budget reconciliation to pass health care reform .
Unfortunately , many of them continue to not understand what they 're talking about .
Let me explain again .
Last year , some Democrats considered using the reconciliation process – an expedited procedure that can't be filibustered -- to pass health care reform .
They decided against it , in part because reconciliation only lets you make changes that mainly affect the budget .
( Things like regulating insurance would n't qualify . )
They passed a plan through the Senate using regular procedure .
Now their plan is to have the House pass the Senate bill , and then use reconciliation to patch up the bill .
That means enacting a handful of relatively modest changes to the Senate bill , changes that would be budget related .
This would not be some unprecedented use of reconciliation .
As uses of reconciliation go , it would actually be quite minor , applying small changes to a health care bill that ’s already been passed .
But many reporters and commentators still seem to think the issue on the table is using reconciliation to pass the whole bill .
Here ’s Kent Conrad trying to explain this to Bob Scheiffer and a pair of Republicans on Face the Nation :
CONRAD : On the question of reconciliation , I have said all year as chairman of the Budget Committee , reconciliation cannot be used to pass comprehensive health care reform .
It won`t work .
It won`t work because it was never designed for that kind of significant legislation .
It was designed for deficit reduction .
So let`s be clear .
On the major Medicare or health care reform legislation , that can`t move through reconciliation .
The role for reconciliation would be very limited .
It would be on side - car issues designed to improve what passed the Senate and what would have to pass the House for health care reform to move forward .
So using reconciliation would not be for the main package at all .
It would be for certain side - car issues like how much does the federal government put up to pay for the Medicaid expansion ?
What is done to improve the affordability of the package that`s come out of the Senate ?
BLACKBURN : It shouldn`t be done at all .
CONRAD : But it would not be used .
Well , that`s not a reasonable position to take , congresswoman .
We know that repeatedly for health care certain provisions , for example , children`s health care , the CHIP program was done through reconciliation .
COBRA , for people who lose their jobs , that was done through reconciliation .
( CROSSTALK )
CONRAD : On relatively minor issues , it`s totally reasonable .
BLACKBURN : But this is not a minor issue .
CONRAD : Well , health care reform at large would not be -- I`ve just said , health care reform , the major package would not be done through reconciliation .
That would be unreasonable .
But that`s not going to happen here .
SCHIEFFER :
What were you going to say , Congresswoman ?
BLACKBURN : Well , I think that , on the reconciliation issue , if they had the votes , we wouldn`t have had the summit .
And if they try to go through reconciliation , it will be a change in semantics .
Instead of the American people saying stop the bill or kill the bill , it`s all going to be about repealing the bill .
That`s not the kind of discussion that they want .
And when we were talking about the expanded Medicaid coverage , we rolled the dice on this in Tennessee over a decade ago , made the gamble that near - term expenditures could be offset by long - term savings .
Those savings never materialized .
And that`s from a Democrat governor in our state .
And as we have all watched it , savings never materialized in Tennessee .
They didn`t materialize in Massachusetts .
They didn`t materialize in Maine .
It is not going to yield the savings that you`re expecting an expanded coverage program to -- to yield .
SCHIEFFER : Let me just throw this in because I`m not sure the White House has the same understanding of this that you do .
Because the woman , Nancy DeParle , who is , kind of , in charge of Medicare over there at the White House -- I mean , health care , over there at the White House , said this morning on " Meet the Press " she thought that an up - or - down vote would be the way to go on this .
So , obviously , she`s talking about trying to do it through reconciliation , Senator .
CONRAD : I`d say this to you , Bob .
I have said all year , I am chairman of the committee in the Senate ; I think I understand how reconciliation works and how it can`t work .
The major package of health care reform cannot move through the reconciliation process .
It will not work .
SCHIEFFER : It will not work ?
CONRAD : It will not work because of the Byrd rule which says anything that doesn`t score for budget purposes has to be eliminated .
That would eliminate all the delivery system reform , all the insurance market reform , all of those things the experts tell us are really the most important parts of this bill .
The only possible role that I can see for reconciliation would be make modest changes in the major package to improve affordability , to deal with what share of Medicaid expansion the federal government pays , those kinds of issues , which is the traditional role for reconciliation in health care .
And here ’s Politico reporting on this exchange :
Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) threw cold water on the idea of using the reconciliation process Sunday during an appearance on CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
" Reconciliation cannot be used to pass comprehensive health care reform , " said Conrad , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee .
" The major package would not be done through reconciliation . "
Asked by CBS host Bob Schieffer to elaborate , given that the White House suggested earlier Sunday that they could pass the main bill with a simple majority of 51 votes , Conrad said that reconciliation was not , in fact , an option
As a woman whose height and weight put me in the obese category on the body - mass - index chart , I cringed when Michelle Obama recently spoke of putting her daughters on a diet .
While I ’m sure the first lady ’s intentions are good , I ’m also sure that her comments about childhood obesity will add yet another layer to the stigma of being overweight in America .
Last August , Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove , a cardiac surgeon and chief executive of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic , told a columnist for The New York Times that if he could get away with it legally , he would refuse to hire anyone who is obese .
He probably could get away with it , actually , because no federal legislation protects the civil rights of fat workers , and only one state , Michigan , bans discrimination on the basis of weight .
Dr. Cosgrove may be unusually blunt , but he is far from alone .
Public attitudes about fat have never been more judgmental ; stigmatizing fat people has become not just acceptable but , in some circles , de rigueur .
I ’ve sat in meetings with colleagues who would n’t dream of disparaging anyone ’s color , sex , economic status or general attractiveness , yet feel free to comment witheringly on a person ’s weight .
Over the last few years , fat people have become scapegoats for all manner of cultural ills .
“ There ’s an atmosphere now where it ’s O.K. to blame everything on weight , ” said Dr. Linda Bacon , a nutrition researcher and the author of “ Health at Every Size : The Surprising Truth About Your Weight ” ( Benbella , 2008 ) .
“ If we ’re worried about climate change , someone comes out with an article about how heavier people weigh more , so they require more fuel , and they blame the climate change crisis on fatter people .
We have this strong belief system that it ’s their fault , that it ’s all about gluttony or lack of exercise . ”
More than 70 years after the horrific events of the Holocaust , a new strain of antisemitism is spreading across various regions of the world .
Never is this more apparent than in Europe , where an uptick in hate crimes and incendiary rhetoric mark a disturbing trend .
Produced by the DW Documentary series , Antisemitism in Europe travels to Berlin , Paris and Warsaw to uncover the possible motivations behind its emergence , and the steps that are being taken to curb its prevalence .
Berlin houses the largest Jewish population in Germany .
This is where the Nazis first organized the extermination of European Jews .
Today , the past has become prologue .
The capital city documented close to a thousand incidents of verbal and physical attacks against the Jews in 2017 .
Representing a 60 % increase over the previous year , this troubling statistic indicates a growing mainstream wave of antisemitism .
Critics claim that the rise of the ultra - right AfD Party has empowered more obvious demonstrations of these prejudices .
The same dynamic applies in Poland where an emerging nationalist movement has taken over the political and social landscape .
In light of recent mass shootings , episodes of vandalism and displays of antisemitic hate speech , many French Jews are fearful for their safety .
Many are immigrating to Israel to escape the increasingly hostile climate .
As detailed in the film , recent spikes in Muslim populations have also posed a challenge to multi-cultural integration .
The film profiles several efforts to branch those divides as activists work to create a dialogue of understanding between Muslim and Jewish citizens .
The film features interviews with political insiders , social activists and members of these racist factions .
They speak of populations that feel underserved and left behind .
The venom of racism provides an outlet for their discontent , and the Jewish people are increasingly made the scapegoats of their frustrations .
For many , the idea of antisemitism seems like a distant remnant of the past .
But it 's clearly alive and well .
If left ignored , an insidious streak of racism can one again become the norm .
In order to combat this potential reality , Antisemitism in Europe champions more open dialogue and impassioned outreach .
Small dogs may have evolved from the Middle Eastern grey wolf Small dogs may all originate from the Middle East , according to research from the University of California .
A study published in the journal BioMed Central found a gene found in small dogs , IGF1 , is closely related to one found in Middle Eastern wolves .
Archaeologists have found the remains of small dogs dating back 12,000 years in the region .
In Europe , older remains have been uncovered , dating from 31,000 years ago , but these are from larger dogs .
" Because all small dogs possess this variant of IGF1 , it probably arose early in their history , " said Dr Melissa Gray from the University of California , Los Angeles .
The team of researchers took samples from grey wolf populations around the world .
Maybe they can have a better understanding of the history of their pets
Dr Melissa Gray
" We have a couple of individuals from North America , from Yellowstone and Alaska , several from the Middle East , Israel , Iran , India , China , Russia , Italy , Spain , Belarus and Belgium , " explained Dr Gray .
The study says the similarity between the variant found in small dogs and that in the Middle Eastern grey wolf shows small size probably originated as a result of the wolf 's domestication .
The scientists believe people may have preferred smaller dogs because they were easier to house in farming societies where space was at a premium .
Animals often become smaller as a result of domestication and the trend can be seen in cattle , pigs and goats .
Dr Gray believes the results could be useful for dog breeders : " Because we have this gene and that it affects body size it could possibly be used as a way to breed for small body size . "
And she hopes small dog owners around the world will find the results interesting .
" Maybe they can have a better understanding of the history of their pets and where they came from and how they likely dispersed out from the region . "

ARTIST : DEVO
ALBUM : SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY
NEW YORK ( Billboard ) - Devo ’s ninth studio album , “ Something for Everybody , ” is more than the new wave art rockers ’ first record in 20 years -- it ’s an ongoing multimedia performance - art - project - slash - marketing - campaign designed to reintroduce the band as “ DEVO Inc. ” with engaging and hilarious commentary on American corporate culture and conformity .
The album ’s 12 tracks were chosen through a crowd - sourced “ Song Study ” and are true to the band ’s longstanding formula of synth - and - guitar jolts , hyper - catchy riffs and winking comment on the human condition .
While there ’s a uniformity across the tracks in tempo and vibe , first single “ Fresh ” booms out of the gate with an unforgettable refrain , and “ Please Baby Please ” and “ Human Rocket ” have a bounce and crunch made for the gym or dance floor .
“ Step Up ” is hard - beating and inspirational compared with the slight cynicism of political disco jam “ Sumthin ’ . ”
There ’s also a contemporary fullness and distortion in the album ’s production that updates Devo ’s sound without sacrificing its unmistakable essence .
ARTIST : MEAT LOAF
ALBUM : HANG COOL TEDDY BEAR ( Roadrunner / Loud & Proud Records )
With Rob Cavallo , who produced Green Day ’s 2004 rock opera , “ American Idiot , ” onboard , it ’s no surprise that Meat Loaf ’s “ Hang Cool Teddy Bear ” is fit for the stage .
But while old - school rap nods and blunt lyricism add to the set ’s allure , its fluidity suffers .
More familiar - sounding Meat Loaf cuts like “ Did You Ever Love Somebody ” punctuate such rebellious tracks as the punky “ Peace on Earth ” ( “ The only thing you can count on in this life is regret ” ) .
The song “ Love Is Not Real ” is infused with compassion , while the raunchy “ Like a Rose ” reflects a cliched rock star attitude ( “ It does n’t really matter that she is n’t 21 / ’Cause she ’s always backstage when the band gets done ” ) .
And on the hip - hop - flavored “ Los Angeloser , ” the veteran rocker introduces a scratch - laden beat with a dispassionate “ yo ” before incorporating more slang , proving he ’s as progressive as he is wistful .
ARTIST : TONI BRAXTON
ALBUM : PULSE ( Atlantic Records )
In recent years , Toni Braxton has had label issues , health problems and other difficulties that put her music career on hold .
Five years after her last release , “ Libra , ” the 42 - year - old singer is back with her sixth studio album , “ Pulse , ” full of a whole other dilemma : men .
On the song “ Yesterday , ” Braxton breaks up with her partner , singing , “ You are so yesterday , wo n’t let you rain on my parade , ” and she complains about abandonment on “ Woman , ” where she warns over a slinky production , “ I hope that you do n’t wake up when it ’s too late to make up . ”
On top of a pulsating beat , the title track finds the singer hopeful and “ not giving up on love . ”
When Braxton is n’t sulking about heartbreak , she ’s enjoying being a woman .
Atop hand claps on “ Lookin ’ at Me , ” she flirts with a clubgoer , and over the piano strokes of “ Hands Tied , ” she reassures her man that she can “ love him with her hands tied . ”
ARTIST : MATT KENNON
ALBUM : MATT KENNON ( BamaJam Records )
Matt Kennon got his first taste of acceptance in country music when Randy Travis recorded his song “ Turn It Around . ”
On Kennon ’s self - titled debut , the artist demonstrates there ’s as much substance and emotion in his singing as in his songwriting .
There ’s a gritty soulfulness that resonates warmly in such tunes as “ The Man I Used to Be , ” and it serves him even better on honest declarations like “ Some People Piss Me Off . ”
The opener , “ Drive It Like You Stole It , ” is a high - octane number that encourages living every moment to the fullest , while single “ The Call ” is a poignant ballad about the power of a phone call .
( In the first verse , a man who ’s about to commit suicide puts the gun down when he gets a call from his best friend , and the second verse involves a teenage girl about to have an abortion . )
With a distinctive voice that wo n’t be confused with anyone else on country radio , Kennon has delivered a potent album that makes him a newcomer to watch .
ARTIST : ANA TIJOUX
ALBUM : 1977 ( Nacional Records )
Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux ’s latest album , “ 1977 , ” is titled for the year she was born , and it plays like the diary of a young woman .
An introspective lyricist with a low voice that makes the listener want to lean in closer , Tijoux has only her thoughts to reveal .
But she does so with conviction , whether musing about happiness ( “ Humanidad ” ) , laying down a heartbreak confessional ( “ Mar Adentro ” ) or getting autobiographical on the standout title track .
Her personal universe encompasses hip - hop existentialism ( “ Crisis de un MC ” ) and broader social consciousness ( “ Sube , ” “ Avaricia ” ) .
A laid - back mix of hip - hop , jazz , reggae and R&B -- which perhaps provides too weak a background for a strong personality -- backs Tijoux on the set .
A star of Santiago ’s hip - hop scene , she ’s probably best known for appearing on Julieta Venegas ’ song “ Eres Para Mi . ”
And during a recent U.S. tour , she was tabbed as Latin America ’s leading female MC .
But Tijoux is an artist with the promise to cross borders and genres .
ARTIST : BONE THUGS-N-HARMONY
ALBUM : UNI -5 : THE WORLD ’S ENEMY ( Reprise / Asylum Records )
The original members of Bone Thugs - N - Harmony ( including longtime collaborator DJ U - Neek , who was absent from the group ’s 2007 album , “ Strength & Loyalty ” ) have reunited for the first time in 15 years to record its newest set , “ Uni - 5 : The World ’s Enemy . ”
And the rap outfit has one message to deliver : Haters , take heed .
“ Smiling in my face , hating on the side , they do n’t wanna see me shine , ” the members rap over a simple piano line on the motivational “ See Me Shine . ”
On top of a repetitive keyboard pattern , the group continues calling out naysayers on the upbeat “ Everytime , ” spitting , “ I ca n’t turn my back around without these haters tryin ’ to shut me down . ”
The group gets a bit more insightful on tracks like “ Wanna Be ” -- about women selling themselves for fame -- and “ My Life , ” which finds the rappers reflecting on the struggles they ’ve faced .
ARTIST : FLYING LOTUS
ALBUM : COSMOGRAMMA ( Warp Records )
Flying Lotus ’ third album , “ Cosmogramma , ” is a strangely cohesive amalgam of exotic sounds .
On the new set , the follow - up to his critically acclaimed 2008 album “ Los Angeles , ” the underground California beat - head balances the futuristic sounds of warbling synths and the natural purr of a live harp .
Flying Lotus ’ appeal lies in his ability to seamlessly combine disparate sounds .
Starting with a dance - worthy bass and hand clap before launching into a soaring Eastern melody backed by the buzz of a synthesizer , “ Do the Astral Plane ” is the closest song on the album to a radio single .
“ Arkestry ” drops the heavy rhythms for a track with free jazz sensibilities ; “ MmmHmm ” is a lullaby set to the chatter of cutlery ; and “ Table Tennis ” uses a bouncing ping - pong ball for percussion and includes the ghostly singing of frequent collaborator Laura Darlington .
“ Cosmogramma ” may evade complete comprehension , but its colorful arrangements entice even the most casual listener .

PENGUIN GROUP AUSTRALIA turns over $ 120 million a year from printing words but a one - word misprint has cost it dearly .
The publishing company was forced to pulp and reprint 7000 copies of Pasta Bible last week after a recipe called for " salt and freshly ground black people " – instead of pepper – to be added to the spelt tagliatelle with sardines and prosciutto .
The exercise will cost Penguin $ 20,000 , the head of publishing , Bob Sessions , said .
At $ 3300 a letter , it 's a pricey typo .
Stock will not be recalled from bookshops because it would be " extremely hard " to do so , Mr Sessions said .
Copies remained on the shelves in city bookshops yesterday , selling for $ 20 .
Mr Sessions could not understand why some readers had found the slip offensive .
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ES MOINES -- Former Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today for the Republican Presidential nomination and said he would serve as a campaign adviser on farm issues .
Branstad had supported Lamar Alexander , the former Governor of Tennessee , who withdrew from the race last month after a poor showing in the Iowa straw poll .
At a news conference here , Bush said Branstad 's endorsement provided a significant organizational boost to his bid for the nomination .
" Grass - roots politics determines the outcome of the Iowa caucuses , " Bush said .
" Terry Branstad is a well - seasoned veteran of that type of grass - roots politics . "
After the news conference , Bush and Branstad went to the Clay County Fair in northwestern Iowa to repeat the announcement .
Branstad will be the chairman of Bush 's national agricultural advisory committee .
Bush said Branstad would " help me on agricultural matters , not only during the Iowa caucuses but after the Iowa caucuses . "
Branstad met with Bush for close to two hours last week to work out the details of the endorsement .
In his endorsement today , Branstad drew attention to Bush 's positions on education and farm issues .
" He has the empathy and the compassion to help our farmers in these difficult times and to restore the markets we need , " Branstad said .

GDP ( official exchange rate ) :
$ 1.335 trillion ( 2009 est . )
Budget :
revenues : $ 514.5 billion
expenditures : $ 547.2 billion ( 2009 est. )
Government spending is reported to be 41 % of Canada ’s GDP in 2009 .
From the United States ‘ Economy page , we see :
GDP ( official exchange rate ) :
$ 14.43 trillion ( 2009 est . )
Budget :
revenues : $ 1.914 trillion
expenditures : $ 3.615 trillion ( 2009 est . )
Government spending is reported to be 25 % of the United States ’ GDP in 2009 .
From the official U.S. federal budget numbers for 2009 , total spending was $ 3.518 trillion .
The CIA ’s estimate was off by less than 3 % .
From Canada ’s federal budget numbers for 2009 , total spending was $ 237.8 billion or only 17.8 % of Canada ’s GDP , seven percentage points lower than that of the U.S. , with the CIA ’s estimate off by more than 200 % .
Since both countries have federal governments , and the CIA is reporting the federal budget numbers for the U.S. , the same should be true for Canada .
As further evidence the CIA ’s data for Canada ’s government spending is incorrect , the conservative Heritage Foundation ranked Canada as more economically free than the United States in 2010 .
If Canada truly had 41 % of its GDP tied up in government spending versus 25 % for the U.S , how could and why would the Heritage Foundation rank Canada as more economically free ?
Former President Clinton on Sunday broadened his warning that Tea Party protesters could feed violence reminiscent of the Oklahoma City bombing , suggesting " right - wing media " and the blogosphere could be culpable for any future politically fueled extremism as well .
The former president , speaking on ABC's " This Week , " elaborated on his controversial comments from Friday , when he drew parallels between the modern Tea Party movement and the anti-government rage of the mid-'90s that preceded the 1995 Oklahoma City attack that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more .
Clinton said Sunday that political dissent is necessary , but " demonization " of government is dangerous -- citing the uptick in threats made against members of Congress and other officials .
" We should n't demonize the government or its public employees or its elected officials , " Clinton said .
" We can disagree with them , we can harshly criticize them .
But when we turn them into an object of demonization , we increase the number of threats . "
The debate over and passage of the health care overhaul this year has coincided with an increase in threats against lawmakers .
According to a recent report , lawmakers reported 42 security incidents from January through March -- lawmakers reported only 15 cases in the first three months of 2009 .
A middle - aged software engineer fueled by his hatred of the Internal Revenue Service also crashed his small plane into an Austin , Texas , building that housed IRS offices in February .
Tea Party protests focus heavily on anti-tax and anti-health care reform rhetoric -- but organizers routinely reject charges that they 're in any way fomenting violence or intolerance .
Clinton 's comments from Friday , made at a symposium commemorating 15 years since the Oklahoma City bombing , drew a rebuke from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh , who accused Clinton of having " just set the stage for violence in this country " and said " future acts of violence " would be on the former president 's shoulders .
Clinton , in the interview Sunday , said the remark " does n't make any sense . "
He instead suggested the behavior of " right - wing media " is reminiscent of the hostile mood of the country before the Oklahoma City bombing .
" I realized that there were lot of parallels between the early '90s and now , both in the feeling of economic dislocation , the level of uncertainty people felt , the rise of kind of identity politics , the rise of the militia movements and right - wing talk radio , with a lot of what 's going on in the blogosphere now , and in the right - wing media , " Clinton said .
" A lot of the things that have been said , they create a climate in which people who are vulnerable to violence because they 're disoriented , like Timothy McVeigh was , are more likely to act , " he added .
McVeigh was convicted on federal murder and conspiracy charges and executed in 2001 for his role in the attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City .
Co-conspirator Terry Nichols is serving life in prison on federal and state bombing convictions .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists in China have succeeded in teleporting information between photons further than ever before .
They transported quantum information over a free space distance of 16 km ( 10 miles ) , much further than the few hundred meters previously achieved , which brings us closer to transmitting information over long distances without the need for a traditional signal .
Quantum teleportation is not the same as the teleportation most of us know from science fiction , where an object ( or person ) in one place is “ beamed up ” to another place where a perfect copy is replicated .
In quantum teleportation two photons or ions ( for example ) are entangled in such a way that when the quantum state of one is changed the state of the other also changes , as if the two were still connected .
This enables quantum information to be teleported if one of the photons / ions is sent some distance away .
In previous experiments the photons were confined to fiber channels a few hundred meters long to ensure their state remained unchanged , but in the new experiments pairs of photons were entangled and then the higher - energy photon of the pair was sent through a free space channel 16 km long .
The researchers , from the University of Science and Technology of China and Tsinghua University in Beijing , found that even at this distance the photon at the receiving end still responded to changes in state of the photon remaining behind .
The average fidelity of the teleportation achieved was 89 percent .
The distance of 16 km is greater than the effective aerosphere thickness of 5 - 10 km , so the group 's success could pave the way for experiments between a ground station and a satellite , or two ground stations with a satellite acting as a relay .
This means quantum communication applications could be possible on a global scale in the near future .
The public free space channel was at ground level and spanned the 16 km distance between Badaling in Beijing ( the teleportation site ) and the receiver site at Huailai in Hebei province .
Entangled photon pairs were generated at the teleportation site using a semiconductor , a blue laser beam , and a crystal of beta - barium borate ( BBO ) .
The pairs of photons were entangled in the spatial modes of photon 1 and polarization modes of photon 2 .
The research team designed two types of telescopes to serve as optical transmitting and receiving antennas .
The experiments confirm the feasibility of space - based quantum teleportation , and represent a giant leap forward in the development of quantum communication applications .

Could you explain more about what the rebranded plugin does that is deceptive ?
Is it something like every few clicks the commission goes somewhere other than where the site operator expects ( i.e. , back to the author of the rebranded version ) ?
Once you install the plugin , what exactly does it say that confuses the user ?
How does one implement the commission process normally and what does this plugin do to change that ?
Do you have screenshots ?
If you can explain exactly how this deceives the public then file a complaint with the FTC : https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/
They have gone after malware / spyware in the past that did n’t disclose what it was doing and this sounds similarly deceptive .
I do n’t think this is a GPL / copyright issue because the GPL gives anyone the right to rebrand your plugin , modify it , etc .
Engaging in fraud is n’t itself a violation of copyright law , so you should focus instead on explaining what false or misleading statements this rebrander makes .
[ Edit : Although , if they also remove your copyright notices , etc. so as to make it look like the code you wrote was written by them , then that is definitely ( C ) infringement and a violation of the GPL as well .
It ’s not clear to me from your post how far they went to cover their tracks . )
This article targets Rails 2.3 Rails 3
The information contained in this page might not apply to different versions .
This is article is part of my series Understanding Ruby and Rails .
Please see the table of contents for the series to view the list of all posts .
A few weeks ago , Alan Skorkin posted a nice article about serializing objects with Ruby introducing different serialization options , including YAML , Marshaling and JSON .
This reminded me of an article I always wanted to write about ActiveSupport : : JSON module , as part of the inside Ruby on Rails series .
What is JSON ?
JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation ) is a lightweight data - interchange format .
More important , JSON is a human readable serialization format , like the popular YAML format all Rubyist are probably familiar with .
Compared to other serialization alternatives such as XML , YAML or Binary - serialization , JSON offers the following advantages :
it 's a human readable format
it 's largely adopted and supported by the most part of programming languages
it 's a language - independent format
can be compressed in one line to reduce stream size
can represent the most part of standard objects
seamlessly integrates with JavaScript which makes JSON the standard for streaming data over AJAX calls
All these features make JSON an excellent serialization format .
Of course , there are also some drawbacks , but this is material for an other article .
JSON and Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails is a web application framework and JSON is strictly related to the web ecosystem as a subset of the JavaScript programming language .
There are many different parts of a Ruby on Rails application where you might need to manipulate , encode and decode a JSON string into a Ruby object and vice - versa .
JSON support in Ruby on Rails is provided by the ActiveSupport : : JSON module .
Behind the scenes , ActiveSupport wraps the JSON library , a standard Ruby Gem which you can use in any Ruby project .
However , ActiveSupport goes beyond the boundary of a simple wrapper : it provides a JSON definition for the most part of the Ruby objects making JSON an effective full drop - in replacement for YAML .
I 'm going to talk about this later in this article .
ActiveSupport ::JSON
As I mentioned before , ActiveSupport : : JSON relies on the JSON Gem thus you need to have both libraries installed on your system .
If you installed the Ruby on Rails framework , then you already have everything you need to start working with JSON .
The module provides a super - simple API composed by two methods :
ActiveSupport :: JSON.encode ( object ) : takes a Ruby object as value and returns a JSON - encoded string .
: takes a Ruby object as value and returns a JSON - encoded string .
ActiveSupport :: JSON.decode( string ) : takes a JSON - encoded string and returns the corresponding Ruby object
Here 's a few examples :
j = ActiveSupport :: JSON ruby - 1.8 . 7 - p249 > j . encode ( 23 ) # => " 23 " j . encode ( " A string " ) # => " A string " j . encode ( { : color => [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] } ) # => { " color " : [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] } j . encode ( { : color => [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] , : date => Time . now }) # => { " color " : [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] , " date " : " 2010-04-29T00:28:56+02:00 " } j . decode ( j . encode ( { : color => [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] , : date => Time . now } ) ) # => { " date " =>" 2010-04-29T00:25:52+02:00 " , " color " = > [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] }
As you can see , the usage is really straightforward and the JSON - encoded result size is smaller compared to the YAML and XML counterparts .
v = { : color => [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] , : date => Time .
now } # => { :color= >[ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] , : date= > Thu Apr 29 00:28:56 +0200 2010} ActiveSupport :: JSON . encode ( v ) # 69 bytes # => { " color " : [ " red " , " green " , " jellow " ] , " date " : " 2010-04-29T00:28:56+02:00 " } YAML . dump ( v ) # --- # :color : # - red # - green # - jellow # : date : 2016-08-06 13:08:09.592621000 +02:00
ActiveSupport :: JSON vs JSON
At the beginning of the article , I said ActiveSupport : : JSON is something more than a mere JSON wrapper .
Now it 's the time to explain that statement .
The JSON format natively supports only a limited subset of variable types such as String , Number , Array and Hash .
Easy to understand , being a language - agnostic format , it does n't support complex or ruby - specific objects such as Object , Exception or Range .
For this reason , JSON library delegates to each class the implementation of the JSON representation of the object using the to_json method .
Similar to other standard transformation methods such as to_s or to_f , to_json is supposed to return a JSON - compatible representation .
While the JSON library now ships with a number of prepackaged definitions , by default it does n't support most of the standard Ruby objects .
Also it does n't support the serialization of ActiveRecord objects and , working with Rails projects and database records , this might be a huge limitation .
ActiveSupport ::JSON solves this problem and provides a predefined to_json implementation for the most part of Ruby / Rails objects .
It also defines a simple Object # to_json making virtually every Ruby object JSON - compatible .
As of ActiveSupport 2.3.5 , the following classes are supported : String , Symbol , Date , Time , DateTime , Enumerable , Array , Hash , FalseClass , TrueClass , NilClass , Numeric , Float , Integer , Regexp , and Object .
You can find them in the lib / active_support / json / encoders folder .
The ActiveRecord serialization / deserialization strategy is defined in the ActiveRecord library in lib/ active_record / serializers/json_serializer.rb :
def to_json ( options = { } ) super end def as_json ( options = nil ) #:nodoc : hash = Serializer .
new ( self , options ) . serializable_record hash = { self .
class .
model_name .
element => hash } if include_root_in_json hash end def from_json ( json ) self .
attributes = ActiveSupport :: JSON . decode ( json ) self end
Compared with JSON Gem , ActiveSupport :: JSON is the solution to the following Alan 's statement :
There is bad news of course , in that your objects wo n't automagically be converted to JSON , unless all you 're using is hashes , arrays and primitives .
You need to do a little bit of work to make sure your custom object is serializable .
Let 's make one of the classes we introduced previously serializable using JSON .
As a side note , it also provides some additional features such as an interchangeable encoding / decoding backend .
Planting a mosque just two blocks from where Muslims murdered Americans on 9/11 in the name of Islam is a huge slap in the face .
Why should n't Muslims be sensitive enough to realize that a huge mosque planted right near the horrific wound to the U.S. created at Ground Zero by Muslims is outrageous to us ?
They claim a right to be insulted by cartoons mocking their prophet , even to the point of beheading people .
The Imam of the Ground Zero Insult , Faisal Abdul Rauf , is not the nice guy he likes to hold himself out to be .
At his Friday afternoon khutbah services and in his book What 's Right With Islam Rauf states that he wants the mosque to be a place where inter - faith understanding is fostered .
His sonorous voice is smooth and almost hypnotic .
His writing style appears to be rational and unthreatening .
However , this does not jibe with the aspects of him that are downright hostile and frightening .
During a recent Friday sermon , this writer did due diligence as a mosque monitor and heard Rauf deny that Muslims perpetrated 9/11 .
In an interview with CNN shortly after 9/11 , Rauf said , " U.S. policies were an accessory to the crime that happened .
We [ the U.S. ] have been an accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world .
Osama bin Laden was made in the USA . "
Elsewhere , Rauf has stated that terrorism will end only when the West acknowledges the harm it has done to Muslims .
And that it was Christians who started mass attacks on civilians .
Rauf has numerous ties to CAIR , an unindicted co-conspirator in the Department of Justice funding case brought against Hamas , an openly terrorist organization .
CAIR is also the initiator of numerous cases designed to intimidate non-Muslims from criticizing aggressive Muslim behavior , and to use our own legal and democratic processes to undermine and dominate America , forcing it to become Islamic .
Rauf calls himself a Sufi , evoking among non-Muslims a " peace and love " image .
But that 's not the whole picture .
Sufism has many sides to it , including the Koranic injunction to spread Islam one way or another , and it has a rich history of waging war , too .
Could it be that one of the frequently used tools of war , lying to the enemy , explains the contradiction between Rauf 's image as reconciler of religions and his sympathies and associations with terrorists ?
A previous Rauf project , Muslim Leaders of Tomorrow , clearly shows on its website that it is headed and funded by individuals from Saudi Arabia , the country that spawned fifteen of the nineteen jihad jockeys who rode the 9/11 planes of destruction .
The funding for the mosque at Ground Zero is much murkier so far .
All that has been publicly disclosed is that the support comes from unidentified sources in Saudi Arabia and Muslim - ruled Malaysia .
Rauf reportedly says he paid $ 4.85 million for the property -- in cash .
Where exactly did this money come from ?
Was it Wahhabist - supporting Saudi sources , which have already funded many other mosques in New York City ?
The mosque is called Cordoba House .
Muslims like to refer to Spain and especially the city of Cordoba as a place where their rule reached a glorious peak .
Contrary to the myth of a Golden Age of equality during the Muslim occupation of Spain ( and in particular in Cordoba ) , Spain and Cordoba were places where Christians and Jews suffered as social inferiors under Islamic oppression .
Equal civil rights never existed for non-Muslims under Sharia , or Islamic law .
Rauf even admits as much when he writes , " Jews and Christians living under Muslim rule simply had to pay a tax to finance their protection by their Muslim overlords . "
This is not equality !
Americans do not demand a special tax to protect Muslims from ourselves .
That would be extortion , not " protection . "
Through another organization Rauf started called the Cordoba Initiative , he created the " Sharia Index . "
This will measure how closely countries follow Sharia , or Islamic law .
While Sharia can cover such relatively innocuous aspects of Muslim life as religious weddings ( hopefully not to twelve - year - old girls ) , it also demands that all Muslim life be governed by laws derived from the Koran , without the intervention of civic institutions , such as democracy .
And the Koran dictates that everyone , even non-Muslims , must ultimately live under Sharia .
Do you understand how that is in direct conflict with our Constitution and other aspects of our secular society ?
Rauf gets even trickier here .
He states in What 's Right With Islam that a society that follows natural law , such as America , is already practicing Sharia .
However , he does not note that his peculiar definition of Sharia acceptance is shared by just about no other Imam .
So what prevents him from adjusting his singular idea of Sharia back to the norm of forced conversions , murdering non-Muslims and apostates , amputations of thieves ' hands , stoning of adulterous women , execution of homosexuals , etc . ?
Throughout his writing , Rauf floats an image of a harmonious , pleasant Islam -- nice to everybody .
But this is totally disconnected from Islam 's actual history of bloody conquest , enslavement , and humiliation of other people -- which he never acknowledges .
Still another unsettling part of Rauf 's problem mosque is why the city has given the building a pass .
Records for the Department of Buildings have shown numerous complaints for illegal construction and no access , yet the issues were listed as " resolved . "
Community Board
One 's financial district committee needs to reconsider its endorsement of this mosque .
The Department of Buildings needs to reassess its action .
The Mayor 's Office of Immigrant Affairs , which supports the project ( Why ?
What has a religious building got to do with immigration ? ) needs to reevaluate its approval .
Mayor Bloomberg himself needs to withdraw his support for this mosque , especially in light of the recent Times Square car bomb attempt .
If not , he will be helping to provide a handy meeting place for future terrorists , those who understand Imam Rauf 's real message : Speak sweetly , appear to be a well - adjusted member of American society , and plan the destruction of America , either with bombs or " peaceful " undermining .

Creatures found where only microbes and viruses were thought to survive .
Some loriciferans live in anoxic sediments .
R. Danovaro
Living exclusively oxygen - free was thought to be a lifestyle open only to viruses and single - celled microorganisms .
A group of Italian and Danish researchers has now found three species of multicellular animal , or metazoan , that apparently spend their entire lives in oxygen - starved waters in a basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea .
The discovery " opens a whole new realm to metazoans that we thought was off limits " , says Lisa Levin , a biological oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California .
Roberto Danovaro from the Polytechnic University of Marche in Ancona , Italy , and his colleagues pulled up the animals during three research cruises off the south coast of Greece .
The species , which have not yet been named , belong to a phylum of tiny bottom - dwellers called Loricifera .
Measuring less than 1 millimetre long , they live at a depth of more than 3,000 metres in the anoxic sediments of the Atalante basin , a place so little explored that Danovaro likens his team 's sampling to " going to the Moon to collect rocks " .
Researchers have previously found multicellular animals living in anoxic environments , but Danovaro says that it was never clear whether those animals were permanent residents .
The new loriciferans , which he and his team reported this week ( R. Danovaro et al. BMC Biol .
doi:10.1186/1741-7007-8-30 ; 2010 ) , seem to " reproduce and live all their life in anoxic conditions " , he says .

The researchers identified an adaptation that helps these loriciferans to survive in their environment .
Instead of mitochondria , which rely on oxygen , the creatures have organelles that resemble hydrogenosomes , which some single - celled organisms use to produce energy - storing molecules anaerobically .
Angelika Brandt , a deep - sea biologist at Germany 's Zoological Museum in Hamburg , says that the work by Danovaro 's group is " highly significant " .
The discovery of metazoans living without mitochondria and oxygen , she says , suggests that animals can occupy niches that once seemed too extreme .

( I , alone , am responsible for the opinions expressed this work . ) ( H)
The reader , especially if of Freethought inclination , may ask why the issue incorporated in this work is being brought to the fore again , especially as it first saw the light of day many years ago . [ 1 ]
This question should be answered candidly and we will proceed to do so .
Many requests lately have been received from persons abroad and at home for copies of the original issues which , of course , are not now readily available .
Mounting interest in the Jesus myth theory was accentuated by the recent publication of The Jesus of the Early Christians by Prof. G. A. Wells .
The existence of Jesus nowadays is not being taken as uncritically as it used to be .
Grave doubt has been engendered .
The discover y of the Qumran Scrolls also brought about much doubt and many an Orthodox historicist was driven to the usual defenses .
Recent biblical research has crumbled to dust many a belief hitherto held beyond challenge .
The central core of Christianity , the very core of its existence , continues to be evaporating under the findings of modern , objective scholarship .
Prof. Wells ' recent book received the usual treatment afforded anyone who contends that Jesus is a myth , pure and simple .
Prof. Wells ' able work is also denigrated in certain circles because its author is not a " specialist " in the field , a pattern of criticism unhappily utilized even by the late Joseph McCabe as this short work will show .
However , as " specialists " have in the past accepted many a belief which later could not stand the test of time , we find nothing in their expertise to justify wearing the dubious mantle of infallibility , though we readily acknowledge our indebtedness to their learning .
History is more than merely vague about the existence of an actual Jesus .
Many merely assume that there must have been such a person , otherwise the gospels would n't have been written .
This is an unfounded assumption .
These so - called records are highly contradictory and their authorship is unknown .
Their appearance on the stage of history is said to be by many competent scholars about the middle of the second century , despite the attempt to date them earlier . . . by many defenders of the " faith . "
So eminent a biblical scholar as Alfred Loisy ( who was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church on account of his findings ) though accepting the historic position , renders his opinion :
" . . . to present as the sole and total cause of Christianity , one human being who , considered as divine , was also the very object worshipped by that religion would only be to create another myth . "
Loisy further maintains that the Christian religion was not created solely by myth , but , he also contends that Jesus alone cannot account for its origin .
This statement alone offers poor consolation to the historicists who stoutly maintain that Christianity could n't have arisen without a personal founder .
It may not be amiss to inform the reader that this short work is offered to the public not as a display of internecine forensics , but rather in the hope that it will afford some interest in the subject matter of the Jesus myth .
It also may have some value in the archives of Freethought historians .
That Christianity is founded upon a myth is a fact which may be unpalatable to some , but those who seek the truth must follow her wherever she leads .
HISTORICUS
Postscript :
The chapter on the Josephian passage was included on account of the fact that this historian would have been an invaluable witness to the existence of Jesus .
A work issued in recent years : The Star - Studded Hoax of Christianity with its Allied Gods , by Robert F. Bartley , Esq. , offers extensive evidence from the gospels that Jesus was not considered to be an actual human being but a god .
This work took Mr. Bartley over twenty years to research and write and constitutes one of the most fascinating detective tales .
Its author was first a policeman on the Toledo police force , later assumed detective rank and then left to practice criminal law .
The handling of the " evidence " leaves little wanting .
Mr. Bartley published this book at his own expense as a contribution to public enlightenment .
Its price is nominal , merely $ 5.95 and may be purchased by writing to :

HlSTORICUS
( A reaffirmation of position , with a reply to certain recent strictures by Mr. Joseph McCabe ) .
It is rather surprising that after all the erudite work done on the Jesus myth there should be any need , especially in Freethought circles , to discuss the subject again .
Considering what has been accomplished by the thorough - going investigations of John M. Robertson , T. Whitaker , W. Smith , Drews , Dupuis , Volney , L. G. Rylands , Albert Kalthoff , Robert Taylor , and a veritable host of other students , one can rightly say that today the mythicist position is unassailable .
The theologic defense has been unable to bring forth any credible evidence to substantiate its contention of historicity .
Position after position had to be abandoned by the church .
To each , however , the apologists clung with desperate anxiety , only to be compelled to relinquish them as the studies of comparative mythology and heirology advanced .
Being unable to present a Jesus established by unbiased historic investigation , the religious world , at last , was compelled to resort to her usual adulation of " faith " and " spiritual " insight as elements which , she hoped , would enable her to establish a basis for the historic Jesus .
Whatever merit those two factors may have within the confines of a church , they cannot add anything to the analytic apparatus utilized by an objective historian .
Those who attack the mythicist position are usually driven to pose the question : how could Christianity have arisen without a personal founder ?
They find that it is better to ask this query than to attempt to demolish the accomplishment of the mythicist school .
Or , they attempt to break down some particular point , and assume that if that is accomplished , the historic Jesus arises . [ 1 ]
There is , therefore , nothing left for the believer , either lay or academic , but to accept the historicity of Jesus as he accepts the existence of god -- on faith !
As P. L. Couchoud sums up the results of the battle between the mythicists and the " historic " school , one readily can see the utter bankruptcy of the latter .
Writes Couchoud :
" The historicity of Jesus is an article of faith . " [ 2 ]
Recently , Mr. Joseph McCabe came out with renewed contention for the historical Jesus . [ 3 ]
In a booklet of 32 pages which purports , according to its sub-caption , to give the " real " origin of the Christian religion , he sees fit to make an attack on the mythicist school , and particularly on the late John M. Robertson .
Why such an attack was not made by Mr. McCabe during Mr. Robertson 's lifetime , and why it is being made in a booklet that deals with the origin of Christianity , may best be left in silence .
Mr. McCabe introduces his attack on John M. Robertson as follows ( italics mine in all quotations given ) :
" For 30 years I have been censored by Freethinkers because I never endorsed this theory ( the mythicist ) .
Today I doubt if it has a single representative in what you may broadly call the world of scholarship .
It first became widely known to Freethinkers by the writings of the late J. M. Robertson in the days when he used to talk about ' Jesusism ' and ' Godism ' instead of Christianity and Theism . [ 4 ]
Robertson had , as a matter of fact , borrowed the idea though he never acknowledged this , from an earlier Freethinker , Robert Taylor , a man of very extensive if peculiar learning , and Taylor may have taken it from Dupius .
However , Robertson who was tireless in research though not very critical when he found something that seemed to suit h is theory , supported the negative view with such an impressive apparatus of comparative mythology that even his dullest and most ponderous works on the subject had a large circulation . " [ 5 ]
A difference of opinion regarding the myth theory does not necessarily entail rationalistic opprobrium , and it is to be regretted that a scholar otherwise so logical and generally objective in his disputes , as Mr. McCabe is , should have harbored that thought for thirty years .
It would be interesting to ascertain by what process of analysis Mr. McCabe discovered that J. M. Robertson had , " as a matter of fact , borrowed the idea , though he had never acknowledged this , from an earlier Freethinker , Robert Taylor , " the latter having been , according to Mr. McCabe , a man of " extensive if peculiar learning , " and , it would certainly not be amiss to have elucidated how Mr. McCabe was led to the opinion that Taylor , despite his extensive if peculiar learning , " may " have taken it from Dupuis .
Mr. McCabe , who charges J. M. Robertson with being " not very critical when he found something that seemed to suit his theory , " offers , regarding the passage in Josephus , the following glaring example of uncritical theorizing :
" The passage in the Jewish historian Josephus is , of course , forged , but who can say whether the forged passage was not inserted instead of a reference that did not satisfy Christians ? " [ 6 ]
This is rather a startling defense of a position , especially when adopted by a scholar who is apt to develop a penchant for the word " may " .
Incidentally , this passage in Josephus has been given up even by conservative church scholars .
Mr. McCabe 's trying to make the admittedly forged Josephian passage serve as evidence of that for which it was forged is certainly " accepting things that suit a theory , " without any kind of analysis , critical or otherwise .
It is interesting to observe Mr. McCabe 's attack on the mythicist school , especially on such titans of Freethought scholarship as J. M. Robertson [ 7 ] and others .
Scholars renowned the world over for their investigations of the Jesus myth are impugned at t he very start because they are not " professional historians , " and , I suppose , we are to assume that their studies are , therefore , invalid .
Although " what you may broadly call the world of scholarship " was ever anything but an out - and - out enemy of Freethought !
After taking Professor Benjamin Smith to task as to the merit of his studies because he was not " an historian but a mathematician , " and , Dujardin by the ear because he was " a fine literary man but , although he read very extensively on this subject and , I think , traveled in the East , he had not the right type of mind for historical work " -- and Professor Arthur Drews is put into his proper place because " he was a teacher of philosophy in a high school " and , the late L. G. Rylands is given a lower niche in the hall of scholarly Freethinkers because " he was not an historian but a cashier to a college " ( as to this sad fate , Mr. McCabe is not quite certain , so he cautiously appends the qualifying clause : " I think " ) -- and , as we are on the question of L. G. Rylan d's scholarship , Mr. McCabe sums up , quite tersely , the merit of his investigations by offering the following startling evaluation -- which sets a new standard for academic criticism :
" He ( Rylands ) died recently so that the theory is out - dated in literature . " [ 8 ]
Upon that basis , Newton , Darwin , Copernicus , et al. , are in the same boat , and , I suppose , we should ditch their theories , immediately , also .
Mr. McCabe has criticized the work of scholarly Freethinkers who have proved the mythicist theory , despite the fact that they were not " professional historians " .
He evidently temporarily forgot in criticizing them that the so - called " professional historia n " is not quite sacrosanct .
Mr. McCabe , however , suddenly lets the feline out of the bag by writing thus :
" I do not stress the fact that no historian ever countenanced it ( the myth theory ) , because our historians today , being professors , are not in a position to be candid on such a point . " [ 9 ]
And , when , Mr. McCabe , were the " historians " or " professors " in a position to be candid on such a point ?
Mr. McCabe also claims that Sir J. G. Frazer is among the rationalist " professional " historians who " have emphatically rejected the myth theory " .
Without pausing to argue the point as to whether Sir J. G. Frazer was an historian or an anthropologist , I would like , since Mr. McCabe places so much value upon " professional " historians , to bring to Mr. McCabe 's attention the fact that Sir James Frazer had reason to change from his original dogmatic denial to a very pronounced modification of it , as expressed in his introduction to P. L. Couchoud 's " The Enigma of Jesus " and it is , therefore , not quite fair to represent him as " emphatically " rejecting the myth theory .
So far as the question of the historicity of Jesus is concerned , it is conclusively summed up in the following :
" The real question of the historicity of Jesus is not merely whether there ever was a Jesus among the numerous claimants of a Messiahship in Judea , but whether we are to recognize the historical character of this Jesus in the Gospels , and whether he is to be regarded as the founder of Christianity .
If the whole of the older Church , including the New Testament literature , entirely rejects the notion of a human founder of the religion , how can our theologians venture to suggest that this literature really wanted to describe such a human founder to its readers , though it did so very clumsily and ineffectively ? " [ 10 ]
Like God , Jesus is a myth .

When J. M. Robertson was talking of " Jesusism " and " Godism , " Mr. McCabe was accepting the agnostic positron .
He wrote : " I prefer the term ' Agnostic ' to ' Atheist , ' because there is a common tendency to conceive the Atheist as one who believes he can disprove the existence of God , and there are men who hold that positron . "

It is with hearty satisfaction that I note that Mr. McCabe evidently learned that the existence " can be disproved , " and , in his revised edition of The Existence of God , he makes mention of the fact that he now considers himself an atheist .
We atheists are glad to have him in our midst .
Perhaps Mr. McCabe may yet revise his position as to the historicity of Jesus .
Anyway , I hope so .

As to how he came to accept the mythicist position , J. M.

to the conception of the evolution of the Jesus - cult from the roots of a ' pre- Christian ' one .
The fact that this view has been independently reached by such a student as Professor W. B. Smith .
who approached the problem from within rather than by the way of the comparative method , seems in itself a very important confirmation . "

A Defense of John M. Robertson Against Joseph McCabe
HISTORICUS
It is a significant fact that the more the mythicist ( nonhistoricity of Jesus Christ ) school is criticised , the stronger does it emerge .
That the theologians and churchmen will attempt to retain the alleged historic foundation to the bitter end , is to be expected ; but that Rationalist scholars should exhibit ill feeling towards their colleagues who maintain that Jesus is a myth , is rather disappointing .
Mr. McCabe 's rambling reply to my article " The NonHistoricity of Jesus Christ , " [ 1 ] subtitled " A reaffirmation of position , with a reply to certain recent strictures by Mr. Joseph McCabe , " not alone fails to meet the point under dispute , but shows evidence of avoiding a critical discussion of the mythicist school .
It was hoped that Mr. McCabe would offer substantial arguments in defense of his own position , the historic one ; instead , he again questions the ability of the scholars and thinkers holding the mythicist position , and under the heading of " Hotch - Potch of Amateur Historians " [ 2 ] relies upon the methods of bluster and academic brow - beating , and tries to silence his opponents by an attempt to prove that they were not " academic " historians , but " amateurs , " and , one supposes , not being culturally sacrosanct , were , therefore , incapable of manifesting any intelligence or comprehension on historical and mythological matters despite profound study and years of research .
As for the article , " The Non-Historicity of Jesus Christ , " Mr. McCabe deigns to state : " An anonymous American sends me a couple of copies of The Truth Seeker in which I am criticised .
I should like to ignore them and to explain to your readers that I am a n old - fashioned Rationalist who feels that his time is better spent in criticising reactionaries than in criticising other Freethinkers ; nor do I care for the standard of manners that seems to be generally accepted in the new school . "
Now , a Freethinker is no more immune to criticism than is the Pope , so far as Freethought is concerned .
A discussion on the non-historicity of Jesus Christ can best be carried on , as with all other subjects , by leaving personalities out , and , with regret , it is noted that , in this respect , Mr. McCabe seems unaware that he has indulged in them .
He speaks of " . . .
Dr. Conybeare 's deadly exposure ( in The Historical Christ ) of his ( John M. Robertson 's methods . . . "
If there was any " deadly " exposure of " methods " it was against Conybeare , in whose learning Mr. McCabe seems to have unbounded faith .
Certainly , Mr. McCabe is aware of the annihilating reply made by John M. Robertson [ 3 ] and his observation that " . . . it suffices to state that Dr. Conybeare charged myth theorists with perpetrating ' howlers ' , without specifying them ; and without mention of the fact that Dr. Conybeare was guilty of blunders on New Testament matters which would have been discreditable to a Sunday schoolboy . " [ 4 ]
The outstanding scholarship of John M. Robertson and his titanic and permanent contribution to the cause of Freethought make it incumbent upon Mr. McCabe , an erstwhile colleague and comrade - in - arms of his , to specify precisely and without any circumlocution what he means by the deadly " exposure " of his " methods , " for Robertson is dead and can not defend himself .
Mr. McCabe considers Dr. Conybeare " one of the most learned tutors of Oxford University and a very high authority on the ancient East , " and states that in his opinion " . . . not one of these writers the myth theorists --( Drews , Smith , Couchoud , Dujardin , Jensen , Whittaker , Rylands ) seems to have read him . "
He supplements this remark with the curious observation , " All dead too . "
Just what their being dead has to do with the validity of their scholarship , remains for Mr. McCabe to show .
Personally , I am at a total loss to see the relation between the two .
However , if Mr. McCabe includes Robertson among those who have not read his Oxford authority , let me inform him that in " The Historical Jesus " Robertson refers to Conybeare three times in the footnotes and in " The Jesus Problem " twenty - one times .
These do not include numerous articles by Robertson on Conybeare 's " methods " or " howlers . "
It is evident that Mr. McCabe has faith in " authorities " and after ascertaining how many of them have standing in the " academic " world , he casts his lot with them , hook , line and sinker .
One wonders whether he so quickly forgot his observation , with which I heartily concur , that " . . . our historians today , being professors , are not in a position to be candid on such a point " ( the mythicist position ) .
Also , he speaks highly of Professor Loisy and states that he considers him " one of the most brilliant biblical scholars in Europe " ( again I concur ) .
But , Loisy is driven by his scholarship to take the position that the whole question of the historicity of Jesus hinges on the Crucifixion , and if that event did not take place , the whole story is a myth .
As to the historic proof , nay , probability , of the Crucifixion , Mr. McCabe knows quite well that there is not a shred of evidence available .
To such last ditch defenses are the scholars who assume the historic position driven .
It is worthy to observe that Mr. McCabe wavers on the necessity or the actuality of a human founder to explain the origin and development of Christianity .
He writes :
" I will consider presently the theory that there never was such a person as Jesus , but you could almost say that we can explain Christianity without supposing that there was . "
In the very next sentence , he admits :
" It ( Christianity ) is a synthetic religion , and its elements were found in most of the great cities which lined the Mediterranean and exchanged crowds of merchants , travelers , and wandering teachers in the century before we find any trace of the new religion . " [ 5 ]
What evidence stands in the way of Mr. McCabe 's " but you could almost say we can explain Christianity " without a personal founder ?
Upon what basis , precisely , does he consider it more probable that Christianity is better explained upon historical grounds by assuming an historic Jesus ?
Of course , Christianity is a " synthetic " religion ; why , then , does Mr. McCabe belabor the point of historicity and have such vehement criticism against the mythicists , whom he so arrogantly criticizes ?
Let us pose this question :
If the whole course of Christianity shows it to be a pack of myths and superstitions , why is it necessary to assume that the story of Jesus is not also a myth and a superstition ?
Further on in his " How Christianity Grew out of Paganism " ( p. 13 ) , Mr. McCabe , inadvertently for his case , makes the following fatal admission :
" We can not be sure of a single biographical detail about Jesus if we follow the ordinary historical principles , so it is not a matter of great importance whether there was such a person or not . "
He concedes the highly important point that we cannot be sure of a " single " biographical detail about Jesus !
Let us , for example , juxtapose two respective positions :
Professor Loisy rests his whole case for the historicity the Crucifixion , a biographical detail , if ever there was one !
Mr. McCabe gives it as his considered opinion that we cannot be sure of a " single biographical detail about Jesus " if we follow the ordinary historical principles . "
What other historical principles of investigation should we follow ?
He also writes :
" It ( the historicity of Jesus ) is a matter on which the evidence justifies a man in being emphatic one way or the other . " [ 6 ]
If such is the result of Mr. McCabe 's historic analysis , why does he level such energetic criticism at the mythicists ?
And , why does he try to make out a case , based upon " academic " authorities ?
In his " How Christianity Grew out of Paganism , " Mr. McCabe wanders from one position to another with disregard for logic or consistency .
He impugns John M. Robertson 's methods , a serious and grave charge for one Freethought scholar to bring against another without offering any proof ; and informs his readers that he is " an old fashioned Rationalist who feels that his time is better spent in criticising reactionaries than in criticising other Freethinkers .
. . . "
I am not engaged in taking issue with Mr. McCabe 's political opinions .
But , it is difficult to understand the nature of criticism which bristles with personalities , and which belittles the works of some of the outstanding mythicist scholars because they w ere merely : " a professor of mathematics , a medical man , a French novelist and dramatist , a German philologist , a dreamy British metaphysician . "
Incidentally , just how did Mr. McCabe arrive at the opinion that the formidable Thomas Whittaker was a " dreamy " metaphysician ?
Are " Priests , Philosophers and Prophets " and " The Origins of Christianity " the works of a " dreamy " man , metaphysician or otherwise ?
One begins to suspect the existence of personal feeling involved in judgments .
And , while on the subject of " personal " feeling , may I be permitted to state that if Mr. McCabe wants to make out a case against John M. Robertson , with whom he seems to be crossing swords frequently after the latter 's death , why does he , especially when he finds Dr. Conybeare 's criticism of his " methods " just and fair , have to bring into a discussion the color of Robertson 's neck - tie and jacket ?
In his : " Evolution or Revolution , " [ 7 ] he engages in the following questionable criticism :
" One of my colleagues of forty years ago was the late J. M. Robertson .
He had already passed into the stage in which he edited a free - love paper , wore a red tie and velvet jacket , and wrote Jesusism and Godism for Christianity and Theism , but he had still a great scorn of caution and conventionality . "
What relation does the editing of a " free - love " paper , the color of a neck - tie and quality of a jacket have to do with the soundness of a man 's opinions ?
Let us , however , return to the non-historicity question .
It was summed up keenly by John M. Robertson , thus :
" Put broadly , the problem is , How are we reasonably to decide whether a quasi- historical narrative , unvouched by known contemporaries , and admittedly marked by a multitude of false and mythical items , had or had not a substantial basis in fact ?
The old plan -- familiar in the day of Sokrates - - was to delete gross myth and miracle , and decide that something really happened which was merely misdescribed , misunderstood , magnified , and progressively embellished .
That was the method of early deistic rationalism , applied for whole generations by rationalizing theologians in Germany , with such results as the conclusion that the Transfiguration might have been the hallucination of one looking by night upon men lit by a camp - fire or torches ; that Jesus did not walk on the waves , but really on the bank ; and so on That method is , in substance , Dr. Conybeare's .
To use one of his own academic terms , he ( Conybeare ) is a ' back number ' with a vengeance . " [ 8 ]
And , in closing , I would like to bring to Mr. McCabe 's kind attention a remark once made by John M. Robertson regarding the question of authorities :
" Every one of the thousand abandoned fortresses of theology has been walled by libraries of learning .
Hence a somewhat obvious futility in undertakings to ban new theorists by blank imputations of incompetence . " [ 9 ]
Men die , true , but , at least , their thoughts live after them !

HISTORICUS
The theological world has already lost its supposed historic god ; it now faces the loss of the hitherto generally accepted belief in Jesus as an historic character .
An illustration of the way the various fissures are beginning to show is the recent remark of a New York Times book reviewer .
Commenting upon " Caesar and Christ " by Will Durant , he states that Durant " stoutly defends " the historicity of Jesus .
The question poses itself to any reflective person : why should the historicity of Jesus , the heart of Christian belief , have to be " stoutly defended " at the present time ?
Centuries have passed , innumerable disputes have taken place within theologic circles on the very minutiae of Christian faith ; the very basis upon which that faith was erected is now in doubt .
Did Jesus of the Gospels have an actual existence , or is he just another ancient myth , embellished and kept in religious circulation by the Christian church ?
It is characteristic of historical development that the religious events we assume as having taken place , under critical examination are often found to be quite different from what we formerly pictured them .
History sometimes assumes patterns which are , a t best , tenuous and vague .
Documents are frequently falsified by persons interested in their falsification and vested interests make their weight felt .
The absence of eye - witnesses , the problem of academic conservatism , and a number of similar factors make the study of ordinary history an arduous task for even the historian .
In dealing with a body of religious thought which has invariably been in the wrong throughout historic times and which has steadfastly fought against the advance of science and truth , we must be on our guard lest the devious machinations of the religious advocates ( whose livelihood rests upon the acceptance of religious doctrines ) throw us back into the jungle of falsehood .
Much depends upon the method utilized in examining the Jesus myth .
That the destructive criticism should emanate mainly from rationalistically inclined scholars is to be expected .
That certain students , though otherwise religious , have presented scholarly evidence most destructive of the myth is also to be expected .
Investigators of the type of Arthur Drews , Strauss , and others remained theists despite the devastating criticism which they adduced against the historic position .
Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel of Zu rich , the author of the much heralded " foundation pillars , " maintained that even without an historical Jesus , religion would continue .
Whether he meant non-Christian theologic thought or whether he accepted the possibility that even if it could be definitely established that the very heart of Christianity is a myth , that the Jesus who has been worshipped for centuries never had an actual existence , would do away with Christian belief , his contention is one of the most damning indictments of religious thin king and offers strong evidence that once you condition the masses to accept certain beliefs it is almost impossible for them to break away and accept the truth .
The problem of the historicity of Jesus is coming to the fore in the more advanced religious circles , and also among rationalistic groups .
It is generally found that the defender of the status - quo in religious belief utilizes various methods of silencing his opponent .
If he cannot intimidate otherwise , it is generally found useful to the defender of the faith to avoid the issue involved , and to brow - beat his critic with an academic shibboleth .
When this is indulged in by a rationalist , however , the surprise is acute .
When I took issue with Joseph McCabe [ 1 ] on his position regarding the Jesus myth and his attack on certain mythicists , [ 2 ] he attempted to minimize the work of the outstanding rationalist scholars who have taken the mythicist position .
After taking Professor William Benjamin Smith to task as to the merit of his studies because he was not " an historian but a mathematician , " and Dujardin by the ear because he was " a fine literary man but , although he read very extensively on this subject and , I think , traveled in the East , he had not the right type of mind for historical work " -- and Professor Arthur Drews is put into his proper place because " he was a teacher of philosophy in a high school " ; and the late L. G. Rylands is given a lower niche in the hall of scholarly Freethinkers because " he was not an historian but a cashier to a college " ( as to this sad fate , Mr. McCabe is not quite certain ; so he judiciously appends the qualifying clause : " I think " ) and , as we are on the question of L. G. Ryland 's scholarship , Mr. McCabe sums up , quite tersely , the merit of his investigations and studies by offering the following startling assertion :
" He ( Rylands ) died recently so that the theory is out - dated in literature . " [ 3 ]
In his letter , [ 4 ] he classified them all as " a hotch - potch of amateur historians . "
Now , in the very nature of the case , it stands to reason that the " professional " historian is closely attached to the cultural status quo , which , in turn , is in the clutches of religious slavery .
In a way , it is important to note that the men whom Mr. McCabe thus characterizes could not become professional or academic historians as the universities are interested in continuing the belief in the historicity of Jesus .
Picture , for example , a man like Edward Gibbon , after writing the " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , " with its famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters , being invited to , say , Yale , Harvard , or Columbia to take a chair in history .
What would the endowers say ?
After all , a university can not live on thin air .
Archibald Robertson , the distinguished rationalist and scholar , in a recent lecture on " A Humanist Theory of Christian Origins , " [ 5 ] made the following statement regarding the difficulties confronting a scientific historical approach to the problem of Christian origins :
" There are two obstacles to a scientific history of Christian origins .
One is the fact that professional scholars are nearly all economically tethered to the established religion and make their history a stalking horse for theology .
The other is the proclivity of mythicists to overstate their case , and while demanding mathematical certainty from their opponents , themselves to indulge in hypothetical flights every whit as fanciful and as incapable of proof as those which they attack .
If both sides would agree to be content with probability , there is no reason why a new synthesis should not emerge . "
Now , if " professional " scholars are economically married to the established religion and " make their history a stalking - horse for theology , " it is obvious that we should turn not to them for a " scientific " interpretation of Christian origins .
Then , again , the mythicist does not demand " mathematical " certainty in the realm of history from his opponents : he does , however , ask for a case based upon probability .
When one considers the devastating effects of the criticism of Bruno Bauer , Strauss , Dupuis , Van Manen , Wm. Benjamin Smith , Arthur Drews , the English theosophist , G. R. S. Mead , Kalthoff , Peter Jensen , and the whole " hotch - potch - of - amateur - historians , " especially the titan , John M. Robertson , no " probability " can sway the scales in favor of a belief i n the historicity of Jesus .
While Joseph McCabe finds the origin of Christianity and the New Testament " more intelligible on the theory that a human teacher of great impressiveness really forms the core of the story , " Mr. Archibald Robertson , who has given the question a great deal of his time and whose book " Jesus : Myth or History ? " will soon be issued by Watts & Co. , though a historicist himself , writes : [ 6 ]
" The idea that a great religion must have a personal founder is a relic of the ' great man ' theory of history . "
To return to Mr. Joseph McCabe and his belief that " a human teacher of great impressiveness " must have been the basis of the Christian origin , the present writer would like to emphasize that such reasoning begs the very question involved .
Upon what basis does Mr. McCabe assume that Jesus had been " impressive " ?
First we must have an actual person whose existence is proved .
What we have is another mythological figure .
Even Mr. Archibald Robertson , despite his efforts to establish a case for the historic position , is impartial enough to write : [ 7 ]
" If we had to choose between the mythicist interpretation and the view which tries to explain Christianity by the genius of a personal founder , we should have to pronounce for the myth theory as more scientific . "
Upon which side then does probability lie ?
One finds it somewhat difficult to accept the thesis advanced by Mr. Archibald Robertson , [ 8 ] namely :
" The origins of Christianity may have been mainly mythical , and yet there may have been a real Jesus who contributed certain features to the final form of the myth . "
The present writer takes exception to " there may have been . "
The issue of " probability " is one of the statistical chances of a certain event occurring .
What evidence is offered ?
If " there may have been , " then , on the same basis , " there may not have been . "
Robert Taylor , the noted author of " Diegesis , " " Syntagma " and " The Devil 's Pulpit , " made the following observation regarding the historicity of Jesus :
" When the simple fact of the existence of such a man as Jesus Christ is questioned , it is usual for the modern advocates of Christianity to shelter themselves from all contemplation of the historical difficulties of the case , by assuming his existence to be incontrovertible , and that nothing short of idiocy of understanding , or an intention to irritate and annoy , rather than to seek or communicate information , could prompt any man to moot a doubt on the subject . . . that none but reckless desperates or downright fools could ever have held the human existence of Christ as problematical . "
Robert Taylor wrote these words in 1829 .
The dedication of this truly remarkable book was written while he was in Oakham Goal for his anti-religious views , dated Feb. 19 , 1829 , and signed , Robert Taylor , A.B. Prisoner . "
Taylor 's observation correctly characterizes " professional " historians of even today .
The mythicist has invariably been replied to with abuse rather than with rational and historic data .
After Arthur Drews brought out his " Christ Myth , " which annihilated the historic position , the " professional " historians and academicians of this day could put up only a defense which is best delineated by Prof.
Chester Charlton McCown as follows : [ 9 ]
" The idiocy -- no other word is strong enough - - of his ( Drews ' ) opponents , especially the conservatives , makes one wonder that Christianity still lives . "
In the same work , Prof. McCown , searching for the " real " Jesus in the year 1940 , offers the following opinion about Jesus 's social message , a " message " that the Christian world is based upon and which is supposed to be a panacea for all evils : [ 10 ]
" In the perspective of the history of Christian thinking and of Scripture interpretation , it is clear that Jesus ' social message to the modern world must be discovered by a complete reinterpretation of the Gospel materials .
A mathematical formula suggested many years ago by Henry J. Cadbury puts the matter in a nutshell .
Let conditions in Jesus ' day be represented by a , his teachings by b , and conditions today by c.
Let the desired modern application of Jesus ' teachings to modern problems be an unknown x .
Careful study can discover a , b , and c .
Out of the equation , a : b==c:x , the value of the unknown quantity can be found . "
To this point has the search for the " social " message of Jesus arrived !
Despite the desperate attempts by " professional " historians and their " string - pullers , " the theologians , the historicity of Jesus as it stands today is best summarized in the terse sentence of P. L. Couchoud " ( a member of the " hotch - potch of amateur historians " ) :
" The historicity of Jesus is an article of faith . " [ 11 ]

[ 2 ] Joseph McCabe 's opinion is best expressed in his own words : " My purpose is historical , but I may say that I find the origin of Christianity and the New Testament more intelligible on the theory that a human teacher of great impressiveness really forms the core of the story , and that in the forty years that elapsed between his death and the first appearance of the Gospels the miraculous legends and myths grew about him . "
Modern Rationalism , Watts & Co. London , 1909 , p. 102 .
It is to be gravely doubted whether the gospels first appeared forty years after Jesus ' alleged death .
McCabe makes the following damaging admission on the same page on which aforementioned passage occurs : " We can not trust unknown writers , separated from the events by half a century . "
Supernatural Religion by Cassels is a very penetrating analysis as to when the gospels first made their appearance .
History marks them in existence about the middle of the second century .

Of all the capital issues raised on the methods that h e utilized in trying to break down the mythicist position , the point that he now belabors is that J. M. Robertson does not belong in the category of " the hotch - potch of amateur historians , " but is a " man of outstanding ability . "
As to the scholars who constitute the aforementioned ' hotch - potch of amateur historians , " so labeled by him in pontifical objectivity , are included " A German technical school teacher ( Drews ) , a professor of mathematics ( Smith ) , a French medical man ( Couchoud ) , a French novelist an d dramatist ( Dujardin ) , and a German philologist ( Jensen ) , a dreamy British metaphysician ( Whittaker ) and a college accountant ( Rylands ) . "
As a rationalist , McCabe should have endeavored to dispute their findings on the basis of reason and logic .
But , this method was not used .
Professor Benjamin Smith is a " mathematician " not an " historian " .
Dujardin was a " fine literary man but , although he read very extensively on the subject ( the Jesus myth ) and , I think traveled in the East , he had not the right type of mind for historical work " .
( Just what type of mind is required ? )
Professor Arthur Drews ( one of whose works McCabe translated ) was a " teacher of philosophy in a high school " -- the late L. G. Rylands " was not an historian but a cashier to a college . "
What sort of critical attack is this ?
Who is to pass final judgment on " the right type of mind " needed by an historian ?
Now , upon his criterion even a man like J. M. Robertson does not seem to have possessed the right type of mind so far as the Jesus myth is concerned .
McCabe writes :
" However , Robertson who was tireless in research though not very critical when he found something that seemed to suit his theory . . . "
( Italics mine , " Historicus " ) How Christianity Grew out of Paganism .
J. M. R. , though of " outstanding ability , " was so poor a scholar of the Jesus myth that McCabe asserts :
" Dr. Conybeare 's deadly exposure ( in The Historical Christ ) of his methods would dispense me from replying if I had any inclination to do so . "
( Italics mine - -" H " ) " The Hotch - potch of Amateur Historians . "
The Truth Seeker , July , 1944 .
This type of attack attempts to categorize J. M. Robertson as even lower than the " hotch - potch of amateur historians . "
We admirers of J. M. R. are glad to learn that McCabe considers him to have been a " man of outstanding ability " albeit not critical when he found something that seemed to suit his theory " and whose " methods " were exposed by Dr. Conybeare Men of the calibre of J. M. R. do not appear often on this world , still less often , alas , in the world of freethought and scholarship .
So far as his having been of " outstanding ability " that is quite obvious both to specialist and amateur .
Mr. McCabe who captioned his letter " The Ethic of Controversy " wrote as follows in his Little Blue Book No. 1788 titled " Evolution or Revolution " which was issued about ten years after Robertson 's death :
" One of my colleagues of forty years ago was the late J. M. Robertson .
He had already passed into the stage in which he edited a free - love paper , wore a red tie and velvet jacket , and wrote Jesusism and Godism for Christianity and Theism , but he had still a great scorn of caution and conventionality .
Thirty years later he , now the ' Right Honorable J. M. Robertson , ' and a friend of peers , made a violent public attack on my hotheaded Rationalism , sneered at my ' five - cent Little Blue Books ' , to the dismay of members of the audience who had known him once as Bradlaugh 's most fiery lieutenant , said , even in the greatly toned down report : ' I give you my word as a student that all vital , great , far - reaching , deep - sinking transmutation of opinion in human societies is a matter of slow metamorphosis . '
His actual language was worse . "
( Italics mine - - " H " ) .
Beside the red necktie and velvet jacket and editorship of a " free - love " paper , what rational disputation have we here ?
Note the assertion --" his actual language was worse . "
If I recall correctly , the discussion referred to took place about 1928 , and J. M. R.'s words , as reported , showed him to be a man of sterling character and a very " ethical " controversialist .
Certainly he had a right to believe that progress was a matter of slow metamorphosis in human societies ; nor did he , so far as I have information , " sneer " at McCabe 's Little Blue Books .
Mr. McCabe 's attempt at subtle persuasion against J. M. R. as noted in the following lines ( same booklet ) , plays fast and loose with good taste and fair " give and take . "
" I am not here giving away a semi-public episode --( McCabe had referred to the incident as " a violent public attack " ) it was far worse than I care to describe -- but it fitly introduces a discussion on the question of evolution or revolution . "
Why the writer of " The Ethic of Controversy " should consider this episode as " fitly " introducing a discussion of evolution or revolution is extremely difficult to tell .
It appears that he is much prejudiced against J. M. R .
J. M. R.'s words , which McCabe , I believe alludes to , were so far as this particular passage is concerned , not even addressed to him , and the observation that " all vital , great , far - reaching , deep - thinking , transmutation of opinion in human societies is a matter of slow metamorphosis " was made in reply to a speaker , other than McCabe , who had brought up the question of " sweeping movements .
. . . "
In the mythicist controversy , McCabe quoted Conybeare as a critic whose " deadly exposure ( in The Historical Christ ) of his ( J. M. R.'s ) methods would dispense me from replying if I had any inclination to do so . "
To those who are acquainted with t he subject , especially in its controversial phase , it is well known that Robertson tore Conybeare ( whom McCabe considers to have been " one of the most learned tutors of Oxford University and a very high authority on the ancient East " ) to shreds in three m asterly articles titled " Dr. Conybears and the Jesus Problem - - A Reply to ' The Historical Christ ' " which appeared in the Literary Guide , issues of June , July , and Aug. 1914 .
These articles are a masterpiece of freethought analysis and deserve to be reprinted in booklet form .
Very little was left of " the learned tutor " after J. M. R. got through with him and still less of the " historical " Christ .
Yet , McCabe still drags him forth to buttress his case against the mythicists and especially against J. M. R. Why ?
He could have attempted a reply based upon the " giving and taking of reasons , " as Robertson so aptly put it .
Instead , he attempts to weaken the mythicist position by talking about the " right type of mind " ( whatever that is ) required in historical work .
In his letter " The Ethic of Controversy , " McCabe writes :
" It is also said that Conybeare is my ' great standby ' on the question of the historicity of Christ .
This also is inaccurate , a perversion of my plain words .
I quoted Conybeare only as a critic of Robertson 's method of proving his particular theory of the Christ - myth . "
His " plain words " are as follows " Hotch - Potch of Amateur Historians , " The Truth Seeker , July , 1944 ) :
" Robertson is the only one of outstanding ability , and Dr. Conybeare 's deadly exposure in The Historical Christ of his methods would dispense me from replying if I had any inclination to do so .
It is characteristic of the school that , though Conybeare was one of the most learned tutors of Oxford University and a very high authority on the ancient East , not one of these writers ( " the hotch - potch of amateur historians " ) seems to have read him . "
In one of my articles on the Jesus myth , I had especially requested McCabe to show what the " deadly exposure " consisted of .
He could have replied .
What have we instead ?
Silence .
To return to the subject of " amateurs . "
It would not be amiss to get McCabe 's opinion as to whether he , too , does not fall into that fatal category .
He has written innumerable Little Blue Books , together with an impressive array of full length volumes .
I have invariably found them to be , authoritative , scholarly and highly informative ; yet , he can not claim to be an " authority " on all the subjects he touched upon ....
He has , however , despite not being an " authority " on every subject he has written , done so me signal freethought work for which we rationalists throughout the world are duly appreciative in our battle against religious ignorance and superstition .
He has also admitted that so far as professorial " authority " is concerned :
" I do not stress the fact that no historian ever countenanced it ( the myth theory ) , because our historians today , being professors , are not in a position to be candid on such a point . " ( Italics mine : " H " )
If we can't go to the " professors , " who , I believe receive payment for teaching certain doctrines , beliefs , ideas , etc. , then it may be worth while to turn to the " hotch - potch of amateur historians , " who , at least , might afford to be " candid on such a point " .
The social system has a vested interest in Christianity and its Jesus Christ .
The professors are part of that body and are vitally concerned in keeping their jobs .
Let us not forget that important fact .
Rationalists should not look towards academic authority as a final judge , because , so far , that authority has been waging war against them .
Conditions , though , are changing .
The Jesus myth , like the God myth , may soon go the " way of all flesh " .
In closing I should , again , like to ask Mr. McCabe to reply to my articles on the mythicist question , " The Non-Historicity of Jesus Christ , " " Jesus : A Mythological Character , " " subtitled " A Defense of John M. Robertson against Joseph McCabe , " and " The Dec line of the Jesus Myth , " which appeared respectively in the Truth Seeker Jan. , 1944 , Sept. , 1944 , and May , 1945 .
I should also like to bring to Mr. McCabe 's attention the observation made by Dr. George Sarton , the well - known scholar and editor of the learned " Isis " ( Autumn , 1944 ) :
" When we try to appreciate the deeds of our intellectual ancestors , we do not ask any more such trivial questions as , Was he a high school teacher or did he occupy a university chair ?
Was he a member of a hundred academies or of none ?
Was he rich or poor ?
A lord or beggar ?
All these matters have some importance , but only for a short time ; sub specie acternitatis they become irrelevant .
The only things that matter are , What did the man do himself ?
Not what did he look like , what kind of uniform di d he wear , but -- what was he , within himself ? "
HISTORICUS .
Scholars have often averred that the Jesus of the New Testament is a myth , that he never had existed , and that there is no historical evidence to substantiate the claims for his existence advanced by the Christian church .
At first the religious apologists scoffed at this contention and attributed the statements of the scholars to pure wickedness , seeing in it but another attempt of Satan to lure more souls in to Hell - - this , and nothing more .
But as the study of mythology advanced , historical parallels were constructed and the truth began to dawn upon unprejudiced persons .
The similarities proved to be extremely destructive to the accepted beliefs about the life of Jesus .
Dupuis , Strauss , Drews , Smith , Robertson and others brought together sufficient evidence to establish upon a firm foundation that there is nothing in all history to prove that the Jesus of the New Testament ever walked the face of the earth .
Contemporary writers displayed an amazing lack of information about Jesus .
Here was a man who performed miracles that astounded the multitudes , yet his acts are not found recorded in the books of historians who noted occurrences of much less importance .
Remsburg , in " The Christ , " names forty - two writers who lived and wrote during the time or within a century after the period , when Jesus is said to have existed , and from all their writings only four passages are to be found that might possibly support the historicity of Jesus .
And of these four passages , not a single one can stand a critical test .
It is agreed that the strongest of them is the passage found in the works of a Jewish historian , Flavius Josephus ( 37-100 A.D. ) .
Prof. Arthur Drews , in " Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus , " states that " he ( Josephus ) is the first profane writer who can seriously be quoted for the historicity of Jesus . "
If the passage in Josephus is genuine , then strong and in fact formidable proof is offered for the Christian claim along historical lines .
On the other hand , should this passage be found a mere forgery , a clumsy interpolation , then the strongest element o f proof for the historicity of Jesus in the whole mass of ancient literature crumbles and dissolves .
Josephus was the author of " A Defense of the Jewish Religion . "
In this he showed himself to be a fervent believer in Judaism - - a point that must be kept in mind in view of the passage attributed to him depicting Jesus as the long - awaited Messiah .
At the tim e he wrote , the Christians constituted a very small sect , of no particular political or social importance .
Late in the first century , Josephus completed his classical work , " The Antiquities of the Jews . "
In this book is found a complete history of his race , dating from the very earliest age , according to the knowledge of his day .
While in the midst of the story of a Jewish uprising , the narrator in this book is interrupted by the following irrelevant passage :
" Now there was about this time Jesus , a wise man -- if it be lawful to call him a man , for he was a doer of wonderful works and a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure .
He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles .
He w as the Christ .
Although Pilate , at the complaint of the leaders of our people , condemned him to die on the cross , his earlier followers were faithful to him .
For he appeared to them alive again on the third day , as god -sent prophets had foretold this and a thousand other wonderful things of him .
The tribe of Christians , which is called after him , survives until the present day . "
( Jewish Antiquities xviii , 3 , 3 . )
Would Josephus , who wrote with such careful sequence , break the unity of his narrative to observe , with Christian piety , that " about this time lived Jesus , a wise man , if it be lawful to call him a man .
. . .
He wrought miracles .
. . .
He was the Christ . . . .
He appeared to them alive again on the third a , day as god- sent prophets had foretold " etc . ?
All this we are asked to accept as coming from Josephus , an extremely pious Jew !
We should be inclined to think that this Jewish historian , after noting a matter of such prime importance in the history of his people as the coming of Jesus the Messiah , would proceed to elaborate on it , to impress its significance upon his religious brethren ; for the Jews at that time were bestowing great attention on matters pertaining to the coming of the Messiah .
In fact , they were awaiting the Messiah with painful impatience and desperate hope .
But Josephus , as soon as he is through with the Jesus passage , the heaven - sent Messiah , the long awaited Christ who was to bring peace and happiness to all those suffering under the cruel Roman heel , goes on , as though nothing of unusual importance had be en touched upon , to make the statement : " Also about this time another misfortune befell the Jews " ; and the text continues leisurely with the story of how Tiberius expelled the Jews from Rome .
Attention is immediately arrested by the wording , " another misfortune befell the Jews . "
What other misfortune ?
If Joshephus had written the joyful Jesus passage , would he have continued with " another misfortune " and then told of Tiberius and his expulsion of the Jews ?
About this passage affirming Jesus as the Christ a number of observations might be made .
Josephus is obviously ignorant of the occurrences connected with Jesus and his followers .
As one who accepted Jesus as the Messiah whom the " god - sent prophets had foretold , " Josephus must certainly have gathered zealously all available information about him .
Yet , the conscientious narrator of Jewish history fails utterly to note such exciting events as :
The triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem .
His acclamation as the Messiah .
The riot before the governor 's house .
The surrendering by the Sanhedrim of one of their people to the Roman authorities .
The disappearance of the body from the grave .
It is not an easy matter , as Professor Drews states , to show that these events were too insignificant for Josephus to record .
The Acts of the Apostles ( ii , 41 ) shows the new religious sect ( Christian ) entering into deadly rivalry with the old religion .
It is difficult to understand how Josephus , a thorough historian in his way , could have failed to include the aforementioned events in his work had these incidents occurred during the life of Jesus .
That he noticed messianic disturbances in the times is amply proven in his " Antiquities " ( xviii , 4 , 1 ) .
Here are noted the false Messiah and his attempt to induce the Samaritans to rise against their Roman masters .
Then there is the incident of Judas , the Gaulonite , who created a disturbance of the people against the census of Quirinus ; the story of the pretending prophet , Theudas , who claimed to possess the power to divide the waters of the Jordan to allow his followers to cross in safety .
In " Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus " Professor Drews says ( page 5 ) :
" Does anyone seriously believe , in fact , that Josephus could have concealed from the Romans , who had long ruled over Palestine and were accurately informed as to the disposition of their subjects , the messianic expectations and agitations of his compatriots and represented them as harmless , in works which were especially concerned with their strained relations to their oppressors ? "
The most important and illuminating fact , however , is that the passage about Jesus as the Messiah is not to be found in the early copies of Josephus .
Not until the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius ( about A.D. 300 ) do we come across it , and it is claimed that all reference to this passage is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsifications of Eusebius . [ 1 ]
Also of the utmost significance is the absence of the Josephian passage in the controversies of the early church fathers .
Not only is the passage not to be found cited in their voluminous disputes , but one fails to come across even a mention of it in work s where it would undoubtedly have appeared had it been in existence at that early day .
It is not in the polemics of Tertullian , Cyprian , Justin or Origen .
Valuable indeed , would this passage have been to Justin in his dialogue with Trypho the Jew . [ 2 ]
Chrysostom , a careful reader of Josephus , wrote in the latter part of the fourth century .
The quotation of the Josephian passage would have weighed strongly in favor of the church .
But no mention is made of it in his works , and we are inclined to accept t he view of Remsburg that he was " too honest or too wise to use it . "
Canon Farrar , in his " Life of Christ , " vol. i , p. 63 ( page 31 of the cheap edition ) , sums up the case in the following words : " The single passage in which he ( Josephus ) alludes to him is interpolated , if not wholly spurious . "
The verdict of history has thrown this passage out .
And thus the church remains without an iota of tangible evidence to uphold its claims for the historicity of Jesus .
Footnotes to Did Josephus Write It ?
[ 1 ] Jakob Burkhardt considers the wily Eusebius to be " the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity . "
He elaborates on his character as follows : " After many falsifications , suppressions , and fictions which have been proved in his work , he has no right to be put forward as a decisive authority , and to these faults we must add a consciously perverse manner of expression , deliberate bombast , and many equivocations , so that the reader stumbles upon trapdoors and pitfalls in the most important passage s. "
( Leben Konstantins , 2d edition , 1860 , pp. 307 , 335 , 347 . )
[ 2 ] Vossius , in the 16th century , possessed a manuscript of Josephus which contained no mention of Jesus .
This morning the BLS reported an increase of 290,000 jobs .
Headline unemployment rose to 9.9 % .
Hidden beneath the surface the BLS Black Box - Birth Death Model added 188,000 jobs .
However , as I have pointed out many times before , the Birth / Death numbers cannot be subtracted straight up to get a raw number .
It contributed to this months employment total for sure , but the BLS will not disclose by how much .
This month there were 66,000 temporary census workers added to the payrolls .
That number can directly be subtracted .
Interestingly , the details show only 59,000 government jobs in total were added .
That means , states have cut back 73,000 jobs .
Expect this trend to continue .
Next month is the big census hiring effect where as many as 500,000 temporary workers will be hired .
In June through August they will all be fired but that will not stop economists and the administration from crowing about the numbers .
On the whole , this was a decent jobs report , but the birth / death number is quite problematic .
I do not buy it .
Moreover , the BLS report does not remotely jibe with the ADP April 2010 National Employment Report estimate of 32,000 .
Someone is wildly off , and I expect that to be the BLS , not ADP .
Those expecting the unemployment rate to drop given the headline number were in for a surprise .
However , we were not surprised having talked about this before .
The participation rate had been falling like a rock , and if people think there may be jobs , they start looking for them .
That means people who were not counted as unemployed , now are .
Expect this to go on for a long time , and expect the unemployment rate to be stubbornly high .
By the way , I still do not think the top in the unemployment rate is in and expect it may rise substantially June through August , and keep rising at a modest pace thereafter for most of the rest of the year .
Time will tell .

Household Data
In April , the number of unemployed persons was 15.3 million , and the unemployment rate edged up to 9.9 percent .
The rate had been 9.7 percent for the first 3 months of this year .
The number of long - term unemployed ( those jobless for 27 weeks and over ) continued to trend up over the month , reaching 6.7 million .
In April , 45.9 percent of unemployed persons had been jobless for 27
weeks or more . (
Among the unemployed , the number of reentrants to the labor force rose by 195,000 over the month .
In April , the civilian labor force participation rate increased by 0.3 percentage point to 65.2 percent , as the size of the labor force rose by 805,000 .
Since December , the participation rate has increased by 0.6 percentage point .
The employment - population ratio rose to 58.8 percent over the month and has increased by 0.6 percentage point since December .
The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons ( sometimes referred to as involuntary part - time workers ) was about unchanged at 9.2 million in April .
These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full - time job .
[ Mish Note : In January the number was 8.3 million ]
Persons Not in the Labor Force
About 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in April , compared with 2.1 million a year earlier .
( The data are not seasonally adjusted . )
These individuals were not in the labor force , wanted and were available for work , and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months .
They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding
the survey .

The key take - away is
there are 9,152,00 of workers whose hours may rise before those companies start hiring more workers .

Grim Statistics
The latest development in the saga of the so - called " birther " challenges to Barack Obama ’s presidency comes from Hawaii , Obama ’s native state .
Yesterday , Gov. Linda Lingle signed a law allowing state agencies to ignore requests for information if they determine the requests duplicate or are substantially similar to earlier ones .
The law targets those who contend Obama was n’t born in the U.S. and thus , under the Constitution , ca n’t be president ; they still are sending 10 to 20 e-mails every week asking the state ’s Health Department for verification of his birth certificate .
Some file the same request even after receiving a response .
( As journalists , we wonder , " Since when has a government official needed a law to ignore a request for information ? "
But we assume Hawaii officials have their reasons . )
Hawaii officials tell requesters the same thing over and over : State law prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to anyone who does n’t have a tangible interest in the matter .
For those coming in late , Obama requested and obtained a copy of his own birth certificate and released it publicly in 2008 , after which we examined it and found all in order .
The document is legal proof of citizenship , and it ’s the only type of birth record the state issues .
Nevertheless , some wanted more .
So Dr. Chiyome Fukino , the state health director , issued a statement saying that she has seen the original vital records verifying that Obama was born in Hawaii and " is a natural - born American citizen . "
But that has n’t stopped the inquiries .
Linda Lingle , we ’d note , is a Republican , and stumped for Sen. John McCain in 2008 .
In other news on this front , the Eleventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has upheld a $ 20,000 sanction against Orly Taitz , the most visible of those pressing the Obama - as - foreigner theory .
As we wrote in January , a lower court judge imposed the fine to punish Taitz ’ " misconduct " in filing " frivolous " legal claims on behalf of an Army officer who did n’t want to deploy to Iraq on the grounds that Obama ’s presidency was illegitimate :
Judge Clay D. Land , Oct. 13 2009 : While the Court derives no pleasure from its imposition of sanctions upon counsel Orly Taitz , it likewise has no reservations about the necessity of doing so .
A clearer case could not exist ; a weaker message would not suffice .
Land was named to the bench by another Republican , former President George W. Bush .
Another lawsuit filed by Taitz on the subject was dismissed in April by no-nonsense federal Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington , D.C. " This court is not willing to go tilting at windmills with her , " Lamberth said , referring to Taitz .
Taitz , undeterred , is hoping to capture the Republican nomination to be California ’s secretary of state .
In that race , she claims that her primary opponent is ineligible to run , though for different reasons than his place of birth .
Taitz contends that Damon Dunn was too recently registered as a Democrat to be a candidate in the GOP primary .
Guess how long it is before the state of New York runs out of cash ?
Less than a week , according to the state 's comptroller .
On June 1 , New York is due to send $ 3.8 billion in aid to local school districts , including $ 2.1 billion that was supposed to be paid in March but not sent for lack of funds .
Yet New York is still $ 1 billion short .
This could affect school operations , the solvency of any business that sells goods or services to the state , the paychecks of state workers , and ultimately home values .
At ...
Pielke Jr and 13 other authors have published a paper advocating a “ re- framing ” of climate policy .
Co-authors that may be somewhat familiar to CA readers include Atte Korhola and Mike Hulme ( a seemingly anomalous search term in the Climategate letters ) .
Daniel Sarewitz checked in briefly at CA a few years ago .
The coauthors tend to be economists .
They observe the lack of accomplishment of climate policy over the past 15 years and argue that policy has been too heavily focused on mechanisms like cap - and - trade and demand targets and insufficiently focused on supply - side ( they express it a little differently , but I think that this characterization is fair . )
They argue that the confluence of Copenhagen and Climategate creates an excellent opportunity for re-framing .
Contrary to much present spin , they say that Climategate was an extremely important event , calling it , together with the Copenhagen , one of two “ watersheds ” in climate policy :
The second watershed is to be found within the science of climate change .
It was crossed on 17th November .
The climate science community has experienced an accelerated erosion of public trust following the posting on that date of more than a 1,000 emails from the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit . [ 2 ]
These emails , whose authenticity is not denied , suggested that scientists may have been acting outside publicly understood norms of science in their efforts to bolster their own views and to discredit the views of those with whom they disagreed . [ 3 ]
They provide a nice citation [ 3 ] of Andrew Montford ’s book :
The principal e-mails of concern are reproduced and discussed in A.W. Montford , The Hockey Stick Illusion , London : Stacey International , 2010 , pp. 402–49 .
This work conveniently relates the topics back to a detailed narrative of the major disputes in climate science , and specifically paleoclimate studies , with which much of the Climatic Research Unit archive is concerned .
They repudiate the disinformation from the climate science community that any of the inquiries have actually investigated matters at issue :
Hitherto , none of the specific critiques of this work by those auditing it have been adjudicated by reviews of the matter , and indeed were explicitly not investigated by the Oxburgh review ( para . 9 )
They dance around nuclear power , arguing that radical new technologies are needed to meet acceptable cost targets , but do not mention that Deutch et al 2009 url ( which they cite ) had observed that there were then about 44 nuclear plants under construction around the world in 12 countries , principally China , Russia , India and Korea – which suggests to me that a major reason why there were no new nuclear plants then under construction in the U.S. ( one was being refurbished ) is due at least in part to self - imposed regulatory issues and the huge costs associated with running the gauntlet of the present U.S. regulatory system .
I have n’t examined the policy options closely and the following point is an opinion that is a general impression only – one in which I ’m speaking as a ( Canadian ) citizen rather than a specialist .
Surely one of the nettles that has to be grasped by the environmental movement in the U.S. and Europe is confronting the fact that prescribing feel - good remedies like wind power and tree - planting carbon credits as a solution for present energy and climate problems is no better than prescribing Laetrile for cancer .
( They may not do any actual harm , but , to the extent that people are tricked into thinking that they might be a solution , they do do harm . )
Once this nettle is grasped , then there would probably be an opportunity to reform the regulatory system so that nuclear plants can be built in the U.S. as well as in Pakistan and the Ukraine .
Peter Gleick and his claque say that we have to do “ something ” right away – though the “ something ” seems all too often to be no better than Laetrile or the sale of indulgences .
Better that we have “ change we can believe in ” .
Protesters gathered briefly near Egypt 's parliament building Baton - wielding Egyptian police have broken up a pro-democracy demonstration in Cairo .
They beat protesters and dragged dozens away from outside the upper house of Parliament , taking them away in trucks before reportedly releasing them later .
Demonstrations are illegal under Egypt 's stern " emergency laws " , which have been in place for 30 years .
The protesters were calling for a change to the constitution that they say would make elections more fair .
The demonstration was called by the 6 April youth movement , which backs the presidential candidacy of Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head of the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog .
" It 's an insulting image for Egypt , " opposition politician Ayman Nour told reporters .
" Hundreds of soldiers are denying the right of a few dozen civilians trying to express their desire to amend the constitution . "
Journalists beaten Mr ElBaradei was not at the demonstration but he has said he would run in elections planned for next year if there were changes made to the constitution allowing fairer polls .
The former UN nuclear watchdog chief has hinted he may run for president Opposition parties are in effect banned by the government 's use of the tight restrictions on the political process in the Egyptian constitution .
Journalists covering the protest were also beaten with police batons , and photographers ' cameras confiscated .
The 6 April movement was formed in 2008 through the social networking site Facebook .
The group campaigns for political reform through a series of strikes and has over 70,000 members .
Mr ElBaradei , 67 , has hinted he may stand against 81 - year - old President Hosni Mubarak , who has ruled since 1981 , in an election due in 2011 .
Observers believe President Mubarak wants his son Gamal to succeed him .
Analysts say Mr ElBaradei's appeal for many Egyptians is that he is a civilian in a country long ruled by soldiers , and that he is untainted by corruption allegations .
But detractors writing in state media have portrayed him as a figure who is out of touch with Egyptian life , having lived abroad for so many years .

Ike Shehadeh , owner of Ike ’s Place , a wildly popular sandwich shop in the Castro , will go to court next week to battle an effort to evict him .
Mr. Shehadeh said he received an eviction notice last month from Denman S. Drobisch , the owner of the building at the corner of 16th and Sanchez Streets .
Ike ’s Place shares the building with four longtime residents who live directly overhead .
After years of fruitless mediation and escalating tensions — during which the shop ’s popularity soared — the residents ’ lawyers are now threatening to sue both Mr. Shehadeh and Mr. Drobisch .
In turn , Mr. Drobisch is seeking to close the shop , Mr. Shehadeh said .
Mr. Drobisch ’s lawyer , Arlene Helfrich , did not respond to numerous requests for comment .
Mr. Shehadeh said that over the years his neighbors had called the police and health and planning inspectors “ over 40 times . ”
It ’s official – “ Men in Black ” are back .
Will Smith has signed on for the third installment and will join Tommy Lee Jones and new comer Josh Brolin for the third installment .
The film will begin production later this year and hit theaters during the already crowded 2012 summer season .
However , while the first two opened up on the weekend of July Fourth , this time the men in black will get an earlier start date –May 25 .
And , of course , it will be in 3 - D .
Because heaven knows you ca n’t have a third installment of a franchise these days without it being in 3 - D .
Kenk : A Graphic Portrait
Nothing can beat the constantly evolving comic book genre when it comes to developing great new anti-heroic characters or misunderstood villains .
A Toronto based production company called Pop Sandbox was in the midst of documenting the views of the infamous Igor Kenk , just before the world started to change in the Summer of 2008 .
First Kenk was hauled in by the Toronto Police , along with his enormous cache of bikes , and related junk .
Then our entire credit driven society started to feel the sagging effects of what happens when an artificially inflated economy loses the pressure of Mass Consumption , as it ’s cash flow dependent pumps were starved of their imaginary funds , and unable to be re-primed at sub - prime rates .
During this same time , Sandbox had already been hard at work filming the daily mini-drama ’s that surrounded Igor Kenk at his Queen West bike shop .
Starting with the raw footage of these candid interviews , Sandbox has taken their pure / documentary approach to the subject and synergised not just Igor Kenk the man , but his whole distorted world , into a self - told story that will be expressed with the integrity and realism of of a journalistic comic book .
Not only are Sandbox ( & Assoc. ) daring enough to go way out into dangerous traffic by representing the the much despised “ Igor the Terrible ” in their multi-modal production , but they ’re also going to be following in the great and progressive tradition of the genre by also innovating the look and content of the venerable Comic Book format itself .
In this case , they ’re basing both their text and the illustration entirely in the meticulously transcribed interview footage that they shot of Igor during the year leading up to his arrest , and treating the story with the integrity and verity of a Journalistic piece .
True to the ever growing and evolving roots of the “ graphic novel ” format , Sandbox seeks to distinguish itself as a meaningful innovator in genre through both it ’s story subjects , and it ’s presentation .
A goal that will be achieved via the inventively hybridized graphics of their illustrator Nick Marinkovich , who has drawn his imagery directly from the photographic footage of Filmaker Jason Gilmore .
This raw documentary feel will then be sculpted with the written work of renowned Writer - Journalist Richard Poplack , who also represents a potentially evolutionary force on the genre as he applies the realism and depth of feature form journalism to what promises to be a hyper - realistic rendition of the ever - changing comicbook format .
See candid photos of Kenk , and read some reactions from the recent Book Launch Party by CLICKING HERE to pop -up a retrospective review of the evening …
The term “ graphic novel ” ( or the more apt term “ graphic novella ” ) is itself a descriptor that seems to still be in flux , and remains open to challenge or re-interpretation , especially by those who believe that it ’s simply a marketing driven descriptor which the almighty comicbook has no real need for – other than to validate a higher price point perhaps .
These and other signs of constant change are well - evidenced by of the many Writers and Illustrators in this literary format as they experiment with not just the labeling of the genre , but also in the flow and layout techniques , visual styles , illustration methods , and even in the publishing mediums used to convey the Artform .
It becomes clear that the cross-platform delivery of multimedia formats which characterizes Pop Sandbox productions seems not only perfectly suited to Richard Poplack ’s specifically progressive outlook on Writing , but also serves as a great example of the spirit of daring innovation , and counter - cultural change that graphic novels have come to represent in general …
At least to Fans of the genre .
n terms of pushing boundaries with this particular project though , it seems that Poplack is not the only innovative force as he seeeks to at least honor , if not revive , the long - format detail and higher journalistic standards from a bygone era that valued feature - length peices , over micro-fragments of quickly digested gossip fodder .
Through his stylistic preferences , Poplack will likely offer a rarely seen depth of character development , that will certainly help distinguish the work of Illustrator Nick Marinkovich ’s innovative new graphical treatments of Alex Jansen and Jason Gilmore ‘s imagery through their production of this graphic novel ( erm , “ portrait ” ) about Toronto ’s infamous Igor Kenk , and the police - led dismantling of his reign of anarchy on Queen West .
Via Jansen ’s production , the depth of Poplack ’s written exploration of both Kenk ’s character , and this highly graphic artform , could quickly dive down in a daring journalistic foray into the underbelly of our seemingly well - ordered Society .
One where we all might all possibly risk learning abit more about ourselves than we ’re ready to accept .
By having the courage to expose and develop Igor Kenk ’s dark , acerbic , and much maligned character , Richard Poplak will certainly attract all the spurious comments and hot - headed letters that would have otherwise just gotten innocuously buried under the sporadic newspaper editorials and daily articles that surface on this subject , only to disappear again with nary a persistent trace .
As well as helping morph the ever - shifting format of the ‘ graphic novel ’
Poplak is also inadvertently open up new channels for a rather disenfranchised Public to vent all the pent the up pressures of a painfully and politically corrected Society .
Although he assures us on his personal Blog that he is n’t creating a forum for haters to gang up on Igor Kenk , nor is he offering Kenk a soapbox to spout off his outrageous views of the World , it seems that one way or another Poplak will inexorably be sifting through at least some of the artifacts behind Kenks near - mythical status , and qualify the forces that drive people underground , regardless of what kind of benefit they might have offered Society otherwise .
At the very least Poplak ’s graphic novel is an opportunistic expose of a compelling character , that may very well provide talking points for an underlying social ennui that rarely finds an usable focus , much less an actually productive Public outlet otherwise .
“ If I had to define the book in a quicky sentence , I ’d assert that it ’s about a man without the art to implement his ideas , without the moral compass to realize his ideals , pulled out to sea by the power of his compulsion . ”
Leave it to a dark anti-heroic comic book character to attract latent or misdirected public opinion , and incites reactions that stem from individual illusions of morality , to a wider social consciousness , or at least shared groupthink .
Whether he likes the results or not , Poplak seems willing to become a visible lightning rod for the popularised hatred that most people have ( in many cases ) simply auto - subscribed to over the past few years since the Toronto Police took a suddenly more concerted interest in bike theft in our fair Metropolis .
Slated to hit shelves ( virtual or otherwise ) in May 2010 , the neutrally titled “ Kenk : A Graphic Portrait ” is already causing quite pre-release stir for itself .
It ’s hard to assume that the self - righteous and indignant vitriol that this subject provides the public opportunity to express could n’t possibly serve to publicize Poplak ’s work nearly enough to warrant the grief that he ’s certainly brought down upon himself in the process .
Obviously Poplack has sawed off some enormous chunks to process and digest , and we ’ve yet to see how the verity and voice of this subject will be properly evidenced .
So instead let ’s just focus abit on the Artform itself , and let it ’s indeterminate content speak it ’s deeper message to future Readers on it ’s own , and over time .
“ The irony of the internet age is that , despite the fact that space is essentially limitless , the long feature piece is just about a dead art . ”
[ Insert Twitter - Bitch Here … Below … Or just Follow via Twitter ! ]
So …
In the copy / pasted nature of a self - regurgitating Internet , here ’s a description of the illustrative value from Poplak ’s own Blog :
Q: Who is doing the drawings ?
A : Oy , this is complicated .
There ARE no drawings to speak of .
The book is a bridging of the fumetti genre with a long - form New Yorker style journalistic profile , crossed with a DIY punk zine .
The source material is largely based on stills pulled from hours and hours of video - footage , photographs and archival shots , all run through an ancient photocopy machine , and then futzed with some more .
It is an agonizing process , and it ’s making me go blind .
Nick Marinkovich , of Underworld comics fame , is responsible for the final look .

" It 's all the Democrats ’ fault !

On Friday ’s The O’Reilly Factor , the love / hate feelings that Bill O’Reilly has for Glenn Beck flared up again , as O’Reilly told Beck , “ So here ’s Beck and he has been on the air for a year at Fox News Channel , it ’s amazing that you have n’t been fired yet , a couple of close calls . ”
As usual Bill - O hid his dig at Beck with humor , but make no bones about it , Bill - O would not mind seeing Beck hit the bricks .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

O’Reilly was talking about Beck ’s first year on Fox News , when he said to him , “ So here ’s Beck and he has been on the air for a year at Fox News Channel , it ’s amazing he has n’t been fired yet , a couple of close calls , I saved you a couple of times .
I said if Beck goes I go .
Well not really , but it sounds good . ”
Almost since Beck began his ascent at Fox News , there were stories about O’Reilly feeling threatened by him , until Beck ’s arrival Bill - O was the undisputed top dog at Fox News .
That all began to change as Beck drew staggering numbers of people to his 5 pm show .
Even with his millions watching , Beck still only averages half of O’Reilly ’s prime time audience , but the speculation grew about what Beck could possibly accomplish if moved to 8 pm .
Beck and O’Reilly have seem to have found a way to get along with each other , but O’Reilly who represents the old school right wing voice that tends to stick to tried and true GOP talking points , is n’t always comfortable with Beck ’s right wing Chicken Little routine aka the sky is always falling the world of Glenn Beck .
Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck do their speaking tours together for one simple reason , money .
They both draw bigger crowds together than when they are on the road separately .
Beck and O’Reilly need each other .
A blessing from O’Reilly would help make the inevitable Beck to prime time transition go smoothly , especially in comparison to the transition that took place at The Tonight Show , where old man Leno never let anyone forget that he is being pushed out .
O’Reilly needs Beck , because Beck ’s fringe behavior makes him look moderate by comparison , as was pointed out earlier this year by The Feed blog .
O’Reilly , besides being a sexist , misogynistic pervert , also has an ego the size of Canada ’s GDP .
Part of him would love to see Beck self destruct so that he remains the undisputed king of Fox News .
As cable news becomes more about personalities and less about news , these kinds of conflicts are more out in the open .
The prime examples of this happened at MSNBC over the past couple of years where Keith Olbermann demonstrated an inability to get along with both Chris Matthews and Joe Scarborough on the air , although this might say more about Olbermann ’s personality than the changing emphasis of cable news .
With the concern growing among some at Fox News that the Glenn Beck style is changing the network for the worse , it is difficult not to see O’Reilly as the old face of Fox News clashing with the new face of Fox , Glenn Beck .
As long as the money is good they will continue to co-exist but Bill O’Reilly is not going to go down without a fight , and you get the sense that he would not be all that upset if Beck managed to get himself fired from Fox News .
TaKaDu ’s software solution can help a city identify and home in on leaks so they can be plugged .
You ’d think that a country like the US , that can send ultra sophisticated rockets into space , would have no problem with a low - tech issue like plugging leaks in city waterways .
And yet , despite water delivery oversight by municipal departments and mega - companies , the solutions are low - tech as well .
As a result , in some cities leaks and dripping pipes can account for 50 percent of all water loss .
According to the World Bank , drips and leaks around the world amount to about $ 15 billion annually .
With enormous amounts of energy needed to purify water , allowing all those drops to drip away is akin to flushing cold hard cash down the toilet .
Now a market - ready , easy to add - on software solution developed by an Israeli IT entrepreneur can help a city ’s waterworks identify and home in on leaks so they can be plugged .
Ranging in price from $ 10,000 a month for a small city to $ 150,000 for cities like LA or New York , company CEO Amir Peleg ( left ) says the software developed by his Israeli company TaKaDu is radically effective .
After all , a hairpin water leak today can become a geyser tomorrow .
Applying high - tech IT to ageing infrastructure
Based on smart math models and algorithms , the TaKaDu software can process both online and historical data , and requires no special technology on the client ’s side .
TaKaDu takes the data fed to it from a waterworks facility and uses it to detect leaks and help the facility to prioritize repairs .
“ We can tell them when , where and how big the leak is , ” Peleg tells ISRAEL21c .
The TaKaDu system is already hooked up to Australian , European and UK water data and the company has partnerships with IBM and Schneider Electric of France .
The software developed at the 21 - person strong company examines parameters such as the flow , pressure , quality and turbidity of water and more .
It ’s offered as a stand - alone solution that requires no high - tech meter , pump or metrics system to connect with .
Peleg , who sold his latest IT company , YaData , to Microsoft in 2008 , explains the transition from the high tech industry to water : “ Water infrastructures and networks are similar to , but more complex than IT networks and telecom .
Water networks are way more complex :
They ’ve developed in an evolutionary way in the last 100 to 200 years .
It ’s aging infrastructure that is leaking .
We are bringing a paradigm existing in the telecom industry and in IT to the water world . ”
One other Israeli company , Meidan , launched a water software technology to measure and monitor leaks , and showcased it at a clean tech conference in 2008 , but to date , TaKaDu looks like the only serious player in this market from Israel .
At the moment Peleg ca n’t divulge the TaKaDu system ’s exact status with respect to trials and operation , but he will say that the company has seen traction and interest from all over the world for trials and evaluation .
A go - to - market strategy based on partnerships
Peleg , who previously founded YaData , Cash - U / Unipier and EVS , tells ISRAEL21c : “ It was a pure IT solution that I sold to Microsoft .
After that I was free as a bird and I could do whatever I want .
There were so many problems in Israel : Problems due to the scarcity of water , and also a movement of VCs into cleantech .
Slowly I looked into this space until I found where the problem is – in water management , with the transformation of data into knowledge . ”
Since Israel ’s Gemini Funds and Giza Ventures have invested $ 3.5 million in TaKaDu , the company , located in a suburb of Tel Aviv , is not seeking investments .
And remarkably , after being in the business for only two years , TaKaDu has already seen sales and is now in the process of forming partnerships .
“ We are not selling technologies , ” Peleg explains .
“ We are providing a solution to water networks – software as a service – which is everything over the web , over the cloud .
Our go - to - market strategy is via partners .
Latin America and Australia are already selling our solution . ”
In April , Peleg participated in a California - Israel Chamber of Commerce clean tech mission along with nine other Israeli clean tech companies , during which he met possible strategic partners from California ’s energy and water sector .
He says that pricing will depend on the size of a network .
There ’s no one - time fee , just a monthly fee , and cities can see results instantly .
“ Just hook up to our service over an IT connection and you start to see merits .
After four months if you do n’t like what you see , then just disconnect , ” Peleg proposes , pointing out that “ It ’s not just about saving water .
TaKaDu can also detect faulty meters so that water companies know when their assets are n’t performing well . ”
The monitoring network can impact water savings up to 50 % , and can help cities predict and prevent water loss now and in the future .
“ A small leak today ?
How much is it worth tomorrow ? ” is Peleg ’s concluding rhetorical query .

Google threatens a tiny Australian start - up , alleging trademark infringement .
It ’s classic David versus Goliath ... but does Google have a choice ?
Google threatens a tiny Australian start - up , alleging trademark infringement .
It ’s classic David versus Goliath , reminding us far more eloquently than Senator Stephen Conroy ’s ham - fisted attempts that under Google ’s friendly exterior lies just another big corporation .
But does Google have a choice ?
Google is the most valuable global brand , according to the latest BrandZ Top 100 issued yesterday .
$ US114 billion , up 14 % on last year .
Groggle , due to start operating in the next few months , is a Brisbane - based “ location driven alcohol price comparison service ” .
Punch in your postcode , find cheap booze .
The name ’s meaning seems obvious .
But Google ’s lawyers reckon the trademark Groggle “ is substantially identical with and deceptively similar to the Google Trade Marks ” and is “ likely to mislead and deceive customers into believing that Groggle has a sponsorship , affiliation or approval with Google when this is not the case ” .
Are they right ?
According to the Arts Law Centre of Australia ( quoting IP Australia , who handles trademark registrations ) , a successful trademark infringement action must show that :
use of the infringing mark was use as a trade mark .
That is , the infringing trademark was being used to indicate a connection , in the course of trade , between goods or services and the ( infringing ) trader or service provider ; and
the infringing trademark is identical , substantially identical or deceptively similar to your trademark ; and
the goods or services ( or both ) in relation to which the infringing trademark was used are the same or at least similar or closely related to the goods or services for which your trademark is registered .
For test one , that ’s a yes .
Groggle is trading .
Test three is probably also a yes , thanks to Google ’s comprehensive trademark registrations .
Australian trademark 788234 grants the mark “ GOOGLE ” in class 9 , which includes “ computer software for creating indexes of information , web sites and other resources ” , and class 42 , “ computer services … providing access to proprietary collections of information ; creating indexes of information , web sites and other resources ” and more .
Trademark 1049124 grants that same mark for class 16 , “ Books ; manuals ; notebooks ; notepads ; pens ; greeting cards ; stickers ; decals ; sticky notes ” , class 25 , “ Clothing ; footwear ; headgear ” and class 35 , “ Dissemination of advertising to others via the Internet ” .
Trademark 1130283 spreads the net even wider .
Thanks for signing up
We look forward to seeing you bright and early with your need - to - know talking points and tidbits for the day ahead .

So Google ’s case comes down to test two .
How similar is similar ?
No doubt Google has issued this demand as part of its continuing attempts to avoid brand genericide .
If they do n’t aggressively defend their trademark from potential infringement , they risk losing their exclusive right to use it .
With the Oxford English Dictionary having already listed “ google ” as a verb in 2006 , Google does risk joining the ranks of the generic , from Aspirin to Zipper .
“ Courts can and do take into account ‘ acquiescence ’ on the part of a trade mark owner , ” says Kimberlee Weatherall , who teaches intellectual property law at the University of Queensland .
“ Cadbury had trouble getting their purple trade mark in part because they ’d acquiesced in Nestlé using the same purple for Violet Crumble .
Even if Google like Groggle , if they allow that then the next person who comes along using something close has a better chance — and gradually , Google ’s mark becomes less distinctive . ”
However Google ’s demand seems designed to impose maximum pressure .
The Groggle trademark was registered on September 28 , 2009 , and approved by IP Australia on February 4 , 2010 .
The 90 - day period to lodge an objection expires this coming Tuesday .
Google has given Groggle just seven days to respond , by 4 pm today .
And Google wants more than just a change to Groggle ’s business name and the internet domain name groggle.com.au .
It wants a signed confession .
It ’s demanding Groggle and its directors provide written acknowledgement that they ’ve contravened sections 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices
Act and committed the tort of passing off .
Weatherall notes that Google ’s letter of demand cites earlier cases , such as its win over Googlebay .
“ In a future dispute … there would be another paragraph stating that Groggle withdrew their mark and domain name and acknowledged that they had engaged in passing off and breach of section 52 of the TPA , ” she told Crikey .
“ And settlement letters always ask for the world .
This is n’t unusual . ”
Apart from genericide , Google is also worried about scams .
While not commenting specifically on this case , a Google spokesperson told Crikey this morning that it wishes to maintain Google as a trusted brand , and reduce the risk of people mistaking a fraudulent website for a genuine Google site .
London , England ( CNN ) --
Solar power is expected to provide almost a quarter of the world 's electricity supplies by 2050 , according to a new report published by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
Eleven percent of total supplies are predicted to come from solar panels on homes and offices while a further 11 percent will be provided by central solar power stations feeding clean electricity to populous areas .
Solar power currently accounts for 0.5 percent of total electricity supplies , but this will need to rise if cuts in carbon emissions are to be achieved , according to the IEA .
Executive director of the IEA , Nobuo Tanaka said in a statement : " The combination of solar photovoltaics and concentrating solar power offers considerable prospects for enhancing energy security while reducing energy - related CO2 emissions by almost six billion tonnes per year by 2050 . "
The future success of solar power stations ( known as Concentrating Solar Power or CSP ) will depend on the development of " dedicated transport lines , " but the IEA predict that it could become competitive with coal and nuclear power plants by 2030 .
The IEA expects North America to be the largest producer of CSP electricity , followed by India and North Africa -- which will likely export half of its output to Europe .
With the right policies in place , the IEA says that solar panels on residential and commercial buildings could compete with traditional electricity supplies by 2020 in many regions .
By 2030 the IEA anticipate solar panels will provide five percent of global electricity .
Tanaka , who announced the initiatives at the Mediterranean Solar Plan Conference in Valencia , Spain , called for " long - term oriented , predictable solar - specific incentives " in order to " bring both technologies to competitiveness . "
Professor Philip Eames , director of the Center for Renewable Energy Systems Technology at the UK's Loughborough University believes that solar power is a viable alternative to fossil fuels .
" Realistically , I think solar power has quite a bright future .
I 've seen predictions before and they are becoming more and more bullish as the technology develops , " Eames told CNN .
" If you look at the resources that are available and the way technology has developed in the last few years , there will be quite a large increase in solar panels and CSP if it keeps developing . "
Eames says costs of solar panels have come down a " huge amount " over the past 12 months and will continue to fall as the technology develops and CSP 's maintenance costs are relatively small .
" Solar power 's time is starting to come , " Eames said .
Back in 2006 Nintendo revealed a few prototypes of the controller for its Wii console .
Mixed in with concepts that would become the Wii remote was a bizarre orange circular object with a large Starman button on top .
There was no clue offered as to just what this controller did or how it worked .
We 've been baffled for three and a half years , but now the answer has finally come forth thanks to Osamu Inoue 's new book Nintendo Magic : Winning The Video Game Wars in which the story of the development of the Wii and Nintendo DS 's unusual designs led Nintendo to shoot back to the top of the video game industry is told .
Here 's the explanation for the mysterious star controller :
Development on the new [ Wii ] controller was in full swing by the middle of 2004 .
With Iwata focusing on the DS , Miyamoto acted in his place on the project .
Takeda 's engineering team searched for sensors that would enable intuitive game control , which Miyamoto 's people used to implement the actual controller .
At first , they started just as Iwata had suggested - by aiming for a simple , TV remote - like controller .
But as they did the work of testing the controller prototypes that included new sensors , the form factors began to take an unexpected direction .
" No one liked that one , " recalls Miyamoto with a rueful grin , of a large , disc - shaped example .
It had a large star - shaped button in the center , surrounded by three smaller buttons , and used internal accelerometers that let the player control by tilting it forward , backwards , left , or tight .
The prototype was orange , and its bizarre appearance earned it the nickname " cheddar cheese " from the development team .
It was admittedly simple and easy to understand , but was also far too garish .
Miyamoto 's team met with around 40 game developers within Nintendo bimonthly to hear their opinions .
This iteration of the controller was met with opposition — they complained it was totally unsuited to traditional games like Mario and Zelda .
Mystery solved !
Thank goodness common sense reigned within Nintendo on this one .
While I 'm sure the company could have come up with some interesting ways to play with that star controller , I can't believe we'd have seen Super Mario Galaxy or Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption if that device were the standard over the Wii remote .
UCLA officials have decided not to use all of the $ 25 million in student fees that they were planning to spend on a $ 185 - million renovation of Pauley Pavilion , home of the school ’s legendary basketball team .
Vice Chancellor Steven A. Olsen said in a letter to The Times that $ 15 million of the student funds would go to other uses .
The letter followed a Sunday article detailing how , in a time of crippling budget cuts , administrators throughout the state have tapped funds meant for classrooms and student services to help pay for ill - timed land deals , loans to high - ranking officials and , at UCLA , the Pauley renovation .
Olsen said Wednesday that bids for the project came in lower than anticipated , bringing the expected cost down to $ 135 million .
The school still plans to use $ 10 million in student fees to help finance the renovation ; those fees are earmarked for seismic improvements to student facilities .
“ The seismic fee is not merely for support of seismic improvements , it ’s also for fire and safety issues , ” Olsen said .
“ There are a number of safety issues related to the uneven gait of the steps down to the bowl ” at Pauley .
The structure also needs seismic braces , wheelchair platforms to comply with the Americans With Disabilities
Act and upgrades to the fire alarm system , among other improvements , according to UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton .
The $ 15 million would have come from a fee approved in a student referendum in 2000 to renovate two other campus buildings : the student activities center and the aging John Wooden Recreation Center .
“ I think it ’s good that they ’re not using those fees , ” said Cindy Mosqueda , a UCLA doctoral candidate who , as a sophomore , campaigned in favor of the assessment .
Mosqueda had been critical of the plan to use the $ 15 million to help renovate Pauley , saying she never would have urged fellow students to tax themselves to fix up the basketball arena .
“ As someone who worked to get that fee implemented and approved by students , ” she said , “ I think it should be used more for its intended purpose . ”
Release of the funds “ is going to provide a reduced burden on the students , and the student fees can be used for other purposes to benefit them , ” Olsen said .
How the fee money will be used has not been decided yet , he said .
“ They could return it to students , ” said Richard Bergman , a former co-chair of the committee formed to raise private money for the renovation .
He had been critical of using the fee for Pauley .
Jamie Arneson , who had been president of UCLA ’s official student fan group and just graduated , said she thinks Pauley would be a great place to spend the money .
“ I ’m so excited for Pauley to be renovated , ” she said .
“ I go there a lot , and the chairs we sit on are kind of old ; people get splinters in their shins . ”

The Obama Administration ’s plan to split the Minerals Management Service into two agencies — one to manage leases and one to regulate safety — is good as far as it goes .
If they ’re really serious , they ’ll put the National Transportation Safety Board , or a similar new agency , in charge of investigating rig accidents and spills .
The NTSB already investigates pipeline accidents , so they have some expertise in a related technology .
They have an established culture of independence , fairness and thoroughness .
And the FAA / NTSB model of regulator / investigator is a proven one that could work for the MMS .
There are a couple “ investigations ” of the current spill mentioned in the press .
I ’ll bet they do n’t approach the thoroughness and professionalism of an NTSB inquiry , which can run for dozens of pages , even for nonfatal incidents .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , centre , with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama , left , and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at their meeting Saturday on the South Korean island of Jeju .
( ( Lee Jae - Won / Associated Press ) )
China showed no sign Saturday of publicly joining South Korea and Japan in rebuking North Korea over the sinking of a South Korean warship —- the issue dominating a three - nation weekend summit meeting .
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said he hoped the meeting with leaders of South Korea and Japan would help achieve peace .
Officials said Saturday 's discussions focused on trade issues , and the ship sinking was on Sunday 's agenda for the meeting at the South Korean resort island of Jeju .
As the main ally of North Korea , China has long been reluctant to back harsh measures against the reclusive state that shares its border .
But senior U.S. officials predicted after recent talks in Beijing that China will gradually endorse the view that North Korea should be held accountable .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions .
North assails ' hideous charade '
An international investigation concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March , killing 46 sailors in the South 's worst military loss since the Korean War .
North Korea has repeatedly denied responsibility , and the state - run Korean Central News Agency said Saturday the investigation was " a hideous charade " by Seoul and its " imperialist " allies America , Australia and Britain .
South Korea has laid out a series of punitive measures and pledged to haul Pyongyang before the United Nations Security Council .
The South 's steps , announced Monday , include slashing trade , resuming propaganda broadcasts across the border and launching large naval exercises off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula .
The North has said the South 's moves are pushing the two countries closer to war .
" These anti-North Korean confrontations are an open declaration of war against us and an extraordinarily criminal act that pushes inter-Korean relations into a state of war , " North Korean Maj .
Gen. Pak Rim Su said Friday , according to broadcaster APTN .
He spoke at a rare news conference of the National Defence Commission , which is headed by leader Kim Jong -il .
China wields veto power as a permanent Security Council member , so its support would be key to UN sanction against North Korea .
Chinese leader offers condolences
Before the two - day summit began Saturday , Wen offered condolences to the families of the dead sailors at a meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Chung Un-chan , the prime minister 's office said .
" China is a responsible nation which insists on justice and is seriously considering the findings of the multinational investigation , " Wen said , according to Chung spokesman Kim Chang - young .
" China has maintained consistent views on the stability of peace on the Korean Peninsula and opposes acts that destroy it , " he quoted Wen as saying .
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama 's government on Friday instituted new sanctions against North Korea .

Links Events News Books Cygnus Meonia QuestCon Articles Email Tiny Roman Bust Shows Pre-Columbian Contact With Mexico
( Revision III ) A Report by Andrew Collins ' Did Roman explorers discover America 1,300 years ahead of Christopher Columbus ' was the headline on page 25 of the DAILY MAIL for Thursday , 10 February 2000 .
On the same day THE EXPRESS ran a story on page 28 under the banner ` Oldest Latin in America : Bust may prove Romans got there first ' .
Both stories sought to highlight claims being made in the new issue of the magazine NEW SCIENTIST concerning the recent realisation that a small ceramic head found in 1933 at a site in the Toluca Valley , 72 kilometres west of Mexico City , is in fact Roman in origin .
( 1) A dating process known as thermoluminescence , which determines the age of ceramics , has found that the tiny bust is approximately 1800 years old .
How it might have reached Mexico is the big mystery .
The implication , however , is that the head , which shows a full - bearded individual in typical Latin style , was introduced to the New World prior to the age of Columbus .
David Kelley , an archaeologist at Canada 's University of Calgary stated that the bust was found ' sealed under three floors .
It is as close to archaeological certainty as you can get ' .
(2) Such statements led anthropologist Roman Hristow , formerly of the Southern Methodist University , to conclude that the bust is firm evidence of transatlantic contact between the Old and New World as early as AD 200 .
(3) Having become interested in the Roman piece , he managed to track it down to a museum in Mexico City , where it had remained since its discovery .
It was the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg , Germany , who conducted the tests which determined the age of the bust .
Afterwards art experts were more willing to accept that it was of Roman manufacture .
Hristow who then checked original excavation reports and realised that the bust must have been buried at least nine years before the arrival in Mexico of Hernando Cortés in 1519 .
Yet this realisation begs the real question of whether or not Roman explorers were making journeys to the Americas around AD 200 .
Betty Meggers , an anthropologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC , has stated that : ` I see no reason why ancient contact is not possible ' .
(4) She herself has made an extensive study of the similarities between the prehistoric pottery of the Joman culture of Japan and the Valdivia culture of Ecuador .
This she believes is evidence of transpacific contact with the Americas as early as 3000 BC .
In contrast , other archaeologists remain sceptical over the claims being made by scholars such as Hristow and Meggers .
Andrew Selkirk , the editor of CURRENT ARCHAEOLOGY , is of the opinion that : ` It is a big leap to claim that the Romans reached Mexico City when scientists are not certain whether they even reached the Canary Islands .
' You could imagine a ship being wrecked off Newfoundland and you could argue that it had been blown across the ocean , but to claim that a boat got as far as Mexico sounds a bit over the top ' .
Indeed , Selkirk even went so far as to say :
` It could have been dropped out of someone 's pocket in the 1930s or [ was ] put there as a spoof .
If you had three similar finds in three different places , then maybe that would be more credible ' .
(5) On a slightly different tack , David Grove , an archaeologist with the University of Illinois , while accepting that the head is Roman , suggests that it could have been taken from a shipwreck during some later age .
If this were so , it would remove any significance the bust might play in re-interpreting the history of Mexico .
(6 ) He also points out that there is no significant evidence of the influence of Old World cultures on the development of Mesoamerican civilisations prior to the age of Columbus .
(7 ) Speaking in the wake of lingering rumours and stories of Roman wrecks awaiting investigation off the coasts of Central and South America , Simon Keay , a Roman expert at Southampton University , says that although evidence of Roman contact has been found as far east as India , there are no records of trading routes to the Americas .
(8 ) A Mystery of Two Heads
The idea of transoceanic contact between the ancient world and the Americas is a subject crucial to our understanding of how Plato came to write his account of an Atlantic island called Atlantis in around 350 BC .
There is every reason to suppose that in order to construct the story he drew on vague maritime knowledge concerning what lay on the western Atlantic seaboard - information that most probably filtered into the Mediterranean world via Phoenicians from Spain and Carthaginian traders from North Africa .
Indeed , I feature the bust in the chapter of GATEWAY TO ATLANTIS entitled ` Shipwrecks and Sailors ' .
After highlighting the discovery of North African amphorae disgorged from possible Roman wrecks in the so - called Bay of Jars outside of Rio de Janeiro during the 1980s , I introduce the evidence for Roman contact with Mexico .
I cite the fired clay bricks used to construct various classical Maya sites in the Yucatán peninsular , in particular the great city of Comalcalco .
The walls of its great palace show a remarkable similarity to fired clay structures of the Roman world , while maker 's marks have been said to resemble characters from a south - east Asian script .
This is territory dealt with in extraordinary detail by British transoceanic expert David Eccott and American archaeologist Neil Steede .
I go on to cite the tiny sculpted Roman head highlighted in the NEW SCIENTIST article and in subsequent national news stories in British papers such as THE DAILY MAIL and THE EXPRESS .
The ceramic piece came originally from a site named Calixtlahuaca , located some 72 kilometres west of Mexico City .
It was excavated in 1933 by archaeologist José Garcia Payón of Mexico 's National Museum .
According to the reports , it was found , along with various grave goods , in a truncated pyramid structure dating to the twelfth century and belonging to the Toltec culture which thrived during this era .
This would then imply that the Roman bust could have been in Mexico for up to 1,000 years , not simply nine or ten years as has been claimed by anthropologist Roman Hristow .
Initially it was thought that this fascinating artefact , which takes the form of a terracotta vessel several centimetres in height , is the one pictured in several books on transoceanic contact with a bushy beard and conical cap , like the Phrygian caps worn by the classical gods Perseus and Mithras .
(9 ) Yet the Roman bust that appeared originally in the NEW SCIENTIST article , and subsequently in THE EXPRESS , was an entirely different one without a hat and with much sharper features .
After some initial confusion it has now been established that this picture had nothing whatsoever to do with the Calixtlahuaca head , and was used simply , and rather sloppily , to illustrate the news story .
( 10 ) American Odyssey
So how might this priceless Roman artefact have come to be in Mexico in the first place ?
Austrian orientalist and anthropologist Dr Robert Heine - Geldern , a believer in transpacific contact in pre-Columbian times , was of the opinion in an article published in 1961 that the bust - which he describes as wearing a ` Pylos ' , a knitted cap favoured among sailors from the Greek seaport of Pylos - had come across originally from Indo - China , where Roman artefacts have occasional been found .
( 11 ) In his view , it reached India via trade links with the Roman Empire , and then had been traded on to Indo - Chinese cultures in Southeast Asia who were themselves making transoceanic journeys during this age .
( 12 ) It was in this way that the head had reached Mexico , and not through direct Roman contact with the Americas .
I have no objection to the view that Roman explorers , or indeed traders , might have made transpacific journeys to Mexico as early as AD 200 .
However , we must also not ignore the clear evidence for transatlantic contact by Romans during this same epoch .
We have the evidence of the amphorae and possible wrecks ( yes , wrecks in plural ) awaiting investigation off the coast of Brazil .
There is another Roman wreck lying off the coast of Honduras in Central America .
As early as 1976 it was disgorging amphorae which have been determined to be of Punic , i.e. North African , origin ( See GATEWAY ATLANTIS ) .
There is also the case of the Roman coin hoard found washed up in a jar on a beach in north - east Venezuela .
The age of the coins span an immensely - long period that stretches between the reign of Caesar Augustus ( 63 BC - AD 14 ) and a date of around AD 350 .
Since the hoard includes many duplicates , there seems very little likelihood that it could have been a discarded or buried collection of colonial origin , or that it might have been part of a national treasure trove on its way either to or from the New World .
What seems more likely is that it is the wealth of a Roman trader lost overboard when his ship was wrecked sometime around AD 350 .
Remember , a vessel that follows the North Equatorial Current westwards from the Cape Verdes will be carried directly to the northern coast of Venezuela , almost precisely where the hoard was found .
The coins are now in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution .
( 13 ) In addition to this evidence there are numerous examples of Roman amphorae and coins having been found in New England , indicating that Roman vessels were also using the so - called Northwest Passage to reach North America via the Faeroes , Iceland , Greenland , Nova Scotia and Newfoundland .
Lastly , the sheer fact that Dr Heine - Geldern cites the fact that the Calixtlahuaca head sports a cap found among the sailors of Pylos hints at a possible maritime connection between this object and its arrival in Mexico .
Pylos , by the way , was a town of Messenia , located on the western coast of the Peloponnesus , opposite the island of Sphacteria in the Ionian Sea .
So when considering the possibility of Roman contact across the Pacific , one should also not forget the Atlantic trade routes that were inherited by the Romans most probably from the Berbers and Taureg peoples of North Africa after the fall of Carthage in 147 BC .
With respect to Simon Keay 's statement in the DAILY MAIL to the effect that there is no evidence of trade routes to the Americas I need only to cite the words of Statius Sebosus , a Roman geographer quoted in the works of Caius Solinus and Pliny the Elder .
He recorded that the islands of the Hesperides lay 40 days ' sail beyond the Gorgades .
Since it can be adequately demonstrated that the Gorgades , or the islands of the Gorgons , were the Cape Verde islands , located off the coast of Senegal in West Africa , and the Hesperides were located in the Far West , there is every reason to believe that Sebosus was alluding to a transatlantic journey time between Africa and the West Indies .
The Hesperides were certainly taken to be the West Indies by Spanish explorers and chroniclers shortly after the discovery of the New World , and there is every reason to believe that they got it right .
Solinus and Pliny would seem to have preserved a knowledge of transatlantic contact either prior to or contemporary with Sebosus ' lifetime ( he is thought to have lived in c. 100 BC ) .
If so , then who exactly was making these journeys ?
Was it the Romans , or could Sebosus have been recalling much earlier journeys made to and from the West Indies by Iberic Phoenicians and Carthaginians ?
With respect to the statement made by David Grove of the University of Illinois to the effect that although the Calixtlahuaca bust is Roman it could have come from a Roman shipwreck , I can say only this .
If it did come from a shipwreck then it is yet further evidence that Roman vessels reached as far as Mexico .
However , I feel it is far more likely that goods for trade were brought to the American mainland by Roman explorers in the time period of its manufacture .
I cannot accept that the Roman head was introduced to the site during excavations in the 1930s , or that it is part of some kind of elaborate hoax .
What seems most important is that some scholars are now openly accepting that an item of Roman manufacture has been found through professional excavations at an archaeological site of Mesoamerican origin that predates the time of the conquest .
This is an incredible revelation and one which is as significant as the announcement in the 1960s that evidence of Viking occupation had been found at a site named l'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland .
Previous to this time scholars have always considered that Roman artifacts found in the Americas were either dropped accidentally or planted deliberately in colonial times .
This news also helps strengthen my own theories regarding the manner in which Plato appears to have constructed his Atlantis story from maritime lore reaching the Mediterranean world via Iberic - Phoenician and Carthaginian traders .
They , it seems , were making journeys in secret to the West Indies , which were known in Roman times as the Hesperides ( after Sebosus and others ) , as well as the islands left above sea-level following the break up of the Atlantean landmass ( after Marcellus and Proclus ) .
I suggest that readers examine GATEWAY TO ATLANTIS for a more detailed account of the evidence for transatlantic journeys to the Americas in ancient times .

UPDATE : Oil spill may hurt Gulf Coast
Oil leaking from a sunken drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico oozed slowly toward the coast Monday , endangering hundreds of miles of marshes , barrier islands and white sand beaches in four states from Louisiana to Florida .
The areas , home to dolphins , sea birds , prime fishing grounds and tourist playlands , could be fouled later this week if crews can't cut off an estimated 42,000 gallons a day escaping two leaks in a drilling pipe about 5,000 feet below the surface .
The rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 and sank two days later .
Eleven of the 126 workers on board at the time are missing and presumed dead ; the rest escaped .
The cause of the explosion has not been determined and oil has been leaking ever since .
Crews are using robot submarines to activate valves in hopes of stopping the leaks , but they 're not sure when they 'll know if that strategy will work .
The spill , moving slowly north and spreading east and west , was about 30 miles from the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast Tuesday .
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said it would likely be several days before any oil reaches the coast .
George Crozier , oceanographer and executive director at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama , said he was studying wind and ocean currents driving the oil .
He said Pensacola , Fla. , is likely the edge of the threatened area .
“ I do n't think anybody knows with confidence what the effects will be , ” Crozier said .
“ We 've never seen anything like this magnitude . ”
In Louisiana , Gov. Bobby Jindal asked the Coast Guard to deploy oil containment booms in the Pass A Loutre wildlife area , a 115,000 - acre preserve that is home to alligators , birds and fish near the mouth of the Mississippi River .
In Mississippi , Gov. Haley Barbour said he has spoken with the Coast Guard mission commander , Rear Adm .
Mary Landry but was uncertain what steps his state might take to protect its beaches .
“ It 's a real difficulty in trying to determine what defenses will be effective , ” he said .
A fleet of boats and containment equipment was working to corral and skim oil from the surface of the Gulf late last week .
But a weather system that spawned deadly tornadoes in Louisiana and Mississippi and heavy seas over the weekend forced crews to suspend their efforts .
Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell said 32 vessels are waiting for conditions to improve to resume cleanup .
The Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and operated by BP Plc. , was drilling about 40 miles off the delta of the Mississippi River when it exploded .
A recent survey [ PDF ] of cellphone users revealed that more than half of Verizon 's customer base would abandon their current phones for an iPhone if given the opportunity .
Market research firm ChangeWave polled more than 4,000 cellphone users for the study .
Of the Verizon customers surveyed , 19 % said they would " very likely " purchase an iPhone if it became available on Verizon , while another 34 % claimed that they would be " somewhat likely " to purchase .
Sprint and T - Mobile customers were less enthusiastic about the device .
11 % of of Sprint and T - Mobile customers said they would " very likely " buy the iPhone if it became available via their carrier , and only 33 % and 28 % said they would be " somewhat likely " to buy , respectively .
" The survey results show an unprecedented level of pent up demand for the iPhone among Verizon subscribers , " the survey noted .
" If Verizon were ever to offer the iPhone … [ it would have ] a profound and likely transformational impact on the industry . "
Although many Verizon customers want an iPhone , very few are willing to switch to AT&T to get it .
49 % of Verizon customers — the highest in the industry — claimed that they were " very satisfied " with the carrier .
Furthermore , only 7 % said they were " very likely " or " somewhat likely " to switch wireless providers in the next 90 days , compared to 8 % of AT&T , 10 % of Sprint and 14 % of T - Mobile subscribers .
The study again leaves us asking :
When will the iPhone come to Verizon ?
[ via ComputerWorld ]
On April 24 , I put aside my Google Nexus One and purchased a white 32 GB iPhone 3GS from AT&T .
Two days ago , I returned the Apple smartphone and cancelled the service .
My reasons should interest anyone considering AT&T and iPhone between now and June 1st , especially , and after June 7th .
The first date is when AT&T jacks up early termination fees ; the second , when Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 4G .
Let me start by saying that I wo n't pull a Dan Lyons .
The Newsweek columnist and Steve Jobs wannabe also is switching from iPhone to Nexus One .
But he unleashed one helluva venomous diatribe explaining why .
I 've got no venom to spew .
I really enjoyed the iPhone 3GS and will miss using the device .
My reasons are more pragmatic .
First some background :
In October 2009 , I moved my family from AT&T to T - Mobile , putting aside iPhone in the process .
I had been an AT&T customer for about six years .
My simple reason :
Too many dropped calls .
Six or more a day was a common number , with about as many failed outgoing calls .
By comparison , I used T - Mobile for nearly five months before dropping a call .
Advertisement
But following Apple 's April 8th iPhone OS 4 announcement , I reconsidered the switch .
My major gripe with iPhone is multitasking , something Apple should fix well enough with iPhone OS 4 .
I had n't tested iPhone apps for many months and wanted to prep for Apple 's newest mobile operating system .
Also , I did n't having a portable music player or good stereo digital recorder for doing interviews .
Apple 's smartphone could fill in for both .
So I finally decided to buy a new iPhone 3GS and start fresh with AT&T .
In California , the buyer 's remorse period is 30 days ; I would have plenty of time to evaluate AT&T and iPhone 3GS .
I also would be coming off the Nexus One , which would be a great comparison to the iPhone 3GS .
To be clear : I planned on the switch being permanent ; I ported my number to AT&T .
But it was not to be .
Here are my 10 reasons for dumping iPhone 3GS and AT&T ( again ) , in no order of importance :
1. Dropped calls .
During my first two weeks back with AT&T , I experienced fewer dropped or failed calls than before my departure in October 2009 .
Then the experience deteriorated .
Last week , dropped and failed calls returned with a vengeance .
For example , in conversations with my father - in - law and The Loops 's Jim Dalrymple over one 15 minute period , calls dropped six times .
I simply gave up talking to both men .
By the way , when I returned the iPhone , the AT&T rep asked where I live .
She laughed and said that everybody at the store knows that my zipcode has some of the worst AT&T service in San Diego .
" Oh ? " I asked .
" Then why when I asked about reception before , AT&T reps said it was strong in my area ? "
She did n't answer that question , but instead offered me an AT&T MicroCell .
" We normally charge $ 150 , but it 's free to people in your area , " she said .
Basically , MicroCell acts as a local 3G hub connected to the home 's broadband .
Ah , no thanks .
2. Google is leapfrogging Apple .
That 's the story headline from Gizmodo on May 20 , and I so totally agree .
Apple 's yearly iPhone release cycle simply is n't fast enough to stay competitive .
Google has taken Android from version 1 to 2.2 since the T - Mobile G1 shipped in autumn 2008 ; Google is rapidly innovating by iteration .
The pace reminds me of the browser wars , where Netscape lumbered along while Microsoft lept ahead .
The numbers tell part of the story .
According to Gartner , Android handset sales rose to 5.2 million units during first quarter from 575,300 a year earlier .
Last week , Google revealed 100,000 Android phone activations a day , which over one quarter puts units at 9 million -- or more than the number of iPhones sold during first quarter .
3. Android 2.2 .
The new operating system is chock full of exciting features , many of which either close the gap on iPhone OS or push ahead of it .
Installation of apps onto memory card , Web - based app store , better suport for multiple e-mail accounts and faster Chrome browser are among the new features that turned me away from iPhone , even when anticipating v4 .
Then there is support for Adobe Flash , which Apple CEO Steve Jobs disses .
He can keep iPhone .
The real Web runs Flash .
4. Android notifications bar .
Sometimes the simplest user interface feature can change everything .
Good example is TiVo 's program guide grid , which opened up the digital video recording market .
Time - shifting was n't a new concept .
People could record shows on VHS tapes long before TiVo .
But the program guide proved to be a simpler and much better motif .
I say the same about Android 's notifications bar , which by its placement , pull - down access and audible zing leaps way ahead of iPhone notifications .
It 's one of Android 's killer features .
5. Desktop widgets .
Returning to using the iPhone 3GS at first felt like returning to something old after using something new .
The Nokia N900 and Nexus One spoiled me with their widgetized home screens .
For example , while iPhone forced me to use various news apps , Nexus One provides a Google News widget accessing thousands of news sites .
Nexus
One kept me more informed than iPhone .
Widgets make what is important readily available and updated in real time .
6. AT&T termination fees .
On June 1st , AT&T will raise early termination fees from $ 175 to $ 325 .
I simply did n't want to be locked in to AT&T .
I got to wondering why the increase , too .
What is it that we do n't know yet about iPhone 4G ?
Is Apple charging AT&T more for the new device ?
Is AT&T concerned about churn to other services , like Verizon and its two - for - one Android smartphone deal ?
Could AT&T and Apple be planning to lower iPhone 's purchase price , increasing the carrier 's subsidy while paying same price for the phone ?
Or perhaps could lower monthly subscription fees be coming ?
Is iPhone coming to other carriers and AT&T proactively acting to keep customers ?
As a journalist , I 'm interested in the answers .
As a consumer , with the number of dropped calls , I was n't willing to be locked in for $ 325 .
7 . My wife loves the Nexus One .
My beloved is an artist and non-geek .
She simply does n't like gadgets -- but she loves her Nexus One .
After switching to iPhone 3GS , I offered her the Nexus One , not really expecting her to take to it ; for starters , I find the Google phone to be kind of ugly compared to iPhone .
What got her :
The aspect of the user interface I also found appealing -- the notifications bar ( see # 4 ) .
Now she does e-mail and Facebook on her phone , because of the notifications .
My wife had used an iPhone 3G in autumn 2008 and asked me to return it , which I did within the 30 - day buyer 's remorse period .
She 's keeping the Nexus One .
I had to buy another , and it arrived while I was writing this post .
By the way , nearly two weeks ago there was big noise about Google stopping Nexus One direct sales .
Oh , yeah ?
When ?
I ordered my phone from Google on Sunday ( May 23rd ) .
8. Blue Mikey .
Like iPod Classic , when I had one , iPhone 3GS was to be my digital recorder with attached microphone .
I purchased the Blue Mikey , which records in stereo on iPhone 3GS in airplane mode .
I also purchased from the iTunes App Store $ 9.99 " FiRe - Field Recorder . "
But when I connected the iPhone to my computer , the recorded audio files would n't transfer .
According to the FiRe 's support site : " You cannot transfer your recordings using ' Sync ' because it is proprietary to Apple . "
Say what ?
I was presented with ridiculous options like browser access over same WiFi network ( which I could n't make work ) or uploading to FTP site .
Frak that .
When I 'm recording interviews at events , there 's no time to muck around with FTP sites .
If sync is n't good enough , the product is n't good enough .
9. Service costs .
I have five lines on T - Mobile , four of them with unlimited phone , Web and text .
These five lines cost me less per month than four did on the AT&T 2,100 - minute family plan .
I paid more for Nexus One ( $ 529 ) versus iPhone 3GS ( $ 299 ) , but Nexus One is unlocked and the extra AT&T monthly fees would close the price difference in less than two months of service .
10 . I prefer the real Web to apps .
With iPhone , there are too many disparate applications .
Nexus
One presents the real Web , which will be more real with Android 2.2 .
Google also presents the real Web in a really useful way , in the browser and with supporting app services .
The emphasis is search and location -- what people need where they are .
During the iPhone OS launch in April , Jobs asserted : " Search is not happening on phones . "
What alternate universe is he living ?
Search is one of the principle benefits of smartphones .
By the way , of course I do use apps .
Amazon 's release of Kindle for Android also factored into my decision , which leads to something else .
Nexus
One is all the tablet I need -- better because it 's always with me .
So also with the switch back to Nexus One came something else : Yesterday I sold my iPad to a good friend .
As asserted last week , iPad is n't for everyone , and that includes me .

This weekend marks one year since beavers were released into the wild in Scotland for the first time since the 17th century .
The reintroduction of the animals to Knapdale Forest in Argyll has been controversial as our Scotland Correspondent , James Cook explains .
True to form the beavers have been busy .
After a 400 year absence from Britain they wasted no time in getting to work .
In a dappled clearing of Knapdale Forest the evidence of their activity is all around .
Sharp teeth marks are left on several large trees which have been gnawed to the ground as timber .
A little deeper into the woodland , a small clump of rowan trees has been felled and dragged away .
Sharp twigs
In fact the beavers have neatly thinned out a whole section of the forest near Barnluasgan .
The little lumberjacks have removed the wood for a major construction project - a dam built with remarkable precision .
It 's an impressive piece of engineering .
Earth , moss and wood are propped up by a neat array of sharp twigs , supported by larger logs which even a human would find difficult to lift .

All but a trickle of water has been stopped , flooding the flat land upstream , including a forestry path .
The result has been to extend the beavers ' territory , giving them more shallow water in which to forage , seek shelter and , possibly , breed .
Nick Purdy who manages the area for the Forestry Commission is impressed with what he calls the " natural woodland managers " .
He explained : " Dare I say it , some of our forestry contractors have probably got something to learn from them
" They 've been felling material for creating the dam and it's all cut to length , it was all presented perfectly for dragging out to the dam .
" You 'd have thought people were doing it rather than beavers to be honest . "
Chubby spaniels
All this work was carried out by animals which are not much bigger than chubby spaniels .
As dusk fell earlier this week a small group of enthusiasts watched as one beaver emerged from the family lodge .
The animal glided silently across the water , pushing out a little bow wave before dipping and diving with a flash of a powerful tail .
The first 12 months of this five year trial have seen their ups and downs .
Image caption Evidence left by the beavers handy work
But the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust which are running the project , insist it 's been a success so far .
Simon Jones , project manager of the Scottish Beaver Trial , said : " We 're really happy with the way things have gone to date .
" So far we 've released four families of animals into the wild here at Knapdale .
" Three of them have settled really well and have gone on to build lodges to show that they 've settled in . "
The fate of the fourth family is murkier .
Three beavers disappeared last August after reports of unauthorised shooting in the trial area .
The beaver reintroduction has plenty of opponents in Argyll and there was speculation that the animals had been shot or scared off by the gunfire .
Both are possible , admits Mr Jones , but he says an investigation into the disappearance and the gunshots was inconclusive .
" It may have been a sheer coincidence , " he says .
Beavers have to cut down trees on a regular basis to eat Jane Allan
The episode did highlight the opposition of some locals , particularly anglers , to the experiment .
Two miles downstream from the beavers at Barnluasgan is Seafield Farm where Jane Allan manages holiday cottages and makes baskets .
She said : " We have concerns about the beavers long term because we 're worried that they will create such a huge impact on the environment . "
Mrs Allan added that three beavers have turned a " fairly small marshy puddle " into a little loch and she thinks such change will continue .
She pointed out : " Beavers have to cut down trees on a regular basis to eat .
" They have to eat a huge amount of vegetable matter to keep themselves going and if you look at any of the places that the beavers have been they have created quite a lot of devastation . "
While the project team insist they are listening to such concerns , the next stage of the trial may upset the critics even more .
Conservationists are hopeful that the animals will now breed .
Scotland 's first baby beavers in four centuries would not be welcomed by all .

Mr Morley , Mr Chaytor , Mr Devine and Lord Hanningfield deny the charges
Three former Labour MPs facing criminal charges over their expenses will have their legal fees paid by the taxpayer .
David Chaytor , Elliot Morley and Jim Devine will receive legal aid , an HM Courts Service spokesman confirmed .
Tory peer Lord Hanningfield , who also faces charges , has not applied for legal aid .
All four deny the charges .
The former MPs have got legal aid under an outgoing " interests of justice " test as they may face prison if convicted .
The decision is made by the court .
When asked after a visit to a Cheshire car plant whether MPs facing expenses charges should get legal aid , Prime Minister Gordon Brown did not answer .
But Chancellor Alistair Darling told Sky News he was " puzzled " by the award of legal aid to the MPs , and acknowledged the public would be " hopping mad " over the decision .
Conservative leader David Cameron said granting legal aid to the MPs was a " complete outrage " and promised to review the system .
Shadow schools secretary Michael Gove said the news was a " slap in the face for every decent taxpayer in this country " .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said people would be " dismayed " that taxpayers ' money was being used to defend these allegations .
' Interests of justice '
The HM Courts Service spokesman said an application for legal aid for the three men was granted on Friday .
Mr Justice Saunders will hear their case during a two - day hearing at Southwark Crown Court from 27 May .
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that officials applied the " interests of justice " test to determine whether the MPs should receive legal aid .
The test says if a defendant is at risk of losing his or her liberty - that is , they could go to prison if convicted - then they are entitled to legal representation paid for by the state .
CRIMINAL LEGAL AID Individual courts decide who to aid " in the interests of justice " Means testing trials being rolled out across England and Wales
In the future , applicants earning more than £ 283 per month or with £ 30,000 in assets will contribute Courts can order defendants to repay part of their defence after a trial Total repaid by defendants in last financial year after a judge 's order at the end of a trial : £ 1 m
Total legal aid budget : £ 2.1 bn
The " interests of justice " test began to be phased out in January to be replaced by a means test for all Crown Court cases in England and Wales - but Southwark Crown Court is not yet part of the new scheme , so it did not apply to the MPs .
Justice Minister Jack Straw told the BBC : " It is simply a matter of chance that [ the means test ] is yet to be introduced in Southwark , where the former MPs are being tried .
" Decisions about legal aid are made by the courts , and MPs and ministers have no control over the award of legal aid in individual cases . "
However , if the MPs are convicted the trial judge could order them to pay back all or some of the costs of the case .
The MPs - who have instructed barristers to argue their cases - have all been suspended by the Labour Party , while Lord Hanningfield has been suspended by the Conservatives .
All four are accused of theft by false accounting and if found guilty , face a maximum sentence of seven years in prison .
Police began investigating after details of all MPs ' expenses claims were leaked to the Daily Telegraph .
The men's lawyers have said that they intended to argue that they should be dealt with by Parliament rather than the courts because their actions were protected by parliamentary privilege .
Privilege traditionally guarantees MPs and peers immunity from slander laws for statements in parliamentary debates and also relates to access to parliamentary buildings .

This site is a little project that lets me make fun of some things and sense of others .
I use it to think a little more relationally without resorting to doing actual math .
Here 's the deal .
Jos� Corral was seriously considering joining the Mormon Church .
For weeks , Corral , 45 , a fourth - grade teacher , met with Mormon missionaries at his home in Laveen to read the Book of Mormon and prepare for his baptism .
Corral , a Catholic and the father of two preteen daughters , was especially drawn to the church 's commitment to family values .
" I was really interested .
I thought , you know , it is going to be really good for the kids , " said Corral , a legal permanent resident from Mexico .
Then , Corral said , he found out that state Sen.
Russell Pearce , a Republican from Mesa and sponsor of Arizona 's tough new immigration law , is a member of the church .
Corral said he told the missionaries to stop coming because he considers the law to be anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic .
" I decided I did not want to expose my kids to a religion that has members that hate other people because they are different , " Corral said .
Corral is not alone .
The law , which makes it a state crime to be in the country without proper immigration papers , has tarnished the Mormon Church 's image among many Latinos , a huge group the church is aggressively trying to attract .
Pearce , a devout Mormon , has been the driving force behind virtually every bill introduced in recent years aimed at clamping down on illegal immigrants .
Mormon officials say Pearce does not speak for the church , which has not taken a stance on Arizona 's law or the issue of immigration .
Still , it has put the church on the defensive .
Kenneth Patrick Smith , a Mesa lawyer and president of the Valencia Branch , a Spanish - speaking LDS congregation in Mesa , said missionaries from his church have had doors slammed in their faces since Arizona 's new law was signed by Gov. Jan Brewer in April .
" They say , ' Why would we want to hear anything from a religion that would do this to the Hispanic community ? ' " said Smith , who emphasized that he was speaking for himself , not the church .
" It 's a great disconnect because on one hand the missionaries are out there preaching brotherly love , kindness , charity , tolerance , faith , hope , etc. , and then they see on TV a quote - unquote Mormon pushing this legislation that makes them not only . . . terrified but terrorized . "
Pearce has repeatedly said his efforts to drive illegal immigrants out of Arizona and keep them from coming here is based on the Mormon Church 's 13 Articles of Faith , which includes obeying the law .
The law makes it a state crime to be in Arizona without proper immigration papers .
It also requires police to ask a person 's immigration status if there is " reasonable suspicion " that the person is in the country illegally .
Critics say it could lead to rampant racial profiling and civil - rights abuses by officers targeting Latinos based on appearance .
Many Latinos who view the new law as unjust and discriminatory blame not only Pearce but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
That is making it hard for Mormons to proselytize to the state 's 1.8 million Latinos , whom the church views as key to future growth .
Smith said he has already seen the effects of stepped - up immigration enforcement and fears more to come when the law takes effect July 29 .
" I deal with the aftermath of what happens when someone gets deported in the middle of the night or does n't come home from work .
I 'm left to help with families and deal with the crying kids and their wives .
It 's devastating on these families when the dad does n't come home , " Smith said .
Pearce did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment .
Kim Farah , a spokeswoman for the LDS headquarters in Salt Lake City , said in an e-mail that elected officials who are Mormons do not represent the position of the church .
She said the church has also not taken a position on immigration , which is " clearly the province of government . "
" However , Church leaders have urged compassion and careful reflection when addressing immigration issues affecting millions of people , " she said in the e-mail .
Some Latino members , however , would like the church to do more .
" I want the church to put a stop to him , " said Celia Alejandra Alvarez Portugal , 30 , a member of the LDS Aguila Ward in Phoenix .
Alvarez , an illegal immigrant from Mexico , is in deportation proceedings after the landscaping business she worked for was raided last year by Maricopa County sheriff 's deputies .
Arizona has one of the largest Mormon populations of any state .
There are 383,000 Mormons in Arizona , or nearly 6 percent of the population , according to the church .
Proselytizing is a cornerstone of the Mormon faith .
The church has trained Spanish - speaking missionaries to go out into neighborhoods to preach to Latinos and encourage them to join the church .
The church does not keep records according to ethnicity .
But the number of Spanish - speaking congregations in Arizona has grown from a handful a decade ago to 51 today .
Smaller congregations are known as branches , and larger ones are called wards .
Branches and wards are grouped geographically into stakes .
Nora Casta�eda , 46 , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Hermosillo , Mexico , who has been a member of the LDS Church for 35 years , said several colleagues confronted her after the law passed .
Casta�eda , director of secondary - language development at Phoenix 's Creighton School District , recalls one saying , " It 's somebody from your church who did this . "
Another , according to Casta�eda , said , " Your ( Mormon ) brother did this . "
She does not believe , however , that Pearce 's anti-illegal - immigrant stance is in line with the Mormon faith , which , in addition to teaching obedience to the law , teaches compassion .
" It is embarrassing to have to defend the church for the thoughts of one man , " said Casta�eda , a member of the Spanish - speaking Liahona Second Ward in Mesa .
In addition to making it hard for the church to reach out to Latinos , the new law is also causing some new converts to leave , she said .
" The husband of a woman ( at her church ) is not letting her go back to the church because he knows a Mormon made this law , " Casta�eda said .
Juan Carlos Zazueta , a math teacher and member of the Liahona Second Ward , converted to the LDS Church when he was 11 .
He does not believe many longtime Latino members will leave the church because of Pearce .
But he thinks as many as half of the Latino families in his church will leave the state because they have a greater chance of having a family member who is undocumented be deported under the new law .
Jorge Pimienta , who oversees missionaries at the Valencia Branch , also expects many Latino families from his congregation to leave .
He blames Pearce .
" I do n't know Russell Pearce .
I do n't know where he is coming from .
All I know is that what he is doing is not what Jesus Christ taught , " he said .
Play along with John Plunkett as we track where the party leaders have been and who they 've met , during the foreign affairs election debate
See the leaders ' debate game in a larger map
It 's the game everyone 's talking about .
No , not Liverpool 's Europa League semi-final clash with Atletico Madrid but our party leaders ' debate global take on buzzword bingo , AKA " As I told Barack while we were shooting hoops with George Clooney . "
In case you have n't been following the debate so far ( where were you ? ) tonight 's debate will be centred around international affairs , and contenders will be awarded points for their global awareness and number of times they have met world leaders .
Extra points are to be won for obscure countries or particularly important world leaders ( okay then , Barack Obama ) , plus an all - important bonus round , more details of which below .
It 's all entirely scientific - even more than Derren Brown 's efforts to predict the National Lottery - but do let us know if you think we 've got the scores wrong , or missed that all - important reference to the day a party leader went grizzly bear wrestling with Vladimir Putin .
Thanks for all your suggestions , some of which we have incorporated below .
Those all - important rules , in full :
• One point for mentioning Iraq or Afghanistan
• Two points for mentioning the United States , Russia , or China
• Five points for any other country ( it shows they are making an effort )
• One point for mentioning an overseas prime minister / president / head of state
• Five points if they refer to a meeting with that prime minister / president / head of state
• 10 points if that head of state was Barack Obama
• 15 points for a meeting with " our troops "
• 20 points to anyone who claims to have met an " ordinary person " in a country other than the UK
• 50 points to anyone who can pronounce Eyjafjallajökull ( yes , I cut and paste it )
Bonus round
Minus 20 points to anyone who says " I agree with Nick " ( that 's SO last week ) .
Clearly Clegg 's at an advantage here , as he 's unlikely to refer to himself in the third person just yet .
So we 'll deduct 10 points from Clegg if he DOESN'T at some point have a pop at the Daily Mail .
What do points make ?
Prime ministers !
Good debate , good debate .
Hope you 're all playing at party headquarters .
Keeeeeeeeeeep voting !

A GROUP of Queensland police officers is being investigated over the alleged theft of $ 20 from a crash victim 's wallet .
Ethical Standards Command has been investigating at least four Sunshine Coast officers over the missing money for almost a year .
The ugly incident is among about 200 matters being examined by Ethical Standards - some of which have dragged on for years .
Officers responsible for receiving the property belonging to a man killed in a road accident last year noted he had four $ 20 notes in his wallet .
By the time the wallet was returned to the station , one of the $ 20 notes had disappeared .
The alleged theft was noted by senior staff at the station the next morning when the victim 's belongings were being prepared for collection .
It is understood one officer offered to replace the $ 20 with his own money but was told it would have to be reported to Ethical Standards .
ESC investigators arrived at the station that afternoon - but almost a year later no one has been charged or disciplined over the missing cash .
The ESC is already under fire over the time it takes to complete investigations .
Officers complain they are left in limbo while cases are allowed to drag on for months .
Three of the officers under investigation over the alleged theft continue to work at the station .
An officer who spoke to The Courier - Mail said a $ 20 note folded in exactly the same way as the others in the man 's wallet was found in the station 's social club tin .
He said the club 's organiser had recently emailed staff reminding them of money owed to the club and asking them to pay up .
" We all know who it is but he wo n't own up and we can't prove it , " the officer said .
" That 's what eats at me .
I have to work with this man . "
The victim's mother said she was sorry to hear about the alleged theft but urged the police service to " forget about it and move on " .
" Police are very underpaid .
This officer probably has a few kids and was facing a lot of bills , " she said .
" It is a bit sad but there are many more important things . "
Last year 2760 complaints were lodged about the conduct of Queensland 's 10,200 police , up from 2267 the previous year and 2104 in 2008 .
Almost 30 police are now suspended or have been stood down while being investigated .
The QPS said Ethical Standard investigators involved in the wallet case were unavailable to answer questions .
A BP shareholder has filed suit against the corporation 's top executives because of the offshore rig disaster that has led to the growing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico .
Filed in federal court in New Orleans on Friday , the lawsuit by Pennsylvania resident Katherine Firpo accuses Anthony B. Hayward , the chief executive officer of BP PLC , and other executives of the London - based corporation , of ignoring safety issues on rigs such as the Deepwater Horizon , which exploded on April 20 .
And she accuses them of pursuing cost - cutting measures at the expense of safety , while lobbying government authorities to decrease safety regulation .
The lawsuit says the rig accident and the leak it caused will cost BP tens of billions of dollars .
The suit is a " shareholder derivative " suit , meaning it was filed by a shareholder on the company 's behalf .
Among other things , the lawsuit seeks court - ordered changes in BP 's corporate governance , and an order that the executives pay monetary damages .
A BP spokesman declined comment Monday .
The lawsuit is among a flurry of lawsuits filed by rig workers or their families and by fishermen and business owners claiming economic damage .
Firpo 's lawsuit says safety issues have been ignored even after a similar lawsuit filed in 2006 was settled out of court .
Corporate executives made " purely cosmetic changes at the corporate level " after the settlement , the suit says .
" The BP Defendants have a long history of ignoring crucial safety issues related to the operation of offshore submersible rigs such as the Deepwater Horizon rig , including problems with the crucial blowout preventer devices that so spectacularly failed during this disaster , " the lawsuit says .
The lawsuit also names three other corporations it says are liable to BP as a result of the disaster :
The rig 's owner - operator Transocean Ltd. ; Cameron International Corp. , which manufactured the blowout preventer ; and Halliburton Energy Services Inc. , which had been working to cap the well with cement prior to the explosion .
Spokesmen for those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment .

“ This was really a decision between helping out small business or helping out large banks , ” said John Emling , a lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association .
“ No one wanted to pick between friends and they had friends on both sides , but because of the momentum , we just felt that if Durbin pushed folks to the vote we would win . ”
The banking overhaul bill still needs to pass the Senate , and then it must be reconciled with a House bill that does not mention debit card “ interchange ” fees .
Banking industry groups said that they had not given the issue enough attention in recent weeks , focusing instead on other controversial amendments .
But they said they would now redouble efforts to convince legislators that the provision would hurt customers by undermining the debit card system .
“ Retailers who benefit greatly from the system will pay almost nothing for the costs of maintaining and improving it , ” said the American Bankers Association .
The Durbin amendment gives the Federal Reserve new authority to regulate and limit the fees that businesses pay to card companies .
It specifically addresses payments processed through the Visa and MasterCard networks .
American Express and Discover cards are not covered by the bill .
Last year businesses paid Visa and MasterCard $ 19.71 billion on debit card transactions , according to The Nilson Report , a trade magazine that is regarded as the best source of data on the industry .
Visa and MasterCard in turn passed about 80 percent of the money , roughly $ 15.8 billion , to the banks that issued the cards .
The legislation directs the Fed to cap those fees at a level that is “ reasonable and proportional ” to the cost of processing transactions .
The Nilson Report estimated that last year , fees averaged 1.63 percent of the transaction amount .
A second set of provisions applies to both credit and debit card transactions .
Visa and MasterCard impose an all - or - nothing requirement on businesses , requiring them to accept cards even on small transactions , and prohibiting businesses from offering discounts based on the method of payment .
The amendment strikes those rules .
John Thompson spent 18 years in a Louisiana prison , 14 of them in a windowless , six - by - nine - foot death row cell .
According to a federal appeals court , " There were multiple mentally deranged prisoners near him who would yell and scream at all hours and throw human waste at the guards . "
Thompson , whose execution was scheduled half a dozen times , was a few weeks away from death by lethal injection when his life was saved by a bloody scrap of cloth .
Although four prosecutors in the Orleans Parish District Attorney 's Office were aware of this evidence , Thompson did n't learn about it until 14 years after his death sentence , when an investigator hired by his pro bono lawyers discovered a crucial crime lab report .
In a case the Supreme Court agreed to hear last week , the prosecutors ' boss , former D.A. Harry Connick , argues that his office should not be held responsible for the egregious misconduct that led to Thompson 's 18 - year ordeal .
But if it is n't , no one will be , an outcome that would not only deprive Thompson of compensation but endanger every American 's due process rights .
In 1985 Thompson , then 22 , was arrested for the murder of a hotel executive who was robbed and shot outside his New Orleans home .
After Thompson 's picture appeared in a local newspaper , three people who were victims of an armed robbery a few weeks after the murder thought they recognized their assailant .
Unbeknownst to Thompson or his attorney , the robber was cut while scuffling with one of his victims , leaving blood on the man 's pants .
The blood was type B ; Thompson 's blood type is O .
He never got a chance to present this exculpatory evidence because his prosecutors never turned it over , even though they were constitutionally required to do so .
The prosecutors decided to try Thompson for the robbery first , hoping to prevent him from taking the stand at his murder trial ( since that would allow them to impeach his credibility by mentioning the earlier conviction ) and to enhance the likelihood of a death sentence .
They succeeded on both counts .
After the concealed evidence came to light , Thompson 's robbery conviction was thrown out , and he won a new murder trial , during which he presented 13 pieces of evidence that , like the blood test , had been withheld by prosecutors .
The jury acquitted him after deliberating for half an hour .
In 2003 Thompson won a $ 14 million award from a federal jury that concluded D.A. Connick had acted with " deliberate indifference " by failing to train his underlings in their constitutional obligations .
An appeals court upheld that award in 2008 .
It 's hard to say which would be more appalling : if prosecutors intentionally hid the blood test , or if they did not know they were required to share it .
There is evidence to support both theories .
In 1994 , after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer , one prosecutor told a former colleague ( who kept this information to himself for five years ) that he had deliberately withheld the blood evidence .
But it 's not clear he knew that was illegal at the time of Thompson 's robbery trial , and testimony in Thompson 's civil case indicated that other prosecutors in the D.A. 's office , including Connick himself , did not know they were legally required to share the crime lab report .
Thompson 's lawyers note that one prosecutor 's " misunderstanding " of the relevant Supreme Court ruling " was so fundamental that the district judge visibly registered surprise , " prompting him to change his testimony .
The Supreme Court has ruled that local governments can be held liable for failing to train officials in their constitutional responsibilities when the need is " obvious , " as with teaching police officers the proper use of deadly force .
The need for prosecutors to respect defendants ' due process rights is no less obvious .
And since prosecutors themselves have absolute immunity for their trial - related misconduct , the threat of lawsuits against their employers is an important safeguard to prevent the pursuit of victory from trumping the pursuit of justice .

Image caption Dentists recommend brushing twice a day
People who fail to brush their teeth twice a day are putting themselves at risk of heart disease , research suggests .
The Scottish study of more than 11,000 adults backs previous research linking gum disease with heart problems .
The researchers said more work is needed to confirm if poor oral health directly causes heart disease or is a marker of risk .
A charity added that oral hygiene was just one factor in good heart health .
It is known that inflammation in the body , including in the mouth and gums , has an important role in the build up of clogged arteries , which can lead to a heart attack .
But this is the first time that researchers have looked at whether the frequency of teeth brushing has any bearing on the risk of developing heart disease .
If you do n't brush your teeth , your mouth can become infected with bacteria which can cause inflammation Judy O'Sullivan , British Heart Foundation
Data , published in the British Medical Journal was collected on lifestyle behaviours , such as smoking , physical activity and oral health routines .
Participants were also asked how often they visited the dentist and how often they brushed their teeth .
Then nurses collected information on medical history and family history of heart disease , took blood pressure and blood samples .
Overall , six out of 10 people said they visited the dentist every six months and seven out 10 reported brushing their teeth twice a day .
Over the eight - year study there were 555 " cardiovascular events " such as heart attacks , 170 of which were fatal .
Taking into account factors that affect heart disease risk , such as social class , obesity , smoking and family history , the researchers found those with the worst oral hygiene had a 70 % increased chance of developing the condition compared with those who brush their teeth twice a day .
Those with poor oral hygiene also tested positive in blood samples for proteins which are suggestive of inflammation .
Cause and effect
Study leader Professor Richard Watt , from University College London , said future studies will be needed to confirm whether the link between oral health behaviour and cardiovascular disease " is in fact causal or merely a risk marker " .
Judy O'Sullivan , senior cardiac nurse at British Heart Foundation , said : " If you do n't brush your teeth , your mouth can become infected with bacteria which can cause inflammation .
" However , it is complicated by the fact that poor oral hygiene is often associated with other well known risk factors for heart disease , such as smoking and poor diet . "
She added : " Good personal hygiene is a basic element of a healthy lifestyle .
" But if you want to help your heart , you should eat a balanced diet , avoid smoking and take part in regular physical activity . "
Professor Damien Walmsley , scientific adviser to the British Dental Association , added it was still unclear whether there was a definite cause and effect between oral hygiene and heart disease .
" Whatever the true position is , we can say with certainty that if people brush teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste , visit the dentist regularly and restrict sugary snacks to mealtimes ; that this will go a long way towards keeping the teeth and gums in a healthy state for life . "
Anbau genveränderter Bt - Pflanzen fördert Verbreitung von Schädlingen Florian Rötzer
Zwar wird mit den transgenen Pflanzen ein Schädling bekämpft , nach einer Studie chinesischer Wissenschaftler gedeiht dafür aber ein anderer - mit Folgen für viele Pflanzenarten
Transgene Pflanzen , bei denen das Cry1Ab - Gen des Bakteriums B. thuringiensis eingefügt wurde , das für Raupen des Schädlings Maiszünsler , aber auch für Larven anderer Insekten giftig ist , sind umstritten .
Befürchtet wird von Genpflanzenkritikern , dass das Toxin nicht nur die Schädlinge vernichtet , sondern auch andere Insekten und Bodenorganismen , dass diese eine Resistenz ausbilden könnten , wodurch wieder mehr Pestizide eingesetzt werden müssen , oder dass sich das Gen in anderen Pflanzen verbreitet .
Bt - Pflanzen sollen den Vorteil haben , Schädlinge abwehren zu können , so dass weniger Pestizide für deren Anbau eingesetzt werden muss , wodurch die Kosten sinken sollen , während die Umwelt geschont und der Ertrag gesteigert werden soll .
Die Europäische Behörde für Lebensmittelsicherheit ( EFSA ) hat letztes Jahr den BT - Mais MON810 von Monsanto nach einem vorläufigen Anbauverbot in Deutschland erneut für unbedenklich erklärt ( Monsantos Bt - Mais sicher wie eine traditionelle Maissorte ) .
Dem Urteil hat sich auch die Zentrale Kommission für die Biologische Sicherheit ( ZKBS ) angeschlossen und erklärt , MON810 stelle keine Gefährdung der Umwelt dar .
Das Toxin wird von Wirbeltieren und damit auch vom Menschen in den Mägen abgebaut , ist also nicht gesundheitsgefährlich , so die EFSA .
Die Wahrscheinlichkeit von negativen Folgen für andere Organismen als den Maiszünsler oder für die Ökologie seien " sehr niedrig " .
Ein Gentransfer zu Mikroorganismen sei sehr unwahrscheinlich .
Sehr gering sei auch , dass andere Tiere , die Raupen fressen , in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden , ebenso sei dies der Fall bei anderen Raupen , die Pollen vom Bt - Mais fressen .
Als problematisch wurde eigentlich nur erachtet , dass die Maiszünsler eine Resistenz ausbilden .
Chinesische Wissenschaftler haben nun aber nachgewiesen , dass zumindest Bt - Baumwolle offenbar schon negative Folgen für andere Organismen hat .
In China wurde BT - Baumwolle 1997 für den kommerziellen Anbau genehmigt , um den Schädling Baumwollkapselbohrer zu bekämpfen .
In Nordchina stellen Bt- Baumwollesorten bereits 95 Prozent der angebauten Baumwolle .
Nach den Wissenschaftlern , die ihre Studie in Sciencexpress veröffentlicht haben , konnte damit der Baumwollkapselbohrer wirksam bekämpft und zugleich die Menge der eingesetzten Pestizide gesenkt werden .
Zudem habe sich die Bt - Baumwolle auch als " dead - end trap crop " erwiesen , da ein Großteil der Schmetterlinge ihre Eier in Baumwollepflanzen ablegen , wo die Larven durch das Bt - Toxin getötet werden , und so eine Ausbreitung auf andere Pflanzenarten minimiert wird .
Aber der Anbau von Bt - Baumwolle hat nicht nur positive Seiten .
In den 10 Jahren , in denen diese angebaut wurde , haben sich andere Schädlinge , die bislang kaum eine Rolle spielten , stark vermehrt .
Die Wissenschaftler weisen vor allem auf Weichwanzen aus der Familie der Miriden hin , die als Pflanzensaftsauger auftreten .
Sie kamen in China bislang nicht massenhaft vor , seien aber gefährlich , weil sie sich schnell vermehren und auch auf verschiedenen Wirtspflanzen verbreiten können .
In 38 beobachteten Gebieten verbreiteten sich Miriden mit dem Anbau von Bt - Baumwolle und wurden nicht nur für die Baumwolle , sondern auch für andere Pflanzen zu gefährlichen Schädlingen .
Nach Ansicht der Wissenschaftler wird dies primär durch die geringere Verwendung von Insektiziden in Zusammenhang mit dem Anbau von Bt - Baumwolle verursacht .
Das ermögliche gerade die Ausbreitung der Miriden in der Baumwolle und anschließend auf andere Pflanzen wie Apfel- , Pfirsich - oder Birnenbäume .
Für diese Schädlinge ist Bt - Baumwolle dann keine Sackgasse mehr wie für den Maiszünsler , sondern ein Brutherd .
Daher sank zwar die Verwendung von Insektiziden gegen den Maiszünsler , während die gegen die Miriden anstieg .
Man habe , so folgern die Wissenschaftlern , bislang zu wenig den Einfluss von Bt - Pflanzensorten auf Schädlinge untersucht , die nicht direkt durch diese bekämpft werden .
In Zukunft müsse man vor dem großflächigen Anbau von transgenen Bt - Pflanzen die mögliche Auswirkung auf andere schädliche Organismen untersuchen .
Wieder einmal geht es also darum , dass neue Techniken zu Nebenwirkungen führen , die man nicht bedacht oder die man ausgeblendet hat .

Top Republicans are gearing up for a showdown against President Obama over the health - care law , which could take place if they win majorities in Congress in November .
They say they are ready to push the issue to the brink – forcing a possible government shutdown , much like when Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton ’s budget feud stopped government operations in 1995 .
Then , Gingrich lost the P.R. war and much of his political momentum in the fight .
Now , the GOP is hoping Obama will catch the blame .
A 2011 showdown could happen if Republicans reclaim power – but not supermajorities — in Congress .
They would n’t have the power to fully repeal the new health - care law but could try to pass spending bills that decline to fund , and thus implement , Obamacare .
At the very least , with power over a single chamber of Congress they could refuse to pass a spending bill funding the health - care law .
The president would likely veto any appropriations bills that do n’t fund his hard - fought , signature accomplishment .
What happens next is a high - stakes game of chicken that could shape the public ’s view of party leaders for years to come .
Gingrich , the Republican leader when the GOP took on Bill Clinton in 1995 , now defends the shutdown that , by his own account , is universally viewed as a low point of his tenure as speaker of the House .
“ Everybody thinks [ shutting down the government ] was a big mistake .
They ’re exactly wrong , ” former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told reporters on Tuesday , “ part of the reason we got reelected was our base thought we were serious .
And they thought we were serious because when it came to a showdown we did n’t flinch . ”
Gingrich urged Republicans not to blink in a showdown with Obama .
“ If the president vetoes the appropriations bill , you re-pass it …
The only person who can shut down the government is the president .
If you ’re prepared to pass the appropriations bill , he has to decide to veto the bill you have passed , ” Gingrich said .
The issue is sensitive because Gingrich ’s 1995 shutdown was a disaster .
Then , he complained about Clinton ’s “ snub ” on Air Force One in seating him and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole at the back of the plane .
“ A lot of this is in the handling , and frankly it was n’t handled very well the first time , ” former Republican Rep .
Tom Davis , a key moderate party figure and president of the Main Street Partnership , told The Daily Caller .
“ The Republican message was n’t very well honed .
Mondays and Thursdays Republicans would get up and say , ‘ We shut the government down , we ’re gonna keep it shut down until the president gives in , ’ Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays we said , ‘ The president shut us down , he wo n’t sign the appropriations bills , it ’s terrible . ’”
Still , Davis – who has often criticized conservative hard - liners for pushing the GOP too far to the right — said , “ Newt is onto something when he says , ‘ We do n’t have to fund it . ’
You can send an appropriations bill without funding for health care and if the president does n’t sign it , it ’s a question of who ’s the public gonna side with ?
“ If it ’s done strategically , correctly , you can send a bill to the president and you put the onus on him to sign it … it ’s a P.R. war … shutting the government down , you never like it , but it ’s a question of who gets blamed , ” Davis said .
A key distinction between then and now , Gingrich and Davis both said is that Obama ’s health - care law is unpopular .
“ The president ’s got to go to the country and convince the country that your failure to spend money on a program that has a 20 point margin of disapproval ” is a bad thing , Gingrich said .
In contrast , in 1995 the GOP was fighting for Medicare cuts .
“ We wanted seniors to pay more out of Medicare .
I think we were right to do that , we just were n’t in a very popular position , ” Davis said .
Republican leaders in the House and Senate have already vowed to try to at least defund Obamacare if they gain power .
“ It ’s going to take appropriated funds to actually come through the process to fund the hiring of the new employees , to create these new bureaucracies , I ca n’t imagine that a Republican Congress is gonna give this P ] president the money to begin this process , ” House Minority Leader John Boehner , Ohio Republican , told FoxNews .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been less specific on defunding the health - care law , but has called for repeal .
Though the calls for defunding health care are focusing attention on a shutdown scenario , few lawmakers would talk on the record about it .
A spokesman for Boehner said it ’s too early to think about shutting down the government : “ There are a few too many ‘ what - ifs ’ in that question to speculate . ”

Hey guys , did you hear that Sheldon Souray demanded a trade ?
It was pretty big news , or so I 'm told .
And , unusually for an Oiler , he did n't demand a trade because it 's like Communism here or because we start imaginary furniture fires .
It 's because the Oilers are bad at communicating with their players ; because Sheldon 's chain was yanked by the organization and he was cut out of the loop as soon as it was clear his injury would n't heal up in time for them to trade him , if not sooner .
I 'm disappointed in Sheldon .
No , not for what he said , but because he thought it would come as news to any of us .
From their alternate captain on downwards , the Oilers handling of communications has been dreadful throughout the Kevin Lowe era .
With their fans , with the media , and perhaps least forgivably with the prospects and players who theoretically lure fans to lay aside a rapidly - increasing amount of money and watch a team that at least has some hope of winning .
Perhaps , when he compared the Oilers organization to a Communist regime , Mike Comrie was being more prescient than any of us gave him credit for at the time .
Like a lapsed servant of a Red state he has since returned , formally rehabilitated if kept somewhat out of sight and mind like our own little Maxim Gorky .
But the Oilers are secretive , treating its workers as replaceable widgets fit only to serve as commanded .
The players are kept in the dark and if their usefulness seems to be at an end regardless of any past service or future potential they are ignored or exiled to the New York Islanders Siberia .
The media is under the thumb of the organization , and offenders have the Zamboni parked in front of their cars are cut off from the corridors of power .
I 'm sure a little of that sounds familiar , anyway .
The Oilers are hardly unique in the way they handle communication , and before the World Hockey Association used the prybar of competition to open up the league it was the rule rather than the exception to behave even more carelessly than the Oilers do .
What is new is , at risk of sounding like yet another self - pleasuring blogger , that there are a lot more eyeballs out there today .
Eyeballs with loud mouths attached to them and who are n't beholden to the Oilers in any way .
The Oilers do n't advertise with the Copper & Blue , they do n't provide us with access , and when we 've tried to set up interviews or other interaction through contracted players in the past the organization has actually put the kibosh on regardless of how enthusiastic the player was .
So Joe Average Fan hears about this , and that 's when it becomes a problem .
When assessing Oilers communication we 're often limited to rumours and to grumbling about the treatment given to fans and the media , because that 's what we can see .
Rumour is no good to anybody , really ( " I heard Ales Hemsky wants to retire , move to Wetaskiwin , and train sheep dogs ! " ) .
Watching Oilers employees like Bob Stauffer defend the organization at all costs with a creepy nigh - cult - of - personality fervour is remarkably disturbing , particularly when certain members of the Oilers fanbase buy what they 're selling .
While portraying the management of a thirtieth - place team as diligent experts whose carefully laid plans are derailed only by unpredictable injuries may be pathetic , when it comes to winning hockey games it 's probably not particularly harmful .
As much as it infuriates us , the ridiculous way the Oilers organization handles communications is mostly harmful only in how it affects what happens on the ice .
Unfortunately , though the thin copper and blue line has kept us mere basement - dwellers from investigating too closely , there are some alarming indications .
Look at some of the interviews we 've done with our prize prospects , for example .
There are little things : Anton Lander not knowing where the Oilers want him to play in the coming season .
Robby
Dee bluntly saying that " I have n't spoken with Edmonton at all " .
One of our very best prospects , Magnus Pääjärvi-Svensson , also apparently having no clue what the organization wants from him , speaking of the AHL as if it would be a nice opportunity if it ever came up .
One such anecdote from a prospect , it 's a misunderstanding .
Three , it 's a trend .
Even Teemu Hartikainen , whose rights the Oilers would lose if he's not signed this summer , told our own Derek Zona after his series with Tappara that " hopefully they like my game in Edmonton and want to sign me . "
Remember , these are just the guys not under contract to the Edmonton Oilers .
The guys we can talk to without Allan Watt having an entire ice - making plant helicoptered in front of our doorways , in other words .
Then there are the big ones .
The whole Cody Wild situation was a mess from day one .
If you 've forgotten Cody Wild , that 's fair enough ; we traded him to the Boston Bruins for Matt Marquardt earlier in the year and Wild ( a defenseman ) had more points in the AHL than Marquardt ( a forward / cinder block ) had in the ECHL and AHL combined the rest of the season .
Wild 's a legit prospect .
Tall , quick , intelligent , one of the Springfield Falcons ' better defenders for two straight seasons but inexplicably kept to the press box .
No , seriously , inexplicably .
It was never explained .
Quoting
Wild from his interview with us when asked why Rob Daum had made him a healthy scratch :
I wish I knew .
I have no idea why I was out of the lineup .
I guess maybe he wanted to get another guy in there to see what he could do .
... and the fact that he did n't even know whether the organization was happy with his progress :
I think they are , I can't tell .
Personally , I 've improved as a player in the areas that they 've asked me to improve .
I can honestly say that I 've worked my hardest to improve on what they wanted me to do and I still am .
I do n't have a bad attitude , I 'm always trying to get better , I 'm always watching video , I 'm always trying to take the next step to get better and make it to the next level .
I believe that they are happy with my improvement and with what I 'm bringing to the table right now .
Apparently they were n't since they traded Wild for the North American William Quist .
Wild was certainly more effective than Taylor Chorney and on a par with guys like Alex Plante and Johan Motin who are still considered legitimate prospects , yet he was given the mushroom treatment and sent out the door for , essentially , a completely valueless plug with no chance of ever becoming a positive NHL player .
They might as well have released him for all the good that trade did the Oilers .
Why ?
Do n't ask Cody because he sure does n't know .
Finally , this whole Souray mess .
What needs to be said that has n't been hashed and rehashed a thousand times by now ?
Where you stand on Sheldon 's trade demand seems to depend entirely on the opinion you have of the Oilers organization : do you think Souray is a liar or do you think the front office is at fault ?
If you listen to the sports radio crowd , you might hear Souray as another disaffected Oilers traitor : we should probably stop issuing # 44 to our defensemen because it does things to their minds .
Demanding a trade for selfish reasons and anyway , he got himself into this mess by getting injured fighting , so if he was being forced to play injured , why would he do everything he could to help the hockey team win ?
Why would n't he take it easy and make sure he did n't go back on injured reserve with a gangrenous limb or something ?
Bull .
Sheldon's no Chris Pronger : he 's been a character guy throughout his career and wore the A without incident or altercation in Edmonton as well as elsewhere .
His accusations jive with everything we 've ever heard , with the histories of young men like Jarret Stoll , Ales Hemsky , Shawn Horcoff and others who have been thrown into the lineup while injured and suffered long - term consequences for it because they 're " leaders " .
The communications issues ?
Steve Tambellini not having talked to Souray since January ?
How does that not sound like business as usual ?
The Oilers , meanwhile , in spite of their best efforts to clamp down on the public knowing anything about their business , have clear effort of yanking the chains of members of their organization .
Call me negative , but I know where I come down .
Is the Roundup Ready revolution coming to a close ?
In the early 1990s , agribusiness giant Monsanto introduced its line of genetically modified crops that could tolerate the pesticide Roundup , allowing farmers to spray it far and wide without worrying about damaging their product .
Now , reports are bubbling up about the increased resistance some weeds are showing to Roundup , which could be the source of great worry , as 90 percent of the soybeans and 70 percent of corn currently grown in the United States are the Roundup Ready varieties .
[ F] armers sprayed so much Roundup that weeds quickly evolved to survive it .
“ What we ’re talking about here is Darwinian evolution in fast - forward , ” Mike Owen , a weed scientist at Iowa State University , said [ The New York Times ] .
And for the environmentally - minded , here 's something else to consider :
That threatens to reverse one of the agricultural advances bolstered by the Roundup revolution : minimum - till farming .
By combining Roundup and Roundup Ready crops , farmers did not have to plow under the weeds to control them .
That reduced erosion , the runoff of chemicals into waterways and the use of fuel for tractors [ The New York Times ] .
For an in - depth take , and a historical reminder of how weeds have always evolved to thwart our means of killing them , check out DISCOVER blogger Carl Zimmer 's post .

Some games kick the bucket , others shuffle off their mortal coil and run down the curtain , while even more join the bleedin ’ choir invisible .
It ’s like they ’re cursed never to see the light of day .
Hives of industrious development - types might busy themselves with painting pictures of exciting new worlds , only for a businessman ( in his suit and tie ) to turn up one day with a stack of P45s , a megaphone and an unrehearsed speech about a general lack of money .
In a world where your average big - name game costs can hit $ 40 million in production , manufacturing and marketing costs it ’s hardly surprising that occasionally the money to finance making them can dry up .
Other demised games are , more simply , FUBARs of epic proportions .
Development nightmares in which the bosses are clueless , the engine unwieldy and year after year of laboured coding slowly becomes a road to nowhere .
Still more games just did n’t hit the right fun quota and were consigned to the development dustbin , others again were lost in seemingly dull publisher deals and takeovers .
Meanwhile others were aborted because of questionable choices by their developer causing the public to get a bit cranky ( to put it mildly ) .
Last year , Rendition : Guantanamo was killed off afterknee - jerk whinersclaimed T - Enterprise , its developer , was supporting Osama Bin Laden ’s lot , while Atomic ’s Six Days in Fallujah – a planned shooter , set during one of the most controversial military actions of the second Gulf War – caused the developer to fade into nonexistence after Konami backed out of publishing it .
In our life - times , these games are gone – or in perpetual hiatus .
Age shall not weary them , nor the years condemn .
In some parallel universe where it all went right though – some lucky alternate version of you got to play them all .

Dungeon Keeper 3
In development : Nov 1999 – March 2000
Developer : Bullfrog
Publisher : EA
Back in the second half of 1999 , after EA purchased Bullfrog and Peter Molyneux left for Lionhead , everyone ’s favourite gaming mega-corporation began to play around with two names beloved by PC gamers : Populous and Dungeon Keeper .
Work on a game to follow Populous : The Beginning – Genesis : Hand of God – was rolling , but the shutters were pulled down when marketing types got the jitters about similarities to Black & White , which was also published by EA .
Above :
There are no screens for DK3 , so look at these and imagine them different , with castles
“ The upshot was that Genesis got cancelled , ” explains Ernest W. Adams , Genesis ’ lead developer .
“ They looked around for something else to do with me , and decided on Dungeon Keeper 3 . ” Adams , alongside a producer and another designer , was tasked with dreaming up new adventures for Horny .
However , because DK2 had n’t sold the required bucketfulls , things would ’ve changed in DK3 .
For a start , Dungeon Keeper 3 was proposed as a straightforward top - side RTS : the portals , chickens and individual and characterful monsters would have remained , yet would have been a part of a three - faction battle for supremacy .
Meanwhile , rather than build dungeons downwards , you ’d be building castles upwards .
For the new faction a group of wild , untamed and vegetation - focussed chaps called The Elders would join the fray , alongside the goodly ordered Heroes and noxious taint of the nasty Dungeon Dwellers .
“ I realise that the move in the direction of a more conventional RTS would ’ve been controversial .
The die - hard Dungeon Keeper purists were bound to hate it , ” said Adams .
“ But the truth is that there were n’t enough die - hard Dungeon Keeper purists .
There were n’t enough people who bought Dungeon Keeper at all .
But marketing had seen the huge success of RTS games like StarCraft , and they wanted us to move in that direction .
Hence the new marching orders .
“ We definitely would n’t have turned DK3 into a clone of StarCraft , ” he continues .
“ We wanted to keep the semi- autonomous creatures for example , and we definitely wanted a castle that you could construct in parts and move around in , not just buildings that pop into existence .
“ The major impetus for the move outdoors also came from the need for better multiplayer play .
The fact is that while the single - player side of Dungeon Keeper was brilliant , its multiplayer was distinctly poor .
You spent a long time without ever having enemy contact , building up your dungeon and armies .
“ When you finally did encounter them , the game was so symmetric ( you always fought other Keepers , not heroes ) that it became a long , grinding war of attrition .
There was very little room for strategy , tactical feints , and so on . ”
The late ’90s were the glory days of the RTS , so it was hardly surprising that had Dungeon Keeper come around for a third self - flagellatory Mistress - slap it would have been in a different form .
It probably would have irked us at the time , but better that than be trapped in this horrid world where Dungeon Keeper no longer exists .
The end
EA , concerned about a potential pre-PS2 dip in the games market , cut back on its riskier titles – of which DK3 was one .
On top of this , the fact that Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter games were in the offing meant that the fantasy money train was in motion and Horny would n’t get a look - in .
Bullfrog went on to have their name stuck on Theme Aquarium and Theme Park Inc , before being dissolved in 2004 .
A crime which has still gone unpunished .

Baby corals find their way to reefs by detecting the sound of snapping shrimps and grunting fish , scientists revealed today .
It had long been assumed that coral larvae drift aimlessly after being released by their parent colonies and almost by chance land back on reefs .
But scientists now believe that though they are anatomically very simple , the larvae can pick up the sound of a reef and head towards it .
The discovery is worrying as it is feared the larvae might also be drawn to dangerous man-made sounds in increasingly noisy oceans or struggle to find reefs because human noise masks their sound .
One of the experts involved in the study , Steve Simpson , senior researcher in the University of Bristol 's School of Biological Sciences , said : " Until recently we assumed that these larvae drift aimlessly , but this study shows they are able to detect sound and move towards it .
This could help them find bustling reef habitats but may also draw them towards human sources of noise such as turbines and drilling operations . "
Simpson said a reef was a noisy place but usually when humans dive they hear little but their own breathing .
But actually a reef is full of " clicks from snapping shrimps that combine to produce a crackling noise and grunts and chirps produced by fish as they communicate . "
Simpson explained how larvae are separated from reefs in the first place : " Coral eggs and larvae are released by their parent colonies ( often in dramatic mass spawning events – analogous to a fireworks night on the reef ) and then drift out to sea where they spend a few hours to days growing and developing in the plankton .
" When they are competent to settle onto the seabed they seek out suitable solid substrate ( eg a bare patch of rock ) , and then cement themselves and gradually start to lay down their skeleton .
Over time they bud – split – asexually , and eventually build a new colony , sometimes metres across . "
Simpson discovered several years ago that baby reef fish use sound as a cue to find coral reefs , but was amazed when his Dutch collaborators working in the Caribbean started finding that coral larvae , which must quickly find a safe place to land or die , can do the same thing .
The team designed a " choice chamber " , offering small invertebrates two or more contrasting conditions and allows them to move freely towards the one they prefer .
They played recordings of a coral reef in one area and the results clearly showed that the flea - sized larvae were strongly attracted to the noise .
How the creatures , which look like tiny eggs covered in hairs , detect sound is unknown .
Simpson said : " At close range sound stirs up water molecules , and this could waggle tiny hair cells on the surface of the larvae , providing vital directional information for baby corals . "
Simpson said the increase of manmade noise in oceans and seas was a worry .

SQL :: Translator is a group of Perl modules that manipulate structured data definitions ( mostly database schemas ) in interesting ways , such as converting among different dialects of CREATE syntax ( e.g. , MySQL - to - Oracle ) , visualizations of schemas ( pseudo - ER diagrams : GraphViz or GD ) , automatic code generation ( using Class : : DBI ) , converting non-RDBMS files to SQL schemas ( xSV text files , Excel spreadsheets ) , serializing parsed schemas ( via Storable , YAML and XML ) , creating documentation ( HTML and POD ) , and more .
New to version 0.03 is the ability to talk directly to a database through DBI to query for the structures of several databases .
Through the separation of the code into parsers and producers with an object model in between , it 's possible to combine any parser with any producer , to plug in custom parsers or producers , or to manipulate the parsed data via the built - in object model .
Presently only the definition parts of SQL are handled ( CREATE , ALTER ) , not the manipulation of data ( INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE ) .

Design Educates Awards ( DtEA ) 2021
Laka Foundation is accepting entries for the Design Educates Awards ( DtEA ) 2021 competition , that recognizes the best ideas and implementations of architecture and design that can educate .
Hot on the heels of Shakira , Rage Against the Machine are leading a fresh charge against Arizona 's controversial new immigration law .
Artists including Kanye West , Sonic Youth and Massive Attack have all pledged a musical boycott of the US state , refusing to tour there until the " odious " bill is repealed .
Rage frontman
Zack de la Rocha is seizing the megaphone for Sound Strike , a new organisation for which " Arizona is [ the ] picket line " .
Their target is bill SB1070 , which passed the Arizona state legislature last month .
Signed into law by governor Jan Brewer , the bill compels police officers to challenge anyone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant to prove their immigration status .
Those without documentation will be arrested as criminals .
" Fans of our music , our stories , our films and our words can be pulled over and harassed every day because they are brown or black , or for the way they speak , or for the music they listen to , " de la Rocha wrote in an open letter .
" This law opens the door for them to be shaked down [ sic ] , or even worse , detained and deported while just trying to travel home from school , from home to work , or when they just roll out with their friends . "
Launched yesterday , the campaign 's initial supporters include everyone from singer - songwriter Conor Oberst and hip - hop crew Cypress Hill , to film - maker Michael Moore and Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte .
Joe Satriani , Serj Tankian and Spank Rock have also signed up .
All of these artists have pledged to skip Arizona on concert tours , refusing to allow their " collective economic power to ... aid and abet civil and human rights violations " .
" [ I feel ] terrible about the idea of boycotting Arizona , " Satriani told Billboard .
" I have friends there .
I have a lot of fans there .
... [ But ] SB1070 just does n't have enough in it to make it a good law .
In the last 15 years the erosion of rights of American citizens has put us close to a police state .
We teeter back and forth ; that 's what you have to be vigilant about . "
Not every progressive musician is in favour of a boycott .
Hardcore band Fucked Up , winners of last year 's Polaris prize , spurred a debate last month when they criticised the band Stars for advocating a boycott .
" Why not keep playing Arizona , using the shows as an opportunity to engage the people there to get involved ? " asked frontman Damian Abraham .
" Use press ops before the show to talk about what is going on in the local media . "
But for de la Rocha , the greatest fear is that SB1070 will become a model for other US border states .
" If other states follow the direction of Arizona , " he wrote , " we could be headed towards a pre-Civil Rights era reality . "
Sound Strike has invited all musicians to join their boycott , and launched a petition asking president Obama " to take necessary and appropriate action " against the Arizona bill .
At the time of writing , there are , er , 81 signatures .

The only problem I have , STUMPTOWNHERO , with the application of " blowback " is that word , as initially applied by the CIA , pertains to the " unforeseeable " future consequences of present actions -- usually with respect to covert activity , such as the CIA - backed overthrow of the democratically elected Mossadegh government in Iran ( 1953 ) .
Here , the results of appointing Janet Napolitano to head Homeland Security were not only foreseeable at the time the President made the appointment but were predicted by Brad Friedman before the President made the appointment .

It 's laughable , the claim of " Apartheid Regime " in the headline , but it does serve the purpose of stirring up the loony crowd .
Apartheid was oppressive and deadly to millions of people , this law is meant to protect citizens at absolutely no ones expense .
But then , Brad and the rest of you folks already know that .

No , no .
Racial profiling can not be used in applying the " your papers , please " law .
Why , that would be illegal !
Heh .
Heh .
I 'm racking my brains to try to figure out how an officer of the law could have " reasonable suspicion " that an individual in Arizona is in the country illegally without using racial profiling .
Every scenario I come up with is full of holes .
( Wait .
They 'll get them through the kids .
Right ?
Kids trying to go to school , or not going to school for fear of being discovered .
Kids being brought to the doctor or hospital --- or not being brought , but who need care .
This is appalling to contemplate . )
I 'm guessing they will do it anyway , and those farms , factories and restaurants that do n't buy off the cops will be targeted .
It wo n't happen , but I keep hoping that the kid of some well - connected AZ citizen ends up in jail for a day or two because the kid has no proof of citizenship on his or her person , and the parents are off on some trip out of the country .
Then we might see a repeal of this dreadful law .

You 're buying the media driven " version " of the law .
It does not allow for profiling .
Showing your drivers license or other approved state issued identification is proof that you are in the country legally .
When people are stopped by the police for reasonable cause this is the first thing they are asked , to show their identification .
And I agree , I hope some well - connected AZ citizen ends up in jail for a day or two because the kid has no proof of citizenship on his or her person , and the parents are off on some trip out of the country .
Maybe then this law can be erased off the books and the Federal Government can start doing their job .
Which they 've ignored for decades .

Traffic violations , someone being questioned as a suspect in a crime , seeing a pickup truck driving down a back country dirt road with 20 people in the back .
All of those are reasons for the police to stop anyone , and to ask these people to see their identification .
When the person cannot produce identification this law comes in to play .
It specifically forbids stopping someone for driving while brown , or speaking with a Spanish accent .
Do n't listen to the media depictions of the law , and do n't listen to our governmental types who criticize the law ... they 're playing to a base of voters and nothing more .

Steve @5 & 8 .
With all due respect , my friend , you are misinformed .
AZ SB - 1070 [ PDF ] is by no means limited to traffic stops .
It provides , in pertinent part : A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER , WITHOUT A WARRANT , MAY ARREST A PERSON IF THE OFFICER HAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON HAS COMMITTED ANY PUBLIC OFFENSE THAT MAKES THE PERSON REMOVABLE FROM THE UNITED STATES .
Under this statute , any undocumented alien who is simply present inside the state of Arizona has committed a public offense that makes him or her " removable " from the U.S.
As noted by the ACLU , explaining the lawsuit they filed to enjoin enforcement of SB - 1070 :
The new law , which will not go into effect for more than 90 days , requires police agencies across Arizona to investigate the immigration status of every person they come across whom they have " reasonable suspicion " to believe is in the country unlawfully .
To avoid arrest , citizens and immigrants will effectively have to carry their " papers " at all times .
The statute does not define what factors a police officer should look to in order to create a " reasonable suspicion " that one is an illegal immigrant , but you can bet dollars to donuts that blond hair and blue eyes will not form a " reasonable suspicion " of illegal status .
SB - 1070 is indistinguishable from apartheid South Africa 's infamous " pass laws " except that where South Africa required non-whites to carry their papers whenever entering a whites only area , AZ ostensibly requires everyone to have proof of citizenship on their person at all times .
The " reasonable suspicion " standard in no way prevents police from stopping someone for " driving while brown " with the failure of the individual to carry proof of citizenship as " probable cause " for the arrest .

Thank you , Ernest .
Steve , the 20 people in the back of the pick - up truck are going to the fields to pick grapes .
That 's not ( or should n't be ) reasonable suspicion .
What do you bet that the farmers will have a cozy relationship with the police ?
What do you bet that folks who do n't " look like " undocumented immigrants will generally not be harrassed if they do n't have the proper " papers ? "
What do you bet that folks who do , will ?
What do you bet that this law stinks to high heaven ?

Respectfully Ernest , I 'm not misinformed .
I did not say that it was limited to traffic stops , I gave a few examples to Lora of when police would ask for identification and I included being questioned as a suspect in a crime with that .
It can only happen when the person is being questioned by police for some other offense .
To Lora @ 10 , I used 20 people in back of a pickup truck on public roads because where I live this is a clear violation of the law .
But I 'll give you that it may have been a bad example because that may not be against the law in AZ .
Just because the ACLU tries to embellish their case painting doomsday scenarios with the court is not evidence of this being a bad law .
The ACLU statement " requires police agencies across Arizona to investigate the immigration status of every person they come across whom they have " reasonable suspicion " to believe is in the country unlawfully " is simply not true .
The law does not allow police to just question people at random as the ACLU would have you believe .
And again , I blame inaction of the Federal Government for AZ passing this in the first place .

Perhaps ,
Steve , you 've read a different SB - 1070 than the one which was actually passed and I linked to .
There is no requirement that SB - 1070 be applied only when the police question a suspect pertaining to a crime , other than the crime of illegal status .
To the contrary , the statute expressly provides " any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States . "
An undocumented alien 's mere presence in the state of Arizona is a " public offense that makes " the undocumented alien " removable from the United States . "
If you had actually read the statute , as I have , instead of listening to right wing propaganda , you would understand , as many of the AZ police chiefs who are opposed to this law understand , that this law burdens AZ law enforcement with an obligation to demand that someone " show their papers " whenever there is a " reasonable suspicion " that they are undocumented aliens .
Those law enforcement officers have complained that the " reasonable suspicion " standard " simply pushes law enforcement to use racial profiling as the only means they can think of to guess at undocumented status of any given person . "
The law does not describe what factors give rise to a " reasonable suspicion . "
It is not the ACLU but the shameless defenders of this apartheid " pass law " who have embellished the facts .
Show me where in SB - 1070 it says that the police cannot stop " anyone " whom they reasonably suspect of being an illegal !
Finally , I find it interesting that you are so Hell bent on damning these economic refugees which the hard right has dehumanized with the " illegal alien " label ; why you and the other immigrant bashers are so willing to militarize our Southern ( but not our Northern ) border ; that you express no recognition of the real culprit which drove these brown - skinned economic refugees north in search of survival -- NAFTA 's dirty little secret in which some of the wealthiest U.S. citizens not only gorged themselves on public subsidies in order to flood Mexican markets with U.S. grown corn at well below the local cost of production ; driving millions of Mexican peasants off the land , first to the cities just South of the U.S. border , creating an over - abundance of cheap labor which was exploited by the U.S. billionaire class in the first step to outsource everything we make except weapons .
Instead of coming up with these race - based laws to scape goat these economic refugees , you and your fellow immigrant bashers should be focused on how the U.S. billionaire class exploited them in order to exploit us .
So no , Steve , I do n't blame Federal Government inaction .
I blame corporate greed and racist dehumanization as the divide and conquer strategy of Right Wing Republicans and the billionaire class .

It all comes down to the question , DO YOU TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT ?
Within itself , this Arizona , anti-Criminal Migant law IS NOT unconstitutional .
Besides that , ANY law can be abused for an unconstitutional purpose .
From all I 've heard , seen , and experienced , For at least the past 50 years or so , the United States Constitution ( especially the Bill of Rights ) has been under incorporated attack .
This is mostly because the United States Constitution requires that its " Rule - of - Law " application protect all " people " who were " created equal . "
Well , guess what ... corporations were never " created , " instead , they were fabulized .
So , for more than half a century , the fabulist slaves of the incorporated world have been buying up politicians while also inventing extreme circumstances of Constitutional doubt among the American population in order to make the United States Constitution functionally irrelevant .
Now , if the Federal Government had been doing the job it was supposed to for around the last four dozen and two years , the xenophobic handjobs of Arizona would never had developed their phobia in the first place .
But the very problem remains that , mostly poverty - stricken , brown - skinned people from south of America 's southwest border keep violating United States sovereignty laws primarily for the purpose of economic enrichment .
Some of those economic enrichment schemes involves trafficing in illegal drugs .
The vast majority encompass severe job market destabilization .
And please , do n't feed me any tripe about the Latino day worker being willing to accomplish scut - work labor that all us more normal Americans are unwilling to do .
Offer an appropriate wage within any protected economy , and you will always find somebody willing to do a job .
Nope , the central theme here should be ( and should have always been ) " THE RULE OF LAW . "
Under the circumstances of America 's migrant worker problems of the Southwest ( and ever - so - regularly migrating towards the Northeast ) , Until the anchor - baby circumstance became truly problematic , virtually all American Citizens of Latino descent could speak a normal and understandable version of the English language .
If they were legal migrants ( not to be confused with legal immigrants ) , well , the government had provided them with official paperwork that identified them as such ... by Federal mandate , they should always carry this paperwork with them .
I know that my step - mother from England ALWAYS carried her green card with her until she naturalized ) .
But , if you do n't trust your government to do the right thing in the first place , then that 's probably because it has n't been doing the right thing for the longest time anyway .
Ultimately , it 's not the law that is the problem , instead , it 's the institution of government .
Have you noticed in this particular circumstance that , while referring to the perrogative of Constitutional protection , that only the " rights " of criminal migrant invaders are mostly being insisted upon by that " Bleeding Hearts " division of the corporate media ?
What about the " Equal Protection " rights of U.S. citizen - workers ( of whatever race or national origin ) ?
Whose rights should be protected first ?

Ernest @ 12 .
In the law section 2 subsection b explicitly states " For any LAWFUL contact made by a law enforcement official etc etc . "
That means the police can't stop a person for driving while brown , they can't ask the random person with an accent sitting next to them at the diner for identification .
That is known as harassment and is against the law , therefore it is not lawful contact .
But then you already knew that .
The subsection goes on to state that , when reasonable suspicion exists they can make a reasonable attempt to determine that persons immigration status .
What is reasonable suspicion ?
How about not being able to identify yourself .
Subsection E states that the law enforcement officer may arrest if he has probable cause to believe that person has committed a public offense that makes that person removable from the United States .
In other words , the person is here illegally .
No where does it give police the authority to randomly stop or approach people and check their immigration status .
But I 'll say it again , you already knew that .
You have no idea what my feelings are on immigration or any other issue for that matter so do n't pretend to .
And if you 're going to toss third rate insults at someone for simply disagreeing with you at least get all the facts straight .
Holding back the pertinent information which destroys the points you 're trying to make is untruthful at best .

I am having difficulty in ascertaining whether you are being intentionally obtuse or simply naïve .
Do you really think the " any lawful contact " provision prevents the police from stopping someone they have a " reasonable suspicion " of having committed the " public offense " of being an " illegal alien ? "
Why do you suppose the AZ police chiefs who oppose SB - 1070 are concerned about the burden this law will place on their officers ?
And , as to your views on immigration , you already expressed them when you blamed federal government " inaction " for passage of this draconian , racial - profiling " pass law , " which you characterized as " necessary , " when , in truth , it is the same billionaire - connected politicians behind SB - 1070 who ( a ) tout free enterprise while the billionaire class feeds at the public trough by way of subsidies , ( b ) uses so - called free - trade agreements to pillage other countries , like Mexico , where they destroyed the local agricultural system by dumping heavily subsidized U.S. corn into the Mexican economy at below the cost of production , driving millions of Mexican peasants off the land , creating the economic engine behind the northward migration , and ( c ) played off anti-immigrant hysteria to engage in " cultural cleansing " by passing an anti-ethnic studies law .
( During the Reagan / Bush I years U.S. support for its surrogate brutal Central American regimes , whose military leaders were trained by us at the School of Americas led to a massive northward migration from that region ) .
In both cases , the immigration " problem " that concerns you is a matter of our imperial exploitation of others come home to roost .
Your suggestion that SB - 1070 was " necessary " is patently absurd .
Even before SB - 1070 passed , local police had a right to notify federal authorities of undocumented status of any individual they take into custody for some " other " offense .
If racism does not either consciously or subconsciously affect your perception of the " security of our borders , " why are you , and other advocates of these so - called " necessary " laws , not clamoring for similar laws to be passed by states that border Canada ?
When is the last time , you or anyone else who supports SB - 1070 complained about illegal Canadian immigrants ?
Sophia , sadly I 'm inclined to agree .
Instead of " change we can believe in , " which got Obama elected , we got " more of the same " which supposedly defeated McCain .
Of course , we all blew our chance for real change when we failed to pick Dennis Kucinich during the primaries .

Yes , I believe the lawful contact described in section 2 subsection b prevents law enforcement from harassing law abiding people .
And as a lawyer I suspect you know the same .
I suppose what you are saying is that all these police chiefs in AZ who do not support this law ( 1 by your own link ) are suddenly going to have their officers abuse it and demand identification of any hispanic person they see .
As Dan said above , any law is subject to abuse , and this is why we have courts .
As a lawyer I 'm quite sure you already know that .
The most factual point in your post is that local police had a right to notify federal authorities of undocumented status of any individual they take into custody for some " other " offense .
Unfortunately , just like our federal government , local authorities selectively enforced our immigration laws .
In fact , they had sanctuary cities where immigration laws were ignored .
This law requires police to enforce it .
But , as a lawyer , you already knew that .
And you still do n't know my stance on immigration .
You attribute the word necessary to my take on this law three times in your rambling , redundant , and angry reply .
In fact you use quotations for the word .
So please sir , let me know where I said this was a necessary law because scanning through my several comments I did not see " necessary " anywhere .
Granted I just scanned so I may have overlooked .

Steve , A couple of teenagers are seen running in the vicinity of a convenience store ( somewhere in AZ ) .
The manager of the convenience store had called police reporting a robbery .
Let 's say the teens have blond hair blue eyes .
They are apprehended and have no ID on them .
They say they were racing each other and were not even in the convenience store .
They give their address located in some reasonably well - off part of town and ask the cops to call their dad , a small business owner downtown , to confirm .
Now , let 's say they are black hair brown skin , Spanish accent .
Their address is in a barrio .
Their mom is a factory worker and could get fired for leaving her post to answer a personal phone call .
Their dad is in Mexico .
Which pair of teens will be thoroughly checked as to their immigration status ?
Which pair of teens might spend some time in jail , regardless of whether or not they committed any crime , and regardless of whether or not they are in the country legally ?
Which pair of teens are even more open to harrassment than before , because of this law ?

Tim Carpenter and Thom Hartmann hold ill - founded and naive opinions .
In 1954 , President Eisenhower dealt swiftly and decisively with the illegal alien issue .
But In 1986 , to America 's detriment , former President Ronald Reagan signed the Simpson - Mazoli Act into American Law .
This across - the board amnesty of 3.5 million Mexicans , resulted in unchecked , chained illegal immigration .
Misinterpretation of America 's 14th Amendment amplified this disaster with Birthright Citizenship for newborns of illegals .

World of Warcraft publisher Blizzard Entertainment this week reportedly said it was discussing the possibility of hosting Australian servers for the popular massively multiplayer online game .
The lack of servers hosted in Australia for the game — also a common problem with a number of other online offerings — means that local players must connect to international servers and suffer extended latency compared with players in those countries , which can disadvantage them in - game and cause slower online reaction times .
“ I would say it ’s possible and that it ’s something we talk about on a regular basis — and I will also say it ’s something I have talked about this week , ” World of Warcraft production director J. Allen Brack said in an interview with AusGamers publishers this week .
“ So it ’s definitely just not a case of ‘ yeah whatever ’ .
It does get our attention and we do raise it up on a regular basis .
If we can make it happen , we ’ll make it happen , ” he added , noting the Australian WoW community was “ super- passionate ” about the issue , but it was a question of local timing and expenditure .
The issue primarily affects games which require low ‘ ping ’ times — indicative of latency — to the servers that users are required to connect to .
Good examples would be first - person shooter games , where a handful of millliseconds can mean the difference in an online match between taking out your own target or your online character taking a hit instead .
However , other Blizzard games such as StarCraft II , which is currently in beta testing — with some Australians obtaining early access to the game — are not as highly affected by the issue .
Delimiter has been beta testing StarCraft II over the past week and has not experienced any latency difficulties on an ADSL2 + connection .
It ’s not hard to find complaints online about poor ping times for WoW in Australia .
For example , back in 2007 a gamer named Drunkmunky posted the following online : “ I live in Australia and I , like the rest of the country , am forced to play WoW on servers located in America .
This results in quite a latency hit that affects nearly every aspect of gameplay . ”
Blizzard has set up ‘ Oceania ’ WoW servers that target Australian WoW players with local time zones , but the servers are still based overseas .

New information about early Native Americans ' horticultural practices comes not from hieroglyphs or other artifacts , but from a suite of four gene duplicates found in wild and domesticated sunflowers .
In an upcoming issue of Current Biology , Indiana University Bloomington biologists present the first concrete evidence for how gene duplications can lead to functional diversity in organisms .
In this case , the scientists learned how duplications of a gene called FLOWERING LOCUS T , or FT , could have evolved and interacted to prolong a flower 's time to grow .
A longer flower growth period means a bigger sunflower -- presumably an attribute of great value to the plant 's first breeders .
" Our paper shows how gene duplication creates potential for evolutionary innovation not just through creating new gene content but also through new interactions among duplicates , " said Ben Blackman , the report 's lead author .
Blackman conducted the research as an IU Bloomington Ph.D. student .
He is now a postdoctoral fellow at Duke University .
Biologists have long thought the accidental duplication of genetic material provides important fodder for evolution .
Less risky than modifying an existing , possibly important gene , duplicates offer an out -- one copy can continue its normal activities while the other copy acquires new functions .
That 's a hypothesis , anyway .
The Current Biology paper suggests reality may be a little more complex .
FT genes play a role in sensitizing flowering plants to seasons , and their expression is usually triggered by changes in day length .
Some flowering plants express FT genes early in the growing season as days get longer .
Sunflower FT genes are expressed toward the end of the growing season when days are getting shorter .
As far as biologists know , all flowering plants have at least one FT gene .

Blackman and his colleagues identified four FT genes in sunflower , Helianthus annuus , which are known as HaFT paralogs .
Each of the paralogs , HaFT1 through HaFT4 , has a unique genetic sequence , but is similar enough to the others to conclude three of them were the result of DNA duplication events in sunflower 's distant past .
" Based on the level of divergence between the various HaFTs and the presence of a single FT copy in lettuce , we inferred that one copy became two during a whole genome doubling event that occurred roughly 30 million years ago , " Blackman said .
" One of those copies proliferated further through two small - scale duplications that we infer occurred much more recently . "
The scientists examined each paralog 's expression patterns within sunflower , and by strategically cloning variants of the HaFT genes into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , discerned the paralogs ' physiological properties in one another 's presence .
One of the paralogs , HaFT3 , has lost function and is no longer expressed .
Countless genome surveys show " non-functionalization " is a common fate for gene duplicates in plants and other eukaryotes , possibly because the extra dose of genetic expression can be wasteful or overtly harmful to the organism .
Two of the paralogs , HaFT2 and HaFT4 , are structurally similar to each other and have retained normal function .
The proteins they encode are produced in leaves in response to day length .
It is believed the HaFT2 and HaFT4 proteins travel down to the stem and up to the shoot tip , where they compel meristem cells to develop into flower buds , but this has yet to be shown conclusively for Helianthus annuus .
advertisement
HaFT1 is n't produced in the leaves but at the site of HaFT2 and HaFT4's target -- the shoot tip and the green bracts that will radiate out from the flower itself .
There are two basic versions of the HaFT1 called alleles .
The domesticated HaFT1 allele is distinguished from the wild allele by the omission of a single nucleotide .
But what a difference that nucleotide makes .
The protein produced from the domesticated HaFT1 is larger than its wild cousin and has a novel domain .
Only two of the 23 wild populations surveyed possess both types of the HaFT1 allele .
That is not the case for domesticated sunflower populations , for which the domestic version of HaFT1 completely ( or almost completely ) dominates .
Modern domesticated sunflowers used in farming are homogeneous for domesticated HaFT1 .
The scientists also examined " landraces , " Native Americans ' own domesticated cultivars , some of which are quite old .
These too are dominated by domesticated HaFT1 .
By comparing the activity of domesticated and wild HaFT1 , the scientists learned it is the domesticated version of HaFT1 that lengthens the time period during which flowers grow and mature .
This can have a wide variety of effects , from increasing the size of the sunflowers ' seed disk to increasing the flowers ' total seed mass .
Despite its name , domestic HaFT1 is n't the result of domestication -- its origin likely precedes human cultivation .
It is called domestic , because it is the version of HaFT1 that caused traits early Native Americans seem to have preferred as they bred the plants for horticulture .
Genetic evidence the scientists collected from a broad survey of domesticated and wild HaFT1 genes suggests domesticated HaFT1 experienced a " selective sweep " around the time early Native Americans would have begun cultivating sunflower .
" Our study is the first to provide both strong functional evidence and strong evolutionary evidence that a particular nucleotide variant in this one gene -- HaFT1 -- was critical for early sunflower domestication , " Blackman said .
How HaFT1 was exerting its flower - delaying effects was not clear until the scientists cloned HaFT1 , HaFT2 and HaFT4 into Arabidopsis thaliana in different combinations .
A. thaliana 's own FT gene had been removed .
Cloning genes in this way can eliminate complicating factors when scientists are interested in knowing how a few genes ( and the proteins they encode ) interact .
Domesticated HaFT1 had no impact on flowering in the presence of HaFT2 .
But HaFT1 did delay A. thaliana flowering in the presence of HaFT4 .
The scientists concluded the newer HaFT1 and older HaFT4 are interacting , possibly directly , in such a way to interfere with HaFT4's function , thereby delaying flowering .
" In the sunflower story , what is most interesting in my view is how evolution has exploited both recent and ancient gene duplicates in the same gene family to achieve shifts in flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity , " said IU Bloomington plant evolutionary biologist Loren Rieseberg , the study 's principal investigator .
Rieseberg has dual appointments at IU Bloomington and the University of British Columbia .
Jared Strasburg , Andrew Raduski and Scott Michaels also contributed to the research .
It was supported with grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation .
Winds from the east or southeast this morning , then continued east or southeast winds through Tuesday have the potential to move new oil onshore along the Louisiana coastline , according to the latest 72 - hour project map produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
As with other forecast maps in recent days , the forecast map that extends until Wednesday evening continues not to show landfall of oil along the Mississippi , Alabama or Florida within the forecast period .
NOAA 's longest - term forecast is the 72 - hour map because officials say there are too many variable factors -- namely wind -- to look with any certainty into the more distant future .
The most recent map said the Mississippi Delta , Breton Sound , the Chandeleur Islands and areas directly north have a potential for shoreline contacts throughout the forecast period .
West of the Mississippi Delta , the shoreline west of Barataria Bay to Isles Dernieres is threatened today .
Should winds continue east or southeast , potential oil contacts could reach as far west as Oyster Bayou on Tuesday and Atchafalaya Bay on Wednesday , the federal experts said .
NOAA 's forecasts are based on the latest National Weather Service forecasts , overflight and satellite observations , current models and tracking devices placed within the oil spill .
Officials caution that tar balls associated with the leading edge of the spill are difficult to track and so are not taken into account .

So in honor of Sarah Palin appearing in Minneapolis ( outside of MN - 06 ) and offering the opportunity to pay $ 10,000 for a picture with her and Bachmann , you can join the RAT PAC for a dollar .
ANOKA , Minn .
—A new , Minnesota - based political action committee has been formed to target Michele Bachmann ’s real record as the U.S. representative for the 6th Congressional District .
Here 's the full press release :
Residents for Accuracy and Truth is comprised of Bachmann constituents tired of watching their representative on Fox News rather than getting a chance to see her anywhere in the 6th District .
" There ’s something symbolic about making this announcement on April 1 , " said David Day , an Anoka County resident and spokesman for the RAT PAC .
" But with Bachmann , everyday really is April Fools ’ Day .
As millions of Americans have seen over the past three years , if there ’s a camera crew on - hand , Michele is more than willing to provide them with all the bloopers YouTube can handle . "
Bachmann is set to appear next week at a Minneapolis ( 5th Congressional District ) rally and fundraiser with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
In advance of what Day sarcastically said " promises to be a proud day for Minnesota , " the group released the following video : http://tinyurl.com/...
" It may make us as crazy as she is , but we ’re proud to take on the task of trying to keep Bachmann honest , " Day said .
" Despite what people outside our district think , most people here are n’t like Bachmann , but she gets away with doing what she does because only periodically do her outrageous statements get press coverage .
The ‘ anti- American ’ stuff from 2008 made her famous , but to those of us who have been living with her for a while — we know that ’s nothing new . "
The RAT PAC will be making appearances at events throughout the 6th Congressional District between now and the election and the organization ’s Web site — www.stopbachmann.com—will serve as a one - stop shop for those looking to understand Bachmann ’s full record .
" For $ 10,000 you can get a photo with Bachmann and Palin , " Day said .
" We ’re a cheaper date .
You can join our team for a dollar . "

Tiny U.S. town forces all business to be conducted in English amid fears of Spanish tidal wave
A small American town 2,500 miles away from the Mexican border has designated English as its official language .
Jackson is in New York state and its population of 1,700 is mostly white with just a handful of Spanish - speaking farm workers .
But inhabitants were determined to protect their English - speaking heritage after condemning the federal government for not acting .
Immigration wars : Migrants ' rights supporters at a rally ( file photo ) .
A small New York town has passed a law ordering English to be used for all town business as supporters of Arizona 's draconian immigration policy try to change America from the ground up
The legislation means that all official business in the town , which has no shops , school or church , must be conducted in English .
Council member Roger Meyer , who proposed the law , said : ' The federal government has shirked its duty by not passing English as the official language of the United States .
' I felt I would start a grass - roots movement to try to get it passed from the bottom up . '
One neighbouring town , Argyle , has passed a similar resolution while another , Easton , will debate the issue next month .
Supporters claim the moves highlight support for bolder action to curb immigration and preserve the culture which many fear is under threat in some states .
Meanwhile heated debate is being waged over Arizona ’s controversial decision to grant police new laws to quiz people they suspect of being in the country illegally .
But supporters claim it underlines the undercurrent of support for bolder action to curb immigration and preserve the language and culture that many fear are under threat in parts of the US .
The small American town of Jackson in New York State
Despite a wave of condemnation levelled at Arizona – with Los Angeles yesterday banning all official business with the state – a new opinion poll found that 59 per cent of Americans supported the crackdown .
Even in Jackson , where nobody really believes there is a serious threat of a sudden flood of immigrants , town officials felt it necessary to make a stand .
‘ People come here because it ’s better than the place they were in , ’ Mr Meyer told the New York Times .
‘ If that ’s the case , you should be adapting yourself to our ways .
We should n’t be adapting to your ways . ’
However , the law has put the town at odds with the New York Civil Liberties Union , which is demanding the law is repealed .
‘ The English language is not under attack in Jackson or anywhere else in the state or country , ’ said union director Melanie Trimble .
The civil rights group said the law was a threat to free speech and discriminated against anyone with limited English skills .
Alan Brown , the town supervisor and the only council member to vote against the measure , insisted : ‘ The law would play to some people ’s prejudices and I do n’t think that ’s a good thing .
‘ This law did n’t pop up because someone has interest in and sympathy for the fact that we ’ve always done our meetings in English .
‘ What is a human ’s greatest fear ?
It ’s fear of whatever , of death , of terrorism , fear of what we do n’t understand .
We ’re all afraid of the unknown .
My opinion is that this is just adding to all of that , ’ he added .
Greece is struggling with a gaping deficit and heavy debt Greece 's government intends to raise the national pension age and ban early retirement as it tries to tackle its huge budget deficit .
The socialist government said it wanted to increase the average retirement age from 61 to 63 by 2015 .
The steps would be part of a series of austerity measures aimed at curbing the country 's deficit and national debt .
But the moves have angered many of the unions , which have scheduled strikes in protest .
Civil servants - who are among those most affected by the pension reforms - are due to walk out on Wednesday this week .
Farmers have already been protesting for weeks , demanding more government assistance , and the country 's biggest union , GSEE , is set to hold a mass walk - out on 24 February .
The unions complain the Greek government has bowed to the markets and pressure from the EU .
Reforming its pension system has been outlined by the European Commission as a priority area for Greece as it struggles to save its economy .
Salary freeze Labour Minister Andreas Loverdos said the pension system would be broke in five years unless changes were made .
" These reforms are not just tinkering , they constitute a major overhaul to make the system viable in the coming decades , " he said .
" We are changing the pensions system in order to keep it alive . "
Last week , Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced a number of austerity measures including a public sector salary freeze and a hike in petrol prices .
PM Papandreou has announced a raft of austerity measures Further measures include the non-replacement of departing civil servants , and tax collectors recovering billions of euros lost to tax evasion .
Greece is one of several EU countries struggling with a gaping deficit and heavy debt , preventing them from spending their way out of recession .
Greece 's deficit is , at 12.7 % , more than four times higher than eurozone rules allow .
Its debt is about 300bn euros ( $ 419bn , £ 259bn ) .
The possibility of Greece or one of the other stricken countries being unable to pay its debts - and either needing an EU bailout or being forced to abandon the euro - has been called the biggest threat yet to the single currency .

A University of British Columbia doctoral candidate has discovered a previously unknown mechanism for silencing retroviruses , segments of genetic material that can lead to fatal mutations in a cell 's DNA .
The findings , published today in the journal Nature , could lead to new cancer treatments that kill only tumour cells and leave healthy surrounding tissue unharmed .
Danny Leung , a 27 - year - old graduate student in the laboratory of Asst. Prof. Matthew Lorincz in the Dept. of Medical Genetics , UBC Faculty of Medicine , found that a protein called ESET is crucial to preventing the activity of endogenous retroviruses in mouse embryonic stem cells .
Distant relatives of such retroviruses are more active in the cells of testicular , breast and skin cancers in humans .
If ESET can be blocked , retroviruses would become dramatically more active , thus either killing the cancer cells hosting them or flagging them as targets for the immune system .
Leung , who was co-lead author with a graduate student at Kyoto University in Japan , has devoted his studies at UBC to the growing field of epigenetics - changes to the genome that do not involve changes to the underlying genetic code .
Such changes determine whether or not a gene is expressed .
The common method for silencing certain genes is DNA methylation , in which a chemical group attaches to the DNA structure .
But Leung and his collaborators at UBC and Kyoto University found that the activity of ESET is far more potent than DNA methylation in silencing retroviruses in embryonic stem cells of mice .
This indicates an independent parallel pathway of silencing the retroviruses .
Their research has direct bearing on cancer treatments because cancer cells are stem - like - they can differentiate into other types of cells .
Also , for unknown reasons , cancer cells have significantly less DNA methylation than normal cells .
So blocking ESET holds the promise of affecting only cancer cells , allowing retroviruses to flourish to the detriment of their hosts .
Normal , differentiated cells , which still have DNA methylation to keep retroviruses in check , would be unaffected .
" Inhibiting ESET may affect just the cancer cells , allowing further expression of retroviruses , which in turn would kill the cancer cells , " says Leung , who is in his third year of graduate studies at UBC .
His co-lead author on the paper , Toshiyuki Matsui , is a student in the lab of Yoichi Shinkai at Kyoto University .

Welcome back to another edition of The Art of Manliness Podcast !
Statistics show that American boys are in trouble .
They ’re more likely to have depression , abuse alcohol and drugs , and perform poorly in school .
What can we do to help these troubled boys ?
To get some answers we talk to Dr. Michael Thompson , author of the book Raising Cain : Protecting the Emotional Lives of Boys .
Dr. Thompson is a psychologist specializing in boys , and he ’s a clinical consultant at The Belmont Hill School , an all boys school in Massachusetts .
Dr. Thompson and I discuss the emotional problems boys face , what dads can do to help boys develop a solid emotional toolkit , and what we can do to help boys perform to their potential in school .
Brett McKay : Brett McKay here and welcome to another episode of The Art of Manliness podcast .
Now , statistic show that boys are in trouble .
They ’re falling further and further behind in school and an alarming number of boys are at a high risk for depression , alcohol and drug abuse , violence and suicide .
But what ’s cause of these problems and what can we do to help boys .
Well , our guest today has written a book about this topic .
His name is Dr. Michael Thompson and he is the co-author of the book Raising Cain : Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys .
The book was later turned into PBS documentary with same title which Dr. Thompson wrote and narrated .
And Dr. Thompson is a psychologist specializing in children and families .
He is the clinical consultant at Belmont High School and All - Boy School in Massachusetts .
And in addition to writing about psychology of boys Dr. Thompson travels the country speaking and educating audiences about the emotional and psychological needs of boys today .
Dr. Thompson , welcome to the show .
Dr. Thompson :
Thank you very much , Brett .
Brett McKay : Well , Dr. Thompson what are the emotional problems that boys are facing these days ?
Dr. Thompson :
It ’s problems of growing up , it ’s problems of feeling good about yourself as a boy and a man in a society which is super focused on school performance where you ca n’t play outdoors because your parents are so frightened of pedophiles and so you do n’t have the kind of practice being a boy that you had when there was neighborhood play .
I think that ’s the biggest challenge to boys today , is that they do n’t get to create their own society in the neighborhood and their own definition of boyhood .
They often feel pending by school , but they ’re pounded continuously with the idea that school is so important .
And finally , there is a problem that boys have always had , which is how to maintain your sensitive inner feelings and look strong on the outside and feel strong to yourself .
Brett McKay :
And so you mentioned that school–– the way that are schools set up kind of a detriment to boys , what about the larger culture , are there are any cultural ideas that kind of have a detrimental effect on boys ?
Dr. Thompson : Yes .
The United States is the most violent society in the industrialized world .
Our murder rate is 20 to 60 times higher than Western Europe .
Even though our rates of violence have been going down since 1995 after a tremendous 20 - year run up , even though they ’ve been going down in this country they ’re still much higher than anywhere else in the industrialized world and I think it makes people jumpy about boys .
I think it makes them not trust boy play , be afraid of boys in the school .
And , of course boys who are being raised in high risk neighborhoods are at risk for seeing violence and being pulled into violence themselves .
So , that ’s really how can you feel strong in this life without actually ending up violent .
Brett McKay : So , what ’s the solution to , you know , these emotional inner problems that boys face today ?
Dr. Thompson :
Well , I mean it ’s simple stuff , it ’s good parenting .
It ’s having fathers who model self - control , who model studiousness , who model many different ways to be a man .
The problem is 35 % of American boys do n’t have a biological father at home and they were dependent on the media to shape what they think of is masculinity .
I mean I ask suburban boys with hard working busy preoccupied fathers what their image of muscularity is and they say NFL football players .
I mean that ’s a little weird , is n’t it ?
Because these football players are n’t absolutely the best models for boys because so few boys have that size and that narrow skill , most of them going to have to make it in the world thinking of themselves as men in some other way .
Brett McKay :
And it ’s not an athlete , sometimes it is often times now a celebrity or some sort of …
Dr. Thompson :
Yes , that ’s right , that ’s right .
Brett McKay :
You talk in your book a lot about developing the emotional literacy in boys , can you explain what emotional literacy is ?
Dr. Thompson : Yeah , it ’s an ability to identify your feelings and be able to speak about them .
Many boys–– look I believe boys have the full range of emotional feeling girls do .
But in boy ’s society when you ’re supposed to look strong you do n’t admit to feelings of shame or inadequacy or if you admit to , you admit to only in a humorous way .
Boy society is different , it shapes a boy ’s emotional reaction .
I think of a fifth grade girl walking into the classroom and saying , “ Oh , I ’m so upset with my stepmother .
Last night we fought and fought and I just went to my room and cried . ”
Okay , the girls are going to gather around her and tend her and be sympathetic .
What is that had happened to a boy who fought with his stepmother and gone to his room and cried ?
Is he is going to come in the school and be able to say that ?
If he did say that other the boys would back away , oh , oh , you know .
Brett McKay : Yeah .
Dr. Thompson :
He ’s a weakling , like that and I can ’t–– I do n’t want to catch that .
So boys often , they ’ll come in and curse the stepmother or look tough or threaten or revenge or something else which allows them to think of themselves as manly but excuse them away from the depths of bad feeling they had and excuse them away from more realistic types of problem solving .
They kind of identify how humiliated and helpless they felt and it ’s helpful to boys to be able to talk about that but boys society does n’t allow it .
Brett McKay :
So , one part of emotional literacy is recognizing the feelings that a boy might have .
You also talk about empathy a lot in the book .
Dr. Thompson : Yeah .
Brett McKay :
Why is it that boys have a hard time empathizing with other people ?
Dr. Thompson : I do n’t we give them practice , I think they want to .
The Japanese have you know five and six - year - old boys go down and work with two - year - old children every day in the school and they say it so that the boys can develop omeati which is Japanese for empathy .
They think kids need to look after other children in order to develop these feelings .
As I say if you ’re taking American boys and you ’re putting them on competitive talent on soccer teams of five and six , they never have it–– you ’re racing them to be ferocious and competitive but not empathic .
Brett McKay : Dr. Thompson , a lot of people will hear this and think okay that ’s fine and you know it ’s great , we should teach emotional literacy to boys but it sounds like we ’re just turning them into little girls , how did you respond to that ?
I mean is it possible to teach emotional literacy while encouraging masculine strength in boys , kind of innate boyish characteristics ?
Dr. Thompson :
You know I had a friend who was born and raised in Germany and teaches in Boston University , has for years and teaches of this old university in Germany and he said many American boys would be stunned by how emotionally open German boys are , which is now on the most pacific countries in the world .
I mean Germans after World War II made a huge , huge effort to redefine what was masculine and they raised German boys differently so they did n’t turn out to be so warlike .
And he said you know German boys are so emotionally open that American boys would read them as gay .
They ’re not gay .
They ’re sleeping girls but they ’re talking to them a lot and that a culture of openness and talking is–– comes from the notions we ’ve muscularity .
You know , the masculinity varies from culture to culture .
What we regard as manly changes in culture to culture .
There is a lot about the American definition of masculinity which I like the independence , the entrepreneurial , kind of do it on your own attitude and there are lots of things which I think are very helpful to American men .
But the tough silent definition of masculinity is , of course , for psychologists worrisome because it means boys put down and do n’t express the actual feeling and then they go out touched with their feelings and we ’re getting a lot of young male depression in later adolescence and early adulthood and that ’s worrisome to me .
So , I try and teach boys that emotional courage is correct , showing your feelings requires some guts , you know .
Brett McKay :
Is that why you mentioned about how German men are emotionally open , it seems like there was a time in America that men used to be like that .
I mean if we go back to 19th century , even before World War II , you ’ll read men you know they ’re were affection with each other , you look at photos of men and they would have their arm around each other and …
Dr. Thompson : Yeah , that ’s right …
Brett McKay :
You know I was reading his diary and he writes you know , you can tell he was very in touch with his inner self and kind of emotions .
What change , I mean what happened , where we got away from that and until where this manliness and masculinity kind of stoic silent type , was it World War II that caused this ?
Dr. Thompson : I must say I do n’t know , I do n’t know the answer to that .
I think it will take a social historian , a social critic to know .
But I do think that the definition of masculinity changed from when – –I ’m 62 years old , when I was a child there were TV shows with you know ‘ Warm - Hearted Fathers and including the show called–– which I used to watch regularly called Father Knows Best and somebody–– the study of TV sitcoms some years ago and found that of 112 fathers on TV shows , they ’re only about seven of them who were competent .
The rest were a boys , adolescent , irresponsible , nit - wit irresponsible fathers .
I mean which father–– if you ’re a boy and you ’re watching to Two and a Half Men , which of those two men is the man you can admire as a father figure .
Brett McKay : Yeah , well , I do n’t think either one of them was that great , but …
Dr. Thompson : Right , I mean there ’s a mini , the real for father of the boy and then there ’s Charlie Shane right , excuse me , you know , he is a permanent 17 for life .
Brett McKay :
And what do you think –– let me just on that tangent there , I mean why do you think we put fatherhood out there just kind of you know mean a dad means kind of being the dumb , overgrown child and just another kid in the family , why do you we love that so much in our society ?
Dr. Thompson : I do n’t know , it ’s very painful to me .
Brett McKay : Yeah .
Dr. Thompson :
And why do we–– you know why did the media grab hold of this attenuated adolescent father ?
It ’s on all of their commercials .
You know the women were responsible and the men are nit -wit .
Brett McKay : Yeah , and something I think that is frustrating a lot of men these days .
And speaking of dads and fathers , what is a father ’s role in teaching emotional literacy to their sons and what can dads do ?
Dr. Thompson : I think as a father you take your son–– you know I was scared in the middle school sometimes , I was worried about police , I wanted to be stronger , but did n’t turn out that way you know .
I turned out to be a writer , an actor and something we did n’t know perhaps to be a football player and many of us found their deepest connections with our friends who are boys , meaningful connections .
I think father should absolutely demonstrate to their sons the power of male friendship , the power of male loves for woman and respect for woman .
I mean just you have to show boy what a real man is , not the two dimensional kinds of characters you see in sports .
Brett McKay :
And one thing that kind of struck me in your book that was interesting was that , you know one thing you can do to teach your sons about emotional literacy and is to show you vulnerability sometimes .
Dr. Thompson : Right .
And you ’re terrified if your son is weak and you ’re terrified if your son is going to be picked on but it ’s better to say what you faced and how you met it with resilience so your son knows that the most important thing is not to be just strong to everything , but in fact to be resilient and have some balance .
Brett McKay : So , Dr. Thompson you work with boys in All - Boys School , what are some things that parents or dads can do to help their sons in schools ?
It just it seems like boys are falling further and further behind and there is , you can go every month you read in article or see something on the television about how test scores amongst boys are falling down , graduation rates are going down for boys .
Dr. Thompson : Right .
Brett McKay : So …
Dr. Thompson :
Well , you know it ’s dads who want to send their sons upstairs to do their homework and they sit downstairs watching you know basketball or ice hockey that wo n’t work .
We know that fathers who do their homework with their sons have sons who get higher grades .
We know that fathers who attend school PTA meetings and come to things other than dumb sports , have sons who gets higher grades .
We know that sons whose fathers read to them at night do better academically .
So , I think when you ’ve a little boy , you should n’t always let the mom read to them , you should go up and read to your sons so they know being a man is being a reader .
Brett McKay :
And one thing you talked about in your book too is how––and we talked a little bit in the beginning of the interview about how schools are not really designed the way they are––in most public schools are n’t designed with boys in mind and that is one of other reasons why boys are struggling and teachers struggle with behavioral problems with boys .
I mean what we can do to kind of guide our schools in making them more boy - friendly .
Dr. Thompson :
Well , in every school I visit and that ’s my work as a school consultant , there are schools that are gifted – –excuse me , there are teachers that are gifted with boys and there are teachers who are not so good with boys .
And I want the secrets of teachers who are good with boys to be advertised , that is highlighted , you know , this is what works with boys in the classroom .
Now , there is a Philadelphia Psychologist , Michael Reichert who is coming out with a book called ‘ Reaching Boys , Teaching Boys ’ and it ’s based on the best kind of lessons from 600 teachers in boys schools around the world and you can actually teach people what are the best kinds of lessons for boys , what really works for them and that ’s what I want because constantly disciplined , constantly telling them they ’re in trouble , just makes them pissed off withdrawn from school .
Brett McKay : Yeah .
One thing I did or I ’ve heard around by people particularly with regard to boys in the schools is actually to enroll boys in the school later than you would girls , is there are any truth to that ?
Dr. Thompson :
Well , because in language acquisition boys – –the average boy is behind the average girl in language acquisition and the average boy is much more physically restless at age five than the average girl is .
So , the average boy is –– he is up against in the school which involves a lot of sitting and listening .
Brett McKay :
So holding them back would kind of put them , I guess , on uneven plane filled with girls ?
Dr. Thompson : Yeah .
Brett McKay : And Dr. Thompson , as I read your book I was struck that many adult men have the same emotional problems that the teenage boys you write about in your book .
What can these men do to overcome these problems that they have ?
Dr. Thompson : Yes , well , you know many , many men find that they got a course in their emotional life by falling in love with a young woman in their 20s and , and that ’s great .
I think that young men has to go back to their fathers rather than just stay angry and away from them .
Go back and ask them the questions you wish you ’d the answers to when you ’re 14 and 15 .
I mean men have to talk with each other .
You know , then I ’m a member of a men ’s group for nine years , that ’s kind of thing a psychologist is likely to do , but is not all mental health professionals , it is mostly educators actually , and you know men can train themselves to be open .
The men in this group were all in their 50s and we started this and we ’re–– a lot of these have various problem and problematic , but we trained each other to be open to each other and that ’s what I like to see .
Brett McKay :
And this book Raising Cain , your book was written a few years ago , have you seen any progress since the publication of the book ?
Dr. Thompson :
Well , I ’ve to believe that I ’m on––talking about the emotional lives of boys , I ’ve to hope that it ’s having an impact but I sure do n’t see in the media .
Brett McKay : Well , Dr. Thompson thank you for your time , it ’s been a pleasure .
Dr. Thompson : Nice talking with you Brett , thanks .
Brett McKay : Our guest today was Dr. Michael Thompson .

Starting later this summer , U.S. citizens 21 and older can begin carrying a concealed firearm without a permit in Arizona .
Arizona immigration bill faces Senate vote Monday
Gov. Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1108 into law Friday afternoon .
It eliminates the requirement for a concealed - carry weapons permit , but does require gun owners to accurately answer if an officer asks them if they are carrying weapon concealed .
It also allows officers to temporarily confiscate a weapon while they are talking to an individual , including during a traffic stop .
" I believe strongly in the individual rights and responsibilities of a free society , and as governor I have pledged a solemn and important oath to protect and defend the Constitution , " Brewer said in a news release .
" I believe this legislation not only protects the Second Amendment rights of Arizona citizens , but restores those rights as well . "
The law goes into effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for this session , which could happen in the next couple of weeks .
Arizona joins Vermont and Alaska in not requiring such permits .
" If you want to carry concealed , and you have no criminal history , you are a good guy , you can do it , " bill sponsor Sen.
Russell Pearce , R - Mesa , has said of his bill .
" It 's a freedom that poses no threat to the public . "
National Rifle Association lobbyist Matt Dogali said the new state law would not violate any current federal requirements .
" There is no federal requirement for a permit or lack thereof , " Dogali said .
The federal government oversees the background - check program required to purchase a weapon , which will still be required in Arizona in most cases .
Brewer last week did sign a separate law that exempts guns made and kept in Arizona from federal regulation , including background checks .
Arizona had 154,279 active permits as of April 4 .
Permit holders are spread across all ages , races and counties , but White males older than 30 in Maricopa and Pima counties hold the majority , according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety data .
The permits generated $ 1.8 million in revenue last fiscal year , according to DPS .
The money is used to help cover costs for enforcing laws related to the Highway Patrol , operating the concealed - carry weapon - licensing program and impounding vehicles .
Arizona 's permit process will remain in place , and many gun owners may still choose to get a permit .
Permits would still be needed in order to carry a weapon into a restaurant or bar that serves alcohol .
They would also be needed if an Arizonan wants to carry his or her gun concealed in most other states .
For those who do choose to get a permit , the education requirements do change under the new law .
Classes are no longer required to be a set number of hours or include any hands - on use of the weapon .
Those who do n't get a permit would not be required to get any training or education .
Retired Mesa police officer Dan Furbee runs a business teaching permit and other gun safety classes .
He said if most people choose not to get a permit , it will put several hundred Arizona firearms instructors out of business .
" It 's going to hurt , " he said .
But he said what really concerns him is that the new law will allow people who have had no education about Arizona 's laws and no training on the shooting range to carry a concealed gun .
The eight - hour class currently required to get a permit includes information on state law and gun safety , as well as requires students to be able to hit a target 14 out of 20 times .
Furbee said his class at Mesa - based Ultimate Accessories costs $ 79 , plus $ 60 for the five - year permit .
" I fully agree that we have a right to keep and bear arms , " Furbee said .
" But if you are not responsible enough to take a class and learn the laws , you are worse than part of the problem . "
He said it 's not uncommon for students to walk into his classroom and pull a new gun out of a box with no idea how to hold it and no understanding of the laws surrounding it .
" If you are going to carry a concealed weapon , you should have some kind of training and show that you are at least competent to know how the gun works and be able to hit a target , " he said .
" You owe the people around you a measure of responsibility . "
This new law is the latest of several that have passed over the past year since Brewer took over the office from former Gov. Janet Napolitano , a Democrat .
Napolitano vetoed at least a dozen weapons bills that crossed her desk during her seven years in office , all of which would have loosened gun restrictions .
In 2005 , Napolitano rejected a bill that would have allowed patrons to carry loaded guns into bars and restaurants .
In 2008 , she also vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to have a hidden gun in vehicles without a concealed - carry permit .
In January 2009 , Napolitano resigned to become U.S. Homeland Security secretary and Republican Secretary of State Brewer became governor .
During her first year in office , Brewer signed a bill allowing loaded guns in bars and restaurants , as well as another that prohibits property owners from banning guns from parking areas , so long as the weapons are kept locked in vehicles .
Nothing more to be said .

This is a tasty dish that the whole family will love .
It might go well served with rice , especially if the rice is loose and firm .
You 'll need about 1 / 2 the placenta of a 6.2 pound baby , or 1/3 the placenta of a 9.3 pound baby .
Chopped and packed , this is just a bit more than 1/3 cup .
( but like any raw meat , you do n't exactly chop it — try snipping away at it with a kitchen scissors )
Ingredients [ edit ]
1/3 cup chopped fresh human placenta
2/3 cup chopped broccoli
2 egg whites
1/8 t thyme
oil for frying
Procedure [ edit ]
Wash the placenta well , in a colander , then shake it to drain .
( it will still leak juices )
Stir the egg whites with a fork until they are without lumps .
Mix all ingredients well , squishing them by hand .
Add a decent amount of oil to a suitable frying pan .
Set a burner to high heat , and put the pan on it .
Start frying , stirring as if stir - frying or scrambling an egg .
The small amount of liquid ( seeping from the placenta , plus the egg whites ) will come to a boil .
You might turn down the heat slightly at this point .
Let the liquid boil away and / or solidify onto the broccoli and placenta .
When it looks yummy , serve it .
Warning [ edit ]
As with any meat from uncontrolled sources ( such as hunting or scavenging ) people should be cautious of risks involved .
Certain blood borne diseases can live in blood and tissue outside the body for some time .

Pope Benedict XVI might offer a mea culpa about the sexual abuse of minors by priests at the culmination of a yearlong celebration of priests at the Vatican in mid-June , a high - ranking Vatican official has said .
Cardinal William J. Levada , who oversees sexual abuse cases as prefect of the Vatican ’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , said on “ PBS NewsHour ” that he “ would n’t be surprised ” if Benedict were to do such a thing .
Cardinal Levada , who is American , succeeded the pope , formerly Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , as prefect in 2005 .
The Vatican spokesman , the Rev. Federico Lombardi , said that it was premature to speculate , but that sexual abuse would not be “ central ” to the June meeting .
The meeting is evolving into an expected rally in support of the pope .
Retired Olympic swimmer Daniel Kowalski has slammed comments by former Brownlow medallist Jason Akermanis encouraging gay players to stay in the closet .
Akermanis wrote in his weekly Herald Sun column on Thursday that coming out was unnecessary " for a lot of reasons " .
He said an openly gay player could make his team - mates uncomfortable and coming out could " break the fabric of a club " .
The Western Bulldogs released a statement on Thursday afternoon saying they disagree with Akermanis ' comments and his opinions were not shared by the club .
Kowalski , a four - time Olympic medallist who publicly revealed he was gay last month , says Akermanis has abused his position as a newspaper columnist .
" I 'm disappointed , I 'm mad , I 'm angry , I 'm sad , " Kowalski told Triple M radio .
" When you get comments like that from a guy of his stature , why would you come out ?
" It 's disappointing more than anything .
Jason Akermanis has always been known for being a human headline .
" I'm at a loss because a lot of work has been done by Pippa Grange and the AFL Players '
Association and there is support and it 's continuing to gather .
" He talks in a sense of ' we ' like he 's speaking for every player in the AFL . "
Kowalski says his fear of being hated , spat on and abused prevented him from coming out earlier .
" I did n't have the balls to do it , I worried what people would think , " he said .
" You 're brought up in this culture that it 's wrong to be gay , especially in sport .
" I was scared but since I 've come out publicly , my life is n't really any different , but the support has been overwhelming and I wish I could 've done it sooner . "
Akermanis questioned the wisdom of any gay players coming out .
" There 's been a little bit of a gay hunting going on where we 're trying to get people to come out , " Akermanis told the Nine Network .
" I 'm not sure that 's very safe and healthy for the competition .
What you do in your private life is your business . "
He says AFL footballers are at their peak of masculinity , which means homophobia is " almost at its peak " .
" Some footballers think there 's something wrong with people , they have some kind of disease , " he said .
Akermanis quickly clarified that he did not personally hold those views , pointing out that he played in Queensland with a gay player , who he thinks is " a terrific guy " and " tough and courageous " .
" I 'm ready .
I 'm fine with it all , " he said .
" But some of my , the homoeroticism around football clubs ... what workplace would you be able to see 20 men nude all the time if you wanted to ?
" When you 're slapping blokes on the bum and just having a bit of fun , what would that do to a man in there when you actually work out , ' Oh wait a second , wait a second .
I do n't know if I can handle that guy ' " .
His comments expanded on the weekly column he wrote for the Herald Sun that focused on the issue .
In March , Collingwood president Eddie McGuire said he has shared a wink and a nod with a few gay men inside the AFL .
He told gay magazine DNA that he has decided to keep their sexuality a secret .
" I 've had my suspicions and there are a couple in particular that I 've known quite well and they 've nodded to me and I 've winked to them , but they did n't want to take that next step in making it public , " he said .
In 1995 , rugby league international Ian Roberts announced he was gay and Olympic gold medallist Matthew Mitcham was the only Australian athlete at the Beijing Games to be openly gay .

New South Wales police are investigating complaints that Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide Philip Wilson mishandled sexual abuse cases involving fellow clergy in the 1970s and ' 80s when he was a senior priest .
One of the complaints comes from a Hunter Valley man who was abused by notorious paedophile Father Jim Fletcher in a house the Archbishop lived in .
Archbishop Wilson , who is widely tipped to become the next Archbishop of Sydney , denies any knowledge of the abuse .
But victims support group Broken Rites wants a full parliamentary inquiry to determine what senior members of the Catholic Church hierarchy knew about the abuse .
Yesterday ABC News Online 's Investigative Unit reported on how Archbishop Wilson was coming under increased pressure to reveal what he knew about clerical sex abuse in the Maitland - Newcastle diocese .
From the late 1960s until the late 1990s more than 100 children were abused in the diocese , north of Sydney , by at least five priests .
Peter Gogarty was one of the boys who was preyed on .
" There was this incredible sort of inner turmoil about what is happening .
What do I do ?
And I remember more than once going home and sitting in the toilet and crying , " he said .
Mr Gogarty was a young teenager when he was abused by Fletcher in the same house Philip Wilson then lived in .
He says the Archbishop of Adelaide , who was then a senior priest in the diocese , should have known what was happening .
" Quite often I would be there alone with Jim , never without Jim , always with Jim , and [ I ] regularly saw Philip Wilson in that house , " he said .
" Now why would any grown man , why would any adult think it was appropriate for another adult male - forget about whether or not he is a priest - what would any reasonable adult think of that sort of behaviour ? "
' No knowledge of abuse '
The Archbishop has told the ABC he did see the young boy in the house but denies he ever saw him taken into a bedroom and knew nothing of the abuse .
" As far as he was concerned Jim was just a good bloke and he did n't know that Jim was up to anything untoward , " Mr Gogarty said .
In the next two weeks another paedophile priest from the same diocese , Father John Denham , will be sentenced for the sexual abuse of 39 victims .
Many of them were from St Pius X High School in Adamstown , where Archbishop Wilson was then teaching .
Stephen Kilkeary was a student at St Pius from 1975 until 1979 .
He says it was a violent place where sexual assault was common .
" It was rampant , basically , " he said .
" John Denham was basically very overt in his sexualised behaviours towards a whole lot of boys and again , thinking back over the years , he basically would target boys , would groom them , would go out of his way to sort of get into their lives , go to their parents ' homes , take them on trips to Sydney , introduce them to alcohol - very full - on paedophile - type behaviours . "
Mr Kilkeary says the question for him remains : was Archbishop Wilson aware of what was going on at the time ?
" I 've given that a lot of thought over the years and my view would be that it would be impossible for anybody not to know , " he said .
Archbishop Wilson says he had no knowledge of the abuse going on while he was a teacher at St Pius .
The chairman of the Australian Catholic Bishops ' conference also denies there was any cover - up over the handling of the sexual abuse of an eight - year - old girl by another priest in the same diocese .
But Broken Rites spokesman Dr Bernard Barrett says the abuse is endemic and he wants a full parliamentary inquiry .
" There probably needs to be an inquiry appointed by the State Government and headed by a judge or a retired judge to get to the bottom of all this and to make it report to Parliament , " he said .
Police are still investigating victims ' complaints in the Maitland - Newcastle diocese , including the accusation that Archbishop Wilson failed to report the sexual abuse of children to police .
How are you supposed to take on an insurance company and fight for the benefits you deserve when you are too sick or injured to go to work ?
Misclassified workers also lose other labor protections accorded employees , such as minimum wage guarantees and overtime protection .
The number one reason that employers misclassify is to avoid paying workers compensation premiums and to avoid workplace injury and disability disputes .
So if a worker gets seriously injured — and this practice affects mostly low - income workers — that worker will have no income , no workers compensation benefits and likely no health insurance to help with medical expenses .
In my home state , California , at least 30 percent of workers are misclassified as independent contractors .
Workers are not the only ones harmed by misclassification — honest contractors are as well .
At a recent hearing of the Education and Labor Committee ’s subcommittee on Workplace Safety , which I chair , a representative of the Mason Contractors Association of America estimated that companies that misclassify their workers expect to reduce labor costs as much as 30 percent .
This puts honest contractors at a real disadvantage , which threatens their bottom line , their business and the security of their employees .
And there is one more big loser in misclassification — taxpayers .
The IRS estimates that about $ 2.7 billion are lost a year in unpaid taxes by employers who misclassify their employees .
To crack down on this problem , I have introduced the Employee Misclassification Prevention Act , H.R. 5107 , known as EMPA , with Reps. George Miller ( D - Calif . ) and Rob Andrews ( D - N.J. ) as original co-sponsors .
Sen . Sherrod Brown Sherrod Campbell BrownMnuchin says he and Pelosi have agreed to restart coronavirus stimulus talks Harris faces pivotal moment with Supreme Court battle Remote work poses state tax challenges MORE ( D - Ohio ) has introduced the same bill in the Senate , S. 3254 .
The bill :
Requires employers to keep records that reflect the accurate status of each worker .
Increases penalties on employers who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees ’ overtime or minimum wage rights .
Requires employers to notify workers of their classification as an employee or non- employee
Creates an “ employee rights website ” to inform workers about their federal and state wage and hour rights .
Provides protections to workers who are discriminated against because they have sought to be accurately classified .
Mandates that states conduct audits to identify employers who misclassify workers and requires that the Department of Labor monitor states ’ efforts to identify misclassification .
Directs states to strengthen their own penalties for worker misclassification .
Permits the Department of Labor and the IRS to refer incidents of misclassification to one another .
President Obama is also concerned about this problem , and in his latest budget complements EMPA by proposing an independent contractor initiative of $ 25 million for Department of Labor and Treasury Department activities to address misclassification .
Legitimate independent contractors play an important role in our economy and many companies make good use of their services .
Other companies , however , that misclassify employees as independent contractors have been ripping off their workers , honest competitors and taxpayers for years .
It is high time to put a stop to it .
On May 28 , there was a " flash crash . "
If you did n't notice it , that is because it occurred not in 2010 , but in 1962 .
Its aftermath offers some clues on what might happen in the wake of this year 's flash crash on May 6 .
" The stock market careened downward yesterday , " reported The Wall Street Journal on May 29 , 1962 , " leaving traders shaken and exhausted . "
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.7 % that day , down 34.95 , the second - largest point decline then on record .
" The drop took place on volume so heavy , " added the Journal , that the " ticker was n't able to finish reporting floor transactions until 5:59 p.m. , two hours and 29 minutes after the market closed . "
Like this year 's flash crash , the " market break " of 1962 came after a run-up in the market that had led many investors into complacency .
In 1961 , stocks had risen 27 % , with leading technology stocks like Texas Instruments and Polaroid trading at up to 115 times earnings .
Then , without warning , stocks " broke . "

Moderate to severely depressed clients showed greater improvement in cognitive therapy when therapists emphasized changing how they think rather than how they behave , new research has found .
The results suggest cognitive therapists should concentrate , at least during the first few sessions , on using cognitive techniques to help those with more severe depression to break out of negative thought patterns and to see events in their lives more realistically .
The study found that a concentration on changing behavior -- such as having patients schedule activities to get them out of the house , and tracking how they spent their time -- did not significantly predict subsequent change in depressive symptoms .
" There has been a lot of attention recently on behavioral approaches to treating severe depression , and that may lead some people to suspect that cognitive techniques are not important for more severely depressed patients , " said Daniel Strunk , co-author of the study and assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University .
" But our results suggest that it was the cognitive strategies that actually helped patients improve the most during the first critical weeks of cognitive - behavioral therapy . "
Strunk conducted the study with Melissa Brotman of the National Institute of Mental Health and Robert DeRubeis of the University of Pennsylvania .
Their results appear online in the journal Behaviour Research and Therapy and will appear in a later print edition .

The study involved 60 patients who were diagnosed with major depression and who were being treated at two university clinics .
All the patients were being treated by one of six cognitive therapists and agreed to have their therapy sessions videotaped for study .
Two trained raters reviewed the videotapes of the first through the fourth therapy sessions .
They rated how much the therapists relied on cognitive and behavioral methods and other aspects of the sessions .
In addition , patients completed a questionnaire at each session that measured their depression levels .
The researchers examined the relationship between specific techniques used by their therapists and the extent of improvement in patients ' depression scores from one session to the next .

The study focused on the first few weeks of therapy because other studies suggest that is when patients make the largest improvement in depression levels , Strunk said .
Results showed that patients ' depression scores improved significantly when their therapists focused on cognitive techniques , but did n't change when their therapists focused on behavioral techniques .
Other factors were also associated with patient improvement , the study found .
Patients improved more when they collaborated with their therapists about a plan for treatment and followed that plan .
Not surprisingly , patients also showed greater improvement when they were more engaged in the therapy process and were open to suggestions from their therapist .
" If you 're a patient and willing to fully commit to the therapy process , our data suggest you will see more benefit , " Strunk said .
Strunk said this research is being continued at Ohio State 's Depression Treatment and Research Clinic .
Researchers there are working with people suffering from depression to understand the nature of cognitive change and how it affects their improvement .
" We 're trying to understand if cognitive therapy leads people to a profound change in their basic self view , or if it teaches them a set of skills that they have to continually practice over time , " he said .
Strunk said these results suggest that , despite the recent attention given to behavioral approaches to treating depression , cognitive techniques appear to be quite powerful .
" In our sample of cognitive therapy patients , cognitive techniques appeared to promote a lessening of depression symptoms in a way that was not true of behavioral techniques , " he said .
Beginnings
The scene is Keene , New Hampshire , and our intrepid hero is one Mr. Andrew Carroll .
Amid a gathering of friends and onlookers , this brave soul held aloft a piece of plant matter .
His black trench coat and shock of red hair in stark contrast to the snow - covered square , Andrew dared to openly possess this innocuous natural substance : marijuana .
Having advertised this event in advance to ensure a spectacle , the throng numbered a few dozen .
A short speech was made , select lines from Nietzsche were read , and Mr. Carroll then offered to pass around the bud , allowing others to participate in this act of civil disobedience .
And lo , in the distance , the king ’s men approached .
Andrew scrambled to find the person holding the bud so that he could complete the act as intended .
Two officers from the Keene Police Department made their way to our hero and engaged him in conversation .
Greetings were exchanged and Mr. Carroll held out his open hand with this small green item visible in his palm .
When asked by the lieutenant if it was marijuana , Andrew snapped back , “ Yes it is . ”
The arrest was made , the trial was conducted , and Carroll , not wanting to pay the $ 420 fine–really !
–and give revenue to the state , spent nine days at the local house of corrections .
Dozens of New Hampshire activists are working to create more liberty by challenging and bringing attention to absurd and outlandish laws .
Some have moved here with the Free State Project , an effort to recruit 20,000 liberty - loving people to relocate in a single area .
Others are natives , or have come for such reasons as employment or schooling .
Unless otherwise stated , everyone named resides in the Keene area .
These are individuals who have chosen to commit their blood , treasure , and sacred honor for liberty .
Make no mistake :
This is not just a couple of random dudes smoking and joking ; there is a robust support network in place , and a community that can be rallied to support a person with very little notice .
Andrew Carroll went to jail as mentioned above– but he did so by marching there from the place of his arrest , nearly thirteen miles , with a group of fifteen activists , holding signs and bringing more attention to the absurdity of imprisonment over a plant .
That was almost a year ago , and the number of activists has swelled as more people move to New Hampshire , drawn by the movement that is just getting started .
It ’s a Celebration !
Keene is a quaint little New England town , surrounded by forested hills and mountainsides , with an old - fashioned town center .
It was September 12 , 2009 , and a political rally was being held at the Central Square ; Rich Paul , Noah Wood , and several friends visited the rally and decided to smoke a joint .
They had no idea of the fate that awaited them and the future of civil liberties in Keene .
The next day , Rich and Noah returned to the square at 4:20 P.M. , and lit up again .
This continued for several days–just the two of them and anyone who cared to join in , peacefully smoking a small amount of marijuana .
No property damage occurred and no one was hurt .
Our socio- economic system did not collapse due to the utter disregard for laws meant to protect us from ourselves .
Soon , Rich and Noah made mention of this daily ritual in their social circles .
Over the next few days , more people began showing up , often bringing friends .
Each time , marijuana was smoked and merriment ensued .
As destiny made inevitable , a reporter from a Manchester newspaper was in the area and decided to investigate the gathering .
By this time , the smokers numbered around thirty , and , though ostensibly a private get - together , bystanders were invited .
An article appeared in the Manchester Union Leader the next day , and , as though a switch had been pulled , the 420 gatherings turned from an under - the - radar revel to an open act of defiance against unjust and immoral laws .
Ian Freeman , host of the locally produced and nationally syndicated Free Talk Live radio show , leveraged his media resources , including the website FreeKeene.com , to drum up support for the next celebration , and the number of people in attendance began to soar .
Activists from other parts of the state were alerted , and a rush of plans were made to head to Keene and take part in this activity .
Many came through , and at 4:20 the next afternoon , the gathering boasted around seventy - five people , not counting the numerous onlookers across the street .
Reporters from other newspapers also made a showing , and the Keene Police Department arrived to observe the spectacle .
The officers parked their cruisers and stood outside of them while not actually setting foot in the square itself .
Many smokers could be seen passing joints or pipes , and selling brownies .
The event went smoothly and peacefully , with no arrests .
Emboldened by the success of this first public event , the rallying cry sounded throughout the area .
It was well - heeded : 130 people filled the square the next day .
Once again , cannabinolic conviviality was conduced , and once again the police did not interfere with the smokers .
They did , however , arrest one person on an unrelated warrant .

Crackdown !
September 26 , 2009 , turned out to be the sort of sunshiney Saturday made for good fun in the park with friends , a Frisbee , and a dog that will fetch errant throws .
After two days of public smoking with police looking on , the activist spirit is fully charged and individuals are becoming more daring .
Rich Paul and Noah Wood were being given credit in the media for starting and promoting the 420 at 4:20 smoke - out , and though they had run with the idea and done a great deal to promote it , it needs to be noted that there was no actual leader .
Nevertheless , this day would prove to be a turning point for Keene .
Early arrivers were greeted by officers from the Keene Police Department , hovering around the fountain by the gazebo .
Chuckles were had and quiet whispers were made as more and more participants crossed the street and entered the square .
Conversation was attempted with the officers , but they were not there to exchange pleasantries .
With five minutes to spare before the fateful time , the officers left the square , much to the happiness of participants .
When 4:20 struck , Rich Paul made a short announcement , and with a spark , the aroma of cannabis filled the air .
Speckled with dots of daylight shining through the canopy of shade the trees provide , good friends filled the square with laughter and lively conversation .
This day demonstrated that existence itself deserves celebration .
Fear and Doubt
The happy mood suddenly changed as two police officers crossed the street and entered the square .
Several activists immediately trained cameras on them .
Notice was given that they were being audio- and video - recorded as they started milling through the crowd , seeming to be searching for criminal activity .
There was a tension in the air as participants wondered what would happen next .
Some chose to wait for the right opportunity to smoke in secret .
Others just watched and waited .
Rich Paul was standing in the center area by the fountain and had put a hand - rolled marijuana cigarette in his mouth as the officers walked away .
He asked loudly for a light , and one man in blue started to head for Rich .
Rich lit the joint and took a puff as the officer walked past him in close proximity to smell the exhaled smoke .
The officer grabbed hold of the joint and placed Rich under arrest as the other policeman came over to provide back - up .
The crowd was incensed and began to ask questions and shout at the officers .
Several activists worked to keep things peaceful and as calm as they can be when watching a friend get arrested .
This is perhaps the key to the success of the protests .
A peaceful society can only be built with peace .
Violence will only shift public opinion against you and provide excuses for the police to use violence .
The officers took Rich to a waiting cruiser as participants peppered them with questions .
Many resumed smoking now that the square was empty of police .
A march to the jail was suggested .
In a matter of minutes , more than half the crowd grabbed signs and paraded down the busy Main Street sidewalk for the roughly two - mile walk to the station .
The city could not help but see this display and take notice .
Police Station Party
Once at the police station , an inquiry was made into the status of Rich ’s arrest , and no information was available other than that he was being processed .
The police station has a section of the parking lot that leads back behind the building where the cruisers are parked , as well as the civilian cars of the officers .
This area is guarded by a sign proclaiming “ NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS , ” with a line painted on the pavement .
Several protesters crossed this line , sat down , and formed a smoking circle where joints were passed .
The large group that had come to the station was divided , as most of them had seen the warning and were cautious about disobeying .
As time went on , more and more people became comfortable with violating the posted order , and crossed the line , making the smoke circle larger .
The police did not come out and bother the smokers , and those in the cruisers that came and went appeared oblivious to the possible “ crimes ” being committed .
Rich Paul was released on a “ personal recognizance ” bond and greeted the waiting throng with surprise .
Keene Police Lieutenant Shane Maxfield had come out and was answering questions posed by protesters and the reporters who were on hand .
In all fairness , the Keene Police Department has shown a good deal of patience and discretion with the activists .
They are not perfect , and have had a few scandalous incidents , but though we are opponents in the legal world , we are not enemies .
I must commend these officers on not being nearly as bad as those in some police departments around the country and world .

The Scene Is Set as the Plot Thickens
Sunday is always a big activism day in Keene , as there is a weekly social event that draws visiting liberty - lovers from across the state and country .
Many in attendance , having seen the day before what happens when an arrest is made , found their natural fear diminished .
Inevitably , there was some minor apprehension , but spirits were high .
The turnout this quintessentially summer day was again around 150 , and events proceeded in typical fashion , with a rallying cry at 4:20 and the familiar fragrance of festivity .
Police were on hand again ; round two sounds the bell .
In the area where Rich had been arrested the day before , Evan Pierce was trying to light a hand - rolled cigarette of unknown contents .
An officer stopped directly in front of him and watched as Evan attempted to get the cherry started .
Evan nervously fidgeted with the lighter as a large huddle of bystanders directed their attention at him .
The officer eventually grabbed the butt and smelled it .
After a few whiffs , he decided to arrest Evan .
Once again the crowd made known their displeasure , and once again a march was made to the Keene Police Department , an even larger group than yesterday ’s , numbering around eighty .
Many stood outside the lobby of the station , chatting and smoking , until a short announcement was made , and most of them hurried inside .
At one point , some particularly bold individuals decided to smoke a joint in the lobby itself .
The lobby is sectioned off from the rest of the station with locked doors and plate - glass windows .
In the center of the room is a pair of benches sitting back to back .
It was on these benches that a none - too - surreptitious joint was lit and passed to all who would partake .
News cameras were on hand from a Manchester TV station and the Obscured Truth Network , the latter run by liberty activists Sam Dodson and Smeg McLain , to record this hot - boxing of the cop shop .
The Keene police ignored the smoke , the group , and the cameras .
Evan was released shortly thereafter .
It turned out he ’d been trying to light a chocolate mint cigarette , not marijuana .
There were no charges against Evan , and the police were left with a black eye .
The group marched back to Central Square and resumed the festivities .
With the one exception noted below , this would be the last time the Keene Police Department interfered with the 420 celebrations as of this writing .
Certainly this victory cannot be under - appreciated .
Central Square became a police - free zone at 4:20 and those who were there lived as free people .
Festival of Gourds
Pumpkin Fest is an annual event in Keene that brings in more than 50,000 tourists from New England and beyond .
The extraordinary number of carved and lit pumpkins on display has earned eight world records in the festival ’s nineteen - year history .
The plan of those who wanted to participate was to go ahead with the celebration at the normal time , and use this as a platform to spread their message to the masses attending .
As Central Square was home to rows of pumpkin shelves and a band on the gazebo , the location was moved across the street , directly in front of City Hall .
It had been twenty days since the false arrest of Evan , and at the start of the festival , signs indicated that that streak might be about to end .
There was a very heavy police presence in the area of City Hall , with units on duty from several neighboring towns , as well as sheriffs .
Included were the obligatory battle - gear cops and K9s .
Whether they know it or not , such militaristic accoutrements are only intimidating to those who plan on being violent .
Peaceful activists are not going to fight , so all that that gear manages to accomplish is to make those officers uncomfortable and sweaty .
At this point the activists had a network of two - way radios that made coordinating efforts much easier in such a densely packed crowd .
The news of the police presence was spread by early arrivers , and this may ultimately have helped garner more of a turnout .
A group of around forty activists gathered in front of City Hall with clusters of police looking on .
Rich Paul had received a good deal of practice using the megaphone , and being a man of many words , he set out to demonstrate just that to all within earshot .
He spoke of the Drug War and how it is a war on people , not plants or chemicals .
He spoke of peaceful people being imprisoned , having committed no real crime , having damaged no property and created no victim .
“ We do this in remembrance of lost liberties , and for hope of the day when people do n’t fear their government , because the government fears the people , ” Rich shouted through the megaphone .
“ Smoke ‘ em if you got ’em ! ”
He then reached in his pocket and produced a pipe and a bag .
He packed a bowl and took a toke–and was promptly arrested .
Noah Wood and Evan Pierce also lit up and were arrested .
The three were moved into the City Hall building to await transport .
Later , three other activists tried to enter the public building and were also arrested .
A crowd waited for them at the police station , and each retold his story numerous times .
Evan and two others arrested that day went to the correctional facility where Andrew Carroll had served out his time .
This place has been the location of many parties , including a few barbecues , as activists go in and come out of jail .
Evan and the other two were released in short time .
Evan has just recently had his trial relating to the arrest .
He represented himself and conducted a very respectable defense against the state , invoking several constitutional arguments while citing the New Hampshire State Constitution , perhaps one of the best ever written as far as the amount of liberty it protects .
He was found guilty , he announced his intent to appeal , and requested a stay of sentencing , which he was granted .
Rich Paul is going to have one of his possession trials in a short time .
It is unknown what Noah Wood plans to do about his trial .
The 420 events continued without any problems after Pumpkin Fest .
There was a break when the New England winter hit full force , but they have since resumed without much to speak of … at least in Keene .

Hello , Nashua !
The Liberty Forum is an annual event put on by the Free State Project to entice people to move to New Hampshire , as well as to provide a place for liberty - minded folk to network and party .
The forum is held in Nashua , New Hampshire , at a fancy hotel , and draws several hundred people .
Naturally it is a great opportunity to practice some peaceful civil disobedience with activists from other parts of the country .
Saturday , March 20 , 2010 , was unseasonably warm , perfect for some outdoor activities .
Like Keene , Nashua has a central square equipped with monument and cannons .
At 4:20 , fifty or so activists traveled out there from the Forum and engaged in a smoke - out .
For a while , it was very peaceful .
Then a bit of commotion started amidst a group of local teens .
Soon it became clear that two undercover police officers were arresting a young man .
The activists , cameras in hand , descended on the police and began asking questions .
The sad truth of the situation is that with all of these mostly white activists openly smoking marijuana , the undercover cops chose to go after a young black male who had allegedly been arrested before for possession .
It can not be proven that the police specifically targeted that young man , but the situation seemed pretty shady .
The young man was put into the unmarked car , and some protesters upset by this gross injustice decided to be bold .
David Krouse of Keene is a very quiet and peaceful man , not one to yell at people or become even the least bit violent .
In silent protest , he has , in the past , stood in the way of police vehicles holding arrested friends , ultimately moving aside when the threat of arrest was levied against him .
This day he did not move .
After standing in front of the car and refusing to move , David was placed under arrest .
He decided to lock his hands and sit down , making a statement by inhibiting the procedure in a peaceful manner .
The officer tried to wrench David ’s hands apart to cuff them behind his back , but was unsuccessful , and decided to call for back - up .
The officer resumed his efforts to cuff David , and his partner came to help .
The two of them picked up David by his arms and carried him around to the back of the car .
The Cavalry Arrives
In a furious blur , about a dozen squad cars pulled up to the park , including a very emotional K9 officer who brought out his dog .
He started pointing at various protesters and shouting , “ He ’s got a gun , ” inciting his dog to bark .
The scene was on the precipice of danger , but some cool talking by veteran activists were able to calm the officers down .
Catherine Bleish , of St. Louis , Missouri , a video journalist , was arrested while asking questions of the police and the young man in the back of the unmarked car .
Most of the event was captured by the Obscured Truth Network , which has put together an outstanding video of the entire event that really captures the mood and atmosphere , both positive and negative .
Most of the participants , about forty in all , headed to the police station as per usual and awaited the release of the captives .
The mother of the young man who was arrested showed up , as his sister was there to see him get taken into custody .
His mother was very upset because she could n’t afford the $ 40 fee for the bail bondsman .
A collection was taken up by the activists and she was given $ 120 .
Several individuals talked to her and offered what help they could give as far as challenging the case in court .
Richard Onley of Keene is rather adept at crafting liberty lyrics .
He approached some singers outside the police station and passed out an easy call - and - repeat song , suggesting that they all go into the lobby and sing it .
Some headed in , and others followed to observe what was going on .
Inside the lobby , the singing of this simple song began as a quiet side note .
As more people chimed in , Richard passed out more lyrics sheets and soon the lobby was a choir .
Remaining positive in even the most dire times can only help ; it is also easier to be peaceful when you are in a positive mind .
The song ended , and much applause was given .
Spirits were high .
The three arrested were released later that evening and a return was planned for the next day .
The warm weather had withdrawn slightly , and Sunday turned out to be a chilly but sunny day .
The 420 celebration was also a goodbye for many of the out - of - state participants .
The police did not interfere , though they did drive by several times and reportedly waved at activists .
The young man arrested the day before was in attendance with his mother and sister , and fully supportive of the protesters .
No arrests happened , no misuse of tax dollars , no harm , no foul .
Yet the peaceful people in the square did nothing different from the day before .
The Saga Is Ongoing
At the most recent event this last week in Nashua , Sovereign Curtis passed an unlit marijuana cigarette to an undercover police officer and was arrested .
He was charged with a Class B felony , Distribution , and is working on his legal defense .
This movement is an ongoing , organic idea that we can have a better life if we are free to decide what that life is .
Pot is just one aspect , and it is not even the plant so much as the idea that my body is mine , not the State ’s , not the Government ’s .
At the same time , I also must accept that if I damage this body , the responsibility to fix it is mine , not the State ‘s , not the Government‘s .
What is happening in New Hampshire is a last - ditch effort to fix a broken system by peaceful means .
There is so much more than pot protests and the accompanying arrests ; there are people challenging unjust laws of many types .
The arrests also present opportunities to challenge the law directly , even though the court system is weighted heavily in favor of the State .
The simple fact is that some individuals have drawn a line in the quicksand of our lost liberties .
Defiant and bold , they have said “ No more . ”
The establishment has quaked and balked at the sheer audacity , but more so over the distinct lack of fear for the consequences that befall a law - breaking activist .
Some would cry out , “ Come , then , and arrest us .
We shall clog your already overburdened court systems and use your prisons as recruitment camps . ”
With an open mind and a pocketful of peace , they are working to change the world in their own way .
James B Schlessinger Jr. , 31 , resides in Keene , New Hampshire , and is the editor of , and a reporter for The Free Keene Press , a blogger at FreeKeene.com , and an all - around cool dude .

Montgomery County residents and businesses will pay an equal share of an energy tax increase expected to take effect Thursday .
Two council committees agreed Monday on a 50 - 50 split for the increase , but will keep the base rate the same — which charges businesses about three times more than residential customers .
County Executive Isiah Leggett ( D ) has proposed the increase to raise $ 21.4 million for fiscal 2010 , which ends June 30 , and $ 133 million for the next fiscal year .
Council members did not discuss what the increase should be , but based on one possible formula , businesses that purchase 1 million kilowatt hours a month would see their monthly electricity bills increase from $ 13,843 to $ 23,852 .
Residential customers using about 1,000 kilowatt hours per month — what Pepco describes as an average user — would see their energy taxes increase from $ 5 to $ 15 , according to council data .
Council members also supported calculating the energy tax rates at a higher level that would raise $ 21.4 million in fiscal 2010 if applied from May 20 to July 1 , then reducing the rates on July 1 — the first day of fiscal 2011 — to cover the necessary revenue .
Members are expected to decide how much revenue they will collect from the increased tax Wednesday , which will determine the new tax rate , said council President Nancy M. Floreen ( D - At large ) of Garrett Park .
In Montgomery County , the energy tax now is about 0.5 cents per kilowatt hour used for residential customers .
Nonresidential customers , such as businesses and government , pay 1.3 cents per kilowatt hour .
In his fiscal 2011 budget proposal , Leggett proposed doubling the energy tax for all customers in order to help fill a $ 1 billion budget shortfall .
Under his proposal , the county could collect $ 265 million in energy tax revenue in fiscal 2011 — a $ 133 million increase .
Leggett also proposed a sunset for the tax increase in 2012 , which the council committees voted Monday to recommend to the full council .
Pepco customers will see an increase in energy costs on their next bills , Pepco spokesman Charles L. Washington Jr. said during the council committee meeting Monday .
" We 're in a box .
We need the revenue , " said Councilman George L. Leventhal ( D - At large ) of Takoma Park .
" We 're faced with a lot of really hard choices . "
Montgomery County 's business community has lobbied hard against Leggett 's original proposal , saying it was unfair to businesses , some of which reported that their energy taxes would increase by as much as $ 500,000 .
Council members said Monday that the 50 - 50 split represented a large concession to county businesses — or those that might consider moving into the county .
However , the business community could still have a " huge challenge to overcome " if the council looks to collect as much in energy taxes as Leggett proposed , said Lisa M. Fadden , vice president of public affairs for the county Chamber of Commerce .
" At this point we have to raise this revenue , " Floreen said .
" We have no choice . "
One of the nation 's biggest labor organizations announced today it will boycott Arizona .
The Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) said its 2.2 million members will not attend any meetings or conventions in Arizona as long as the new immigration law is in place .

Perhaps .
But in an age of plastic surgery , body building and an infinity of cosmetics , let us hesitate to say impossible .
These and other strange blessings may be waiting in the future - which after all , is the Twilight Zone .

When Hortense wrote this weekend about Hollywood 's " plastic - surgery backlash , " it prompted one industry - insider commenter to refer to a famous Twilight Zone episode , " Number 12 Looks Just Like You . "
And she had n't even heard about the freaky Plastic Surgery convention , yet !
In case you 've never seen the classic episode about a Gattica - like society of identical , surgically - enhanced beauties , I wo n't spoil the ending for you .
Suffice it to say , there 's a lot of peer pressure .
And people lose all perspective .
And beauty is defined very narrowly .
And it 's scary .
In other words , it 's almost too perfect to serve as an effective analogy , because the irony would be pretty much lost on contemporary Hollywood .

Hortense commented that it's a bit rich for the town that 's pushed a generation of women to halt time or play a neurotic harridan making hot - flash jokes ( see : I told You So - or , better yet , do n't ) to now condemn women for " doing this to themselves . "
" This , " of course , is taut brows , trout - pout and cheeks as oddly cherubic as those of a QVC china - doll .
But it 's richer still in light of today 's breaking news in the world of surgical enhancement .
First , we have the annual convention of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery ( ASAPS ) , which plays host to thousands of suspiciously boyish doctors ( yes , the bulk are men ) as they learn about the latest advances in injectibles , boobery and , natch , those sagging pelvic floors .
Presumably , some of these doctors are experts in repairing cleft palates or reconstructive surgery , too - but to hear the Washington Post tell it , that 's really not the focus of the ASAPS event , in which " the models depicted in the oversize photos on the exhibit floor all look about the same — young , white , thin , robust of bust . "
That said , the doctors are alive to what 's described as the " globalization " of beauty - Asians want to look Western while " Turks want Christie Brinkley 's nose . "
A two - way street , as you can see !

And as if to give a lie to the supposition that Hollywood 's going natural on us , well , the numbers are climbing again .
Right now , the surgeons will tell you , business is pretty good and getting better .
Everything sagged during the recession ; not everyone had $ 7,000 for a facelift , and those who did held off , feeling kind of sheepish about walking around with a new face or a suddenly perky body part when times were so tough for everyone .
" It 's fair to say that plastic surgery is a leading economic indicator and the consumer is back , " said Rollin Daniel , a cheerful surgeon from Newport Beach , Calif. , in the body - beautiful center of Orange County .
Daniel says his practice is about 20 percent ahead of where it was at this time last year .
" Half of it , " he estimates , " is consumers feeling better about their economic situation and half is pent - up demand . "

Of course , no doctor 's a magician - a source , surely , of either frustration or revenue .
And one of the reasons , as new research proves , is that , well , bones age , too .
Summarizes Newser , " the researchers found that bones around the eyes , jaw , and cheek shrink and descend as people age . "
The skin , therefore , needs to be continually tightened to result in the desired shrink - wrapped appearance .
You 'd think , at some point , that beautifiers would simply throw in the towel and cede to nature .
But more likely , they 're busily at work perfecting a bone - plumper instead .

Plastic Surgeons Provide A Fine - Looking Model Of Success At Gathering [ Washington Post ]
A Little Too Ready For Her Close - Up ? [ New York Times ]
PHOENIX , AZ — Rocket - launch industry executives , engineers and related enthusiasts who comprised the core of the 140 attendees at the 17th annual meeting of the Space Access Society here appear fully fueled and ready to depend on commercial cargo and crew services in the coming era of U.S. civil spaceflight .
Both the meeting presentations and the opening - day mood of attendees were generally flush with excitement at the prospects for canceling or significantly downsizing NASA 's current Ares / Constellation architecture in the post - Space Shuttle period , as envisioned in the Obama Administration 's central rationale for the agency 's FY2011 budget request .
Obama , in his speech Thursday , elected to keep a scaled - down version of the capsule - based Orion spacecraft and set a goal of sending astronauts to an asteroid and then on to Mars . ]
" Is it a risk ?
You bet it 's a risk , " said Alan Ladwig , NASA 's deputy associate administrator for public outreach , who presented the broad themes of the NASA budget request .
" It 's also a risk to rely on single rocket like Constellation that was not meeting its budget guidelines or its schedule , " said Ladwig , adding that it was important to remember that " legacy companies do n't have a divine right to all of the contracts that NASA has , and the ' upstart ' companies do n't have a divine right to innovation . "
Multiple efforts underway
Jeff Patton of United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) said the Boeing - Lockheed Martin joint venture could be ready to launch astronauts to orbit on a commercial basis in four - and - a - half years , at a cost of roughly $ 130 million for an Atlas - V class vehicle , after $ 400 million in launch site facility upgrades .
Patton emphasized that ULA has been investigating aspects of human - rating its Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles since NASA study contracts for an Orbital Space Plane awarded in 2002 .
The company has also learned a lot about current commercial space business considerations working with Bigelow Aerospace as its planned launch supplier .
Bigelow 's forecasted crew demands in support of its planned launches of inflatable commercial space stations in 2014 and 2016 could drive a dozen launches per year , he said .
The reliability requirements to " human rate " a launch vehicle are not much different than those demanded to launch high - risk payloads such the recent New Horizons mission to Pluto , with its nuclear radioisotope power generators , he stated .
ULA will use most of its $ 6.7 million in NASA funding for commercial crew development to develop an improved Emergency Detection System to identify critical launch situations , and to refine its models of the environments in severe failure modes such as near - pad aborts , Patton said .
After citing other major FY11 budget request themes such as " building a 21st launch complex " and directly involving the public more via participatory exploration and increased support for science education , NASA 's Ladwig said that it would be at least two to three years before it becomes clear what the combination of commercial crew development and the maturation of the suborbital research and tourism markets will germinate .
" What 's it all about ?
Opening space to humanity , " Ladwig said .
" We do n't really know what will pan out .
That 's good thing .
It is in fact a ' new ocean , ' with a lot of people participating . "
Acknowledging such an approach can be " a hard sell " in a struggling economy , he outlined a three - phase schedule .
It begins with five years of NASA working with the private sector to develop " game - changing technology , " followed by a period of infrastructure renewal and construction , leading to " sustainable human exploration " by the late 2020s , toward the ultimate goal of " becoming a multi- planet species . "
Constellation going nowhere
The NASA space science program , which will soon see the return of oversight by a chief scientist position at the agency , has thrived in a regime where it sets more general strategic goals , rather than dates and destinations .
" The Constellation program was going nowhere , " he concluded .
" Let 's build on the legacy of Apollo -- it is time to move forward "
Augustine commission member Jeff Greason , president of XCOR Aerospace , addressed the criticism that the current NASA plan is lacking a clear destination , saying that commission members purposefully discussed this issue in the context of asking the question , why have a civil space program at all ?
" One of the reasons is that it 's supposed to be a technical ' push ' program " to force development of advanced technology , Greason said .
" You can not do that with a 30 - year plan , " he said , comparing the over specificity of such approach to his earlier experience in the semiconductor industry .
There , three years was considered a reasonable horizon for detailed planning and decades - long goals are vague and generally rely on experience -- often fortuitous -- gained along the way , he said .
His experience in industry and proprietary data that he was asked to review as part of the Augustine commission convinced him more strongly than ever that the U.S. aerospace industry is at a crisis point .
" The U.S. industrial base has decayed so far that we are on the verge of not being a space power , " Greason said , citing so many " single - string " suppliers and lost skills that the wrong sort of a launch failure could be crippling .
" It is a matter of national survival that we restore that industrial base " through federal investment in technology developing and more creative flight - testing regimes , he said .
Fresh attention to ideas such as in - orbit rocket fuel depots , in - situ fuel production at economically sensible places like Mars ' moon Phobos , and commercial crew services are " starting to crack " the outmoded system , he said to a late - night audience of industry members and NASA outsiders .
" The U.S. government has dropped the ball too many times , and now it 's up to us . "
WASHINGTON ( AFP ) – Like any good central banker , the Federal Reserve ’s Ben Bernanke cut a calm figure Thursday , sketching an endgame for vast crisis lending without hinting at the ideological storm that engulfs him .
From behind a thick wooden desk , Bernanke assured Congress that the Fed would not raise interest rates or withdraw 2.3 trillion dollars it has used to prop - up the economy before the “ appropriate time . ”

What he did not tell assembled lawmakers and television crews was that economists , Washington policymakers and even his Fed colleagues are in fierce disagreement about when the appropriate time might be .
Experts say the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression has exploded a debate over monetary policy that has long bubbled within the Fed .
“ To some degree we are in uncharted territory ” said Rob Roy McGregor , an economics professor at the University of North Carolina , Charlotte and an expert on the Fed ’s interest - rate setting Federal Open Market Committee .
Within the committee , McGregor said , monetary hawks — who argue for tight controls on money supply to curb inflation — are dismayed by historically low interest rates and the scale of Fed ’s balance sheet , which is more than double pre-crisis levels .
Meanwhile monetary doves , facing the greatest economic crisis in a generation , are more willing than normal to run the risk of stoking inflation in the pursuit of job creation .

It is not the first time the Fed ’s monetary hawks and doves have clashed , but today ’s tough realities may be polarizing the debate .
In recent months , traces of that debate have become public , shattering the Fed ’s image as a bastion of pointy - headed economists who pore over endless streams of data before reaching an amiable consensus .
For two straight committee meetings , Thomas Hoenig , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , has voted against his colleagues ’ promise to keep interest rates low for an “ extended period . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That is a sure sign of wider discord within the normally guarded Federal Reserve , according to Vincent Reinhart , a former head of the Fed ’s Division of Monetary Affairs .
“ The first thing to remember is that Fed is a consensus - driven organization , ” he said pointing to divisions over how quickly the Fed should move away from crisis mode by raising rates and unwinding the balance sheet .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This is a philosophical issue : how they exit , and how quickly they want to exit , ” he said , “ it is fundamentally about how you think inflation is determined . ”
According to McGregor , such dissent “ is actually quite rare . ”
Between 1966 and 1997 , dissent was recorded in just 7.8 percent of votes .
Some blame the politically - charged nature of the economic debate for the splits , and for threatening the Fed ’s independence .

Allan Meltzer , a Fed historian and former economic advisor to presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan , said the votes of open market committee members are often influenced by their proximity to Washington politics .
Of the ten voting members on the open market committee , five are members of the Fed ’s Washington - based board of governors , and five are presidents of regional federal banks .
“ The ( regional ) presidents are not as politically responsive , ” said Meltzer , “ they are out there talking to people , they hear the concerns about inflation . ”
In the current economic environment , the governors may be more finely attuned to concerns in Washington about tighter monetary policy and fears that it could choke the economic recovery .
ADVERTISEMENT
There are concerns that politics may further influence the debate .
Obama now has the opportunity to appoint two vacant governors seats and replace the Fed ’s vice - chair , who is to retire .
All three would serve on the open market committee .
Meltzer sees a difficult balance between the two , sometimes conflicting prongs of the Fed ’s mandate : to seek price stability and full employment .
“ The Fed has a dual mandate , and they choose to fulfill one part of that mandate at a time . ”
The Bed Bug Registry is a free , public database of user - submitted bed bug reports from across the United States and Canada .
Founded in 2006 , the site has collected about 20,000 reports covering 12,000 locations .
Check For / Report Bugs :
Hotel name :
City and state
Street Address
City and State
The Bed Bug Registry exists to give travelers and renters a reliable and neutral platform for reporting their encounters with bed bugs .
Though most Americans have still never come across one , these retro pests are spreading extremely quickly across American and Canadian cities .
Bed bugs are easy to transport in luggage and very hard to get rid of .
For this reason they have become an especial nuisance for hotels , dorms , hospitals , movie theaters , libraries , and other public spaces .
You can't tell whether a building or hotel room has them based on cleanliness - the bugs can thrive anywhere there are cracks and crevices to hide in .
Until a reliable , safe pesticide becomes available , avoiding bed bug encounters will be the only reliable way to ensure they do n't spread into your own home .
Image caption European Union countries may be forced to co-ordinate their budgets
The European Commission wants EU countries to co-ordinate plans for national budgets in a move to strengthen financial co-operation .
It would involve submitting budgets to the EU for a " peer review " , possibly before they go to national parliaments .
Some reports suggested the proposal would involve just the 16 countries using the euro currency , though this has not been made clear .
The Commission said its aim was to help prevent another EU financial crisis .
But the move , controversial as it would mean encroaching on sovereign territory , was immediately criticised by Sweden 's prime minister .
The EC statement said : " The Commission proposes to reinforce decisively the economic governance in the European Union [ which has 27 members ] .
" An early peer review of fiscal policies would help shape a fiscal stance for the EU and the euro area as a whole .
" Union countries should begin co-ordinating preparations for national budgets and economic reforms .
" Member states would benefit from early coordination at European level as they prepare their national budgets and national reform programmes , " the statement said .
' Deeper surveillance '
Olli Rehn , Europe 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner , appeared to suggest that the measures applied to eurozone countries .
He said : " Coordination of fiscal policy has to be conducted in advance , in order to ensure that national budgets are consistent with the European dimension , that they do n't put at risk the stability of the other member states . "
And he added : " For [ the ] euro - area it means deeper and broader surveillance , in particular with regard to macroeconomic imbalances . "
No one in Mr Rehn 's office was available for clarification .
' Shining exception '
Sweden 's prime minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , opposed any tighter surveillance on his country .
" That this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange , " he told a press conference .
" This kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for [ countries ] with a budget policy that goes against the [ EU ] stability and growth pact , " he said .
" But countries like Sweden , we are a shining exception with good public finances and do n't even come close to the limits one is not permitted to surpass .
It is not fair to treat us the same way . "

Overview
Microsoft recently added a new layer of complexity to the ongoing debate regarding the filtering and censorship practices of U.S. search engines via its own search engine , Bing .
ONI testing reveals liberal filtering by Bing in one of the most censored regions in the world : the Arab countries .
Microsoft ’s Bing , which tailors its search engine to serve different countries and regions and offers its services in 41 languages , has a filtering system at the keyword level for users in several countries .
Users in the Arab countries — or , as termed by Microsoft — “ Arabian countries ” — are prevented from conducting certain search queries in both English and Arabic .
ONI testing reveals that Microsoft filters Arabic and English keywords that could yield sex - or LGBT - related images and content .
Methodology and Results
We manually tested the search engine using a set of 100 Arabic keywords and a set of 60 English keywords that would yield results in various content categories , including sex , nudity , dating and escort services , LGBT content , violence and terrorism , politically sensitive content , minority and religious rights , and women ’s rights .
The Arabic keywords tested included classical Arabic terms and various alternatives from different Arabic dialects .
All testing was conducted using Bing set to the “ Arabian countries ” setting .
We tested the search engine using both the Arabic and English interfaces .
Testing was conducted in four Arab countries chosen for their different levels of Internet censorship as uncovered by the latest ONI research .
These countries are the United Arab Emirates ( substantial political filtering and pervasive social filtering ) , Syria ( pervasive political filtering and selective social filtering ) , Algeria ( no evidence of filtering ) , and Jordan ( selective political filtering and no evidence of social filtering ) .
All testing was conducted in the period of January 2 - 15 , 2010 .
It is important to emphasize that de-listing of results was not probed in this research .
In - country testing has consistently revealed the following :
- Bing filters out Arabic keywords that may return sexually explicit content .
Examples of the Arabic keywords found filtered include Arabic terms for “ sex , ” “ porn , ” “ intercourse , ” “ breast , ” and “ nude . ”
- Bing filters out Arabic keywords that could yield Web sites containing LGBT content .
Arabic keywords found filtered include terms for words such as “ gay , ” “ lesbian , ” and “ homosexuality . ”
- Bing filters out keywords in various sex-related categories .
Examples include Arabic terms for “ prostitution , ” “ whore , ” and “ sadism . ”
- Bing filters out English keywords that could yield sexually explicit Web sites .
The keywords include “ porn , ” “ sex , ” “ fuck , ” “ penis ” ( but not “ vagina ” ) , “ sodomy , ” “ homo , ” “ sexual , ” “ sexy , ” “ clitoris , ” and “ anal . ”
The following is a sample list of keywords the OpenNet Initiative tested .
- Bing filters out English keywords that could yield sexually explicit Web sites .
The keywords include “ porn , ” “ sex , ” “ fuck , ” “ penis ” ( but not “ vagina ” ) , “ sodomy , ” “ homo , ” “ sexual , ” “ sexy , ” “ clitoris , ” and “ anal . ”
- Bing filters out English keywords such as “ gay , ” “ lesbian , ” “ homosexual , ” and “ queer ” when searching for images , however , using these words to search for Web sites is permitted .
- Attempts to use any of the filtered keywords generates a message in Arabic or English ( depending on the interface used ) which reads , “ Your country or region requires a strict Bing SafeSearch setting , which filters out results that might return adult content . ”
- Similarly , searching for images using any of the filtered keywords generates the alert :
“ The search may return explicit adult content and has been filtered by your Bing SafeSearch settings .
Your country or region requires a strict Bing SafeSearch setting , which filters out results that might return adult content . ”
- Bing does not offer users of the “ Arabian countries ” version the option to toggle SafeSearch on / off .
This option is available for Bing instances tailored to some other countries .
- There is no filtering by keywords if a user chooses another country ( e.g. , United States , Canada ) as their location even if they are physically located in an Arab country .
- One anomaly we found when probing filtering by keywords is that filtering does not work if a filtered Arabic keyword is used together with another non-filtered keyword .
For example , a search using the Arabic word for “ sex ” is banned , but using the Arabic term for “ sex stories ” is not banned .
This anomaly is not found in the case of English keywords i.e. , searching using “ sex ” and “ sex stories ” are both banned .
- We found no evidence of filtering of keywords in Arabic or English that could return results in other content categories .
We tested keywords that could yield politically sensitive content ( e.g. , “ democracy ” , “ freedom ” , “ opposition ” ) , content related to violence and terrorism ( e.g. , “ torture ” , terror ” , “ explosive ” ) , Web sites related to minority and religious rights ( e.g. , “ Shiite ” , “ Baha ’i ” , “ Christian ” , “ Jews ” ) , and content related to women ’s rights ( e.g. , “ gender ” , “ equality ” ) .
None of the tested keywords were found banned .
Conclusion
Microsoft ’s explanation as to why some search keywords return few or no results is that “ [ s ] ometimes websites are deliberately excluded from the results page to remove inappropriate content as determined by local practice , law , or regulation . ”
It is unclear , however , whether Bing ’s keyword filtering in the Arab countries is an initiative from Microsoft , or whether any or all of the Arab states have asked Microsoft to comply with local censorship practices or laws .
It is interesting that Microsoft ’s implementation of this type of wholesale social content censorship for the entire “ Arabian countries ” region is in fact not being practiced by many of the Arab government censors themselves .
That is , although political filtering is widespread in the MENA region , social filtering , including keyword filtering , is not practiced by all countries in MENA .
ONI 2007 - 2008 and 2008 -2009 testing and research found no evidence of social content filtering ( e.g. , sex , nudity , and homosexuality ) at the national level in countries such as Algeria , Egypt , Iraq , Jordan , Lebanon , and Libya .
On the other hand , Microsoft does not seem to apply IP - geolocation restrictions .
That is , if a user physically located in an Arab country chooses to use an uncensored version of Bing tailored to another country ( e.g. , USA or UK ) , he / she will not experience any keyword filtering even if he / she uses a keywords filtered by Bing for “ Arabian countries . ”
Additionally , in the case of Arabic keywords , users can sidestep the search engine censorship regime by adding another non-filtered Arabic keyword to the filtered one .
Microsoft ’s declared aim from this type of censorship is to filter out “ results that might return adult content . ”
However , filtering at the keyword level results in overblocking , as banning the use of certain keywords to search for Web sites , not just images , prevents users from accessing — based on Microsoft ’s definition of objectionable content — legitimate content such as sex education and encyclopedic information about homosexuality .
It is difficult to assess the impact of Bing ’s filtering policy on access to information and freedom of speech in Arabic - speaking countries .
The fact that users can easily switch to another search engine that does not filter its results ( e.g. , Google ) or switch to a different version of Bing ( e.g. , a U.S. or European version ) , suggests that the impact may be slight if one assumes that users are making a conscious choice to restrict their search results with the help and guidance of Bing to filter out offensive material .
On the other hand , default settings have a profound impact on user decisions ; many users will be unaware of the options or be motivated to try alternative searches .
As other search engines have done , Bing could offer users the ability to choose their own level of filtering in a way that is transparent and easy to implement .
This raises a separate set of questions regarding the motivation and standards for instituting search result filtering in the region .
It is unclear still whether Microsoft is acting at the behest of local officials , interpreting local law , seeking to preempt future regulation or attempting to position the company as a good corporate citizen .
The fact that they employ a single filtering policy throughout the region implies that they are following one or both of the latter approaches rather than the former .
The current approach uses a region - wide standard for filtering content as opposed to the more targeted , granular , and country - specific policy .
A more targeted approach — either country - based or preferably , defined by the user — is more generally consistent with minimizing the impact on freedom of speech .
Through its involvement in the Global Network Initiative , Microsoft has signaled its willingness to be at the forefront in protecting freedom of expression around the world .
It is difficult to reconcile this position with Bing ’s current filtering standards .

Day [ 9 ] driving
We departed from USC at around 8:30 AM .
After making a couple wrong turns we finally reached our destination , Blizzard HQ , in just a short one - hour drive .
We were both decked out in our nerd gear , with me repping TL wearing the Teamliquid winged horse shirt and Day [ 9 ] in his awesome Macro - Micro yin -yang shirt .
Upon our arrival , the Blizzard security guard told us to “ make a left , then you ’ll see the orc statue and the door will be to the left ” .
When the security guard uses an orc as a landmark , you know that you ’ve arrived at the right place .
We walked into the lobby area and after filling out our NDAs , we started mingling with other representatives from other websites , such as Shacknews and Gamasutra .
It was definitely nice to meet and chat with some people who are very dedicated to ESPORTS .
All the Blizzard employees were extremely nice and went way out of their way to make us feel welcome — really an awesome group of people .
They soon shuffled us into the auditorium ( with very plush seats , I might add ) , where we had an informal Q&A session with Dustin Browder , followed by a brief demonstration of the single player mode .
About three weeks ago Teamliquid received an invitation to attend Blizzard ’s exclusive press conference that took place on April 19th .
Day [ 9 ] and I had the honor to represent our favorite website !
Last year , Blizzard Entertainment revealed a lot of the multiplayer aspects of the game .
However , with the beta now fully underway and beta keys being given out left and right , this year ’s press conference focused on the single player campaign .
Now I know that the majority of TL ’s userbase cares a lot more about multiplayer balance and issues than the campaign , but I think that you ’ll be pleasantly surprised with our review of the current single player build .
I will also state that I have no interest in lore , so I will not be discussing any of that in this article .

Informal Q&A Session Recap
The following is a compilation of notes I took during this informal session as we waited for the single player demonstration to load up .
Beta tournaments :
He said that he found them exciting because they did n't really expect any tourneys since it was " just beta " .
They are seeing strategies that they did n't predict during internal testing .
The balance team is excited for current situation in beta .
They will be dealing with the queen rush in the next patch [ author ’s note : not sure what was meant by this ] .
They also want more diversity in the ZvZ matchup .
MBS and smartcasting : Hardcore players are happy with the amount of skill required to play the game at a high level .
They have n't been hearing many negatives about it .
The backlash is n't as severe as what they had anticipated .
Releasing a patch that does n't nerf protoss : Patches have different aims .
Sometimes they 're based on balancing race matchups , but oftentimes not .
For example , the ZvZ matchup was stale because they were only making 3 units .
The reasons for the patch are that statistically speaking , protoss is winning a lot .
ZvT and ZvP have only 1 % win-loss differential .
However PvT is at around a 55 % win rate .
The matchmaking system does its best to match players with their own skill level , but the data is n't necessarily reliable .
One flaw he pointed out was that one player may be more significantly more skilled than another but they may end up going 50 - 50 against each other because of the racial imbalances .
KR vs US vs EU : In Korea , Zerg needs to be nerfed because Zerg is so dominant .
For EU / US , Zerg needs to be buffed .
At this point , due to limited sample size , nobody knows for sure what races are the most powerful .
Playing on different gateways : Blizzard is not planning on allowing players to play on different server upon release , so things will be the same as they are in beta right now .
Entry Barrier
( How new players join the competitive scene ) : Solo play campaign is the starting experience .
Then they will graduate to either play versus the AI or challenge mode .
Hopefully after that , they will go online and play co-op with friends .
Next they can then play 3 v3 , 4v4 .
Ideally , they play 1v1 based on their prior experiences .
However in the beta none of these discussed features exist .
Beta is not meant to be a demo , it 's intended to be a test of 1v1 and 2v2 balance , so it is n't really good for casuals .
Lurker removal :
It conflicted with other units already in the game : roaches , infestors , banelings .
The lurker was originally pushed to tier 3 .
However at tier 3 , detection was plentiful so they felt like the unit did n’t have a specific enough of a role .
UI / Hotkey adjustments :
They are not planning on having a fully customizable UI but they will have customized hotkeys .
For advanced players , they can even open a textfile and edit each individual hotkey .
Balancing time and resources : Dustin Browder spends equal amounts of time on balance and other things .
In terms of money spent , he was n’t sure of the exact breakdown .
They are still working on solo campaign and also working on the AI .
Spellcasters : Pretty confident about their current state except for infestors .
He wishes that queen has better tension with spell choice ( ie MULE vs scan with the orbital command ) .
He is happy about ghosts and their current role .
Unit Balance :
They do n’t want to mess with too many things because the metagame changes all the time even without patches ( think of the SC1 metagame transitions over time ) .
Hunter - seeker missile :
They are going to lower the technology requirement from fusion core down to just the tech lab , but this means that they will also bring down its power , too .
Single player and multiplayer data / balance is separate : Unit statistics such as rate of fire and HP may be different .
There are also upgrades in solo mode that would be impossible to implement in multiplayer .
He stressed that the solo player campaign does not train you for multiplayer .
Community feedback : Yes , it is definitely being heard and used .
From the community ’s perspective , it seems like they are n't listening because it takes ~ 2 weeks to get stuff implemented , but they are definitely reading and looking at what the community says .

Single player basics :
After each single player mission you return back to the story mode origin , which will change throughout the game .
You can customize force before going into battle .
You can unlock different units ( such as the medic and firebat ) by playing missions .
You can make technology purchases ( for example , the combat shields for marines ) .
Each unit has a cheaper basic upgrade and then a much more expensive higher upgrade .
Mercenaries : Extremely high - end version of units that you already own .
You can use each mercenary once or twice each mission , depending on what mercenary it is .
When you purchase them in - game , they immediately arrive at the battle scene via drop pod .
Research : Missions have bonus missions ( for instance , kill a brutalisk or find hidden Zerg DNA on the map ) that gives you research points .
There are checkpoints at 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 research points .
At each checkpoint you have 2 choices of what you can research .
Once you research it , it ’s final .
You can not go back and change it .
TV news reports : Based on your actions in the game , there will be TV news reports that update the situation happening in the Starcraft 2 world .
Very cool feature .
Gameplay : Each mission is its own special gameplay mechanic .
They do n't want each one to be the same " jump in and kill the computer AI " mission .
Each mission will be very distinct from each other .
After Dustin Browder ’s presentation , the majority of the rest of the day was spent playing the single player campaign and the new challenge mode .
We headed up to the 3rd floor where they had 2 rooms set up with computers for the press and fansites to play !
Lots of nerds playing SC2
Single Player Mode
Day [ 9 ] and I split up the single player mode .
I explored the different customizations , mercenaries , and the new challenge mode .
Day [ 9 ] tried some of the campaign missions , and I wrote down his opinions and impressions of the game as he was playing .
Our workstation : note the variety of complimentary drinks
Customizations
The single player interface is much different from that of SC1 or Battle .
net .
There are four different locations you can visit between missions .
The environments are interactive .
When you click on different characters and structures they react and talk with you , almost like how it would be in an RPG .
Bridge :
This is where you can select the planet and mission you will play
Armory :
You can purchase upgrades for your units and buildings .
Level 1 is cheap , Level 2 is much more costly .
For example :
Bunker :
Level 1 : Projectile accelerator ( increase range by 1 )
Level 2 : Neo -steel bunker ( increase number of bunker slots by 2 )
Missile turret :
Level 1 : Titanium Housing ( increase missile turret health by 75 )
Level 2 : Hellstorm Batteries ( additional volley of projectiles with each attack )
Units :
All of the following have 2 unique upgrades each
Infantry : Marine , Medic , Firebat , Marauder , and Reaper
Vehicles : Hellion and Diamondback
Cantina :
You can buy mercenaries here
3 types were unlocked : war pigs , devil dogs , hammer securities .
There were also some mystery locked mercenaries .
Mercenaries are upgraded or elite versions of units you already have , such as marauders .
Buy mercenaries at the Cantina [ 1680x1050 ]
Laboratory : Research technology
You get to research extra technology each time you collect a certain number of research points for completing extra missions within levels .
For example , when you have 15 points you can choose between scv-less refineries or double - pumping command centers .
Your choice is final , and can not be reversed .
Research new technological improvements at the Laboratory [ 1680x1050 ]
Challenge Mode
Challenge mode is basically a set of single player UMS maps made by Blizzard and they test specific skill sets in SC2 .
In the current build , there are three different missions for three different difficulty levels to give us a total of nine .
Basic :
Teaches you general knowledge of unit counters and army composition
Tactical Command : Send the right Terran counter units .
Protect three supply depots from waves .
Path of Ascension : Send the right Protoss counter units .
Protect three pylons from enemy waves .
For the Swarm : Send the right Zerg counter units .
Protect three spires from enemy waves .
Advanced : Focuses on micro tips and increasing multitasking
Covert Ops :
You have a small force of terran specialists ( like ghosts ) and you kill as many units as possible in a given time frame .
Psionic Assault : Protoss version of above with high templars and sentries , except you have no time limit .
You just beat as many waves of units as you can .
Infestation : Zerg version with roaches and infestors .
Destroy as much of enemy base as you came before time runs out .
Expert : Training for multiplayer
Harbinger of Death : PvT , you can only use hotkeys and have to kill as many units as possible before time runs out .
Opening Gambit : TvZ , build up a strong econ and large army while fighting off early attacks .
Aim is to optimize build order .
Rush defense : TvZ / P. Learn how to fight off rushes as a Terran .
There were only two missions ready to play in this build : Psionic Assault and Harbinger of Death .
There are three achievement levels , Bronze , Silver , and Gold .
These achievements were based on the number of kills you managed to get .
Psionic Assault was really difficult at first and I died just around the Bronze level .
Then I realized that SC2 had smartcast and I was able to almost reach Gold on my second attempt .
The waves come from various directions and as you get further and further into the game , the waves start coming in more frequently and eventually simultaneously from the different ramps .
Harbinger of Death was challenging due to the time limit .
If there was no time limit , it would have been an extremely easy mission to finish .
I forgot that you could only use hotkeys for this challenge , so I lost my carriers right away since I did n't make interceptors ( I had clicked on the " make interceptor " picture ) .
On my 2nd attempt it was much easier .
I was n't able to kill all the units but I made significant improvements from my first go - around .
Single Player Campaign
We played two different campaign missions , one each from two different worlds : Bel ’ Shir and Xil .
We decided to try the campaign with the difficulty level on “ Brutal ” mode , which was the hardest .
Day [ 9 ] played the campaigns while I sat next to him writing down observations as well as transcribing some things that he said as he played .
Bel 'Shir : Welcome to the Jungle
There are 2 main goals for this mission :
1 ) Collect terrazine gas located around the map .
2 ) Prevent Protoss from sealing 7 altars
And 1 bonus goal :
3 ) Find Protoss relics
Fight off the Protoss as you collect terrazine gas [ 1680x1050 ]
Prevent Protoss from sealing the altars [ 1680x1050 ]
- Before Day [ 9 ] started the mission , he bought all the unit upgrades first .
These upgrades are permanent , so you do n’t have to buy them every time you start a new mission .
- Latency on single player is significantly lower than on Battle .
net so it 's very easy to control units .
- Scouts are just as bad against ground as in SC1 .
- In the original single player , none of the missions were challenging in any regard , but this is very challenging .
- The computer AI target fires .
- Day [ 9 ] was playing extremely aggressively , but there appears to be no repercussions for that at all .
- Low on money relatively quickly , had to expand .
- Calling in mercenaries is necessary , they have very inflated stats relative to other units .
- Day [ 9 ] just lost to scouts in single player TvP ! ( lol )
Xil : The Dig
There are 3 objectives in this mission :
1 ) Recover the laser drill
2) Destroy the Xel ' Naga temple door
3 ) The laser drill must survive
In this mission the main idea is to defend your Terran base as you destroy the Protoss Xel ’ Naga temple door with your laser drill .
You destroy this ... [ 1680x1050 ]
... with this [ 1680x1050 ]
You initially start with a drop pod worth of units .
The unit statistics are different from the multiplayer version ( different HP values , etc ) .
You have to defeat small groups of units along the way .
The campaign guides you very nicely in a tutorial - type fashion .
After you beat the original few units they smoothly transition into you taking over a base .
You have this laser drill ( 33 damage ) that needs to kill the Xel ' Naga temple door which has 100,000 HP .
Your base has 2 entrances and Protoss will keep attacking you .
On " Brutal " mode the computer is actually quite good .
Day [ 9 ] would be having a tough time fighting them off if he did n't have that laser which will also help defend the base .
Even with the help of the laser he is barely able to hold them off .
There is a new Terran unit that is not in multiplayer mode : the Diamondback .
It ’s an armored mechanical unit that comes out of the factory .
It does 20 damage with a +20 vs armored bonus .
It can move while shooting .
Both missions so far have this " rush rush gogogo " feel to it .
It ’s a very fast and frantic feel .
Day [ 9 ] is impressed because he feels like he actually has to really try and focus to beat the mission .
Day [ 9 ] eventually loses again , but he thinks that the campaigns are awesome .
To quote him directly , " it 's like impressively fun . "
We decide to try this mission again .
It ’s difficult to see the enemy in the minimap due to the colors .
In a classic version of this type of map you 'd expect to be able to win by just making a bunch of defensive structures but with this level it is n't possible ( which is a very good thing ) .
Playing it a second time makes the mission significantly easier since he knows what he 's doing .
It seems like he 's winning without too much difficulty this time .
The mission takes a very long time to complete because the Xel ’ Naga temple door has so much HP .
I think he has played this mission for about 15 minutes and it still has 17,000 out of 100,000 HP remaining .
Oh sad face , the game just crashed with only 10,000 HP remaining .
The game has a nice autosave function where you can restore up to a certain point .
Day [ 9 ] taking a break from SC2 to work on his presentation
Lunch Time !
Sometime during the single - player testing , it was lunch time .
Yay for delicious Mexican food !
During the lunch break we were able to chat with Karune , as well as several other awesome Blizzard staff members such as Kenny ( community team ) , Dan and Simeon ( B.net 2.0 ) .
We ’re always happy to be able to strengthen our relationships with the Blizzard staff .
Also , they loved our
For the rest of the day we experimented a little bit more with the single player modes , but for the most part we chatted with Blizzard staff members , and we also prepared for the fansite Q&A session with Dustin Browder and Chris Sigaty .
Unfortunately , we were n’t able to ask all the questions we wanted since there were other sites there asking questions about things like lore …
But not to worry , we definitely managed to learn a few key things about SC2 !
So without further ado , here ’s what we learned during the Q&A session .
Fansite Q&A Session Recap
Description of their balance process : Ideas could be based on forum posts , replays , Battle .net statistics etc .
Basically the entire process is a lot of trial and error .
18 + rating in Korea :
Not sure what 's going on with that .
They are looking up what happened and how to fix it .
High ground mechanic :
They like how it is now .
According to Dustin Browder , it gives a clear advantage at first and then it eventually disappears .
Implementation of F - keys : F1 - 4 will hero hotkeys for single player missions and the inevitable DotA clone . “ ~ ” will be for voice chat .
F5 - F8 are to be implemented as screen locations in Patch 9 .
It may be possible to customize and remap these hotkeys in the future .
Server isolation and its effect on the growth of ESPORTS :
It will be definitely something that will be look at in the future , but at the moment there are no plans to allow people to access different servers with the same key due to lag and latency issues .
The " you are being revealed " mechanic :
It is being fixed at the moment .
The new plan is when you lose your last central building , only you will get a 30 second countdown to build a new central building .
If you do not build one in 30 seconds , only then will it be revealed to your opponent .
Also , if you make a central building again past the 30 second mark , your opponent will lose their vision of all your buildings .
The 30 seconds is the current number , but based on testing it may move up to 60 seconds .
Also , in the future this may end up being a toggleable option for tournament mode .
Group / online replay watching : Group replay watching is not expected to be implemented at launch .
However subsequent patches are aimed to be like WoW , where the patches are significant modifications , not just minor balance tweaks .
You will be able to create " groups " .
A Group is a concept of gathering users with similar interests together , such as mapmaking .
It will be in a future patch or expansion but it wo n't be in the next content patch .
For clans and other things there is no predicted date of release for this feature although they will look into it .
Hiding " match history " data :
All professional sports are based on studying tape of the opponent .
So no , they are not planning on hiding match history data .
Once the tournament patch is added it 'll be easy to figure out who the best of the best are ( professional league ) .
If a player wanted to hide their match history , they would need to make another account and play .
Identifiers : Still not sure of the final answer on whether or not they will keep it .
The idea was that if someone wanted a very common name such as “ Darth Vader ” , this would enable them to do so .
However due to confusion , this is still up for change .
They do n't know what direction they will take but they do acknowledge that this is a problem .
Overall ladder rankings :
The tournament system will rank only the very top end players , but definitely not all platinum players .
Foreign font support for Battle.net :
They will look into getting font support for the different versions .
Replay speed ( fast vs faster ) and its effects on game statistics like APM :
They actually were not aware of this problem but Dustin took note of it and will work to fix it right away .
As the Q&A session concluded we realized that it was time return to reality and go home .
The Aftermath
The adventure did n't end there for Day [ 9 ] and myself .
Day [ 9 ] really needed to get back to school because he had to present his final oral presentation in his night class .
As we got into the car in the parking lot , we realized that we were extremely low on gas .
We drove around for a long time trying find a gas station , even asking the car next to us as we were stopped at a red light .
He pointed us in the right direction and we were so happy to see the Shell gas station .
We turned so that we can be in a position to get into the parking lot …and we realize that we ’re now on the on -ramp to get onto I - 5 .
F M OL .
Anyway after a few more minutes of nervousness and car beginning to lose power we finally manage to fill up the car with a full tank of very much needed gasoline .
Unfortunately for us , I - 5 is the worst freeway in the world to be stuck on during rush hour traffic ( fellow SoCal residents will agree with me here ) and it took us much longer to get back to campus than to get to Blizzard .
Not only that , but President Barack Obama was at our school so half the roads around our campus were blocked off and we were stuck on the off - ramp about a half mile away from campus for about 30 minutes due to the diverted traffic .
Luckily for us , it all ended up well as Day [ 9 ] destroyed his oral presentation thanks to his public speaking practice through his show the
And with that we wrap up our coverage of Teamliquid ’s visit to Blizzard HQ 2010 !
We hope you enjoyed it !
- LosingID8 and Day [ 9 ]
This post was made by the Team Liquid Starcraft 2 Coverage Team .
For more of TL's coverage , please visit the Team Liquid Starcraft 2 Beta Page .
Single player basics :
After each single player mission you return back to the story mode origin , which will change throughout the game .
You can customize force before going into battle .
You can unlock different units ( such as the medic and firebat ) by playing missions .
You can make technology purchases ( for example , the combat shields for marines ) .
Each unit has a cheaper basic upgrade and then a much more expensive higher upgrade .
Mercenaries : Extremely high - end version of units that you already own .
You can use each mercenary once or twice each mission , depending on what mercenary it is .
When you purchase them in - game , they immediately arrive at the battle scene via drop pod .
Research : Missions have bonus missions ( for instance , kill a brutalisk or find hidden Zerg DNA on the map ) that gives you research points .
There are checkpoints at 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 research points .
At each checkpoint you have 2 choices of what you can research .
Once you research it , it ’s final .
You can not go back and change it .
TV news reports : Based on your actions in the game , there will be TV news reports that update the situation happening in the Starcraft 2 world .
Very cool feature .
Gameplay : Each mission is its own special gameplay mechanic .
They do n't want each one to be the same " jump in and kill the computer AI " mission .
Each mission will be very distinct from each other .
After Dustin Browder ’s presentation , the majority of the rest of the day was spent playing the single player campaign and the new challenge mode .
We headed up to the 3rd floor where they had 2 rooms set up with computers for the press and fansites to play !
Day [ 9 ] and I split up the single player mode .
I explored the different customizations , mercenaries , and the new challenge mode .
Day [ 9 ] tried some of the campaign missions , and I wrote down his opinions and impressions of the game as he was playing .
The single player interface is much different from that of SC1 or Battle .
net .
There are four different locations you can visit between missions .
The environments are interactive .
When you click on different characters and structures they react and talk with you , almost like how it would be in an RPG .
This is where you can select the planet and mission you will playYou can purchase upgrades for your units and buildings .
Level 1 is cheap , Level 2 is much more costly .
For example : Bunker : Level 1 : Projectile accelerator ( increase range by 1 ) Level 2 : Neo - steel bunker ( increase number of bunker slots by 2 ) Missile turret : Level 1 : Titanium Housing ( increase missile turret health by 75 ) Level 2 : Hellstorm Batteries ( additional volley of projectiles with each attack ) Units :
All of the following have 2 unique upgrades eachInfantry : Marine , Medic , Firebat , Marauder , and ReaperVehicles : Hellion and Diamondback You can buy mercenaries here3 types were unlocked : war pigs , devil dogs , hammer securities .
There were also some mystery locked mercenaries .
Mercenaries are upgraded or elite versions of units you already have , such as marauders .
Research technology
You get to research extra technology each time you collect a certain number of research points for completing extra missions within levels .
For example , when you have 15 points you can choose between scv-less refineries or double - pumping command centers .
Your choice is final , and can not be reversed .
Challenge mode is basically a set of single player UMS maps made by Blizzard and they test specific skill sets in SC2 .
In the current build , there are three different missions for three different difficulty levels to give us a total of nine .
Tactical Command : Send the right Terran counter units .
Protect three supply depots from waves .
Path of Ascension : Send the right Protoss counter units .
Protect three pylons from enemy waves .
For the Swarm : Send the right Zerg counter units .
Protect three spires from enemy waves .
Covert Ops :
You have a small force of terran specialists ( like ghosts ) and you kill as many units as possible in a given time frame .
Psionic Assault : Protoss version of above with high templars and sentries , except you have no time limit .
You just beat as many waves of units as you can .
Infestation : Zerg version with roaches and infestors .
Destroy as much of enemy base as you came before time runs out .
Harbinger of Death : PvT , you can only use hotkeys and have to kill as many units as possible before time runs out .
Opening Gambit : TvZ , build up a strong econ and large army while fighting off early attacks .
Aim is to optimize build order .
Rush defense : TvZ / P. Learn how to fight off rushes as a Terran .

Wild deer ' cause 74,000 accidents every year '
Wild deer cause 74,000 accidents on the roads every year , claims a study
The soaring numbers of wild deer are causing havoc on Britain 's roads , devastating ancient woodlands and ruining gardens , wildlife experts warned yesterday .
Conservationists say the UK's deer population has doubled since the 1970s and is now close to 2 million - a level not seen since the time of the Norman Conquest .
According to new figures from the National Deer Collisions Project , the animals cause 74,000 road accidents each year - and kill up to a dozen drivers and passengers .
Yesterday , Dr Jochen Langbein , co-ordinator of the project , warned that the number of accidents would rise unless the creatures were better controlled .
He said 100 people are injured and up to 12 killed each year when deer run into roads .
Last month an inquest heard how a father of two died when a deer crashed through his windscreen .
The animal had been hit by another vehicle near Basingstoke , Hampshire , pushing it into the path of his van .
Insurers pay out around £ 15 million a year to repair cars hit by the animals .
The worst accident blackspots are in the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex where more than 300 deer are hit by cars each year .
Accidents involving the animals are often serious because they leap up if they are startled while crossing roads .
Some scientists believe they see beams from headlights as solid objects and try to jump over them - ending up crashing into windscreens .
Since the 1970s deer numbers have been rising by three to five per cent a year , and most conservationists agree that 30 per cent of deer have to be shot each year to stop numbers going up .
The muntjac species is a particular nuisance .
Just 20 inches tall , they breed all year round and can be a massive pest for gardeners .
I wonder if that 67 % is an accurate percentage ?
impoosible aint gunna happen .
this is america love it or leave itsalutes * my theory , is thier are so many cultures here in america .
being around latinos , especially form guatemala and venezuela ... they all look for some white guy witha job to marry for legal residency , and businesses give them phony social security numbers .
talking time to time , they like it here , but dont really like us at all americans .
The reason thier here , si for a better life .. the dollar is worth so much more , and much more opportunitys here .
SO !
they all stay amongst themselves , watching out for eachother , not really caring so much about our laws or culture .
I wonder what nationalitys then , did foxnews talk too ?
people for INdia will side with eachother , lations will side with eachother , u get the point .
IF asking international people about banning the flag , thats not right or fair , as opposed to asking legal , tax paying AMERICAN citizens this question .
just specualtion *
Mr Halappa has denied the charge ( Photo : BK Ramesh )
A former minister in the government of India 's southern Karnataka state has been arrested after the wife of a friend accused him of sexual assault .
Haratal Halappa , former food and civil supplies minister in the state 's BJP government , denies the charge .
He says he is being framed by political rivals .
Mr Halappa resigned last week .
He surrendered to the police on Sunday .
Correspondents say the incident has embarrassed the BJP ( Bharatiya Janata Party ) government .
Mr Halappa had claimed some of his own party leaders are among those who want to frame him .
He said last week that he had resigned to save the government from embarrassment and vowed to clear his reputation if there was a " proper inquiry " .
The woman , who lodged a complaint against the minister , said the incident took place last November .
She said she and her husband were threatened by the minister and told to keep the incident secret .
" He tried to have sex with me by force .
I resisted ... When my husband returned home , he saw me crying .
He could not control his anger and beat him .
I beat him up too , " she said .
She said she was " scared " for her life if the government did not give her protection .
Mr Halappa will be produced in a court in Bangalore city on Monday .
The political process always manages to turn idealistic dreams inside out .
For an excellent example , look no further than the civil rights laws passed in the last 40 years .
For almost a century before 1964 , governments in many southern states forced segregation on the people .
Government prohibited companies from providing racially integrated facilities for their employees or customers .
Whites and blacks were forbidden by government to sit together in restaurants or to use the same restrooms and drinking fountains  and in many cases were forbidden to shop together or work together .
Civil rights advocates fought to repeal these state Jim Crow laws , but they failed .
So they appealed to the federal government , which responded with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
But this did n’t simply repeal state laws compelling segregation .
It prohibited racial segregation  voluntary or otherwise .
Overnight , what had been mandatory became forbidden .
Neither before nor after the Civil Rights
Act were people free to make their own decisions about whom they would associate with .
The civil rights movement was n’t opposed to using government to coerce people .
It merely wanted the government to aim its force in a new direction .
Although the activists believed coercion served the noble objective of bringing the races closer together , it was coercion nonetheless .
Rollback : Repealing Bi ... Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 1.28 Buy New $ 10.01 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
The Giant Begins to Grow
And coercive laws never stand still .
No matter what a law ’s backers say at the time of passage , the law always stretches in surprising directions .
The expansion occurs on at least two fronts :
The law almost always is enforced more broadly than intended ;
When government benefits one group , other groups are encouraged to seek similar benefits .
And this is what happened to the civil rights laws .
In the first regard , the bureaucrats and courts set out to enforce the laws zealously , seeking to root out any kind of discrimination  even though ending segregation , not discrimination , was the motive behind the original law .
Companies were ordered not to consider race in any way when making hiring decisions .
But usually the reasons for a business decision are hard to prove .
Unless a businessman is a noisy bigot , who can say whether racial discrimination has affected his decision to hire someone ?
To avoid having to read minds , the enforcers examined results to determine whether discrimination had occurred .
If you did n’t have a suitable racial mix in your workforce ( or even among your customers ) , you were assumed to be discriminating  and the burden of proof was on you to prove otherwise .
So an employer could avoid charges of discrimination only by , in fact , discriminating  by using quotas to assure that he hired the right number of people of the right races  even though the original sponsors of the law had sworn that quotas were no part of it .
The law against segregation had been transformed into a law requiring discrimination .
The law also encouraged other groups to demand similar coverage .
Once it was established that government should punish racial discrimination , the door was open to using government to punish anything similar .
If it ’s wrong for an employer , landlord , or organization to discriminate according to race , it must be just as wrong to discriminate according to gender .

So the coercion expanded to prohibit discrimination against women  and then religious believers , and then the elderly , and then people with children , and then the handicapped .
The New Aristocracy
Civil rights laws feed lucrative lawsuits .
So every imaginable group wants to be covered by the laws  to be eligible for generous settlements .
There ’s pressure to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual preference , weight , looks , drug use , illness , criminal record , citizenship , and many other categories .
Everyone wants to become part of the aristocracy .
And it is an aristocracy these groups are trying to join .
Once they ’re on the " A - List , " they have special powers .
They can sue anyone who refuses to hire them , to rent an apartment to them , or to sell his services to them  and maybe force him to pay thousands or millions of dollars in punitive damages .
No company can risk such a disaster by offending someone in the aristocracy  since almost any mistake might be considered evidence of discrimination .
For example , in 1993 six U.S. Secret Service agents sued the Denny ’s restaurant chain  complaining they received poor service because they ’re black .
And how do they know their color was the reason for the poor service ?
Because a group of white people entered the restaurant at the same time they did , and the white people finished their meals before the blacks received their first course .
To many people this was proof of discrimination .
Now , if you happen to be a white male , you ’ve probably never felt such an insult .
It ’s true you may have endured dreadful service in a coffee shop  perhaps many times .
A waiter may have refused to give you the time of day , lost your order and forgotten you were even in the restaurant , spent all his time flirting with a waitress , or refused to take care of you until he had phoned his bookie .
Fail - Safe Investing : L... Harry Browne Best Price : $ 4.28 Buy New $ 10.14 ( as of 11:10 EST - Details )
The family at the next table may have eaten an entire meal before anyone even asked for your order .
And so you passed the time counting the designs on the wallpaper .
But it is n’t called discrimination if you are n’t part of a group that ’s been certified as oppressed .
So you have to blame it on a bad - tempered waiter , an overcrowded restaurant , or poor management .
Since you are n’t part of the aristocracy , there ’s no chance you were insulted because of your race ( or your religion , handicap , or any other recognized status ) .
You were insulted just because you ’re you .
And your only recourse is to find a coffee shop that will treat you better .
The Denny ’s customers , however , could file a law suit  and they did .
To avoid a long , expensive trial and months of unfavorable news coverage , Denny ’s settled out of court and paid them $ 54 million .
1
Neither you nor I was in the Denny ’s restaurant that night .
And we are n’t mind readers .
So we do n’t know whether the waiter mistreated the Secret Service agents because of their race .
But we do know that if it ’s possible to get an enormous payoff for claiming discrimination , many people will try to get it  whether or not they actually suffer discrimination .
So we should n’t be surprised that so many accusations are made .
And with such rewards available for minor insults , it ’s not surprising that more and more groups demand to be covered by the law .
Absurdity Becomes the Law
The civil rights laws are supposed to end discrimination and segregation , and to promote harmony .
But coercion never produces harmony .
How harmonious are people who are being forced to act against their will ?
Most likely , those who are coerced will resent those who benefit from the coercion .
This sets group against group ; it does n’t bring them together .
And if we accept coercion for one purpose , we ’ll be asked to use it for others .
Even if you can say " No " to the other uses , some people will say " Yes , " and others will say " Yes , please , and make mine a double . "
The noble cause will be stretched further and further until it eventually becomes farce .
For example :
A Chicago company was hauled before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to explain why it failed to promote a woman who claims she was discriminated against because of the microchip in her tooth that allows her to communicate with others .
Then there ’s the man who sued his employer who fired him for bringing a gun to work .
He said he was covered by the Americans for Disabilities Act ( an outgrowth of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ) because he ’s under psychiatric care .
The case will be tried before a jury .
A 220 - pound woman has sued the Minnesota National Guard , claiming that its 155 - pound limit discriminates against her eating disorder .
2
In 1993 a married couple was ejected from an airliner ( before takeoff ) because they had screamed a string of obscenities at other passengers .
So they sued the airline , claiming it had discriminated against them as sufferers of a disease that makes them utter profanities .
3
Has the law really been stretched so far ?
No , it has been stretched even further .
In fact , it has been stretched all the way inside out .
The civil rights laws originated to end segregation of the races in the South .
But in 1992 a Florida court used these laws to award a white woman permanent disability benefits  ruling that her employer should have provided a segregated workplace to accommodate her fear of blacks .

Why Government Doesn&r ...
Browne , Harry Best Price : $ 18.46 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 12:05 EST - Details )
Although the decision seems absurd , something of the kind was inevitable .
If coercion is used to protect the feelings of black people , eventually it will be used to protect the feelings of white people as well .
Once government coerces on behalf of one group of " victims , " it will eventually swing the club on behalf of almost every imaginable group .
You ca n’t limit coercion to the uses you think are right .
So do n’t think of any of these cases as an example of a government program gone wrong .
Each is an example of a government program  period .
You ’re Not a Dictator
I ’ve used the Civil Rights Act as an example of the way a well - intentioned government program grows and causes far more problems than it solves .
But it is just one example .
All government programs expand to encompass the political demands of people who want to take advantage of its benefits .
And almost all government programs eventually do the opposite of what their original backers had asked for .
Whatever social reform you may envision , the version the government implements will be something completely different .
However lofty your purpose , it will be debased by compromises in the legislature , in the administration of the program by thousands of government employees , and in the settling of the inevitable disputes .
Not only that , the program is likely to grow far bigger and more complicated than what you wanted .
And someday it will evolve into a force opposite to your intentions .
You are n’t a dictator .
You ca n’t control the actions of politicians , bureaucrats , and judges .
Please remember that the next time you think some law will solve some great social problem .

The Best of Harry Browne
A November 2009 post on the Visual C++ Team Blog by Raman Sharma delved into the improvements Visual Studio 2010 was purported to have made to the “ Find All References ” feature of Visual Studio .
This feature is a must - have for any developer in almost any language .
As a project grows in size and complexity , it becomes a real chore to remember and locate exactly where a particular variable was defined – which is something that ’s quite useful to know .
According to the VC ++ blog post , VS2010 now uses a “ speed - mode ” by default to locate these references .
It ’s a bit less accurate in that it generates a lot of false positives , searching by name rather than by usage , but that this reduced accuracy comes with greater speed .
And the option remains to further filter out results by having the compiler and the intellisense databases resolve the actual results and determine whether or not they indeed reference the search term .
Except that ’s the way it ’s supposed to work .
In truth , that ’s not what happens :
1 ) Visual Studio 2010 ’s “ Speed Mode ” of Find All References is slower than it was in Visual Studio 2005 .
2) Visual Studio 2010 ’s “ Speed Mode ” not only generates extraneous false positives , it also fails to show items that do match the search term .
On any project of considerable size , “ Find All References ” will cause a hang of the Visual Studio 2010 user interface for up to a minute as it does nothing more than plain - text search for the selected variable or function .
It blocks the main user thread , it hangs the UI , and it takes forever .
Much longer than Visual Studio 2005 / 2008 did with its more accurate compiler - based variable references search .
And as for point 2 , the time - lapse screenshot below ( to show both the selection , the menu , and the resulting dialog ) should speak louder and clearer than a thousand words .
( Click the image for a full - size screenshot )
Unfortunately , Visual Studio 2010 seems to be exemplifying the ongoing trend at Microsoft of slowly giving less and less attention to C++ developers as they continue to push .
NET ( now at version 4.0 and growing strongly ) at the cost of everything else … while still refusing to embrace the .NET platform for their own technologies , leaving their once - content developer - base fighting against their own IDEs for life .
This is the first of several posts about Visual Studio 2010 , it ’s advantages , and its shortcomings .
We love Visual Studio and despite everything else , its still the best IDE out there and a damn good one at that .
But some things just need to be said in hopes that they will be addressed at some point in the future .
A " double - dip recession " makes no sense to the 76 percent of Americans who believe that the US economy remains in recession .
And indeed , I argued in Suppressing the Cognitive Dissonance of a Bogus Recovery that the " growth " touted by the mainstream media and the Central State propaganda machine is a mirage .
To the 24 % of the populace who believes the U.S. exited recession in fine fettle , I offer a " Two Scoop Special " : a Double - Dip recession is guaranteed for the following reasons :
1 . The Eurozone is heading into deep recession , taking U.S. corporate profits with it .
Three things are certain in the Eurozone : Austerity , higher taxes and more of each nation 's budget will be carved off to pay interest on their ballooning debt .
All three mean less money in consumers ' pockets , and in local government pockets .
Please see Why the Eurozone Is Doomed for more on the Eurozone 's structural problems .
2. China 's unprecedented bubble in credit and real estate will implode , taking down China 's economy .
Warning signs already abound : please see If China Stocks Lead U.S. Market , Look Out Below and China 's Towers and U.S. McMansions : When Things Fall Apart ( Literally ) for more .
China 's imploding debt / real estate bubble will cut its already meager imports from the U.S. and dismantle the illusion of " growth " ( note to economists : building 100,000 empty highrises is not " growth " ) that has enabled the commodity countries such as Canada and Australia to inflate new property bubbles at home .
3. Once China goes down , so do the housing bubbles in Canada and Australia , and the Asian economies which depend on sales to China for their own growth .
As those nations ' tumble into a bottomless pit of bubble - popping recession , their taste for American goods and services will plummet as well .
Good - bye , inflated Corporate - America profits .
China 's bubble deflating will be felt in Japan and the Southeast Asian " Tiger " economies , all of which will see their exports to China crater .
Since they are all merchantilist to the core , this drop in exports will push them into recession as well .
The highly popular fantasy that " emerging economies " will continue growing at insane rates forever will drop heavily into the dustbin of history .
If you have any doubt about this scenario , call up a chart of copper , which is generally considered a bellwether for commodities and the global economy .
Copper has crashed .
4. Local government in the U.S. will have to shed tens of thousands of jobs .
As Mish has repeatedly pointed out , public unions could avoid massive layoffs by slashing the pay of all public employees and trimming their pension plans and other ( in comparison to private - sector workers ) gold - plated benefits .
But the public unions seem bent on turning back the clock to 2006 : they are rejecting any meaningful cuts in pay or bennies , and they also want limited / zero job cuts .
That is n't possible .
Any politico so beholden to the State fiefdoms that he / she votes in taxes high enough to fund the public union fiefdoms will lose power this November .
States with 20 % unemployment cannot survive massive tax increases , on top of all the junk fees and hidden taxes which have already been imposed on a burdened public .
This realization is slowly going mainstream , for instance : The Bankrupting of America :
We have a ruinous collaboration of elected officials and unionized public workers .
The loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs ( and do n't forget those 1.5 million Census jobs are temporary ) will deplete the amount of income and borrowing power needed to sustain " consumer spending . "
5 . Bank reform will force layoffs and consolidation in the financial sector .
It 's been a tough year for the banks ; after all , U.S. commercial banks generated a record $ 22.6 billion in derivatives trading revenues in 2009 -- that 's commercial banks , not investment banks .
Aw , poor babies .
Reforms will eventually shutter many trading desks and curtail various high - labor gaming within the financial sector , triggering another round of layoffs .
More " jump , you f**kers " signs will appear on Wall Street .
6 . Housing 's bogus government - induced " rally " will implode .
Just scan patrick.net for dozens of stories outlining the implosion : mortgage applications are plummeting , building permits are plummeting , sales are plummeting , etc .
The Federal government essentially nationalized the entire U.S. mortgage market to save housing , and now that the Fed has announced an end ( or so they claim ) to their $ 1.2 trillion buying spree of toxic mortgages , then the Mortgage Emperor is revealed to have no clothing .
There is no private mortgage market in the U.S. anymore ; there are only the rotting carcasses of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , still soaking up tens of billions of dollars in tax money to sop up soon - to - default mortgages .
For an on - the - ground report from once - hot San Diego , check out the San Diego Housing Forecast : the values of pricey homes is still falling , and buyers are now scarce .
7 . The massive Federal bailouts accomplished nothing but propping up a rotten status quo for a year .
No new jobs were created ; what was " saved " by squandering trillions of dollars ?
The counterparties to AIG 's bad derivatives bets ; Goldman Sach 's ability to skim profits day after day , month after month , a housing market doomed to slide much further , destroying the trillions dumped in to prop it up , and and a handful of pork - barrel projects at the state and local levels .
Now the " stimulus " and bailouts are drying up , and we have nothing to show for it .
The bloated status quo cannot maintain its payrolls without the trillions in Federal largesse , and so payrolls and spending will fall throughout the status quo .
8 . The vaunted " recession - proof " sickcare industry will start shedding jobs as Medicare and other funding sources implode .
Texas doctors opting out of Medicare at alarming rate :
 This new data shows the Medicare system is beginning to implode ,  said Dr. Susan Bailey , president of the Texas Medical Association .
 If Congress does n't fix Medicare soon , there 'll be more and more doctors dropping out and Congress ' promise to provide medical care to seniors will be broken . 
More than 300 doctors have dropped the program in the last two years , including 50 in the first three months of 2010 , according to data compiled by the Houston Chronicle .
Texas Medical Association officials , who conducted the 2008 survey , said the numbers far exceeded their assumptions .
The largest number of doctors opting out comes from primary care , a field already short of practitioners nationally and especially in Texas .
Psychiatrists also make up a large share of the pie , causing one Texas leader to say ,  God forbid that a senior has dementia .
Once again , this should n't be news to oftwominds.com readers , as we addressed this trend back on April 10 , 2010 : The Politically Inconvenient Medical Realities of Opting Out .
Simply put , there is n't enough money in the known Universe to fund U.S. sickcare , and now the reality is bursting through the walls of denial and complacency .
The " recession - proof " sickcare ( a.k.a. healthcare ) system will start shedding jobs , not adding them , as the money dries up -- not just Federal money , but private insurance funding as well , as employers cut headcount and laid - off employees find they cannot afford COBRA coverage or sky - high private insurance rates .

There is a lot of information out there about the benefits of optimism in numerous areas of life .
The research shows that optimists are n’t necessarily blind to the world , seeing it with rose - tinted glasses , which is a common criticism of books and programs aimed at developing optimism in people .
In fact , optimism seems to be in many cases a highly desirable decision making or belief strategy .
And being optimistic implies a positive anticipation of a desired outcome ; sometimes when all the evidence points to a different one occurring .
Rather than writing the “ 10 steps to optimism ” , I want to look into this a little more deeply .
Why have we evolved the ability to think this way ?
Surely the best way to guide behaviour would be to hold beliefs that are as accurate as possible , and making decisions based on them .
I would have assumed that these would be the most accurate decisions you could make .
So you might argue that natural selection would tend towards accurate thinking , but this does n’t match up with the evidence base on optimism or other cognitive biases ( or simply the experience of being human ) .
To explain the ultimate origin of optimism , it is necessary to figure out whether having a system in the brain that allows for overly favourable perception or cognition can be beneficial to survival or reproduction , and also to see how the system would relates to other ideas in evolutionary theory .
To give a specific example , consider the tendency of men to overestimate the sexual interest of women ( 1 ) .
This is of course an adaptive strategy , because male reproduction is limited only by the number of partners they can meet , and since it costs little or nothing to ‘ try it on ’ , being optimistic and assuming the best means fewer missed opportunities .
Natural selection would therefore favour men who are optimistic about women ’s interest in them , as opposed to those with accurate perceptions .
This balance of costs and benefits is how optimism is said to have evolved .
In a situation where a caveman or cavewoman has to make a decision , but they are uncertain about the outcome , sometimes they are going to get it wrong .
But , is it more costly to make false positive errors , or false negative errors ?
This problem is called error management theory ( 1 ) , and it ties in nicely with the idea of positive illusions , which we ’ve discussed before in the context of relationships .
Taylor and Brown ( 2 ) propose that positive illusions help motivate people to pursue goals with a low objective level of success , such as the terminally ill individual whose positive illusion about the disease leads her to positive health behaviours .
In such a situation ( and in others ) , optimism and pessimism can lead to different negative outcomes – optimism might lead to wasting time and energy in pursuits that are not beneficial , and pessimism might lead to passivity and missing out on potential opportunities .
Reasoning forward we can see a route through which optimism can evolve in a world where the outcomes of decisions are often uncertain – if the cost of trying and failing is low ( compared to the benefit of succeeding ) , then optimism is the best strategy – better , even , than a decision that is made on accurate information ( 3 ) .
Coming back to increasing chances of survival and reproduction , we find that positive illusions tend to be aimed toward the self , and particularly about characteristics that other people find desirable – when asked about others , the illusions disappear ( 4 ) – with the exception of our positive illusions towards our romantic partners ; but we ’ve seen that these are ultimately self - serving as they help sustain the relationship .
Likewise , pessimism is thought to have evolved by the same pressure of natural selection , but this time acting on a different area of the brain .
This allows for variation in the things we can be optimistic and pessimistic about , depending on the particular situation ( see reference 3 for more info on this ) .

Fedora Summer Coding 2010 is looking for students
[ Announcements ] Posted Apr 8 , 2010 23:12 UTC ( Thu ) by jake
Fedora is sponsoring a " summer of code " - style program for students called Fedora Summer Coding , which is looking for student participants .
The ideas page is a little thin right now , but mentors have until April 14 to add to that list .
" We are rapidly constructing this summer coding program .
We know what we are doing , but because of timing , we are building the infrastructure , process , and requirements as we go .
It 's like moving in to a house while the scaffolding is still outside .
The Fedora Project makes it easy to do stuff like this , since the plumbing and stuff are already in place .
( Enough of that metaphor ? ) " .

Mr Palmer said an " emotional " response to whaling was unrealistic Allowing whaling nations to kill a limited number of the animals is the only way ensure control , New Zealand 's representative on the issue has said .
Former PM Geoffrey Palmer said attempts to reach a global deal on whaling would fail unless nations could compromise .
Australia , which wants a total ban on whaling , has expressed alarm at Mr Palmer 's comments , and said it could not back such a scheme .
Japan , Iceland and Norway together hunt more than 2,000 whales each year .
Mr Palmer , who represents New Zealand on the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) , said whaling nations had increased the size of their hunts in recent years .
Not all cultures or all nations see that issue the same way , and because of that you have to arrive at an international accommodation
Sir Geoffrey Palmer
Culture clash over whaling
Whale of a dilemma
But he said the main problem was that there was no effective way of controlling how many whales were hunted .
He said a compromise would lead to " a big reduction in the total number of whales killed compared with now " .
Mr Palmer said that if the IWC did not agree to a compromise when it meets in Morocco in June , all control over whaling could be lost .
" There is a big risk of that and I do n't relish it , " he said .
Japan has not stated publicly how far it is prepared to reduce the size of its annual Southern Ocean hunt .
' Awful alternatives '
Mr Palmer said that the " emotional attachment " to a total ban on whaling was unrealistic .
" There is a great deal of unhappiness in New Zealand about killing whales , and that 's true of other public opinions in many countries , " he said .
" But the truth of the matter is that not all cultures or all nations see that issue the same way , and because of that you have to arrive at an international accommodation under a treaty arrangement . "
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING
Under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat New Zealand 's Foreign Minister Murray McCully said he thought a compromise deal was worth making , saying that the alternatives to conducting further talks were " truly awful " .
New Zealand , Australia and Japan are members of a small group of countries that has been exploring the potential for a compromise for two years .
It faces a deadline of 22 April to come up with a submission to go forward to the IWC 's annual meeting in June .
But Australia , which has threatened to take Japan to the International Court of Justice if it does not stop whaling in the Southern Ocean , reacted angrily to the comments .
Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett said he was " alarmed and very concerned that New Zealand would support a proposal that is flawed and represents a huge compromise to pro-whaling nations " .
" Australia cannot support the compromise package now being discussed in the IWC , " he said .
Japan abandoned commercial whaling in 1986 after agreeing to a global moratorium but continues to target more than a thousand whales each year under the auspices of a scientific research programme .
Conservationists say the whaling is a cover for the sale and consumption of whale meat .
Iceland and Norway both " objected " to the moratorium - a permitted procedure under IWC rules - and also carry out annual hunts .

After the vets had been at the fence for around half hour or so , suddenly the police started to freak out .
Out of nowhere , they closed Lafayette Park - something none of us , including the mainstream media assembled there - had ever seen .
The police literally ordered the press to leave , and pushed all us back halfway to the end of the park , telling us the park was closed .
They were telling the police that they were being intentionally stopped from covering the story .
And they were .
It was interesting that the White House so freaked out this time around , when there were only six people on the fence , and the crowd was mostly tourists .
Last time , there were 200 raucous demonstrators watching and the police were n't worried at all .
It seems GetEqual got the White House 's attention .
Update 18 Apr. 2010 : A new version of the script has been released .

Sky sources understand Man City are in talks with Real Madrid over Fernando Gago and Gonzalo Higuain .
Talks begin over Higuain and Gago
understands Manchester City are in talks with Real Madrid over the possible signings of Fernando Gago and Gonzalo Higuain .
City are looking to strengthen their squad over the summer after agonisingly missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification this season .
They have identified a number of transfer targets and appear keen to strike a deal with Real for Higuain and Gago .
Higuain has enjoyed a stunning campaign at the Santiago Bernabeu , although Argentina coach Diego Maradona recently claimed that Real had not contacted him about a contract renewal .
Compatriot Gago , who was linked with a move to City in January , also established himself as a key member of Manuel Pellegrini 's team .
City would have to use all their financial muscle to prise the duo away from Spain but are understood to have entered negotiations with Real .
They are also thought to be in discussions with the representatives of Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko .
A rising tide .
The U.S. economy gained more jobs in March than any other month in the last three years , according to a government report released Friday .
The Labor Department said the economy gained 162,000 jobs in the month , compared to a revised reading of a 14,000 job loss in February .
That makes March only the third month of gains since the recession began .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a gain of 184,000 jobs .
But despite missing forecasts , the March number was generally not seen as a disappointment by economists , because revisions in January and February readings added a combined 62,000 additional jobs .
The unemployment rate remained stubbornly high , holding steady at 9.7 % , matching economist expectations .
"
The third increase in jobs in the past five months indicates that the labor market has begun to stabilize , " said Sung Won Sohn , professor at California State University Channel Islands .
" However , a sustained gain in employment is some time away .
" While the news was positive , there were a number of short - term factors that inflated the reading , including an addition of 48,000 by the Census Bureau as it geared up for the once - in - a - decade headcount of the U.S. population .
Some economists had feared that even more of March 's gain would be due solely to Census hiring , so the modest gain was viewed favorably .
March 's job gain was also bolstered by weather factors -- February 's numbers had been depressed by temporary job losses related to severe winter storms last month .
Still , the report was good news overall for an economy that has suffered a net loss of 8.2 million jobs since the start of 2008 , a month after the official start of the recession .
" Employers are n't looking at this and saying , great it 's over , I can go hire , " said Tig Gilliam , CEO of Adecco Group North America , a unit of the world 's largest employment staffing firm .
" But it 's moving in the right direction .
" Christina Romer , chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , pointed out that the first quarter had an average monthly job gain of 54,000 , compared to an average monthly job loss of 753,000 in the first quarter of 2009 when the Obama administration first came to office .
But she said more needed to be done .
" It is obvious that the American labor market remains severely distressed , " she said in a statement .
" It will take sustained , robust employment growth to bring the unemployment rate down .
Further targeted actions to spur private sector job creation are critically needed to ensure a more rapid , widespread recovery .
" Perhaps the most encouraging sign in the report was that the gains were spread across various sectors of the economy -- 60 % of industries added jobs -- the most widespread gains seen across the economy in four years .
That rising tide of hiring brought relief to some long - suffering sectors of the economy .
Construction added 15,000 jobs , the first increase of any kind in the sector since June 2007 .
Manufacturing also added 17,000 , with 2,500 of that gain coming at auto plants and their parts suppliers .
Retailers added nearly 15,000 jobs and leisure and hospitality accounted for 22,000 more jobs .
"
In a word , it 's a resilient recovery , " said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of Economic Cycle Research Institute .
" All these areas are stabilizing and moving forward .
That 's the hallmark of a recovery .
" While the report was good news for job seekers , it also contained sobering readings for the depth of labor market pain that has built up over the last two years .
There are 15 million people counted as unemployed , down 607,000 since the record high hit in October , but still the fifth highest total on record .
The average time those unemployed have been out of a job now stands at just under eight months , a record - long duration .
" For those laid off , unemployment is stretching longer and longer and putting severe distress on families , " said Christine Owens , executive director of the National Employment Law Project , a New York - based advocacy group for the unemployed .
" The long slog of looking for work and surviving on jobless benefits is going to continue for millions of Americans .
" Almost 1 million more have become so discouraged that they 've stopped looking for work altogether and are no longer counted in the unemployment rate .
But the number of discouraged job seekers fell by just over 200,000 since February , an indication that job seekers are also sensing an improving market and are again looking for work .
" Right now is the time when you 're not wasting effort to hit the pavement , " said Achuthan .
" Employers do want to hire .
" The average hourly work week crept up 0.1 hours in March , an indication that employers are restoring the hours of employees who had their shifts and pay cut during the recession .
But there are still 9.1 million people working part - time jobs who want to be working full - time , up more than 250,000 since February .
The average hourly wage slipped 2 cents to $ 22.47 .
But the longer average work week lifted the average weekly paycheck by $ 1.57 to $ 763.98 .
Taken as a whole across the economy , that will put more money into consumers ' pockets and help spur more spending , which in turn should produce more hiring into the future .
That 's how Rand Paul , son of Ron Paul , was posed in the headline of a Salon piece Friday by Ben Van Heuvelen : " the Tea Party 's Obama . "
Paul is a uniter of the libertarian / Tea Party right , Van Heuven wrote :
The political genius of Paul is his ability to cultivate a narrative that speaks to all strains of the Tea Party movement at once .
After all , the libertarian purists who loved Ron Paul 's dissident truth - telling are not natural allies of the Limbaugh Dittoheads who dismissed him as an eccentric .
He sings his libertarianism in the key of Glenn Beck - and he is writing a Republican playbook for the tea party era , turning grassroots energy into electoral power .
Now , less than a week before the primary , polls show Paul 's lead over Grayson approaching 20 points .
He also leads both of his potential Democratic challengers in the general election polling .
Paul is currently poised to crush his opponent , Secretary of State Trey Grayson , in tomorrow 's Kentucky GOP primary , despite -- or perhaps due to -- the establishment backing that Grayson enjoys .
There is an Obama parallel in there , as the current president defeated the ultimate Democratic establishment candidate in Hillary Clinton , who had a network of supporters from her husband 's days as president -- eight years of favors curried , endorsements lined up -- at her back .
It 's definitely premature to declare anyone the Tea Party 's Obama .
The Tea Party movement has n't put anyone in the White House yet , though it is likely that in 2012 it will put someone on the GOP ticket , at the very least as VP .
Until that happens , we wo n't know who will be that Obama - esque uniter , able to unite existing GOP coalitions while at the same time turning out new or marginalized voters .
But the Tea Party movement has created its own new set of stars -- up - and - coming politicians who have vaulted from anonymity to the national spotlight .
Amid a heavy demand for anti-spending and anti-bailout rhetoric , it 's worth noting that none of them had to vote on the 2009 TARP bailout -- just as President Obama did n't have to vote on Iraq as a state senator ( and indeed spoke out against it ) -- and they 're free of that baggage that now weighs on incumbent senators who were exposed to that hydrant of pressure from Henry Paulson and the Bush administration 's Treasury Department .
The star politicians delivered , so far , by the Tea Party movement are : Rand Paul , Marco Rubio and Scott Brown ( he was backed by Tea Partiers , even though he's not actually one , himself ) .
Consequential candidates who were born of Tea Partyism but have n't attained stardom , yet , are : Sharron Angle ( if she wins the Nevada GOP primary and defeats Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the fall ) , Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater ( who will run against each other in Utah 's GOP Senate primary , having both taken down Republican Sen. Bob Bennett at the state convention with Tea Party support ) .
Between now and this time next year , it seems one of these politicians will have been further apotheosized by Tea Partiers , and could end up as a presidential candidate or VP pick in 2012 .
If that happens , the movement will truly have its Obama .

Editor 's note : On Sept 27 2017 , Hugh Hefner , the Founder of Playboy , died at his home in Los Angeles , surrounded by his friends and family .
He was 91 years old .
Upon hearing the news the editors at IrishCentral could n't help but recall when our girl , April Drew , visited the famed Playboy Mansion in 2010 to meet Mary O'Connor ( RIP ) , who ran the show for the Playboy boss .
Enjoy !
It 's not every day a gal from County Kerry gets to visit the bright lights of Hollywood for the purpose of work , and it ’s certainly not every day she gets an opportunity to visit the house that most men dream about in their sleep , a house that only allows drop - dead gorgeous girls through its doors , and a house that if the walls could talk the stories would be something else .
An opportunity arose a few weeks ago that I could n’t turn down .
After seeing a few episodes of the hit E! television show " Girls Next Door , " which focuses on the day - to - day life of Playboy creator Hugh Hefner and his buxom young girlfriends , I became familiar with Mary O’Connor .
O’Connor [ who sadly passed away in 2013 ] is Hefner ’s personal secretary , friend , housemother , and confidant and works in a tiny office in the upstairs of the Playboy Mansion .
She has been a loyal servant to him for more than 40 years .
O’Connor intrigued me even more because she looked so like anyone ’s Irish grandmother , and , as it turns out , O’Connor ’s own grandmother is from Co. Tyrone .
Elated and still in disbelief after securing an interview with her , I enlisted the companionship of Irish Voice resident photographer Nuala Purcell to document our trip .
Picture the scene – the driveway is super narrow , made for little BMWs and Porsches .
Our big roaring truck just made it up the winding road ( signs saying “ Playmates at Play ” welcoming us ) and into the front yard of the most famous house in America – well , in California anyway .
As we took in our surroundings briefly we were met with the mansion ’s press guy , Rob , who kindly gave us a tour of the downstairs before introducing us to the woman of the hour .
Of course , I ’d seen all the rooms before .
Hef ’s lounge where he catches up with friends and watches movies , the breathtaking foyer adorned with pictures and cut-outs of Hef and his girlfriends , and the dining room where we conducted our interview with 82 - year - old Mary O’Connor .
Although extremely modest and camera shy , O’Connor kindly agreed to do this one - off interview .
She rarely gives interviews , so we were very pleased when she allowed us into her world .
As previously mentioned , O’Connor ’s grandmother , Sarah Brigham Taner , emigrated with her siblings from Co. Tyrone in the mid-1800s for a better life in the U.S.
They settled in Pittsburgh , and soon enough Sarah fell in love and married a German music professor who lived in America .
O’Connor ’s father was born in 1896 .
The family moved around a lot and it was in Berlin , Germany that O’Connor ’s parents met .
“ My mother was studying music in the Berlin Conservatory of Music when she met my father , ” said O’Connor .
O’Connor ’s parents finally moved back to the U.S. and O’Connor was born in Chicago as Mary Feuchtinger .
The O’Connor part comes from her fourth husband .
Before ever working for the founder of Playboy Enterprises , O’Connor had an exciting life .
She married a man 11 years her senior when she was just 18 .
“ That was a big age difference when you are as spunky as I was , ” O’Connor joked .
After her first marriage came to an end O’Connor married a further three times , each relationship ending .
However , a little more than 20 years ago , she finally met her soul mate , Captain Bob .
I remember him from the show .
They are a great couple .
O’Connor moved out to California in 1953 after she separated from her second husband .
“ I always wanted to come here .
My father ’s sister was a screenwriter and involved in the movies and that fascinated me , ” she said .
But it was n’t the movies that caught O’Connor ’s attention .
It was the speed of a car .
It was through her second husband that she fell in love with the buzz surrounding racecar driving .
Not only did O’Connor promote road races across the country , she competed several times in them .
As O’Connor ’s life became much more hectic after she was thrown into the life of playboy bunnies , Hugh Hefner and the excitement and glamour associated with the world of being sexy and rich .
While serving on the board of advisors of a hospitality magazine she was approached by another board member to take up the position of manager of the Playboy Mansion in Chicago .
After some careful thought , O’Connor agreed to go working for one of the most powerful men in the U.S. and has n’t looked back since .
“ I moved to Chicago in 1969 and at the time there were 24 bunnies living in the house , ” she said .
“ It was a whole new experience and a whole lot of fun . ”
In 1971 Hef purchased the mansion in LA and for a few years , O’Connor traveled between the two until he finally moved himself and his bunnies to sunny California .
“ I had great fun furnishing this house , ” O’Connor told us as we looked around .
“ It was so much fun going into a store when money was n’t an issue . ”
O’Connor has been with Hef for more than 40 years and has no intention of retiring .
She works 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , sometimes seven days a week .
It was Hef ’s birthday on the Friday after we were at the mansion .
O’Connor and her staff were busy preparing a big bash and then it was off to Las Vegas with the whole lot of them ( including O’Connor ) to continue the celebrations .
As for the " Girls Next Door " show , O’Connor said that she was n’t very fond of the idea of being featured on camera every day when she came to work , but she said after a while she became used to it .
O’Connor ’s day consists of sitting in her office and spending hours meeting with Hef to discuss business issues .
“ I see more of Hef than I do of anyone else , ” she laughs .
O’Connor maintains a strong relationship with several of the previous playboy bunnies , some of whom were Hef ’s girlfriends .
This is particularly true for her relationship with Kendra Baskett .
O’Connor has appeared on the show " Kendra " several times .
“ The girls know I ’m here if they need me , ” she told us , showing her motherly side yet again .
O’Connor is no stranger to Ireland .
In 1986 she visited the south with Captain Bob and thoroughly enjoyed it , but had one regret .
“ We did n’t get to go up to the north of Ireland where my family are from , ” she said disappointedly .
However , O’Connor plans to go back for a little over a week next year with her friend Jason McGimpsey and explore the land of her grandmother .
“ That ’s really important to me , ” she said .
“ I ’m really looking forward to that trip . ”
As our interview came to a close I asked Rob if Hef was anywhere in the mansion .
He was !
Upstairs in his sleeping quarters .
He normally does n’t rise till after 11 a.m. , at which time he joins O’Connor in her office to run through the day ’s business .
We left the Mansion that day feeling excited but also proud that an Irish American woman is part of the reason
Hef is so successful , grounded and so full of devilment .

An increasing number of states are considering banning bisphenol - A ( BPA ) from food and drink containers in response to growing concerns that the chemical causes cancer , heart disease , diabetes , and other serious illnesses .
Despite disregard by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) about its potential dangers , states like Connecticut and Massachusetts have passed legislation outlawing the chemical from being used in food and drink containers .
For years , the FDA has denied that BPA is dangerous , even when numerous studies have indicated that the chemical leeches into food and disrupts hormones .
After being pressed to reevaluate its position by the National Toxicology Program and others who disagreed with the FDA 's position , the agency reluctantly agreed to take a look at the evidence once more .
Last month , the FDA announced that it now has " some concerns " about BPA 's effect on brain development in children and babies , but would not admit that the chemical is dangerous or unsafe .
The agency has stated it will not issue a ban on BPA , even though it agrees that the chemical is likely problematic .
Spokesmen from the American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) agreed with the FDA 's decision , insisting that a ban on BPA is unnecessary .
According to ACC , research indicates that BPA is perfectly safe .
Industry rhetoric is not enough to convince the public , however , which is increasingly opposed to the chemical 's use in food containers .
Many manufacturers have responded to the outcry over BPA by voluntarily eliminating it from their containers and noting on labels that the products are " BPA free " .
In addition to Connecticut and Massachusetts , the city of Chicago and Suffolk County , New York have also banned BPA from food containers as has the entire nation of Canada .
New Mexico , Maryland , Missouri , California , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Vermont , and Washington , D.C. , also have pending legislation to ban the chemical as well .
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , plastic containers whose bottoms bear a 3 or 7 in the triangle recycling logo likely contain BPA .
Those with a 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , or 6 most likely do not .
HHS also recommends not using plastic containers that are scratched since they are more likely to leech toxic chemicals .
It is always good practice not to put really hot liquids into plastic containers , since doing so can encourage leeching of chemicals like BPA .
Freezing plastic bottles is also a bad idea because it can encourage leeching as well .

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - A
Dutch sex shop will be giving away 2,000 “ Pope condoms ” this weekend in a dig at the Roman Catholic Church .
De Condoomfabriek ( The Condom Factory ) said it wanted to make a point about sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted pregnancies and the Vatican ’s opposition to contraceptives .
The condom wrapper carries the image of a papal figure with an unmistakable general likeness to Pope Benedict , though the figure ’s face is removed .
It bears the words “ I SAID NO !
We say YES ! ” framing the papal image .
The suggestion of a “ pope condom ” caused a diplomatic row last month when Britain ’s Foreign Office was forced to apologise for a memorandum by a civil servant that suggested Benedict launch a papal - brand condom on his pending visit to the UK .
The South Dakota Republican gubernatorial primary is being held in a couple weeks .
One of the candidates is Gordon Howie , the Tea Party candidate .
He does n’t have the most money , but he thinks he still has a fighting chance :
Of the five GOP candidates for governor , the two with all the money are Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard and Senate Majority Leader Dave Knudson .
They ’re the establishment candidates that Howie hopes to topple .
In order to get support , what is Howie doing ?
He ’s telling churches to endorse him ( PDF ) .
Of course , that would be illegal , since they are tax - exempt and are therefore not allowed to endorse one candidate over another … but Howie just ignores all that “ Constitution ” stuff :
“ For too long , our spiritual leaders , have been neutralized in the public square , ” Howie says .
“ Pastors and their congregations have been muzzled on Sunday mornings by the threat that their taxation status requires an enforced silence on who to vote for , and why .
This is simply not true .
Government regulation has no place behind the pulpit . “ …
“ Our spiritual leaders , the men and women we trust most on matters of morality and responsible citizenry have every right to offer biblical guidance in helping their flocks align their spiritual values in choosing candidates who will return righteous rule to government , ” Howie says .
Citing the “ Pulpit Initiative of 2008 , ” a faith - based challenge to perceived Internal Revenue Service authority to regulate politically - oriented speech from the pulpit , Howie has scheduled Sunday morning and Wednesday night appearances at church services across South Dakota , to expose the truth regarding ministerial freedom in political endorsement .
Pastor Scott Craig , who participated in the original ‘ Pulpit Challenge , ’ publicly endorsed John McCain over Barack Obama in the 2008 election .
He says a church ’s tax status should not be allowed to serve as bribery in silencing their political message .
“ The IRS basically tells churches , we will give you a financial kickback , if you give up your freedom of speech , ” Craig says .
“ I was born an American citizen , guaranteed the right to freedom of speech .
I did n’t give up my rights when I became a pastor . ”
Neither Craig nor Howie understands the law .
Churches can endorse whomever they want — no one is stopping them — but in exchange , they have to pay taxes .
It ’s as simple as that .
But you will never see churches jumping on that bandwagon .
Their deal right now is too sweet to give up .
Pastor Craig can endorse whomever he wants in his capacity as a private citizen … but that changes when he steps into the pulpit .
One pastor has already listened to Howie and endorsed him in church :
On May 15 , the Rev. H. Wayne Williams , pastor of Liberty Baptist Tabernacle in Rapid City , officially endorsed state Sen. Gordon Howie in his bid for governor during a church service .
Williams did not return a message last week when called by the Journal , but few here expect that his church will face repercussions from the Internal Revenue Service as a result of his sermon .
Federal tax code prohibits all tax - exempt organizations , including charities and churches , from endorsing any candidate for public office .
Meanwhile , other pastors took a more responsible route :
Not from the Rev. Jeff Otterman , pastor of St. James Lutheran Church in Belle Fourche , however .
He called Howie ’s Pulpit Challenge irresponsible and insulting to his congregation .
“ The people at St. James are very well - read , and they do n’t need their pastor telling them how to vote , or who to vote for , ” Otterman said .
“ To back one candidate over another seems far - reaching and could alienate a congregation rather than create opportunity for growth . ”
At Synagogue of the Hills , vice president Wayne Gilbert said its congregants hold divergent political opinions but all agree not to jeopardize the synagogue ’s tax - exempt status over political activity .
“ I do n’t think any responsible leader of a tax - exempt religious group would be willing to risk tax - exempt status to endorse a candidate , ” Gilbert said .
Gilbert said the idea “ that I should be instructed by a religious leader as to which candidate has the moral or religious high ground is personally insulting to me .
I expect religious leaders to offer me insight and guidance into spiritual and moral matters , not secular and political ones . ”
Even Howie ’s own pastor has said he wo n’t endorse him from the pulpit because that ’s an irresponsible thing to do .
… “ I have encouraged our people to be participants in the political arena and showed them the scriptures that back it up , ” [ Bishop Lorenzo ] Kelly said .
“ But I have not from the pulpit endorsed him .
I would n’t do that .
I would n’t put my church in jeopardy of anything . ”
Howie is going to put every church out of business if they listen to him .
They ’ll be rightfully sued by every church / state organization in the country .
The IRS will be all over it .
Hmm … Maybe South Dakotans should be voting for this guy .
He sounds like an anti-theists ’ best friend .

New credit card and overdraft restrictions will save U.S. consumers from being charged at least $ 5 billion in fees this year alone at the largest U.S. retail banks and credit card companies , a USA TODAY analysis reveals .
The analysis — based on institutions ' own estimates — comes during a year when new rules are kicking in to address unfair credit card rate increases and steep bank overdraft fees .
It highlights the sizable dent these rules will have on an industry blamed for pushing consumers deeper into distress during the recession .
In recent years , banks made it easier for consumers to overdraw their bank accounts and raised credit card fees and rates .
As consumer outcry swelled in the recession , Congress passed a credit card law and the Federal Reserve issued a regulation to crack down on banks ' aggressive overdraft policies on debit cards .
Lawmakers hope the restrictions will mean much - needed savings for consumers , boosting spending and the economy .
Indeed , new data show the measures are their " own little stimulus for the economy , keeping billions in the pockets of consumers rather than in profits gained from deceptive practices , " says Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , co-author of card reform signed into law last year .
USA TODAY 's analysis relies on institutions ' projections of what they will give up under the new rules , gathering data from the 10 largest retail depository institutions and the 10 largest holders of credit card receivables , as tracked by SNL Financial .
Of the 10 institutions with the largest amount of credit card receivables , seven gave estimates about the credit card law 's impact .
In all , the issuers — Citigroup , Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo , U.S. Bancorp , HSBC North America and Barclays Group US — will forgo at least $ 2.5 billion to $ 3.1 billion in fees just in 2010 .
Also , seven of the top 10 depositary institutions expect to take a combined $ 2.4 to $ 2.6 billion hit under the new overdraft rules and banks ' voluntary policy changes .
R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers predicts that institutions will give up at least $ 9.9 billion in revenue a year due to the credit card law .
Moebs Services estimates that the industry 's overdraft revenue will shrink by $ 1.9 billion , to $ 35.2 billion this year .
While some institutions are moving away from overdraft coverage , others are boosting fee income with new programs , Moebs says .
Scott Talbott , a senior vice president at the Financial Services Roundtable , warns that the total cost of the credit card and overdraft regulations will be even higher than bank estimates , which " do n't take into account the loss of services and credit that would be available . "
Two North Korean agents have been arrested after sneaking into South Korea disguised as refugees to assassinate an octogenarian former secretary of the North Korean Workers ' Party Central Committee who defected to the South in 1997 .
The agents , from the Reconnaissance Bureau of the North 's People 's Armed Forces , had orders to kill Hwang Jang - yop ( 87 ) , prosecutors said Tuesday .
The National Intelligence Service and the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office on Tuesday arrested Maj. Kim Myong - ho ( 36 ) and Maj .
Tong Myong - kwan ( 36 ) on a warrant from the Seoul Central District Court .
According to prosecutors , Kim and Tong arrived in Yanji in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in the Chinese province of Jilin after crossing the North Korea - China border in November last year .
They met up with other North Korean agents and received mobile phones and operational funds at a liaison office of the Reconnaissance Bureau there .
Afterwards , they pretended to defect and traveled all the way to Thailand with the help of local brokers .
They were arrested by Thai police and handed over to the South Korean embassy .
Deported from Thailand , they arrived in South Korea in January and February and were questioned by the NIS .
But their stories did not check out since both gave false names and places of birth .
Under interrogation , they confessed to being spies .
Prosecutors said the two admitted to having orders from Kim Yong - chol , the bureau director , to file a report about Hwang Jang - yop 's activities including the location of his home , and to cut off his head .
They were ordered to escape to the North Korean embassy in a third country and await further instructions if they failed to accomplish their mission .
The Reconnaissance Bureau was launched last year , when several agencies dealing with operations against t he South were merged .
Kim and Tong were chosen as special agents in 2004 and received intensive training to infiltrate South Korea and assassinate VIPs , prosecutors said .
The two refused to say what else they had planned , but the NIS is investigating if there are any other North Korean spies already active in the South they were to contact here .

Under that approach , the commission maintained that it had “ ancillary authority ” to oversee certain aspects of broadband service even though it did not fall under the strict rules that give the commission the power to regulate telephone service .
Image Great Works Internet in Biddeford , Me. The F.C.C. will subject the Internet to some of the same oversight as phone services .

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said in April that the F.C.C. ’s classification of broadband service as an “ information service ” rather than as a “ telecommunications service ” did not allow it to sanction Comcast for slowing or blocking access by its customers to an application known as BitTorrent , which is used to share large data files including video and audio .
The new approach , which the F.C.C. called a “ third way , ” would rely on a legal theory that recognizes the computing function and the broadband transmission component of retail Internet access service as separate things subject to different regulation .
The approach is similar to one that the commission has used to regulate aspects of wireless communications service , Mr. Genachowski said .
And it relies in part on a 2005 United States Supreme Court decision , National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services .
In that case , the court said that Congress gave the F.C.C. the authority to decide how it would regulate Internet service .
But the F.C.C. ’s new approach also relies in part on a dissenting opinion in that case , written by Justice Antonin Scalia , which said that the “ computing functionality ” and the broadband transmission component of Internet access service were different things , each subject to differing levels of regulation .
Austin C. Schlick , general counsel for the F.C.C. , said in a statement that “ the upshot is that the commission is able to tailor the requirements ” of its regulatory authority “ so that they conform precisely to the policy consensus for broadband transmission services . ”
Telecommunications companies said they believed the F.C.C. had overstepped .
The National Cable and Telecommunications Association , with whom the F.C.C. sided in the Brand X case , called the decision “ fraught with legal uncertainty and practical consequences which pose real risks to our ability to provide the high - quality and innovative services that our customers expect . ”

It takes two to make a baby , or maybe three or four if you 're worried about passing on select genetic diseases .
Doctors in the United Kingdom announced Tuesday that they had successfully genetically engineered embryos from parents who would have passed on mitochondrial DNA mutations by conceiving the old - fashioned way .
The researchers reported the feat in the journal Nature .
" Because of the lack of a viable treatment for these patients , and their families , preventing the transmission of mtDNA [ mitochondrial DNA ] disease is a priority , " Douglas Turnbull , of the New Castle Institute for Brain Aging and Vitality and colleagues wrote in the article .
Mitochondria can be found in the cytoplasm of the cells , where they produce most of the cells energy .
They have their own DNA distinct from the 50 - 50 mother - father split in the nucleus of a cell .
A child directly inherits only its mother 's mitochondrial DNA , and in some cases will be certain to inherit a debilitating mitochondrial mutation .
Turnbull and his colleagues took 80 donated fertilized eggs that were unsuitable for in vitro fertilization , removed the nuclei and replaced the nucleus from the unhealthy egg with mutated mitochondria into the healthy egg .
All of the genetically engineered zygotes soon developed into blastocysts and were destroyed within 6 to 8 days .
But conceivably , couples could go through the same process and get a baby that looks like them but does n't carry the mother 's mutated mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm of their cells .
A different method with similar goals was completed with monkeys in 2009 .
The authors of the paper argue that while some couples who know they are at risk for passing on mitochondrial diseases can already get genetic counseling or expect only mild problems from mitochondrial mutation , other families are more unfortunate .
" In some families , mtDNA disease can affect multiple family members with catastrophic consequences , " wrote Turnbull and colleagues .
" For these families , pronuclear transfer may be an option that mothers who carry mtDNA mutation may consider . "
Mitochondria are responsible for generating 90 percent of the body 's energy , according to the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation , and can still function even with some level of mutation .
But health problems begin when 60 percent of a person 's mitochondrial DNA is mutated , according to the authors of the paper .
Only a few thousand children are born with a mitochondrial disease each year in the U.S. , according to the Cleveland Clinic .
But by age 10 , many more children -- about one in 4,000 -- will develop a mitochondrial disease .
When mitochondria malfunction .
they can starve cells , or interfere with crucial chemical reactions within the body .
Muscle weakness and pain , gastro - intestinal disorders and swallowing difficulties , poor growth , cardiac disease , liver disease , diabetes , respiratory complications , seizures or visual / hearing problems can all be caused by a mitochondrial disease .
Some people with a mitochondrial disease can live into adulthood , but many die within a few years .
Now That We Can Do This , Should We ?
Although ethicists have come out in droves against genetic engineering at the level of a fertilized egg , some say the serious nature of these incurable diseases and the function of mitochondrial DNA should make this case of genetic engineering an exception .
" For these diseases that are very debilitating or devastating it makes sense , " said Art Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
Starting with James Watson , who helped discover DNA 's double helix , Caplan said geneticists often speak against " germ- line " engineering -- meaning genetically manipulating sperm , eggs or zygotes to change a human being .
" As recently as 2000 we had a large number of genetic experts saying , ' Do n't do that , ' " said Caplan , speaking about an Asilomar Symposium on Science , Ethics and Society where 247 scientists signed a position statement against it .
But Caplan argues in the case of mitochondrial DNA , " There 's no intent here to interfere with the key genes that make us who we are .
We 're in the battery pack of the cell .
" I also think there 's a little bit of coyness about it .
Someone donating mitochondria .
Is that person a third parent ?
I do n't think so , " said Caplan .
" I do n't think this is a big issue . "
Not all agree .
David Prentice , a member of the lobbying organization Family Research Council , argued that replacing mitochondrial DNA was no different than other genetic engineering efforts .
" There are significant ethical concerns with this technique , " said Prentice .
" It involves cloning and germline genetic engineering of humans , requires destruction of young human embryos to create the recombined embryo , and is a eugenic technique that manufactures children . "
Whatever the merits or disadvantages , both Prentice and Caplan agree that the technique would be legal in the United States .

John Lennon urged us : " Imagine there 's no heaven / It 's easy if you try / No hell below us / Above us only sky . "
Yet the religious are n't turning to Lennonism any faster than Leninism .
Today , according to a new book by Lisa Miller , Newsweek 's religion correspondent , 81 per cent of Americans and 51 per cent of Brits say they believe in heaven – an increase of 10 per cent since a decade ago .
Of those , 71 per cent say it is " an actual place " .
Indeed , 43 per cent believe their pets – cats , rats , and snakes – are headed into the hereafter with them to be stroked for eternity .
So why can't humans get over the Pearly Gates ?
In reality , the heaven you think you 're headed to – a reunion with your relatives in the light – is a very recent invention , only a little older than Goldman Sachs .
Most of the believers in heaven across history would find it unrecognisable .
Miller 's book , Heaven : Our Enduring Fascination with the Afterlife , teases out the strange history of heaven – and shows it 's not what you think .
Heaven is constantly shifting shape because it is a history of subconscious human longings .
Show me your heaven , and I 'll show you what 's lacking in your life .
The desert - dwellers who wrote the Bible and the Koran lived in thirst – so their heavens were forever running with rivers and fountains and springs .
African - American slaves believed they were headed for a heaven where " the first would be last , and the last would be first " – so they would be the free men dominating white slaves .
Today 's Islamist suicide - bombers live in a society starved of sex , so their heaven is a 72 - virgin gang - bang .
Emily Dickinson wrote : " ' Heaven ' – is what I can not Reach ! / The Apple on the Tree / Provided it do hopeless – hang / That – ' Heaven ' is – to Me ! "
We know precisely when this story of projecting our lack into the sky began : 165BC , patented by the ancient Jews .
Until then , heaven – shamayim – was the home of God and his angels .
Occasionally God descended from it to give orders and indulge in a little light smiting , but there was a strict no - dead - people door policy .
Humans did n't get in , and they did n't expect to .
The best you could hope for was for your bones to be buried with your people in a shared tomb and for your story to carry on through your descendants .
It was a realistic , humanistic approach to death .
You go , but your people live on .
So how did the idea of heaven – as a perfect place where God lives and where you end up if you live right – rupture this reality ?
The different components had been floating around " in the atmosphere of Jerusalem , looking for a home " , as Miller puts it , for a while .
The Greeks believed there was an eternal soul that ascended when you die .
The Zoroastrians believed you would be judged in the end - time for your actions on earth .
The Jews believed in an almighty Yahweh .
But it took a big bloody bang to fuse them .
In the run up to heaven 's invention , the Jews were engaged in a long civil war over whether to open up to the Greeks and their commerce or to remain sealed away , insular and pure .
With no winner in sight , King Antiochus got fed up .
He invaded and tried to wipe out the Jewish religion entirely , replacing it with worship of Zeus .
The Jews saw all that was most sacred to them shattered : they were ordered to sacrifice swine before a statue of Zeus that now dominated their Temple .
The Jews who refused were hacked down in the streets .
Many young men fled into the hills of Palestine to stage a guerrilla assault – now remembered as the Hanukkah story .
The old Jewish tale about how you continue after you die was itself dying : your bones could n't be gathered by your ancestors anymore with so many Jews scattered and on the run .
So suddenly death took on a new terror .
Was this it ?
Were all these lives ending forever , for nothing ?
One of the young fighters – known to history only as Daniel – announced that the martyred Jews would receive a great reward .
" Many of those who sleep in the dust shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt , " he wrote and launched us on the road to the best - selling 1990s trash 90 Minutes in Heaven .
Daniel 's idea was wildly successful .
Within a century , most Jews believed in heaven , and the idea has never died .
But while the key components of heaven were in place , it was not the kumbaya holiday camp it has become today .
It was a place where you and God and the angels sat – but Jesus warned " there is no marriage in heaven " .
You did n't join your relatives .
It was you and God and eternal prayer .
It was paradise , but not as we know it .
Even some atheists regard heaven as one of the least - harmful religious ideas : a soothing blanket to press onto the brow of the bereaved .
But its primary function for centuries was as a tool of control and intimidation .
The Vatican , for example , declared it had a monopoly on St Peter 's VIP list – and only those who obeyed their every command and paid them vast sums for Get - Out - of - Hell - Free cards would get them and their children onto it .
The afterlife was a means of tyrannising people in this life .
This use of heaven as a bludgeon long outlasted the Protestant Reformation .
Miller points out that in Puritan New England , heaven was not primarily a comfort but rather " a way to impose discipline in this life . "
It continues .
Look at Margaret Toscano , a sixth - generation Mormon who was a fanatical follower of Joseph Smith in her youth .
Then she studied feminism at university .
She came back to her community and argued that women ought to be allowed to become priests .
The Mormon authorities – the people who denied black people had souls until 1976 – ordered her to recant , and said if she did n't , she would n't go to heaven with the rest of her family .
She refused .
Now her devastated sisters believe they wo n't see her in the afterlife .
Worse still , the promise of heaven is used as an incentive for people to commit atrocities .
I have seen this in practice : I 've interviewed wannabe suicide bombers from London to Gaza to Syria , and they all launched into reveries about the orgy they will embark on in the clouds .
Similarly , I was once sent – as my own personal purgatory – undercover on the Christian Coalition Solidarity tour of Israel .
As we stood at Megido , the site described in the Book of Revelation as the launchpad for the apocalypse , they bragged that hundreds of thousands of Arabs would soon be slaughtered there while George Bush and his friends are raptured to heaven as a reward for leading the Arabs to their deaths .
Heaven can be an inducement to horror .
Yet there is an unthinking " respect " automatically accorded to religious ideas that throttles our ability to think clearly about these questions .
Miller 's book – after being a useful exposition of these ideas – swiftly turns itself into a depressing illustration of this .
She describes herself as a " professional sceptic " , but she is , in fact , professionally credulous .
Instead of trying to tease out what these fantasies of an afterlife reveal about her interviewees , she quizzes everyone about their heaven as if she is planning to write a Lonely Planet guide to the area , demanding more and more intricate details .
She only just stops short of demanding to know what the carpeting will be like .
But she never asks the most basic questions : where 's your evidence ?
Where are you getting these ideas from ?
These questions are considered obvious when we are asking about any set of ideas , except when it comes to religion , when they are considered to be a slap in the face .
Of course there 's plenty of proof that the idea of heaven can be comforting , or beautiful – but that does n't make it true .
The difference between wishful thinking and fact - seeking is something most six - year - olds can grasp , yet Miller – and , it seems , the heaven - believing majority – refuse it here .
Yes , I would like to see my dead friends and relatives again .
I also would like there to be world peace , a million dollars in my current account , and for Matt Damon to ask me to marry him .
If I took my longing as proof they were going to happen , you 'd think I was deranged .
" Rationalist questions are not helpful , " announces one of her interviewees – a professor at Harvard , no less .
This seems to be Miller 's view too .
She stresses that to believe in heaven you have to make " a leap of faith " – but in what other field in life do we abandon all need for evidence ?
Why do it in one so crucial to your whole sense of existence ?
And if you are going to " leap " beyond proof , why leap to the Christian heaven ?
Why not convince yourself you are going to live after death in Narnia , or Middle Earth , for which there is as much evidence ?
She does n't explain : her arguments dissolve into a feel - good New Age drizzle .
True , Miller does cast a quick eye over the only " evidence " that believers in heaven offer – the testimonies of people who have had near - death experiences .
According to the medical journal The Lancet , between 9 per cent and 18 per cent of people who have been near death report entering a tunnel , seeing a bright light , and so on .
Dinesh D'Souza , in his preposterous book Life After Death , presents this as " proof " for heaven .
But in fact there are clear scientific explanations .
As the brain shuts down , it is the peripheral vision that goes first , giving the impression of a tunnel .
The centre of your vision is what remains , giving the impression of a bright light .
Indeed , as Miller concedes : " Virtually all the features of [ a near - death experience ] – the sense of moving through a tunnel , an ' out of body ' feeling , spiritual awe , visual hallucinations , and intense memories – can be reproduced with a stiff dose of ketamine , a horse tranquilliser frequently used as a party drug . "
Is a stoner teenager in a K - hole in contact with God and on a day - trip to heaven ?
Should the religious be dropping horse dope on Sundays ?
But Miller soon runs scared from the sceptical implications of this , offering the false balance of finding one very odd scientist who says that these experiences could point beyond life – without any proof at all .
But even if you set aside the absence of even the tiniest thread of evidence , there is a great conceptual hole at the heart of heaven – one that has gnawed at even its fondest believers .
After a while , would n't it be excruciatingly dull ?
When you live in the desert , a spring seems like paradise .
But when you have had the spring for a thousand years , wo n't you be sick of it ?
Heaven is , in George Orwell 's words , an attempt to " produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of something that had only been valuable because it was temporary " .
Take away the contrast , and heaven becomes hell .
And yet , and yet ... of course I understand why so many people want to believe in heaven , even now , even in the face of all the evidence , and all reason .
It is a way – however futilely – of trying to escape the awful emptiness of death .
As Philip Larkin put it : " Not to be here / Not to be anywhere / And soon ; nothing more terrible , nothing more true " .
To die .
To rot .
To be nothing .
We would n't be sane if we did n't seek a way to leap off this conveyor - belt heading towards a cliff .
So yes , there is pain in seeing the truth about Heaven – but there is also a liberation in seeing beyond the childhood myths of our species .
In The Epic of Gilgamesh , written in Babylon 4,000 years ago , the eponymous hero travels into the gardens of the gods in an attempt to discover the secret of eternal life .
His guide tells him the secret – there is no secret .
This is it .
This is all we 're going to get .
This life .
This time .
Once .
" Enjoy your life , " the goddess Siduri tells him .
" Love the child who holds you by the hand , and give your wife pleasure in your embrace . "
It 's Lennon 's dream , four millennia ahead of schedule : above us , only sky .
Gilgamesh returns to the world and lives more intensely and truly and deeply than before , knowing there is no celestial after - party and no forever .
After all this time , ca n't we finally follow Gilgamesh to a world beyond heaven ?

Crystal structure of the yeast Sac1 protein , left , and rotated 90 degrees , right .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
For the first time , researchers -- all Cornell scientists -- have characterized the structure of a protein that belongs to certain enzymes that are essential for proper functioning in all life forms , from yeast to humans .
The enzymes , belonging to the so - called Sac family , are involved in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking .
Scientists have found that when the gene that expresses Sac enzymes is deleted in animals , the animals die , and mutations of related genes in humans lead to cancers and such neurodegenerative hereditary diseases as Charcot - Marie - Tooth Type 4J ( CMT4J ) and Lou Gehrig 's disease .
Researchers from Cornell 's Weill Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology , reporting online in the Journal of the European Molecular Biology Organization , have characterized for the first time the crystal structure of the Sac1 protein in yeast .
Yeast serves as a model organism for all cells ; most of the 6,000 genes in yeast are also found in humans .
The Sac1 protein in yeast is a progenitor for related Sac proteins also found in plants and animals .
Understanding the Sac1 protein's structure opens the way for experiments that may reveal how these fundamental enzymes interact with cell membranes to enable essential cellular processes , which could also lead to drugs that target related diseases .
" This enzyme was first discovered in 1989 , but no one had seen the atomic structure of this protein , " said Yuxin Mao , an assistant professor of molecular biology and genetics and the paper 's senior author .
Andrew Manford , a graduate student in the lab of Scott Emr , director of the Weill Institute , is the paper 's lead author .
" Others have tried , but this is the first time " the protein 's structure has been revealed , said Mao .
Much like an on and off switch , pathways that signal cells to divide , migrate or transport materials in and out of the cell are often activated by attaching a phosphate group to proteins or lipids ( a process called phosphorylation ) and similarly deactivated by the removal of the phosphate group .
A class of enzymes called phosphatases mediates the removal of phosphates , and the Sac family of enzymes the Cornell researchers studied are lipid phosphatases .
Such diseases as CMT4J and Lou Gehrig 's disease occur when Sac family phosphatases fail to function properly , leading to a buildup of a group of phosphorylated lipids .
Mao and colleagues determined the structure by growing Sac protein crystals , which allowed researchers to view a protein 's atomic structure through X - ray diffraction .
Mao's lab used Cornell 's synchrotron to solve the crystal structure of the Sac1 protein at an atomic resolution of less than 2 angstroms ( two ten- millionths of a millimeter ) .
" This opens up biochemical studies of how these enzymes function -- it 's a breakthrough in this direction of study , " said Mao .
" And it helps our studies of other members of the Sac family . "

Part of the Daily Telegraph 's website has been hacked , apparently by people in Romania who were aggrieved at its identification of " gypsies " and " Romanians " .
Its " Short Breaks " and Wine And Dine sections were both hacked , with the Short Breaks site still up at 12.55 pm today , with a picture of a Romanian flag claiming to be for the " Romanian National Security " , some comments in Romanian and the remark in English at the bottom that " Guess what , gypsies are n't romanians , morons . "
It also links to a Russian site which plays an MP3 called The Lonely Shepherd .
Sunbelt Software , which first noticed the hack , said that it had alerted the Telegraph when it noticed the hack .
The method used to hack into the site is not known .
Chris Boyd , a researcher at Sunbelt , said that a translation of the text from the page says that the hackers are " sick of seeing garbage like this ... calling us Romanians ' gypsies ' . "
It also attacks Britain for " broadcasting shitty TV programs like Top Gear " .
But Boyd said that the group is apparently unknown even among Romanian hackers – suggesting that it may be one person with a grievance against the Telegraph .
In March 2009 the Telegraph 's system was also hacked , exposing the email addresses of registered users on part of its site .
That hack also seems to have been done by a Romanian hacker – suggesting that the site has become a target .
A later posting in May on the Hackersblog site suggested that there was a weakness on the Telegraph site that allowed it to be hacked repeatedly .

PR2.0 : Re-Defining Society
The incredible opportunities for social and ecological Change are already the defining characteristics of Our Times .
If our Species has ever had the chance to make Choices , then this is it .
We can either cower in a nurtured need consume familiar goods and services , or we can shed some of th manufactured artifice that fuels our Consumer driven trends and values .
Bringing us to this point in history .
The early 21st Century has dumped some pretty big choices in terms of what sort of Species we ’d like to turn out to be .
It ’s time for Humanity to take stock of itself , and set some sustainable priorities for the Future .
Hardcore Urban Cyclists are naturally and keenly aware of the harsh realities of the road , and the sky , and most things in between , as a simple matter of survival .
This is just as an effect of riding in and consequently fairly realistic about subjects like Consumption and Consumerism …
This inate self - awareness of our place in Society might result from biking among the dangers of cars , and breathing the toxic results of such easy access to dirty energy , and all the excess that flows out from that mindset .
Perhaps .
So we ’re each in our own way , and to varying degrees sharing our collective human experience , even though larger forces are defining not only the circumstances that make up the urban cycling experience , but also how Motorists and Pedestrians will choose to perceive these , and how they fit into the bigger ecological picture .
As Consumers in a rather Media literate and socially savvy Mass Market , it ’s still surprising to realize how much of our perceptions are shaped not just by Ad driven marketing , but also from an editorial channel for stories prepared and constructed to satisfy the needs of Public Relations that speak for entire industries as well as the corporate pillars that support them .
Issues that foment our Public Perceptions according to that which best represents the true and underlying objectives of the institutions and corporate structures that construct our visible Society as we see it .
Larger interests wishing to shape our Public Opinion on a much wider range of issues than we ever realize in the moment .
Consider perceptions around the recent case of Michael Bryant ’s deadly run-in with a Cyclist …
PR was clearly and immediately at work in the Micheal Bryant case , and it was then widely reported that the prestigious Navigator Inc was not just behind the handling of Bryant ’s public image , it was front and center in it ’s efforts to do so .
Curiously , the one role out of so many served by PR which is most often recognized by the Public is the role of “ Crisis Management ” expertise – usually applied when dealing with the fallout and shifting Public perceptions that become unsettled around negative events of course .
Ironically , this savvy public sense of PR being at work represents a conspicuous visibility that is actually the LAST thing that most seasoned PR practitioners would ever desire when trying to manage a crisis .
Consider the aftermath of the Deep Water Horizon disaster , where we ’re seeing countless mentions in the Media of the ongoing PR work that we ’re now supposed to see as a Public Communications “ Service ” , rather than simply associating all the official news releases as “ damage control ” , or ‘ spinning ” of corporate interests .
Since there seems to be a schism between what is , and what PR would like to see , perhaps we would benefit from a quick review of the historic role of Public Relations in modern Society … Before proceeding .
This trend to a more overt style of PR has been widely criticised by PR experts for going against the traditional standards of their field , yet these now is being increasingly embraced by an industry that is itself going through it ’s own painful evolutions , along with the Mainstream Media outlets that it serves .
This surprising change is being attributed to a newly emerged philosophy called PR2.0 ( yes , another mock ‘ upgrade ’ ) that publicly espouses a radical shift from a central authoritarian broadcasting model , to a more peer - to - peer driven model that leverages an aire of “ open ” communications through the powerful reach of Social Media – and is supposedly being integrated ( either visibly , or surreptitiously ) into our Media landscape on a more human level .
Considering this realization that PR firms now have a stated and vested interest in spreading info through our Social Networks , perhaps we should pause to re-consider the power of propaganda , rather than reflexively denying its existence in what we steadfastly consider our Free Society .
While Mr. Bryant spent the night in jail , the initial news around this story was about the aggressor Darcy Sheppard , his well publicized dispute with his girlfriend earlier that evening , and many reactions about how the police were remiss in their duties to keep a potential menace off the roads .
Whether the gathering and distribution of these facts was the result of crafted PR , or simply the result of astoundingly incisive investigative journalism and lightening fast TV reporting , is now irrelevant since the results are identical .
What was also reported was that Mr. Bryant had engaged the services of a PR firm called Navigator , and therefore all these facts were simply homogenized into each report on an equal basis of fair disclosure .
The immediate hiring of a PR firm is n’t surprising to anyone , especially since Bryant certainly has the resources to get this sort of help , but it obviously and instantly polarizes the Public .
Suddenly the side stories about drunkenness , other altercations that night , and a criminally checkered past seem like news - plants , rather than simply reading as facts .
Mr. Bryant is associated with the type of people who can also afford the very best lawyers , and thus can buy the very best judicial outcomes possible , while flexing public opinion along the way .
In short this plays into all the public fears about an unfairly stacked system , and unfortunately the PR industry ( due to some shameless self - promotion by Navigator ) was now dragged down into this bottomless mess as well .
For no matter what the outcome of this matter is , the Public will only remember that a powerful man was either charged or acquitted , and that he used PR to achieve the best possible results in what is now seen as a heinous crime by most average people …
Regardless of the outcome … Because ( for better or worse ) freely distributed images will always speak louder than professionally prepared words .
Once statements like the following are out on the Internet , there is no measure of PR that can ever take them back …
Perhaps however , a truly good PR firm could foster alternate views of the issues and arrange followup television interviews with these witnesses to discuss a “ bigger picture ” on the war between Cyclists and Motorists , or perhaps make them minor celebrities in a Populist movement towards Citizen based justice , or even just a segment about the absurd / unbelievable things that roadwork crews see and hear about on the streets .
Maybe I just have n’t looked hard enough , but I ’ve yet to see a PR firm create a truly engaging and viral meme for public consumption , and it is likely that in the future , such creativity will likely be sourced from the entrenched and obviously commercial interests of Ad Agencies instead .
Perhaps ,
Advertising will be the industry that consumes all Marketing budgets ultimately , and the Consumer will just tune everything out that is n’t packaged as Entertainment , and we can just forget about any real progress as a Society , or Civilization .
Clearly , I digress .
Sorry
At the current rate , it seems like the most promising aspects of PR are indeed at risk of being assimilated into other fields though , if the Public continues to be taught not to trust PR work .
As a result of the Bryant affair , many PR experts ( anonymously voiced to the Media ) that they are critical of the way Navigator inserted themselves so conspicuously in the case , handing out press releases and generally letting it be known that they were now in charge of Mr. Bryant ’s communications .
Quite obviously , most PR executives strive for invisibility at a time of crisis , they said .
“ People are always suspicious they ’re being played or manipulated , so it ’s probably not a good idea to confirm it for them , ” said one senior PR expert .
Daniel Tisch , president of Argyle Communications , was quoted saying that Navigator ’s conspicuousness helped fuel a predictable controversy , one that reinforced a narrative of haves and have - nots – the rich former attorney - general with high - priced PR juxtaposed with a poor , dead victim with no voice at all .
“ You always want good PR , but you never want your PR to become the issue , ”
– Daniel Tisch , Argyle Communication
When a well read and respected newspapers like the Globe clearly spells out the procedural details of the entire process for damage control used in these cases , it further cements public perceptions about PR , and entrenches a belief that PR firms will always prefer to act behind the scenes , because visibility would somehow blow their cover , and ruin their desired results .
In all but the most heinous cases of personal damage control for wealthy individuals , such guiding principals for invisible professionalism , where the PR never openly steps into the limelight would conceivably be a disastrous precedent to base general PR methods upon in the future .
Because not only are markets increasingly savvy about 3rd party associations , and representations , but because the future of excellent PR should in fact be founded upon the complete and polar opposite of covert back - room shenanigans and machinations .
As many pundits have stated in their views of the ( so called ) PR 2.0 revolution , we need to put the “ Public ” back into Public Relations !
When Comcast got caught blocking some BitTorrent connections a few years back , the issue was n't just one for the FCC ; it also went to court , where customers sued Comcast over the practice .
That class action suit reached the settlement stage back in December 2009 , but the man who discovered the P2P blocking is asking users to opt out .
Robb Topolski helped bring Comcast 's practices to light , and he's not pleased about the proposed settlement .
Under the terms of the deal , which have not yet been approved by the judge in the case , you could be eligible for a whopping $ 16 from Comcast .
You qualify if you were a Comcast customer who used " the Ares , BitTorrent , eDonkey , FastTrack , or Gnutella P2P protocols at any time from April 1 , 2006 to December 31 , 2008 " and / or used " Lotus Notes to send emails any time from March 26 , 2007 to October 3 , 2007 . "
( Some Notes traffic was apparently blocked inadvertently by Comcast 's system . )
In order to qualify for the cash , you need to sign up at the official settlement website and provide your Comcast account number .
According to Topolski , though , it 's a bad deal and you should opt out of the settlement , thus preserving your rights for future litigation .
Here 's why :
You paid about $ 50 a month for the service , and the amount that Comcast stands to return is up to about 50 ¢ per month for each month that it blocked traffic — just 1 cent on the dollar !
That does n’t begin to compensate for the value of the service that Comcast secretly took back .
If that tiny amount of money is compensation , then there is no penalty to Comcast for interfering with its customers , for failing to disclose it , for repeatedly lying about it , and for taking so long to stop it !
The settlement was reached under the assumption that the FCC would still oversee Comcast .
With Comcast ’s victory over the FCC 's authority , there is nothing to stop Comcast or any other ISP from again interfering with your Internet communications .
We asked Comcast for a response to Topolski's campaign , but have yet to receive a response .
Opt -outs have to occur by May 13 , as do objections to the settlement .
Such class action suits often produce little of value for affected consumers , but they can generate plenty of cash for the law firms that handle them .
In this case , the lawyers plan to ask the court for $ 3 million in fees and expenses .
EDIT 11th Nov 2010 : Since this article was first published , Heidi has revealed her true colours .
It ’s very sad , but I ’m leaving the article up for purposes of clarity .
Please read here after you ’re done : https://howgoodisthat.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/the-latest-video-from-qualiasoup-is-excellent/#comment-6673
It ’s easy to forget , sometimes , that the radical lunatics we spend so much time trying to publicly shame only represent a tiny percentage of the wider Christian community .
That ’s why I should probably apologies for not spending a little more time now and then telling you all about some of the non-crazy Christians out there , who take an interest in science and rationalism and do understand many of the cogent arguments put forward .
Heidi , twitter name @heidiraff , first came to my attention when she agreed to take part in a podcast with myself and two other non-theists .
She immediately impressed me with her attempts to remind her fellow Christians on the panel of what Jesus is actually said to have taught , as opposed to their sometimes rather selective interpretation of the New Testament — and how , to them , it somehow justifies teaching people things that are n’t true .
She did this in a non-confrontational way and also managed to remain respectful of the opinions expressed on my side of the debate , even though we strongly disagree in some key areas .
The podcast was hosted by Juanita Berguson ( @JuanitaBerguson ) a self - confessed ‘ Kingdom Capitalist ’ who sells a particularly weird blend of Jesus and anti-science , ‘ New Age ’ spirituality .
Heidi was as disgusted at the way myself and the other atheists on the panel were treated by Juanita and her business partners at the time .
Readers will recall , when myself and @antitheistangie took objection to Juanita silencing our microphones before we ’d been allowed to answer some serious allegations of “ struggling with the format ” , Juanita ’s puppy dog Paul Collier decided to leave some rather choice comments on her behalf .
So when Heidi was again invited to take part in another of Juanita ’s podcasts she did so with some reticence .
What happened next was both sad and also rather predictable .
Heidi writes :
Last Sunday , I get this message from Juanita .
She tells me that she has this wonderful Christian scientist .
He ’s going to be on the show and she ’ll let him give a talk and then allow atheists to ask him questions .
I thought , wow , pretty cool .
I ’m thinking it ’s gotta be someone with the genome community … but stupidly , I did not ask about his credentials .
I just assumed that Juanita had a good person , especially because she said this guy was a very good friend of hers .
It never crossed my mind that he ’d be crazy .
So then … I go on Twitter for about 2 - 3 hours , and I ’m hyping it like crazy .
I probably hit up about 20 different atheists I know , and I ’m telling everyone that this scientist is going to be on and it ’s going to be a really great show , etc .
Then … the guy started talking .
My stomach literally dropped and I got so dizzy .
I have all these atheists pinging me on Twitter and sending me DMs saying , “ What the heck , Heidi ?
Why would you promote this guy ? ”
And I ’m totally mortified , so I explain that I did n’t know .
To demonstrate that I meant business , I hung up my line and then sent out messages on the atheist hashtag , saying I was sorry that I had wasted everyone ’s time and that I did n’t know that the “ scientist ” was going to be like that .
As if that was n’t bad enough Juanita then started to private message Heidi , accusing her of “ bashing her guest ” and “ supporting the atheist cause ” .
That ’s right folks , as soon as you call someone out for talking nonsense , unless you fall in - line and say nothing , you ’re on “ their side ” .
Now as if it was n’t wonderful enough that , as you can see from her own blog , Heidi really is very much into Jesus and not at all on anyone ’s “ side ” , her distain for charlatans who speak on her behalf does n’t simply stop there .
Regular readers are familiar with my on - going campaign to publicly ridicule Joe Cienkowski — a twitter evangelical who spouts spurious nonsense about how , in his book ( there ’s your first clue ) he can “ prove evolution is a lie and the religion of atheism ” .
See the last week ’s previous blog entries for more background .
Now , I have to say up - front , although it did n’t directly involve Heidi , I am proud to say I first found out about Joe ’s latest exploits directly from her .
So sickened was she , that Joe presumed to preach on behalf of Christianity that the only way to show the strength of your faith , is to encourage others to believe in things that are n’t true , that she blogged a great example of the difference between people who are genuine in their religious conviction and people who try to exploit it , after the screen - grab opposite began to circulate twitter last evening : christiansafehouse.blogspot.com
Originally posted by @jeanybeany80 , the only thing more amusing than seeing the self - same physical evidence Joe repeatedly asserts as invalid in his Jihad against rationalism , logic , free inquiry and intellectual honesty , is that his dual identity as both a paragon of virtue and a sleazy letch was apparent to anyone from the first moment they first encountered him .
That inner dialogue between intuition and reason , which the Joe Cienkowski’s of this world insist is unattainable to those of us with no illusions about ‘ spirituality ’ or ‘ supreme moral authority ’ told all of us , Christian and atheist , that there was something not quite right about @JoeCienkowski from the moment he appeared .
And what do you know , we were right .
Now , how does this affect my reviewing his book , when it arrives ?
It does n’t .
The planned video series will go ahead — and I just wanted to close by addressing some of the concerns of those of you who are saying that feeding the troll is just giving him what he wants .
I agree that , under normal circumstances , this is good advice .
However , if Joe was pushing a book about how he can “ prove with scientific evidence ” that black people are intellectually inferior to white people , or that — as it is decreed in 1st Timothy , that women should be subservient to men and learn in silence , society would shun and discredit him with the sort of deafening silence some people are advocating .
But if we continue to afford religious lunatics some kind of wild card right , to assert equally nonsensical things about the teaching of science as a large group of people in society once did about race and sex , then we ’re not silencing them at all — we ’re allowing them to continue unchallenged .
So , I will still be asking those of you interested in following the video series ( when the book itself actually arrives ) to donate to UNICEF to off - set the cost of the book itself ten times over and I will still be twittering and blogging , reddit’ing and YouTubing as much attention in the general direction of @ JoeCienkowski as I possibly can , because I genuinely believe the only way we ’re going to win against these people is in the broad daylight of reason and truth and with a little help from our non-crazy Christian friends .

Dr. Ergun Caner , the president of Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary , has been a rising star on the Religious Right , entertaining audiences at major Religious Right gatherings with his hip , irreverent stories about his upbringing as a radical Muslim and his conversion to Christianity .
Just this week , his story was featured on Focus on the Family ’s broadcast , “ From Jihad to Jesus . ”
Turns out , according to a growing chorus of critics – many of them Southern Baptists and other Christians – Caner has apparently been lying for years about his childhood and his life story .
It ’s hard to even summarize the extent of the deceptions being described by his critics , but they include his claims to have grown up in Turkey and to have personally involved in Islamic Jihad , when court records from his parents ’ divorce place him in Columbus , Ohio when he was just a few years old .
Check some of the critical websites for voluminous debunking of Caner ’s colorful ( and apparently fanciful ) stories about learning about America through TV broadcasts in Turkey and more .
Some charges are even more directly related to his ministry , such as his claims to have debated top Muslim scholars around the world .
Caner ’s critics say there ’s no evidence of those debates .
These are no vague or reckless charges , but carefully documented exposes that draw from Caner ’s sermons , speeches , and online videos , and other public records .
Liberty does n’t seem to have responded publicly , but recently posted a revised version of Caner ’s bio with disputed claims removed .
Some of Caner ’s critics are willing to forgive him , but only if he owns up to his massive deceptions .
Meanwhile , Caner and his supporters have been trying to get his critics to shut up .
Caner himself has pulled the Religious Right ’s favored religious persecution card , reportedly saying in a memo to his Liberty colleagues , “ I never thought I would see the day when alleged ‘ Christians ’ join with Muslims to attack converts . ”
Meanwhile , others are starting to raise questions about the extent to which Ergun ’s brother Emir , who heads a Baptist college in Georgia , may have assisted in Ergun ’s deceptions , whether actively or by passively allowing false claims to go unchallenged .
It does n’t look like Liberty University is going to be able to shove this under the rug .
Stay tuned .
Baptist Leaders Plan to Cut Ties With Georgia Church With Female Pastor Rev. Mimi Walker said she 's saddened by Baptist leaders ' conservative thinking .
April 1 , 2010  --
The co-pastor of an Atlanta Baptist church said she has no interest in stepping down , even though state and national leaders threaten to cut ties with her congregation because it is led by a woman .
" I know this is hurting people , so I 'm saddened , " the Rev. Mimi Walker said .
" I 'm not so much offended but saddened for the path they 're taking . "
Walker and her husband , the Rev. Graham Walker , co-pastors of the Druid Hills Baptist Church for two years , were told in late January that the Georgia Baptist Convention would recommend " defellowshipping " the Walkers ' church unless Mimi Walker stepped down or the church admitted that her husband was more senior than she .
The couple , backed by their congregation of about 100 active members , refused .
The Georgia Baptist Convention " would n't do it if they did n't think it was helping their cause somehow , " Walker said .
That cause , she said , is following a conservative set of regulations , adopted by the national Southern Baptist Convention in 2000 , that include doing away with women in leadership positions .
Defellowshipping means the Georgia Baptist Convention would no longer accept the church 's donations for mission work and that the church would no longer be welcome to use GBC resources for things like Sunday School materials and ministry conferences .
" Our first indication was in December they had just done the same to First Baptist Church of Decatur , " she said .
A local newspaper reporter , she said , told them GBC officials were saying " we would be next . "
The Rev. Julie Pennington - Russell , pastor of the First Baptist Church of Decatur , Ga. , said the Southern Baptist Convention 's policy toward women in leadership positions " hobbles the effectiveness and vitality of the church . "
Her church was defellowshipped by the convention last year over the same issue .
" A lot of unrepeatable time and energy went into the creation and adoption of this policy , " she wrote in an e-mail .
" It just seems so peripheral and small - visioned compared to the life - affirming work that God is doing in every corner of the world "
Leaders from the Georgia Baptist Convention , one of 42 state conventions under the Southern Baptist Convention , are saying little about the recommendation , made formally two weeks ago .
The GBC has 3,600 affiliated churches in Georgia with an estimated 1.2 million parishioners .
There are about 42,000 churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention .
" The GBC has never been opposed to women serving in ministry positions other than pastor , " convention executive director J. Robert
White said in an e-mailed statement .
" We are keeping faith with the Baptist Faith and Message with regard to women serving as pastor . "
GBC spokesman Eddy Oliver told ABCNews.com that he was unsure how leaders were made aware of Mimi Walker 's position at Druid Hills .
" We do n't keep track of every single pastor , " Oliver said .
Roger " Sing " Oldham , spokesman for the Nashville - based Southern Baptist Convention wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com that " I would think the majority of Southern Baptists view the ordination of woman as a modern cultural innovation that is at odds with both scripture and Christian history and would affirm this action by the Georgia Baptist Convention . "
But Pennington - Russell said she 's confindent many would believe otherwise .
" Druid Hills has been making a difference in the Atlanta community and in the world for a long , long time , " she said .
" The Georgia Baptist Convention may be finished with them , but God did n't get that memo . "
Strict Southern Baptist Bylaws Discourage Women Leaders
A formal decision will be made regarding Druid Hills at the GBC 's annual meeting in November .
It 's a meeting the Walkers plan to attend .
" It 's not that we want to fight it as much as we are supposed to have a right ... to speak to it , " she said .
" I do n't think it will change their minds , but hopefully it might inspire some women who are struggling in Southern Baptist churches . "
Walker said she sees that struggle often at Mercer University 's McAfee School of Theology , where both she and her husband teach .
Under the more conservative tenets now favored by Southern Baptist leaders , she said , " women should never be over men , teaching in the church . "
That line of thinking comes from a choice to take a much more literal view of scripture , including a letter the apostle Paul wrote to Timothy saying women should n't speak so much .
But Walker said she does n't subscribe to that kind of interpretation .
Neither does the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship , a group that has grown to about 1,800 churches since its inception in 1991 to offer Southern Baptists a more moderate way of worship without having to leave their faith .
Most of the fellowship 's churches are dual - aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention -- as Druid Hills is for at least the time being .
They believe in upholding what spokesman Lance Wallace said is one of the principles of the denomination -- the autonomy of the local church to worship as they choose .
" For us , Druid Hills are doing exactly what they are free , and frankly have the responsibility , to do for themselves , " Wallace said .
The move toward conservative worship , he said , has been damaging to women Southern Baptists who have been led to believe their desire to lead is wrong .
" They feel very just kind of tormented , they struggle with what they 're supposed to do with their lives , " he said . "
They feel a call , but if they grow up in these churches they feel they are n't supposed to do that . "
Druid Hills was not even the fist church Mimi Walker has led .
Raised Presbyterian before joining a Baptist church in college , Walker and her husband did 12 years of missionary work in the Philippines before she was ordained in 2003 .
She held pastoral positions in two Atlanta - area Southern Baptist churches before coming to Druid Hills .
Pastor : Convincing Southern Baptists of Value of Women Not Worth Energy
Pennington - Russel said that she has not identified herself as a Southern Baptist for about 20 years even though her church was affiliated with the denomination until it was defellowshipped over her leadership last year .
She was notified through a Fed Ex letter that her congregations 's relationship with the Southern Baptist Convention , dating back to 1862 , was terminated .
First Baptist Decatur has given several million dollars to Southern Baptist efforts through the years , " she said .
" I assumed that a 146 - year relationship was worth , at very least , a personal conversation . "
Like Mimi Walker , Pennington - Russell , ordained since 1986 , said she never considered stepping down as pastor .
" Withdrawing relationship from our church , and recently from Druid Hills Baptist Church , seems entirely beside the point to me , " she said .
" I have chosen to invest my time , gifts and energy in other ways than trying to convince them otherwise .
That is not the way I want to spend my one and only life . "
If the GBC goes forward with its plan to cut ties with the Druid Hills Baptist Church , the Walkers will follow Pennington - Russell 's lead and affiliate only with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship .
" It does n't change what we 're doing much , " Mimi Walker said .
Currently , and in the past , worshippers have been given the option to direct their donations either to the GBC or the fellowship .
If the church is cut from the convention , all donations will go to the fellowship .
Wallace said only about 300 of their churches are aligned solely with the fellowship .
" The church has been very supportive , " she said .
" They 've taken the stand that they appreciate our ministry as co-pastors but they would also be open to looking at a woman senior pastor in the future . "
EXCLUSIVE : Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon have brought Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes partners Brad Fuller and Andrew Form on to produce Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , the live - action film that reboots the film series launched by New Line in 1990 .
Bay , Fuller and Form will produce with Galen Walker and Scott Mednick .
The producers will begin meetings with writers in the next few weeks .
The deal puts Bay in the center of two Paramount franchises , as he started production May 17 on Transformers 3 , and is zeroing in on Rosie Huntington - Whitely to replace Megan Fox as love interest for Shia LaBeouf .
TMNT , a co-production between Paramount and Nickelodeon , is an outgrowth of the $ 60 million acquisition made by Nick last October for global rights to the entire Turtles franchise .
Right around the same time , Paramount made a first look deal with the Platinum Dunes partners , who will generate genre projects but also want to expand their scope .
While they ’ve already set up several projects including a Rob Cohen - remake of Fright Night , the Turtles film puts them into new territory .

On 1st May we celebrate the achievements of organised labour , but how did this tradition start ?
These origins take us back to America ’s revolutionary socialist history and the struggle for the eight hour day .
At the October 1884 convention of the federation of Organised Trades and Labour Unions , a resolution was passed unanimously which stated , “ that eight hours shall constitute a legal day ’s labour from and after May 1 , 1886 ” and called for a general strike to meet these ends .
There was great support for the cause and the American working class duly answered the call of the OTLU : more than 300,000 workers downed tools across the country .
Chicago was the centre of the movement , 40,000 were out on strike and the city stood still .
The first May Day parade in history took place when Albert Parsons of the radical International Working People ’s Association , along with his wife and kids , led 80,000 men and women down Michigan Avenue .
Apart from banners calling for the eight hours day , there were some which called for more radical demands : “ Private Capital Represents Stolen Labour ” , “ Workingmen Arm ” , “ Down with Throne , Altar and Money - Bags ” .
On Monday May 3rd , as additional workers joined the strike , August Spies , editor of the German language Anarchist newspaper Arbeiter - Zeitung addressed several hundred members of the Lumber Shovers ’ Union .
This was down the road from McCormick Reaper Works on Blue Island Avenue .
In April 1885 , Cyrus H. McCormick Jr. had been forced to withdraw a 15 % wage cut after “ the bitterest labor - management struggle in the company ’s history ” and had been determined to break the union ever since .
He sacked those who had lead the dispute and then in February 1886 declared a general lock out and replaced the rest of his workers with non-union scabs .
For the next three months armed guards and the city police fought with the picketers who attempted to harass the scabs .
As an exhausted Spies began to finish his speech which did not mention the McCormick lock out , the bell rang at the Reaper Works which signaled the end of the day .
Although Spies pleaded for his audience to stand firm , 200 of the crowd broke off to confront the scabs .
The strikers had managed to drive the scabs back into the factory , which now had its windows broken by those who threw stones .
After the police and picketers fought with truncheons and stones , the police drew their guns and fired into the crowd , killing two and injuring many more .
The next day some anarchists distributed a leaflet calling calling for people to gather at the Haymarket Square at 7:30 in the evening to protest the police violence : it was a rainy day and only 200-300 people turned out .
The meeting was peaceful , so peaceful in fact that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr. walked amongst the crowd then returned home to bed , convinced that there would be no trouble .
As Samuel Fielden , the last speaker was finishing his speech at about 10:30 , a police contingent began to march towards the crowd and gave orders to disperse .
It was at this point that someone ( 1 ) threw a bomb , killing one policeman and injuring several more .
The police opened fire , killing at least four workers and injuring many more , in addition many police were killed or injured due to friendly fire .
In the aftermath known socialists were rounded up , union offices and print works were raided and a press propaganda campaign launched against reds , alongside one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in US history .
August Spies , Albert Parsons , Adolph Fischer , George Engel and Louis Lingg were sentenced to death by hanging .
Lingg committed suicide by setting off a small bomb in his mouth , it blew off his jaw and destroyed a large section of his face , it took six hours of pain for him to die .
Michael Schwab and Samuel Fielden had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment by governor Richard Oglesby before being pardoned by governor John Altgeld , Oscar Neebe received 15 years in prison .
Two years later the American Federation of Labour decided to campaign for the eight hours day once again and set 1st May 1890 as the next day for a general strike for the cause .
In response Raymond Lavigne , at the first congress of the Second International , meeting in Paris on the hundredth anniversary of the French Revolution tabled a motion calling for , “ a great international demonstration ” on the 1st May to demand the eight hours day .
The protest were such a success that it became an international tradition .
“ The day will come when our silence will be more powerful that the voices you strangle today . ” – August Spies , just before his demise .
Professor Alan Smithers ' exhaustive worldwide study of the benefits of single - sex schooling has revealed what many of us suspected : there are n't any .
Single - sex schools score highly in league tables but , as Smithers shows , it is because many of these schools are grammars or independent .
Here we have further evidence of the irrepressible dishonesty employed by those who seek to maintain - or to reintroduce - outmoded educational traditions .
Hold a neo -Victorian model up as being likely to improve academic standards , manipulate admissions criteria so an improvement in results is inevitable , and then spend the rest of the year shouting about how successful your new wheeze has been .
We live in a PR - infected world .
Much public service nowadays consists less of doing a job , more of stating ad nauseam how well it is being done .
Smithers ' findings mean we have yet another meaningless stock phrase to dump in the dustbin of unfunny jokes that populate much of the British education debate .
" Single - sex education causes academic improvement , " can be added to the hilarious " specialism drives up standards across the curriculum " gag currently making many staff at specialist schools choke on their lunch , and to that killer punch - line : " Improvement in results at academies is not down to manipulated admissions . "
My own objection to the idea of single - sex schooling is probably overly simplistic , and revolves around the fact that it is unnatural .
It engenders fear and distrust of a mysterious other .
We go to co-educational nurseries , and to mixed infant and primary schools .
And we do this happily and naturally , mixing with the other gender with ease .
When we reach the age of 11 , however , our education system can divide humans into two entirely distinct species .
Socially , this is almost as disastrous as educating different creeds in separate schools .
Teenagers who have grown up in single - sex schools , boys or girls , are not able to act naturally around the opposite sex , perhaps ever .
Any system that encourages half the population to be scared of the other half is idiotic by design .
It stores up a well of misunderstanding that festers mockingly within us , having ruinous effects throughout the journey of our lives .
There has been some suggestion that single - sex schools are under increasing threat .
Far from it - the education bill has provided for them to expand .
Let me explain .
Many girls ' schools are considered to be successful , and as " successful " schools are to consider expanding , it is likely that many girls ' schools will do so .
Where their neighbouring school is co-educational , the creaming off of more female students will inevitably affect the gender balance at the co-educational school .
There are already parts of the country where supposedly co-educational schools have a gender balance of three boys for every girl .
This does nothing for these schools ' results , thereby further conferring on them " sink " status ; and meaning more girls are recruited for their single - sex neighbour , so that eventually you are left with one school for high - performing girls , and another for the boys plus any girls who do n't pass academic muster .
This situation exists already , and will be exacerbated by the education bill .
Our children are more mature than many give them credit for , and can cope perfectly well with being in the same class as the opposite sex without turning into a raging sea of hormones .
I taught an all - boys class in a mixed school last year .
There were some benefits , but most interesting was the response of the girls who'd had the boys taken from their English lessons .
They were passionate in their opposition .
We need the boys back , they said , so that lessons are more lively , and they need us to help them .
