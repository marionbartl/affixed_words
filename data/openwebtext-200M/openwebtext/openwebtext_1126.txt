When the four horsemen ride into town , its wise to be in a vehicle heading in the opposite direction , or , better still , get a ride thats got some firepower .
If the Mayan calendar is right and were all headed for some kind of fiery and brimstoney end ( Im putting a tenner on it being Michael Moores fault ) then its time to start thinking about saving for a car that can really crush the skulls on the way to the burned down husk of what used to be the local petrol station .
On the plus side , the apocalypse will undoubtedly make the pasties taste better .
As usual , Obama is a step ahead .
Hes got himself a pair of wheels that makes Pimp My Ride look like the Morris Minor Owners Club .
Built by Cadillac , codenamed Stagecoach , nicknamed the Beast , designated Limo One , even riding bitch * in this car should be considered a privilege .
David Caldwell of General Motors gives us a lowdown on the cars specification :
One of the specifications is that we do n't talk about the specifications .
Very Fight Club .
Still , it doesnt do any harm to speculate .
How does an estimated weight of eight tons , a hermetically sealed environment to protect from chemical attack , a Kevlar - reinforced floor , run -flat tyres and ballistic glass five inches thick sound ?
In fact , the only things to worry about in the Beast are weak bridges and someone cutting a fierce one inside the airproof cabin .
Still , I bet Obamas smell of roses , right ?
For some , the possibility of death by apocalypse in a Cadillac is too much to bear .
Sure , its a fiercesome piece of machinery , but its still a car .
Time to open up the cheque book and make away with some military kit before the half million bounces .
The M1117 Armoured Security Vehicle , apart from sounding like online frag speak ( Haha I just totally M1117 your Warthog ) is an unofficially sanctioned badass currently doing the rounds in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries grouped together on the news .
At $ 700,000 each , it would best be described as a premium product , the MacBook Pro of all - wheel drive armoured vehicles .
For the money it delivers a lot of bang .
The IBD Modular Expandable Armor System , or IBDMEAS , or Ib - dum - ee-ass , can withstand an IED attack , which in laymans terms means you can bomb the hell out of it and not very much will happen .
The armour is also designed to deflect rocket - propelled grenades .
In the likely event that a counter arse - kicking is in order , it sports a browning machine gun and , my personal favourite , a Mk 19 grenade launcher .
Totally M1117 .
Quite how it handles horsemen is not part of the spec , though my guess is quite well .
Sometimes though , ib - dum - ee - as and a grenade launcher is just a little too , well , pansy .
Step forward the Stryker , an eight - wheeled monster weighing in a fat 16 tons .
Dont think you can call it chubby and leggit though ; its capable of 62 mph .
The asking price for this tubby sprinter is an ice cold $ 1.2 million .
Nevertheless , pity the poor fool in his Stryker who challenges his mate in the TPz Fuchs to a game of paintball .
The Fuchs is a brutal monstrosity of a thing .
When its not busying itself with carrying personnel or matching the Stryker for weight and speed , it enjoys itself by taking out other vehicles with its MILAN anti-tank - guided missiles , allowing any potential driver to utter the unbeatable , I just Fuchs you up .
Weapons may be impressive , but when facing off against the four horsemen , the best line of offence is a strong defence .
Take the Cougar range , with such famous customers as the United Kingdom , the US , and , brilliantly , Iraq .
Lesson one in intimidation : make the publicity shot for the vehicle one of it getting blown up and surviving with nary a scratch .
Lesson two , make the second publicity shot one of the vehicle parked up all casual and caption it with
This little tyke took a few steel - toed whacks in the short and curlies and still nudged home on three wheels with all officers present and correct .
And make an Aussie say it .
Sometimes , though , its just not enough to walk the walk and talk the talk .
Sometimes its just best to look mean .
And I dont mean bomber jacket and Rambo boots mean , I mean mean .
A good tactic when trying to make a car look mean is strapping the front of a steam train to it .
This baby is a SWAT Riot Truck , capable of maximum badassness .
It is yet to be established whether it is called the Riot Truck because it causes riots or because it stops them .
The plow on the front has a 3 - tonne capacity , meaning it could move a fat Land Rover out of the way and still make room to do over a couple of Minis too .
The paint is resistant to Molotov cocktails .
Okay , its not as durable , powerful or plain invincible as the Stryker or the Cougar , but the great thing about the Riot Truck is that , unlike the aforementioned vehicles , its built for intimidation .
The Cougar looks like an army vehicle that could withstand a few knocks .
The Riot Truck looks like it could withstand a direct impact from God .
Which is what this article is all about .
There is one more question to answer .
When the four horsemen are on your tail , where do you hide ?
How about the worlds most secure car park .
Where could it be ?
The Pentagon ?
Fort Knox ?
How about Derby , UK .
The Bold Lane car park has been listed as one of the ten most secure places in the world .
Park up your Riot Truck and enjoy .
If it will fit .
* For the unitiated , riding bitch refers to occupying the middle seat in the back of the car , where legroom is limited .

Trackbacks FactCheck flubs Obama gun fact check : FactCheck.org is an excellent project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania .
It a non-partisan organization which provides factual evaluations of the claims of and about political figures .
I have cited it in my own writing , and will continue to do so .
However , that FactCheck has a well - deserved reputation for accuracy and good judgment does not mean that its work is infallible , as the VC has pointed out previously .
The Encyclopedia Britannica also has a well - deserved reputation for accuracy and impartiality , but the Britannica sometimes contains errors or overstatements .
FactCheck 's September 22 , 2008 , report on the National Rifle Association 's advertising critical claims that the NRA " distorts Obama 's position on gun control beyond recognition . "
FactCheck itself , though , has overstated its claims , and made several errors .
show )
Much of FactCheck 's critique of the NRA is the mere recitation of vague platitudes by Obama claiming that he supports of the Second Amendment .
FactCheck fails to recognize that Obama 's platitudes and the NRA 's charges could be simultaneously true .
For example , John McCain might sincerely say , " I strongly support First Amendment rights . "
A group critical of McCain might take out advertising which says " McCain sponsoroed the most comprehensive restriction of political speech in American history , and he is an opponent of your First Amendment rights . "
All the statement are true : McCain sponsored the McCain - Feingold act , which outlaws a great deal of speech related to federal elections ; people who are strong First Amendment advocates can therefore conclude that McCain is a very serious threat to First Amendment rights .
McCain , however , is doubtless sincere in his belief that the political speech restrictions are consistent with his support for First Amendment rights .
His First Amendment is simply much smaller than the First Amendment which free speech groups like the ACLU support .
FactCheck would be incorrect if it declared that the free speech group was making " false " charges which " distorted " McCain 's views .
Likewise , the NRA is not distorting Obama 's record when they accurately point out his advocacy for draconian gun controls , even if Obama offers generic platitudes about Second Amendment rights .
Obama may sincerely believe that the various measures he has promoted are consistent with the Second Amendment ; the NRA disagrees , and it is not factually inaccurate for the NRA to say so .
On some of the charges , FactCheck appears not to have studied Obama 's words carefully .
For example , one NRA claim is that Obama wants to " Ban the Manufacture , Sale and Possession of Handguns . "
FactCheck accurately reports that Obama did endorse such a position in his 1996 Illinois State Senate race .
( FactCheck also supplies the details of Obama 's 2008 claim that the questionnaire was filled out by an aide without Obama 's knowledge , even though Obama 's handwriting is on the cover of the questionnaire . )
But FactCheck asserts that the NRA is lying because of Obama 's response to the same question in 2003 : " While a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable , I believe reasonable restrictions on the sale and possession of handguns are necessary to protect the public safety . "
The 2003 response hardly means that Obama does not favor a handgun ban .
He simply said he recognized it as politically impracticable .
A candidate can simultaneously support something , and consider it " politically impracticable . "
For example , in a 1997 Connecticut Law Review
If I were running for Congress in 2008 , and somebody asked " Do you favor repealing federal laws about the mere intrastate possession of guns ? "
I would probably explain that a complete repeal is " not politically practicable , " and would say that I would work instead for marginal improvements in the laws .
Now suppose my opponent puts out a brochure which says " Kopel favors repeal of federal laws on gun possession . "
Is the opponent distorting my position beyond recognition ?
Well , probably not .
A good FactCheck article would point out the difference between my 1997 position and my current statement on what is " politically practicable . "
But my very choice of the words " politically practicable " indicates that if political circumstances changed , so that a broad repeal were politically practicable , then I would support it .
Conversely , if I ( or , Obama or McCain ) were asked " Do you think that the federal government should require journalists to get a government license ? " the response would not be " Licensing journalists is not politically practicable , but there are other steps the government could take to improve media quality . "
So Obama 's 2003 acknowledgement that handgun prohibition was not " politically practicable " ( at least for a U.S. Senate term that would begin in 2005 ) is consistent with support for handgun prohibition .
FactCheck concludes the section by citing Obama 's claim at an April 2008 debate " I have never favored an all - out ban on handguns . "
The claim is , to say the least , highly dubious in light of the evidence about his 1996 questionnaire , and FactCheck should not have treated this dubious claim as the final word on the subject .
FactCheck failed to report that during the Potomac Primaries a few weeks earlier , Obama had
FactCheck also overlooked the Obama campaign 's statement when the Supreme Court granted cert . in the D.C. handgun case : " Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional " and that " local communities " should have the ability " to enact common sense laws . "
( Chicago Tribune , Nov. 20 , 2007 . )
On the day the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in District of Columbia v. Heller , Obama campaign announced that he agreed with the Court 's decision because it affirmed an individual right .
( The full quote is reproduced in another section of the FactCheck report . )
Notably , Obama did not say that he agreed with the Court 's interpretation that the handgun ban was a violation of the individual right .
Asked about the November 2007 statement supporting the D.C. ban , the campaign
In sum , FactCheck 's label of " False " for the NRA 's statement that Obama supports laws to " Ban the Manufacture , Sale and Possession of Handguns " was based on sloppy reading of some of Obama 's statements , and failure to report other statements explicitly in favor of handgun prohibition .
A similar error is repeated for " Mandate a Government - Issued License to Purchase a Firearm " , which FactCheck calls " Misleading . "
FactCheck quotes a Jan. 15 , 2008 , interview with the late Tim Russert : NBC's Tim Russert , Jan. 15 : Senator Obama , when you were in the state senate , you talked about licensing and registering gun owners .
Would you do that as president ?
Obama : I do n't think that we can get that done .
Obama then went on to list some things which thought could be done .
The phrase " I do n't think we can get that done " has the same import as " not politically practicable . "
It does not convey opposition to the idea .
The NRA claims that Obama 's position includes : " Ban use of Firearms for Home Self - Defense . "
FactCheck says this is " False . "
FactCheck discusses Obama 's opposition to an Illinois bill to prevent localities with handgun bans from punishing a person who used a handgun in lawful self - defense on his or her own property .
Obama 's statements in opposition to the bill ( which are not quoted by FactCheck ) explained that he was worried that the bill would erode local handgun bans .
( At the time , Chicago and five of its suburbs banned handguns . )
FactCheck writes : " Letting the owner of an unregistered firearm escape the penalty for failing to register is one thing , but it 's another thing entirely to make it a crime to use any firearm -- registered or not -- in self - defense . "
Well , if you ban a person from having a handgun at all , you are certainly banning them from using it for self - defense in the home .
Moreover , the Washington , D.C. , gun law - - which Obama supported -- forbade the use of any firearm in the home for self - defense .
( Including a registered rifle , a registered shotgun , or a pre-1976 registered handgun legally possessed under the grandfather clause ) .
The Supreme Court later declared the self - defense ban to be unconstitutional .
Another NRA claim which FactCheck says is " False " is : " Ban Rifle Ammunition Commonly Used for Hunting and Sport Shooting . "
As FactCheck reports , the issue involves Obama 's support for legislation to expand the federal definition of armor-piercing ammunition .
Obama supported a bill to give the Attorney General the administrative authority to ban any rifle ammunition which can penetrate the type of vests commonly used by police .
FactCheck accurately quoted a limitation in the bill : it would apply only to ammunition which is " designed or marketed as having armor piercing capability . "
The " marketed " prong is easy , since rifle ammunition makers do not tout such capability in their advertising .
However , the " designed " language is broad enough to allow bans on anything .
Almost every automobile in the United States is " designed " to drive over 100 miles per hour .
The speedometers show this capability , and even if they did not , every automobile manufacturer is fully aware that its autos can be driven at very fast , unsafe speeds .
The auto engines are " designed " to have a certain amount of power , and this " design " is based on the full knowledge that that auto can be driven over 100 mph .
Among the definitions of " design " in Black 's Law Dictionary is " The pattern or configuration of elements in something , such as a work of art . "
Just as the deliberate configuration of the elements of every automobile can be accurately said to be " designed " to drive over 100 mph , so every deer - hunting round can be said to be " designed " to penetrate body armor .
Notably , the ammunition ban language did not say " designed and intended . "
FactCheck does quote Senator Kennedy , the sponsor of the bill , saying that he did not want to ban hunting ammunition .
Nevertheless , the plain language of the bill , and not Senator Kennedy 's floor statements , were what would be enacted into law .
If there were ever a judicial challenge to ban on particular rifle ammunition ban , a court might well find that the language of the statute , along with judicial deference to agency interpretation of the statute , meant that there was no need to look to legislative history .
FactCheck give NRA a " Partly True " for : " Expand the Clinton Semi-Auto Weapons Ban to Include Millions More Firearms . "
FactCheck agrees that Obama has declared his support for " assault weapon " bans , because he think that " assault weapons " are guns which belong only on " foreign battlefields . "
But FactCheck adds : " We 're not sure where the NRA gets its claim that ' millions ' of additional weapons would be covered . "
The answer is straightforward , in the Illinois legislature , Obama for
The FactCheck gives the NRA a rating of " Uncertain " to " Increase Federal Taxes on Guns and Ammunition by 500 Percent " and " Close Down 90 Percent of Gun Shops in America . "
Both these statements , FactCheck correctly reports , come from a newspaper report of Obama 's 1999 description his gun control plan .
( Chicago Defender , Dec. 13 , 1999 . )
( At the time , he was running for the U.S. House of Representativs . )
FactCheck notes that Obama has not pushed for these proposals since his election to the Senate , and adds , " We asked the Obama campaign about his position on an ammunition tax but have received no response . "
" Uncertain " is an awfully generous label , Obama - wise .
Obama clearly announced he supported the particular policies .
He has never said that he has changed his mind on those policies .
His campaign was specifically offered a chance by FactCheck to say whether Obama had changed his mind , and the campaign refused .
Just because Obama is not pushing for something in Congress does not make the NRA 's claim uncertain .
FactCheck gives NRA a " True " for " Pass Federal Laws Eliminating Your Right - to - Carry . "
Illinois and Wisconsin are the only two states which do not have procedures for issuing concealed handgun carry permits .
( 40 states issue under mostly objective standards , while 8 states give nearly limitless discretion to the issuing authority . )
In the 2004 U.S. Senate campaign , Obama said he favored a national ban on concealed carry permits .
Like the carry ban , the bans on gun stores and the 500 % firearm and ammunition tax proposals do not become less true simply because Obama is not pushing them at present .
The NRA gets a " Mostly True " for " Restore Voting Rights for Five Million Criminals Including Those Who Have been Convicted of Using a Gun to Commit a Violent Crime . "
FactCheck points to the relevant bill co-sponsored by Obama , and cites the Sentencing Project for the fact that 5.3 million felons who have served their sentences cannot vote .
The Sentencing Project pointed out that most felony convictions are not for violent or gun crimes .
So the NRA claim is " Entirely True . "
The NRA never asserted that most felony convictions are for violent gun crimes .
" Unsupported " is how FactCheck describes : " Appoint Judges to the U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Judiciary Who Share His Views on the Second Amendment . "
FactCheck 's reasoning is that " the NRA can point to no statement by Obama calling for a Second - Amendment test for his judicial appointees , and we could find none . "
That Obama has not announced a litmus test does not mean that it is unrealistic to expect him to appoint Justices who share his views on Second Amendment and on other matters of constitutional law .
It would be reasonably expected that Obama appointees would take a similar approach of nominal support for the individual right , but finding that hardly any gun controls short of complete prohibition violate that right .
One final NRA claim does not get a FactCheck rating , but it does get a response that might as well as come from the Obama press office .
That is : " Obama would be the most anti-gun president in American history . "
FactCheck supplies Obama 's quote from Heller decision day , beginning with " I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms .. " , and promising , " As President , I will uphold the constitutional rights of law - abiding gun-owners , hunters , and sportsmen .
I know that what works in Chicago may not work in Cheyenne . "
Well , that Obama has " always believed " in the individual Second Amendment right did not prevent him from proposing a national ban on concealed carry , a ban on 90 % of gun stores , a 500 % tax increase on firearms and ammunition -- as the FactCheck article itself reports .
If a candidate proposed banning 90 % of bookstores and a huge tax increase on books , it might be justifiable to predict that he would be " the most anti-book president in American history " -- notwithstanding his proclaimed belief in the individual First Amendment right .
FactCheck calls the NRA prediction , " a pretty tall statement .
We do n't know how George Washington , John Adams or Thomas Jefferson might have felt about armor- piercing ammunition or assault weapons . "
Fortunately , there have n't been many anti-gun Presidents , in U.S. history ; and only the Clinton administration invested a large portion of its politcal capital in gun control .
So President Obama would not have much competition in the " most anti-gun " contest .
We know that Washington and Jefferson were avid gun collectors , and that Jefferson recommended daily hunting as the best form of exercise .
We also know that Jefferson
As far as we know , Obama has never fired a gun , or even held a gun in his hands .
We do know that no President in American history has , in his pre-presidential career , endorsed so many sweeping prohibitions and other severe controls on American gun ownership .
The September 22 , 2008 , FactCheck on the NRA criticism of Obama is marred by the omission of crucial facts , one - sided and misleading presentations of issues , and thinly - concealed political advocacy .
According to FactCheck , the NRA refused to answer FactCheck 's request for explanations of its claims .
If so , the refusal provides a partial explanation of why so many crucial facts were missing .
Whatever the reasons behind the problems in the September 22 report , FactCheck should publish a substantially revised edition .

The NRA 's advertising points to various positions which Obama has taken over the years .
Not one of these positions ( with a single very dubious exception , discussed below ) has been subsequently repudiated by Obama .
Much of FactCheck 's critique of the NRA is the mere recitation of vague platitudes by Obama claiming that he supports of the Second Amendment .
FactCheck fails to recognize that Obama 's platitudes and the NRA 's charges could be simultaneously true .
For example , John McCain might sincerely say , " I strongly support First Amendment rights . "

" The 2003 response hardly means that Obama does not favor a handgun ban .
He simply said he recognized it as politically impracticable .
A candidate can simultaneously support something , and consider it " politically impracticable . "
For example , in a 1997 article , Glenn Reynolds and I wrote in favor the historic and textual interpretation of the Congressional power over interstate commerce : that it applies to commercial activities conducted across state lines , and to the regulation of activities which are " necessary and proper " for regulating interstate commerce .
Thus , I think that laws about who can possess guns ( e.g. , persons convicted of particular crimes , children , alcoholics , etc. ) should be matters of state law , not federal law .
( With the caveats that state laws cannot violate the Second Amendment , and that other federal powers might be legtimately used in certain situations ; for example , congressional power over immigration might be an appropriate basis for a federal restriction on gun possession by illegal aliens . )
If I were running for Congress in 2008 , and somebody asked " Do you favor repealing federal laws about the mere intrastate possession of guns ? "
I would probably explain that a complete repeal is " not politically practicable , " and would say that I would work instead for marginal improvements in the laws .

Another NRA claim which FactCheck says is " False " is :
As FactCheck reports , the issue involves Obama 's support for legislation to expand the federal definition of armor-piercing ammunition .
Almost all rifle ammunition used for hunting deer or larger animals will penetrate a bullet - resistant vest ; such vests are designed to stop handgun ammunition , not rifle ammunition .
( In part because rifles have longer barrels , their bullets generally have greater velocity , and hence greater kinetic energy , than handgun bullets . )
Obama supported a bill to give the Attorney General the administrative authority to ban any rifle ammunition which can penetrate the type of vests commonly used by police .
FactCheck accurately quoted a limitation in the bill : it would apply only to ammunition which is " designed or marketed as having armor piercing capability . "

But FactCheck adds : " We 're not sure where the NRA gets its claim that ' millions ' of additional weapons would be covered . "
The answer is straightforward , in the Illinois legislature , Obama for SB 1195 , which defines " assault weapons " much more broadly than the 1994 federal law .
It included double - barrel and break - open shotguns in 28 gauge caliber and larger ; and also banned .50 caliber rifles .
The FactCheck gives the NRA a rating of " Uncertain " toandBoth these statements , FactCheck correctly reports , come from a newspaper report of Obama 's 1999 description his gun control plan . ( , Dec. 13 , 1999 . )

" , and promising , " As President , I will uphold the constitutional rights of law - abiding gun-owners , hunters , and sportsmen .
I know that what works in Chicago may not work in Cheyenne .
" Well , that Obama has " always believed " in the individual Second Amendment right did not prevent him from proposing a national ban on concealed carry , a ban on 90 % of gun stores , a 500 % tax increase on firearms and ammunition -- as the FactCheck article itself reports .
If a candidate proposed banning 90 % of bookstores and a huge tax increase on books , it might be justifiable to predict that he would be " the most anti-book president in American history " -- notwithstanding his proclaimed belief in the individual First Amendment right .
FactCheck calls the NRA prediction , " a pretty tall statement .
We do n't know how George Washington , John Adams or Thomas Jefferson might have felt about armor-piercing ammunition or assault weapons .
" Fortunately , there have n't been many anti-gun Presidents , in U.S. history ; and only the Clinton administration invested a large portion of its politcal capital in gun control .
So President Obama would not have much competition in the " most anti-gun " contest .
We know that Washington and Jefferson were avid gun collectors , and that Jefferson recommended daily hunting as the best form of exercise .
We also know that Jefferson instituted a government program to supply guns , at federal expense , to people who could n't own one .
We know that neither Washington , nor Adams , nor Jefferson ever proposed banning a type of gun simply because it was useful on " battlefields .
"
As far as we know , Obama has never fired a gun , or even held a gun in his hands .
We do know that no President in American history has , in his pre-presidential career , endorsed so many sweeping prohibitions and other severe controls on American gun ownership .
The September 22 , 2008 , FactCheck on the NRA criticism of Obama is marred by the omission of crucial facts , one - sided and misleading presentations of issues , and thinly - concealed political advocacy .
According to FactCheck , the NRA refused to answer FactCheck 's request for explanations of its claims .
If so , the refusal provides a partial explanation of why so many crucial facts were missing .
Whatever the reasons behind the problems in the September 22 report , FactCheck should publish a substantially revised edition .

Long Debunked " Rumor " Validated by Giuliani
FEMA in NYC prior to 9 - 11 for Project TRIPOD terror drill , scheduled for
9-12
By Gregor Holland
As of this writing , June 2 , 2004 , the transcript of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani 's testimony to the 9 - 11 Commission during the May 18 - 19 , 2004 hearings in New York is the only transcript of that hearing omitted from the Commission website ( http://www.9-11commission.gov).
Did Rudy say something wrong ?
In case you missed it live , you can listen to his testimony in full at the WNYC radio website at : http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/28147.
As Giuliani recounts his experience of the day of 9/11 , and the evolving location of the Emergency Command Center that morning , you might want to pay special attention to what he says at the end of his prepared statement :
" ... the reason Pier 92 was selected as a command center was because on the next day , on September 12 , Pier 92 was going to have a drill , it had hundreds of people here , from FEMA , from the Federal Government , from the State , from the State Emergency Management Office , and they were getting ready for a drill for biochemical attack .
So that was gonna be the place they were going to have the drill .
The equipment was already there , so we were able to establish a command center there , within three days , that was two and a half to three times bigger than the command center that we had lost at 7 World Trade Center .
And it was from there that the rest of the search and rescue effort was completed . "
Readers may remember that on the days immediately after 9/11/01 there was a nasty little rumor running around the internet that FEMA had arrived in NYC on Monday September 10 , thus implying foreknowledge of the disaster .
The source of the rumor was a September 13 , 2001 interview between CBS News anchor Dan Rather and Tom Kennedy ( later corrected to Kenney ) of FEMA National Urban Search and Rescue .
Here is a transcript of the brief interview :
Rather : " Tom Kennedy ...
Kenney , a rescue worker with the National Urban Search and Rescue , it 's part of FEMA ... "
Kennedy : " We 're currently one of the first teams that was deployed to support the city of New York for this disaster .
We arrived on late Monday night , and went into action on Tuesday morning .
And not until today did we get a full opportunity to work the entire site . "
The rumors which subsequently ravaged online chatrooms and 9/11 websites were officially denied by FEMA .
In a November 15 , 2001 WorldNetDaily piece titled " FEMA : No prior knowledge of 9 - 11 : Agency dispels Net rumor , says team did n't arrive in NYC Sept. 10 " , Jon Dougherty wrote : ( http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25329 )
" The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it did not have urban search and rescue teams in place in New York City prior to the Sept. 11 attacks , contrary to an Internet - based rumor alleging otherwise .
In the interview , Kenney misspoke when he said he and his team arrived in New York City and were " finally on the ground " and deployed by " Monday night .
... "
If accurate , that would have meant the team arrived Sept. 10 - the night before the attacks .
According to a spokesman in the office of Vito Pizzi , who works in FEMA 's federal coordination office , a total of 16 teams were put on alert or activated Sept. 11 .
Two of those teams were sent in to Ground Zero the next day , Sept. 12 .
FEMA officials said Kenney , in the head of the moment , misstated his team 's arrival date .
Kenney could not be reached for comment . "
The rumor of FEMA presence prior to 9/11 was so stubborn that it took another debunking in a September 5 , 2002 Boston Herlad piece written by a Stephanie Schorow .
Schorow recommends that ' X - File fiction ' can be separated from fact with simple research and checking of multiple sources .
In reference to the rumor that " FEMA sent the Urban Search and Rescue Team to New York City THE NIGHT BEFORE the attacks occurred ! " , Schorow writes :
" But if you search further , you 'll see Tom " Kennedy ' ' is actually Tom Kenney , an officer from the Massachusetts Urban Search and Rescue Task Force ; apparently Rather got the name wrong .
Likewise , common sense dictates Kenney simply said Monday when he meant Tuesday .
To confirm , the Herald called the Kenney home on Cape Cod and spoke to Kenney 's wife , who said that her husband did go to New York on Sept. 11 , not Sept. 10 .
She explained that he was under extreme stress when Rather interviewed him , and added wryly that it was typical of her husband to confuse dates . "
( http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/bostonherald090502.html )
We should note that the actual wording of the debunking accounts does not deny that FEMA was in New York on September 10 , it merely denies that the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force was not in New York on September 10 .
We should note that FEMA , when denying presence in NYC prior to 9/11 did not raise the possibility that there was confusion about the existence of a separate FEMA team for the scheduled 9/12 bioterror drill , a drill which we have learned is named Operation TRIPOD .
It seems that prior to the Giuliani testimony there has been scant mentioning of the bioterror drill .
According to a May 22 , 2002 Press Release from the NYC Office of Emergency Management , the TRIPOD , or ' Point - of - Dispensing ' drill , was successfully held that day .
The Press Release states :
" TRIPOD had originally been scheduled to take place on September 12th , 2001 , at Pier 92 - which ironically had served as the temporary home of OEM shortly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 . "
The release also mentions that the TRIPOD exercise is supported by " The Office of Justice Programs , through the Office for Domestic Preparedness " .
The Office for Domestic Preparedness was the effort assigned to Dick Cheney by George W. Bush on May 8 , 2001 .
Although reports indicate that Cheney never convened any meetings of this Task Force prior to September 2001 , it seems that there must have been some sort of planning involved with the organization and scheduling of Operation TRIPOD for September 12 , 2001 .
With all of the unpleasant news of 9/11 , it must have pleased Cheney that the scheduling of this drill made the pre-assembled emergency team immediately available to New York City .
Who would have thought ?
Major questions exist as to why FEMA would deny being in New York City prior to 9/11 without mentioning the 9/12 bioterror drill .
These questions must now be addressed as the initial suspicions of those who learned of the Tom Kenney statement have been clearly validated .
The coincidental presence of a large FEMA team in NYC at the location , Pier 92 , which became the Command Center for the entire emergency operation is disturbing .
An alert press and a legitimate 9 - 11 Commission should have raised this issue long ago .

The worms represent a new group of species
A group of glowing worms has been found dwelling in the deep ocean , some of which release body parts as tiny " bombs " to ward off predators .
Researchers describe the bizarre " Swima worms " in Science journal .
The creatures , which the scientists say could be widespread in the deep sea , indicate the extent of biodiversity yet to be discovered in the oceans .
The team found them whilst exploring the waters just above the sea-bed off the west coast of the US .
Lead author Karen Osborn , from the University of California San Diego , told BBC News that she and her colleagues found the worms accidentally , whilst exploring the deep oceans with remotely operated submersible vehicles .
The green " bombs " may have evolved from gills " We came across them and thought they were very interesting , firstly because of their bioluminescence , " she said .
" When we brought them up and realised they were different from anything that had been described before , we became even more interested . "
Dr Osborn and her colleagues were exploring depths of up to 3,700 m when they spotted the creatures .
As they continued to bring more of the worms back to their lab , they realised they had found a group of previously unknown animals .
Each of the seven species found so far is transparent apart its gut , and all of the worms produce colourful bioluminescence .
The researchers are now investigating what chemicals the animals produce to give rise to their striking glow .
The animals are also excellent swimmers - using fans of long bristles that form swimming paddles .

Five of the species release the glowing bombs , which probably serve to distract predators while the worm escapes .
The team has named the first of these species Swima bombiviridis .
" They usually have about eight of the bombs , and they drop one or two at a time , " explained Dr Osborn .
Because of the tiny size of the bombs - approximately 1 - 2 mm in diameter - and the bright lights used by the submersible vehicles , the team was unable to capture this bombing on film in the deep ocean .
" So we bring the animals up to study them , " Dr Osborn said .
" If you transfer the animal into a small tank , and harass it a little bit with forceps - kind of bump it anywhere on the body - it will release one of these bombs .
" As soon as [ the bomb ] is released it starts glowing green and the animal swims away . "
Greg Rouse , another member of the research team , explained that a common ancestor of the species had gills that appeared to be " in exactly the same places as the bombs " , from which the bombs could have evolved .
Some of the worms have tiny green appendages that they release as bombs
" The gills ( of their relatives ) can fall off very easily so there 's a similarity of being detachable , but for some reason the gills have transformed to become these glowing little detachable spheres . "
Dr Osborn concluded : " This group of really fantastic animals emphasises just how much we have to learn about deep sea organisms and deep sea biodiversity . "

“ It used to be that lawmakers were coy about any ideas they had about heading for K Street , waiting until their terms ended before announcing they were beginning a more lucrative career , ” Politico ’s Kenneth Vogel opines .
Not anymore .
Florida Sen. Mel Martinez — who recently quit the country ’s top legislative chamber — joined up with lobbying firm DLA Piper less than two weeks after resigning his seat .
Martinez was recently replaced by the former chief of staff to Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , who is now seeking Martinez ’ former seat .
ADVERTISEMENT
DLA Piper bills itself as one of the largest legal services provider in the world , helping companies to “ internationalize . ”
On the front page of their website , under the tagline “ LEGAL INSIGHTS , ” they highlight the following posts : “ Lending activity by offshore foreign corporation gives rise to effectively connected income according to Internal Revenue Service Memorandum , ” and “ From hiring to firing / A basic guide to the Chinese employment law life cycle . ”
Martinez ’ flight from lawmaker to lobbyist may have been quick — but the Florida Republican is n’t alone .
“ In recent years , members of Congress planning to become lobbyists have not been able to wait , ” Vogel notes .
Martinez ’ hiring at DLA Piper “ brought to five the number of former lawmakers since 2007 who have abandoned their constituents midterm and almost immediately resurfaced with lobbying firms , according to data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics . ”
“ This used to be considered unacceptable , but it really is a growing phenomenon , ” Meredith McGehee , who lobbies for stricter lobbying and ethics regulations for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center , told Vogel .
“ The reality is that the money has gotten so big and so tempting these days , that I think a lot of these members are saying , ‘ I do n’t think I ’ll go back into political office , first of all , and , the money is just too big to turn down . ’ ”
Martinez said his reason for quitting the Senate was to spend more time with his family .
ADVERTISEMENT
Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ignacio Sanchez , a partner at the lobbying firm , told a blog that he recruited the ex-senator .
“ When he announced he was going to retire and let the governor appoint someone to finish out the term , I immediately talked to him and said , ‘ You really ought to consider looking at our firm .
I think you would really do well , and we would love to have you , ’” Sanchez told LegalTimes .
Martinez found himself in hot water several years ago during the Republican Party ’s heated involvement in the case of Terri Schiavo , a woman kept on life support who suffered from brain damage .
A Martinez aide drafted “ talking ” points for Senate REpublicans to use on the scandal — talking points which were inadvertently obtained by the Washington Post and then posted on Raw Story .
ADVERTISEMENT
Martinez blamed a lawyer in his office , Brian Darling , but others told a Capitol Hill reporter at the time that other Martinez aides had been involved .
A source says “ that he knows ‘ for certain ’ that two other senior Martinez staffers helped Darling write the memo and circulate it to other Republican Senators , ” then - Roll Call reporter Mary Ann Akers reported .
“ Those three were really working it , ” the disgruntled source quipped .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Darling belatedly admitted circulating a memo that urged Republicans to get involved in the Terri Schiavo case , in part because it could yield political benefits , ” Akers added .
A partner at the DLA law firm says that they did n’t seek to woo Martinez until he left the Senate .
Under Senate rules , Martinez wo n’t be able to lobby his former colleagues for two years .
“ We did n’t have any discussions with him until he decided to leave the Senate , and we did n’t conduct any negotiations with him of any sort until he had left the Senate , ” John Merrigan , a DLA partner , told Vogel .

The firm has employed numerous former members of Congress , including onetime House Majority Leaders Dick Gephardt — a Democrat — and Dick Armey — a Republican .

Wow !
If this is a real hint of her views on this matter than I think we have to applaud .
Even if it does n't change the ultimate ruling in this particular case , it is still good to have a new Justice who questions the corrupt foundation of law regarding the relationship between corporations and the government .
Of course , some people 's heads started steaming when they heard her talk about the Santa Clara decision being a " mistake " .
" I do n't want to draw too much from one comment , " says Todd Gaziano , director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
But it " does n't give me a lot of confidence that she respects the corporate form and the type of rights that it should be afforded . "
The linked article has a very good background on the history of Corporate Personhood .
It even mentions the little discussed ( outside liberal circles ) fact that the original court case on this matter ( Southern Pacific Railroad v. Santa Clara County ) did not actually address this issue but instead that the whole foundation of " corporations are people " argument were the results of an off hand remark by the then chief justice that was written down by the court reporter as if it were part of the official decision .
Justice Kennedy , however , is not so enlightened :
Until the phone call , Rossie Anderson - Howze did n't think she needed help negotiating her $ 12,000 in credit card debt .
But when the company promised to cut the retiree 's 12.9 percent interest rate and save her $ 4,000 or her money back , she agreed to let Moneyworks LLC charge $ 1,090 to her card .
The company failed to deliver on its promises , she said , forcing Anderson - Howze , of St. Paul , to become one of hundreds of Minnesota consumers to seek help from Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson .
Swanson sued Moneyworks LLC and two other debt assistance companies on Tuesday , alleging that the companies made unsolicited phone calls promising lowered interest rates , guaranteed savings and money - back guarantees .
Swanson alleges that Washington - based Priority Direct Marketing , Clear Financial Solutions of Florida and Moneyworks LLC , based in Georgia , " charged financially strapped people a lot of money to lower the interest rates on their credit cards , only they failed to do so , leaving people even further behind on their bills . "
Attempts to reach all three companies were unsuccessful .
The calls promising lowered interest rates come at a time when credit card companies have been raising rates , even for consumers with stellar credit .
Swanson said debt assistance is just the latest " cottage industry " that 's formed to " capitalize on the bad economy . "
Attorneys general around the country , including Swanson , have sued mortgage foreclosure consultants and health care credit card companies since the recession took hold .
Swanson hopes the lawsuit will shine a spotlight on these companies and help locate the individuals behind them .
No principals have been identified yet in these cases , but Swanson suspects that a few people are behind many of the " fly - by - night " debt assistance companies .
Swanson said Moneyworks LLC and Clear Financial Solutions already have stopped answering some of their phone lines .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Nearly one out of five U.S. drivers surveyed has read or sent a text message while behind the wheel , even though nearly all of the respondents in an AAA survey released on Friday considered such action unacceptable .

“ The new technologies that help us multitask in our everyday lives and increasingly popular social media sites present a hard - to - resist challenge to the typically safe driver , ” AAA Chief Executive Robert Darbelnet said in a statement accompanying the survey commissioned by the AAA Foundation .
“ Enacting texting bans for drivers in all 50 states can halt the spread of this dangerous practice among motorists nationwide , and is a key legislative priority for AAA in state capitals , ” Darbelnet said .
The group , which provides emergency road services to its members and lobbies on automobile issues , formerly was known as the American Automobile Association .
The random telephone survey questioned 2,500 U.S. residents 16 and older in April and May .
Although nearly all respondents considered the practice unacceptable , 18 percent said they had sent a text message while driving within a month of being surveyed .
Most data available on texting and driving are anecdotal , but the U.S. Transportation Department is seeking more information as pressure grows to ban the practice .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood will hold a two - day conference on distracted drivers next week in Washington .
Separately on Friday , 93 percent of 1,000 licensed drivers responding to a survey commissioned by Ford Motor Co supported a nationwide ban on texting while behind the wheel .
AAA says surveys of its members also favor a ban , a step that Ford and other major automakers support .
About a dozen states have imposed prohibitions , and proposals for a national ban have been introduced in Congress .
The wireless industry -- including cellphone manufacturers , carriers , and some Internet companies represented by the CTIA - Wireless Association -- support state and local efforts to ban texting while driving .
From the medium ’s inception , Japan seemed to have no qualms in dealing with themes no heavier than those found in movies and TV , such violence and sexuality .

Castlevania III : Dracula % 26rsquo;s Curse
To avoid trouble with the Medusa , Konami quite disturbingly gave the mythical baddie a manlier chest build , thus simultaneously defeating the purpose of her inclusion in the first place , as well as making the topless legend ten times more disturbing !
And although the 15th century statues fit the Transylvanian motif perfectly , they did n’t fall in line with NoA ’s puritanical vision of Western gaming .
So , like Lady Justice in an Alabama courthouse , some poor asshole had to digitally dress the artwork to hide those disgusting mammaries .
Super Castlevania IV
Did Konami think they ’d actually be able to sneak a tit by Nintendo on a more powerful console ?!
16 - bit equals twice the nipple , you silly geese !
The audacity … put a top on that tramp !
Earthbound ( Mother 2 )
In Magicant zone you ’ll wander around the cheery recesses of Ness ’s mind .

SEXUALITY
Final Fight
So Final Fight ’s Poison and Roxy have the distinction of being gaming ’s first transvestites … but that ’s probably a bit of a failed cop out on Capcom ’s part .
Here ’s how we think it went down :
NINTENDO : Uh , hey … you ca n’t have Guy beating up women in the street .
CAPCOM : So we ca n’t punch women ?
NINTENDO : Kind of in poor taste , do n’t you think ?
CAPCOM : Well … what if I told you they were n’t actually “ women ” in the strictest sense ?
NINTENDO : Come again ?
CAPCOM : You see , Poison and Roxy are actually transvestites !
NINTENDO : Seriously …
CAPCOM : Uh , yep !
As such , it ’s technically no different than hitting a man .
Plus , we ’re really close to deadline here and -
NINTENDO : DUDE , JUST F*** ING TAKE IT OUT !
CAPCOM : Fine !
They ’re now Billy and Sid… dicks .

Narwhals - Tusking
Music ; Ambiance : Narwhal song
JM : Monkeys pick nits off each other 's heads .
Plenty of humans like a good back massage .
And if you 're arctic whale ?
You rub tusks .
I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet .
The narwhal has a tusk that extends from its forehead .
Narwhals have a practice scientists have dubbed " tusking , " in which two whales rub these 8 - foot long tusks together .
Dr. Martin Nweeia studies the narwhal .
MN : Tusking is a behavior where narwhal are seen with their tusks , usually above the water , although it can occur below the water as well .
From talking to Inuit elders -- who 've probably had the most experience being around this whale - it really is gentle process .
It 's not something that 's seen as a battle .
Typically , that was seen in some of the more western viewpoint - type articles or literature or even lore .
And , in terms of the value of tusking , it could be for multiple purposes .
It could be sensing something ; you know , the physical act of rubbing two tusks against each other could provide some sensation for these animals .
The second thing , the whale may have this aspect as a way of brushing its teeth , or its tooth in this case .
When tusks are looked at in nature , the high ridges - cause keep in mind , this is almost a ribbon that 's kind of wound together and there 's really high points to it and low valleys to it .
The high points or the high parts of the ridges do n't really collect as much of the algae , and they look more clean .
And , because of that , I have a feeling that when they tusk , they can actually clean these high ridge portions , which might help to expose some nerve endings .
And that could be an appropriate way for the whale to , again , be cleaning the surface of this so it could act as a better sensor .
You scratch my tusk , I scratch yours .
Absolutely .

Why Do Manga and Anime Characters Look the Way They Do? by Margaret O'Connell
A few months ago , a co-worker of mine mentioned that she had recently seen Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away  a fact which I found mildly surprising , since she had previously informed me that I was the only person she knew who so much as read science fiction .
In the course of enthusiastically discussing the film , my co-worker expressed the opinion that Miyazaki had deliberately tried for a multicultural effect when creating the character designs in order to increase the movie 's appeal to an international audience .
I found this rather ironic , since , as anyone who has watched just about any of the more popular anime imported to the United States knows , the human cast of Spirited Away are perhaps the closest thing to realistically Japanese - looking characters in any anime seen here since Akira or Serial Experiments Lain .
For one thing , they all have reasonably normal - sized eyes and black hair , unlike the human stars of more sweepingly commercially successful imports such as Yu - Gi- Oh ! , Pokemon , and Sailor Moon .
Although Yu - Gi-Oh ! and Sailor Moon , at least , are clearly intended to take place in some approximation of modern - day Japan ( Pokemon 's setting appears to be some vaguely Japan - like region of a mildly - variant alternate world in which virtually all animal and marine life consists of cute , super - powered " pocket monsters " , or pokemon ) , all of these shows ' major cast members include at least one blond or redhead  not to mention the occasional lavender - haired teenage villain ( i.e. , James / Kojiro in Pokemon ) or ziggurat - headed hero whose zigzag locks are an improbable mixture of purple , scarlet , and yellow ( Yugi himself ) .
Even the title character of the very specifically Japanese historical adventure series Rurouni Kenshin , the legendary imperial " battousai " ( man- slayer ) of the nineteenth - century Meiji Restoration , is a lavender - eyed redhead whom most Western viewers would n't have a clue was Japanese if he were n't dressed in a pink and white kimono and armed with a ( reversed ) samurai sword .
These apparently un - Japanese character designs are not a new departure for anime , or for the manga that so many of them are based on .
Although the earliest anime series to be shown on American TV , Osamu Tezuka 's Astro Boy , Speed Racer , and ( in some markets ) Eighth Man and Gigantor , featured mostly dark - haired human characters , they were drawn in a relatively cartoony , Disney - influenced style which made it easy to assume that all the cast members were Caucasian .
In fact , as more than one anime historian has pointed out , many viewers who were fans of these shows in the 1960's , when they originally aired in the U.S. , never realized that their favorite series were actually Japanese imports rather than homegrown products .
So why is it that there have traditionally been so many apparently Caucasian - looking characters in anime and manga , even the ones that are specifically set in Japan ?
According to noted manga authority Frederik L. Schodt , author of Manga !
Manga ! :
The World of Japanese Comics ( Kodansha International , 1983 ) and Dreamland Japan : Writings on Modern Manga ( Stone Bridge Press , 1996 ) , the roots of this phenomenon can be traced back as far as the forced " opening " of Japan to the West by Commodore Perry in the nineteenth century .
In Schodt 's words , " Before the Japanese came into contact with Westerners , they depicted themselves with Asian features , and often smaller - than - life eyes , in scroll paintings and woodblock prints . "
In contrast , " Prior to the Meiji period , which began in 1868 , ...' Europeans ' were drawn as huge hairy freaks with enormous schnozzles . "
However , once Perry and his entourage arrived in 1853 , introducing European - based concepts of art and esthetics along with their main objective of increased trade between Japan and the West , Japanese artistic ideals began to shift closer to Western models .
Initially , this influence appears to have been somewhat gradual and fitful .
Schodt cites the example of popular prewar ( i.e. , pre-World War I ) Japanese romance magazines for young women , in which illustrations by artists such as Jun'ichi Nakahara depicted heroines with large dreamy eyes in a distinctly Western style .
Yet in the 1890's , only a decade or two before these illustrations appeared , American writer Lafcadio Hearn , who spent much of his life in Japan and eventually became a Japanese citizen , commented in a letter to a friend , " When I show beautiful European engravings of young girls or children to Japanese , what do they say ?
I have done it fifty times , and whenever I was able to get a criticism , it was always the same :  ' The faces are nice ,  all but the eyes : the eyes are too big ,  the eyes are monstrous . ' "
Obviously , the transition from this view to today 's popular bias in favor of anime characters with oversized  even saucer - like  eyes did not take place overnight .
Schodt considers the impact of the Second World War to be a decisive factor in this process : " Defeat in World War II caused a national loss of confidence that clearly extended to Japan 's self - image .
Western ideals of beauty were not only accepted but pursued , often to a ludicrous degree ( operations to remove the epicanthic fold of skin over the eye , which creates the graceful , curved look in Asian eyes , are still popular ) .
Nowhere was this tendency more pronounced than in manga . "
Osamu Tezuka , the founding father of the modern Japanese manga and anime industry , set the tone for post - World War II Japanese comics by adopting cinematic techniques inspired by animation , particularly American animation .
As in much animation of this period , Tezuka 's character designs usually featured disproportionately large eyes , a tendency which was further exaggerated when he began to draw girls ' romance comics such as Ribon no Kishi ( Ribbon Knight ) .
According to Schodt , " Tezuka , and the other men and later women artists who followed him , found that a Caucasian look , with dewy , saucer - shaped eyes , was extremely popular among young readers and that the bigger the eyes , the easier it was to depict emotions ...
Eventually , depicting Japanese people with Caucasian features and large eyes became an established convention ; readers internalized the images , and demanded them . "
Japanese history professor and anime expert Antonia Levi , author of Samurai from Outer Space : Understanding Japanese Animation ( Open Court , 1996 ) , concurs with Schodt 's view that the oversized eyes and generally Caucasian appearance of many anime characters stems from the artistic conventions established by early shoujo ( girls ' ) manga .
However , she proposes a more specifically sociocultural explanation for how this came about .
According to Levi , when the first generation of women manga artists took over the girls ' comics genre in the 1960's , they wanted the option of doing storylines with more action and plot development than the stereotypically sugary , sentimental romances their male predecessors had assumed young female readers would prefer .
However , since it was still socially impermissible for female characters to do anything particularly unconventional or adventurous if the story were set in anything resembling contemporary 1960's Japan , the female manga artists of this pioneering group resorted to setting a far greater proportion of their stories in Europe and the United States than their counterparts in shonen , or boys ' , comics did .
In Levi's words , ... the first wave of shojo manga written by women for girls dealt with a never - never land called the West , preferably the historical West .
In that never - never land , women were strong and ambitious .
They still lived for romance , but they also led interesting and exciting lives .
Often they masqueraded as men in order to do things that might seem otherwise impossible for women .
Even the men they loved and often lost had a female look to them .
They were pretty men with eyes as large and lustrous as any woman and sensitive , caring natures .
Levi goes so far as to assert that the notoriously willowy , feminine look of many male manga characters , especially in shoujo manga , is directly attributable to what eventually became a sort of symbiotic relationship between shoujo manga and the uniquely Japanese institution of the Takarazuka theater , an all - female troupe which also caters primarily to a teenage female audience .
The biggest stars of this troupe are usually the male impersonators who play the male leads .
In fact , these cross-dressing actresses are often the objects of crushes by their young teenage fans  a development which Levi states most Japanese parents consider a normal part of growing up , and even regard as " nicer " and " purer " than the alternative of their daughters ' first experience of puppy love being directed toward an actual male .
In Levi's view , the sensitive , delicate - looking , sexually non-threatening male characters in the first wave of female - scripted shoujo manga were not mere variations of the androgynous pretty - boy pop stars from David Cassidy to the Hansen brothers who have held a similar appeal for many young girls in the West .
What these shoujo manga boys and men really looked like " were not just idealized males , but the male impersonators of the Takarazuka theater . "
In fact , during the 1960's and early 1970's , when it was rare for any but the most overwhelmingly popular manga to be made into anime , shoujo manga became a significant source of script material for the Takarazuka theater , which was far more likely to express interest in dramatizing shoujo storylines than the still relatively small anime industry was .
As early anime studios ' preference for the more action - oriented shonen ( boys ' ) manga as source material suggests , manga and anime , although closely related , are two separate art forms whose audiences are by no means identical .
Manga , which constitute approximately forty percent of all printed matter produced in Japan , have so pervaded every conceivable niche of mainstream Japanese society that , in addition to the action - adventure , romance , horror , and science fiction genres Western comics fans might reasonably expect , there are also manga for adults devoted to everything from cooking to business to golf .
In Dreamland Japan , Frederik Schodt states that at one point in the early 1990's , there were no fewer than ten manga magazines revolving around the popular pinball - like arcade game pachinko .
Anime , on the other hand , tends to be aimed at a younger and less specialized audience .
In his " From the Inside Looking Out " behind the scenes anime - industry column in Animerica Extra , Vol. 5 , No .
4 , Scott Frazier asserts that , despite the widespread popularity of printed manga among every age group and every niche of society , in its native Japan televised anime is still primarily associated with and aimed at children and young people , albeit to a lesser extent than animated cartoons are in the United States .
In Frazier 's words , " The majority of anime shows are aimed at kids , and almost every show on the air is written for audiences 18 and under .
A famous producer , who at the time had more TV hits than anyone else , said , ' Everything has to be written for 14 - year - olds , no matter what the concept , or it will fail in the end . ' "
This does not necessarily have the bowdlerizing , sanitizing effect that might be expected by Americans accustomed to the kind of Saturday morning TV censorship which deems many 1940's Bugs Bunny cartoons too violent to be shown .
Japanese ideas of what sorts of sights and concepts are suitable for children  or at least not unsuitable enough to be assiduously concealed from them  tend to be far more flexible than those prevalent in the United States , as one might surmise from the Cartoon Network 's monotonous warnings that certain of its late - night Adult Swim anime programs " may contain material parents might not find suitable for viewers under the age of fourteen , " and from the age ratings on many English - language manga paperbacks .
For example , TOKYOPOP recommends Kodocha : Sana 's Stage , a series about an irrepressibly cheerful eleven - year - old girl TV star , for audiences 13 +  two years older than the story 's heroine .
Presumably this is due to the not - quite - as - sophisticated - as - she - thinks - she - is Sana 's habit of referring to her handsome young manager as her gigolo  a term she picked up from her eccentric writer mother 's novel " The Gigolo and I " without fully comprehending its meaning  or even her lover , although there is nothing pedophilic going on between them and Sana herself is shocked at the thought of any male 's doing more than kissing her on the cheek .
In vivid contrast to these better - safe - than - sorry warnings from the American packagers of translated manga and anime , Mitsuhisa Ishikawa , the head of Production IG , the Japanese animation studio which created the violent animated origin sequence for O - Ren Ishii , Lucy Liu 's yakuza boss / assassin character in the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill Volume 1 , remarked to an interviewer in the October 21 , 2003 issue of the Financial Times that he was planning to take his seven - year - old daughter to see the R - rated - in - the - U.S. Tarantino film the next day .
In accordance with this idiosyncratically broader , more lowest - common - denominator vision of the viewership for anime on television , Japanese anime producers have traditionally tended to avoid or alter any manga source material which they believed might be uncongenial to significant segments of the audience , particularly the male audience .
Again , Japanese concepts of what young males might be willing to watch are somewhat less rigidly reductive than those of their American counterparts , some of whom still assert , despite the across the board popularity of characters such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Xena , Warrior Princess , that male viewers wo n't watch TV shows with female leads .
It was this belief which provided the rationale for many of the extensive cuts and changes made to transform the girl - centered Japanese anime Card Captor Sakura into the somewhat more coed English - language Cardcaptors , which aired the original show 's fourth episode as its American premiere because it was the first one in which heroine Sakura 's boy rival , Li Syaoran , showed up .
Up until the 1980's , when the reduced costs of computer animation and the overwhelming commercial success of such 1970 's anime as Macross and Space Cruiser Yamato on Japanese TV led to a dramatic rise in the number of animated offerings , this attitude meant that even much of the more action - oriented shoujo material never got adapted into anime at all .
However , once the trajectory from manga to anime became relatively standard for any reasonably popular manga with sufficient youth appeal , shoujo series such as the " magical girls as superheroines " titles Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura and the time - travel adventure / romance Fushigi Yuugi began to make the leap from page to screen .
However , in order for them to do so , some of the distinctly shoujo stylistic features of the original manga were often altered for anime purposes .
In Sailor Moon , the most notable change appears to have been the animators ' usage of easier to follow , more linear scene layouts and action sequences , in contrast to the occasional pages of the original comics in which the heroines seemed to be hovering amongst indistinct swirls of mist in tableaux whose significance or intended impact was often unclear to the untrained eyes of Western ( and , presumably , non-shoujo - reading Japanese ) viewers .
In Fushigi Yuugi , as in a number of other shoujo series , there was also a certain amount of alteration in some of the character designs  specifically , the male character designs .
As Azure Blue points out in an article on the shoujo / yaoi website Aestheticism , " a large number of shoujo manga heroes tended to appear bulkier in their anime incarnations ( i.e. the boys from Fushigi Yuugi ) .
This is done so that muscle - craving male audiences ( especially the ' straight ' ones ) , who 'd stay away from shoujo manga but might nonetheless watch their anime counterparts as they show up on TV , will not be turned off . "
Blue , along with Antonia Levi and a number of the guest speakers at the 2003 Big Apple Anime Fest , including the director of the anime version of Alien Nine , goes on to assert that of late the originally polarized shoujo and shonen genres have begun to blend together to produce a greater number of anime and manga which attempt to appeal to both genders by featuring elements of the two styles .
In fact , she asserts , " in recent years ... it 's the mainstream shounen manga that are adapting a shoujo - ish art style to appeal to readers of both sexes .
As the line separating shoujo and shounen begins to thin , so increases the number of prominent boy waif characters in boys ' comics . "
The examples Blue cites of this that would be most familiar to the average American manga fan not fluent in Japanese include some of the more slim and boyish - looking demon opponents of the heroes of YuYu Hakusho .
However , a similar , though less extreme , noticeable skinniness is also evident in the protagonists of the manga versions of the shonen series Trigun and Big O , at least compared with their anime counterparts .
Whether because of the aforementioned Japanese anime producers ' belief that excessive willowiness in heroes is off - putting to the male half of the prospective homegrown audience , or due to the unusually prominent involvement of Western markets such as the Cartoon Network in the very production of this particular series , the TV version of Big O's protagonist , negotiator / giant mecha- driving crimefighter Roger Smith , looks something like a slightly less musclebound , more GQ - clad version of the exaggeratedly broad - shouldered , powerfully built male superheroes of the current American - produced animated Justice League series .
The Roger in the Big O manga series ( which , according to a note at the back of the Viz edition , was actually created as an after - the - fact adaptation " based on the animated series from Sunrise " ) is also conspicuously broad - shouldered , albeit more in the style of some of CLAMP 's more selectively anatomically exaggerated heroes such as Dr. Shuichiro Kudo in Wish .
However , the TV Roger has a less youthful - looking face and a stronger chin , and his trademark black business suits seem noticeably more well - fitted and expensively cut .
By comparison , the manga Roger is scrawnier and more immature - looking .
In a number of panels , artist Hiroshi Ariga 's habit of drawing the hero 's starched shirt collar so conspicuously oversized that it appears to be a couple of sizes too big for his rather skinny neck makes the manga Roger look like the TV version 's teenage kid brother wearing his anime counterpart 's slightly too loose hand - me - down clothes .
There is a similar discrepancy between the anime and manga versions of Trigun 's pacifist sharpshooter protagonist , Vash the Stampede .
The anime Vash is not particularly muscular and , when not in the middle of one of the many gun battles forced on him by various bounty hunters , Gung - Ho Guns , and other enemies , often presents a rather harmless and even goofy appearance .
However , he does at least look the estimated age of twenty - four listed on his Wanted poster at the beginning of volume one of the Yasuhiro Nightow manga ( English edition published by Dark Horse Manga ) .
For the most part , the Vash in the manga version does n't .
As with Roger Smith , the manga version is noticeably skinnier , and in many scenes is drawn with more unformed - looking facial features than his more adult - looking anime equivalent .
In some panels , he is even depicted with eyes fully as large and round as those of Kite , the twelve - or thirteen - year - old boy who plays a pivotal role in the sandsteamer - hijacking story arc .
This is actually quite logical in terms of the visual shorthand of manga and anime , in which the size of a character 's eyes is often a clue to his or her personality or even moral alignment .
As Levi puts it , " Eyes ... are a way of indicating emotion , something that is not always easy to do with a black and white drawing , or even with the greater flexibility of animation .
That has carried over into today 's anime where sensitive , sympathetic characters usually have larger eyes than other characters . "
Conversely , evil or cold - hearted characters usually have narrow eyes , while ( theoretically ) innocent children , even when they are juvenile delinquents or pickpockets like Bikky and Carol in Sanami Matoh 's police drama / shounen - ai romance FAKE ( TOKYOPOP ) , often have enormous eyes compared to adults .
In shoujo manga especially , teenage girls are frequently depicted with such disproportionately large , glistening , or starry eyes that it often strikes Western readers new to the genre as distractingly weird .
( One Tart reviewer described Kira Aso , the heroine of Fuyumi Soryo 's teenage romance series Mars , as " a bloody freak " whose " scary eyes " are " the reason why I 'm afraid of most manga . " )
In fact , no less a luminary of the Japanese comics world than Rumiko Takahashi spoofed this glamorously bug - eyed look for cartoon girls in the Urusei Yatsura OVA episode " The Terror of Girly - Eyes Measles " .
In this video , Ataru Moriboshi , the teenage - boy protagonist of the famous shonen science - fiction comedy series , becomes infected with an alien disease called " the Girl Measles " , which turns his eyes as huge and twinkling as those of many female manga and anime characters .
Although this condition , which strikes Ataru himself as distinctly grotesque , would seem to be something of a handicap to the high - school horndog 's usual girl - chasing ways , he manages to spread the highly contagious virus all over town anyway before the status quo is finally restored .
For the most part , it seems to be only in what could somewhat unfairly be described as teen soap opera - type shoujo manga such as Yoko Kamio 's Boys Over Flowers / Hana Yori Dango ( Viz ) , Miwa Ueda 's Peach Girl ( TOKYOPOP ) , and the aforementioned Mars ( TOKYOPOP ) that teenage girls ' or women 's eyes are consistently drawn as much as twice the size as those of boys .
This tends to be the case in such series whether the individual female character in question is actually as sensitive and sympathetic as the oversized " windows to her soul " suggest or not .
For instance , in Peach Girl , heroine Momo Adachi 's alleged best friend , Sae , is a two - faced backstabber who will literally stop at nothing to spoil Momo 's chances with Toji , the boy they both like .
Yet Sae 's eyes are drawn to look just as disproportionately enormous as those of the more genuinely loving and tender - hearted Momo herself .
The only exception that I am aware of to this strong correlation between manga which are largely dominated by teen romance and the shoujo technique of portraying the heroine 's eyes as literally the size of saucers is the work of Yumi Tamura , an unusually gritty shoujo artist whose thematic preoccupations have been compared to those of Frank Miller .
Although Rei , the Japanese Self - Defense Force rescue expert protagonist of Tamura 's recent series , Chicago ( Viz ) , is an adult , her perpetually glistening eyes are easily two or three times the size of those of any of the male characters in the strip .
If anything , the gender - based ocular discrepancy is even more pronounced in this series than it is in Tamura 's earlier political / post - apocalyse fantasy Basara ( Viz ) , in which the adolescent heroine spends much of the story masquerading as her dead dissident - leader twin brother .
The teen - romance manga 's dramatic difference in the portrayal of the adolescent female and male gaze is rendered even more noticeable by the fact that in such series the female characters ' eyes are drawn much rounder and with far more conspicuously dilated irises and pupils than those of their male counterparts .
Rei Kashino , the sensitive tough guy male lead of Mars , has eyes that are larger and more luxuriantly - lashed than those of the female characters in many other manga .
But they look downright ordinary in comparison to those of the shy , introverted heroine , Kira , whose eyes consist almost entirely of pupil and occupy such a disproportionate amount of her face that she resembles a more refined version of one of those notorious 1960 's Keane paintings of tragically bug - eyed waifs .
Although the sex - linked ocular dimorphism is not as obvious in non-shoujo works , in shonen ( boys ' ) manga as well , once characters hit the age of puberty , girls ' eyes generally tend to be depicted as at least slightly larger than those of boys , especially among supporting characters .
Interestingly , there are a number of significant exceptions to this rule among shonen manga involving junior high school students , even in series which are , or eventually become , essentially battle manga  i.e. , manga revolving around tournament - style combat ( such as Pokemon and the later installments of Yu - Gi - Oh ! and YuYu Hakusho ) or otherwise heavily involving fight scenes in virtually every episode .
For instance , in Kazuki Takahashi's manga version of Yu - Gi - Oh ! , currently being serialized in the English - language edition of Shonen Jump ( Viz ) , the disproportionately short , still neotenically childish - looking ( at least when not possessed by his adult ancient - pharaoh alternate personality ) hero , Yugi Mutuo , has eyes which are conspicuously larger than those of any of his classmates , including his female friend Anzu Mazaki ( Tea Gardner in the American version of the TV show ) .
In Nobuyuki Anzai's Flame of Recca ( Viz ) , Recca Hanabishi , a boisterous but chivalrous boy who dreams of becoming a ninja when he grows up the way a kid from a European background might fantasize about being a knight , is conspicuously scruffy and roughnecked in appearance and is usually depicted wearing a backwards baseball cap with a bristling shock of hair untidily sticking out of it .
However , in many scenes , the idealistic , compassionate Recca 's eyes are comparable in size to those of Yanagi Sakoshita , the shy , artistic girl whom he designates his " princess " and swears to serve as her personal shinobi , or ninja bodyguard .
In contrast , Tokiya Miyagami , his misguided swordsman schoolmate who becomes fixated on Yanagi because of her resemblance to his beloved dead sister , is a glamorous pretty - boy type , but has relatively small , narrow eyes .
Similarly , in Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto , also serialized in Shonen Jump , the title character , a goodhearted but mischievous boy who is widely regarded as a troublemaking pest by most of the people in the mythical village where he attends a sort of Hogwarts School for aspiring ninjas , has eyes which appear to be the same size or larger than those of Sakura , the pretty but snippy female classmate he has a crush on .
( In another interesting parallel to Flame of Recca , Naruto also has a narrow - eyed , but conspicuously better - looking , male rival in the form of his teammate Sasuke , although so far the personal conflict between them has played a much smaller role in the story than it does in the corresponding situation in Recca . )
However , both Recca and Naruto spend so much of the time with their eyes either squinting in suspicion or anger or crinkled shut with merriment that the surprisingly soulful relative largeness of the orbs in question is far easier to overlook than it is with the more strikingly obvious disparity in ocular size between teenage shoujo manga heroines and the boys and men around them .
Another shonen series featuring wide - eyed boys and a rather snippy girl is Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King , yet another of the manga being serialized in Shonen Jump .
The protagonist of this series , Yoh Asakura , is a laid back junior high school slacker type who is also a gifted medium and shaman capable of both communicating with and channeling the powers of ghosts such as the formidable fifteenth - century samurai Amidamaru .
Perhaps as a visible mark of their unusual receptivity to the spirit world , both Yoh and his rather panicky bookworm boy sidekick , Manta Oyamada ( Morty in the English - language version of the anime currently shown Saturday mornings on Fox ) , are usually depicted with noticeably large , round eyes .
In fact , the nebbishy Manta , who has just enough sixth sense to see , but not channel , ghosts , and is drawn in a more exaggeratedly cartoony style than most of the other characters , has bug eyes which are frequently rendered as simply lidless oversized circles with small dots for pupils .
( The most consistent difference between large - eyed boy characters in shonen series and their more conspicuously ocularly - overendowed shoujo teenage girl opposite numbers is that , even in the case of the enormous - eyed Yugi , the boys ' irises and pupils tend to be smaller in proportion to the overall size of their eyes .
Shoujo girl characters like Mars ' Kira and Hana Yori Dango's Tsukushi Makino , on the other hand , frequently have such immensely dilated - looking pupils that in some panels the whites of their eyes are barely visible . )
Shaman King 's main continuing female character , the peremptory Anna Kyoyama , in contrast , has heavy - lidded eyes which are usually portrayed half - closed with impatience or disdain .
However , it is clear from the shape of her eye sockets and high - arched brows that on the rare occasions when she fully opens her eyes , her gaze would be equally as wide as Yoh's .
This is only logical , since Anna , too , is a shaman , albeit of a type whose abilities are less suited to the supernaturally - powered battles involved in claiming the title of shaman king from which the series derives its name .
Accordingly , Anna , who has been betrothed to Yoh since childhood despite the fact that both of them are still only in junior high , has made it her mission in life to light a fire under the excessively easygoing
Yoh to ensure that he lives up to his potential .
Specifically , she is determined to make sure that he is in good enough shape to survive and triumph in the potentially deadly upcoming " shaman fight " worldwide competition  thus enabling her , as his fiancee , to become the first lady of the shaman world .
( Although Anna 's pushiness and unconcealed vicarious ambition can sometimes make her seem about as sympathetic as Peanuts ' Lucy Van Pelt on a bad day , especially in her initial appearances in the strip , in an interview in Shonen Jump No. 9 , creator Hiroyuki Takei advised the interviewer to " Please think of her as my signature character " and stated that the relationship between Yoh and Anna was " quite an ideal relationship " .
Presumably this all comes across somewhat differently to readers in Japan , where there is evidently great national reverence for take - charge nagging mother figures , whether or not this sort of personality would necessarily be the average shonen manga reader 's first choice for his fantasy fiancee . )
In at least one other shonen strip , Yushihiro Togashi's manga version of YuYu Hakusho ( also appearing in Shonen Jump ) , the protagonist , Yusuke Urameshi , starts out as a narrow - eyed sneering punk with few visible redeeming qualities .
However , after being fatally struck by a car while trying to save the life of a small child  an altruistic act so unexpected by the afterlife authorities that they are unable to decide what to do with him without further testing his mettle by means of a series of ghostly tasks and labors 
Yusuke gradually begins to temper his derisively defiant attitude .
As his afterlife experiences cause his personality to evolve in a more constructive direction , Yusuke 's eyes shift to a more stereotypically soulful shape and size as an outward sign of his spiritual growth .
The most basic constant in all of the examples above appears to be that however large the eyes of the protagonist ( and , occasionally , one or more other exceptional male characters such as Manta in Shaman King and Yugi 's equally short , large - eyed grandfather in Yu - Gi - Oh ! ) may be , most of the other boys and men in the strip will follow the " normal " pattern of having eyes which are noticeably smaller than those of the corresponding female characters .
In contrast with the more formulaically sex - linked " girl = naturally sensitive and emotional character = oversized eyes " approach typical of some of the more soap operatic shoujo teen romance manga , the more variegated range of ocular types among male characters in some shonen manga seems designed to subliminally clue in the audience that the one or two exceptionally large - eyed males have hidden depths and should be followed with particularly close attention .
( This would also explain at least one aspect of the unusual appearance of Kenshin Himura , the pacifist swordsman title character of Rurouni Kenshin , whose eyes are usually depicted as much larger and rounder than those of any of the other adult male characters in both the anime and the Nobuhiro Watsuki manga , except when he goes into warrior mode to actually do battle .
Under those circumstances , as with a number of the large - eyed boy characters discussed above , his eyes change to a more conventionally narrow male configuration . )
In this sense , individual variations in eye size among male characters in shonen manga can be seen as a somewhat less obtrusive analogue of the floating flowers which , among other functions , often show up in the background in shoujo manga to spotlight the heroine and other significant characters soon after they first appear ( per Matt Thorn 's " Shoujo Manga : Comics by Women for Girls of All Ages , " Part2 ) .
As a further gender - stereotyped corollary to the " eyes as windows of the sensitive soul " concept , adult female characters also generally have larger eyes than men .
However , as with most such stylistic " special effects " in manga and anime , there is considerable variation from artist to artist , and sometimes even from panel to panel , in the range and degree of expressive distortion employed to distinguish different types of characters ocularly .
For example , in Maki Murakami's Gravitation ( TOKYOPOP ) , scathing - tongued romance novelist Eiri Yuki and his bossy , manipulative older sister Mika both have conspicuously narrower eyes than a number of the more warm - hearted characters , including Mika 's noticeably large - eyed husband , Tohma Seguchi , who is at least outwardly much more considerate and concerned about others ' feelings than she is .
Similarly , in FAKE , volume three , when brash , tough - cookie FBI agent Diana Spacey first appears , barging into a New York City police station insisting on being directed to the chief of detectives ' office , her eyes appear to be slightly smaller than those of Detective Randy " Ryo " Maclean , the more gentlemanly of the series ' two cop protagonists .
( This makes perfect sense , since Ryo is possibly the world 's most empathetic and nurturing police officer of either gender , to the point that at the end of the first story arc he more or less adopts
Bikky , the ten - year - old street urchin son of a drug dealer whose murder Ryo and his partner , Dee Laytner , had been investigating . )
However , in subsequent scenes throughout the story , both Diana 's and Ryo's eyes , along with those of most of the other characters , change apparent size for dramatic effect depending on the situation and emotional context .
Similarly , in the Trigun , volume one , scene alluded to previously , as Vash reflects back on his own childhood after the latest narrowly - averted crisis , his eyes momentarily appear to be as innocently large as those of the young boy who has just helped him foil the Bad Lad Gang 's attempt to hijack and crash the sandsteamer .
However , neither this nor his usual innocuous , happy - go - lucky demeanor prevent Vash from occasionally assuming a quite convincing version of the more stereotypical steely - eyed gaze one might expect from a notorious outlaw with a sixty billion double dollar bounty on his head .
This often - exaggerated expressive variability in characters ' appearance is just one example of the wider range of the visual vocabulary of manga and anime compared to that of most mainstream English - language comics .
The much more extensive range of mood - setting " special effects " and strategically - distorted character designs employed in most manga and anime has virtually no counterpart in most areas of the American comics universe beyond the expressionistic architecture of some artists ' rendition of Gotham City and the theatrically chameleonic variations in shape and length often assumed by Batman 's cape at particularly dramatic moments .
The stylistically Silly Putty - ish techniques of most Japanese manga artists tend to have far more in common with the surrealistic extremes of , say , old Warner Brothers cartoons featuring Elmer Fudd , Daffy Duck , and Bugs Bunny than they do with the more limited , " realistic " palette of most mainstream American comic books and even non -gag - a - day daily comic strips .

ST .
LOUIS–A boy allegedly abducted in a custody dispute nearly two years ago has turned up alive , hiding with his mother in a small , specially built secret room at his grandmother 's Illinois home , investigators said .
Richard " Ricky " Chekevdia , who turns 7 on Sept. 14 , was in good spirits and physically fit after being found Friday by investigators with a court order to search the two - story rural home in southern Illinois ' Franklin County , about 120 miles southeast of St. Louis .
The boy 's mother , 30 - year - old Shannon Wilfong , is charged with felony child abduction .
The grandmother , 51 - year - old Diane Dobbs , is charged with aiding and abetting .
Wilfong remained jailed Saturday on $ 42,500 bond in Benton , Ill. , where Dobbs was being held on $ 1,000 bond .
The boy was staying Saturday with one of his father 's relatives while state child - welfare workers investigated claims the father abused the child before his disappearance – allegations rejected by the dad , who 's thrilled the agonizing search has ended .
" Two years ?
You have no idea , " Mike Chekevdia , a 48 - year - old former police officer who 's a lieutenant colonel in the Illinois National Guard , told The Associated Press by telephone Saturday from his house in Royalton , Ill. , some three miles from the home where his son turned up .
" I 've lost sleep .
I 've lost weight .
I 've gained weight .
I would n't wish this on anybody . ''
After hearing his son had been found , Chekevdia said , " you could have knocked me over with a feather . ''
Chekevdia won temporary custody of his son shortly before the boy and his mother – Chekevdia 's former girlfriend – disappeared in November 2007 .
Chekevdia said he long suspected his son was being stowed by Dobbs , although there were no signs of the boy at her home when it was searched with her consent after his disappearance .
Wilfong was charged the next month with abducting the child but could n't be found .
For much of the time since , Chekevdia said , the windows of Dobbs ' home were blocked off by drawn shades or other items , presumably to prevent anyone from peeking inside .
" I had a firm belief he was in there , and yesterday it was confirmed , " Chekevdia said .
Investigators , during a news conference Friday , did not detail what led sheriff 's deputies and federal marshals with a search warrant to Dobbs ' house Friday , when they found the boy and his mother in a hideaway roughly 5 feet by 12 feet and about the height of a washing machine .
" We let him out of the ( patrol ) car and he ran around like he'd never seen outdoors .
It was actually very sad , " Illinois State Police Master Sgt. Stan Diggs said .
" He was very happy to be outside .
He said he never goes outside . ''
" Surprisingly , " Diggs added , " Ricky is in very good spirits .
For someone who 's been isolated in that house with no other outside beings , he 's a very social , very polite , very talkative little boy . ''
Dobbs , the grandmother , told the Southern Illinoisan newspaper of Carbondale , Ill. , last year that her daughter had been forced into hiding to keep the child from his father .
Dobbs called the dispute a " nightmare for all of us " and insisted her daughter had difficulty getting authorities to help .
Chekevdia , eager to get his son back in school and to a dentist , said waiting for Ricky to resurface required patience .
" It 's hard to sit back and watch things happen when you 're used to making things happen , " he said .
" But I just bided my time and let the system work . ''

Six - in - ten ( 61 percent ) workers report they always or usually live paycheck to paycheck just to make ends meet , up from 49 percent last year and 43 percent in 2007 .
This is according to a new nationwide survey of more than 4,400 workers by CareerBuilder .
Three - in - ten ( 30 percent ) workers with salaries of $ 100,000 or more report that they too live paycheck to paycheck , up from 21 percent in 2008 .
Some workers are making ends meet by dipping into their long - term savings .
More than one - in - five ( 21 percent ) workers say they have reduced their 401 ( k ) contributions or personal savings in the last six months to get by .
Looking at workers earning six figures or more , a nearly equal number ( 23 percent ) report that they have also reduced their 401 ( k ) or savings .
While some workers are tapping into their long - term accounts , others are having a hard time saving anything at all .
More than one - third ( 36 percent ) of workers say they do not participate in any programs such as 401( k ) , IRAs or retirement plans , up from 31 percent in 2008 .
In addition , one - third ( 33 percent ) report that they do n’t put any money aside into their savings each month , up from 25 percent in 2008 , while 30 percent set aside $ 100 or less per month for savings and 16 percent save less than $ 50 .
“ Workers are employing a variety of tactics to help make ends meet in this economy , ” said Rosemary Haefner , vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder .
“ Whether it ’s by keeping a tighter budget , finding ways to bring in additional income or adjusting their savings strategies , workers are doing their best to weather the current storm .
These good financial habits will not only help workers in the short - term , but better position them for the future . ”
Haefner offers the following tips for riding out the economic downturn and preparing for the future :
Keep track of spending – Create a spreadsheet to analyze what you spend each month , including the money spent on those inevitable invisible expenses , such as a morning coffee , cab ride or afternoon snack .
Once you can see where your money goes , you can clearly see where you can cut back .
Boost your income – One - in - ten workers report taking on a second job in this economy to help make ends meet . *
Ask yourself if this is something you can handle on top of your current job and then pursue some viable options .
Check out sites like www.sologig.com for contract and freelance opportunities .
Speak up – Talk to your HR department and see what is available to help you save on your monthly expenses .
Even though times are tough , companies are still offering flexible spending accounts , wellness benefits , retail discounts , transit reimbursement and more .

Heavy periods can cause a lot of pain for some women
Too many women may be undergoing hysterectomies for heavy periods when alternative treatments should be considered first , a study suggests .
An audit of 51,500 women in England found large variations in the type of surgery done for the condition .
Overall , four in 10 women had a hysterectomy , but regional figures ranged from 25 % to 54 % .
Experts said women may not be given enough information about the treatment options available .
Heavy menstrual bleeding , also called menorrhagia , can be caused by conditions such as endometriosis , fibroids and hormonal imbalance , and can severely impair a women 's quality of life .
Women need to be informed of the risks and benefits of each surgical option before decisions are made
Dr Tahir Mahmood , RCOG
There are drug treatments available , but if the condition continues to be a problem , national guidance recommends a type of minor surgery which removes a layer from inside the womb .
This technique , known as endometrial ablation , is associated with less risk than a hysterectomy which is recommended only as " a last option " .
The audit published in BJOG : An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology looked at rates of surgery for both options between 2003 and 2006 .
The researchers from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) found a four - fold difference overall in the use of surgery between different primary care trusts in England .
And the proportion of endometrial ablation operations varied from 46 % to 75 % .
Common
It is estimated that around one in 20 women aged 30 to 49 years old go to their GP each year because of heavy periods .
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) say women should be given full information about the range of treatments available before considering irreversible operations such as hysterectomy .
But the researchers said the variation shown in the study suggests this is not happening .
Dr David Cromwell , from the Health Services Research Unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : " The rates of hysterectomy have gone down in recent years but what we still find concerning is this four - fold variation between the regions . "
The RCOG is due to begin a further national audit to look into the treatment women are getting .
Dr Tahir Mahmood , vice president of standards at the College , said there had been moves towards more conservative treatments .
" This research shows how current NICE guidelines may not always be followed .
" Why this is the case has been the object of some speculation but we have good evidence now of the substantial variation in surgical treatment across the regions .
" Women need to be informed of the risks and benefits of each surgical option before decisions are made . "

Rare meteorite find in Australian outback
Scientists have discovered a rare kind of meteorite in outback Western Australia , which could hold clues about the origin of our solar system .
The findings are published in today 's edition of the journal Science .
Planetary scientist Dr Philip Bland , of Imperial College London , says they tracked the meteor as it travelled through the atmosphere and then plotted where it landed on Earth .
Bland says the meteorite was found within 100 metres of the predicted site of the fall .
The meteorite , called Bunburra Rockhole , is a melted basalt , which is the size of a cricket ball , he says .
Bland says they tracked the meteor using a network of observatories across the Nullarbor Plain , which stretches across southern Australia .
The observatories are part of a trial experiment that records images of the night sky and track falling objects such as meteors .
First find
The Bunburra Rockhole was the first meteorite find for the camera network .
CSIRO Exploration and Mining scientist and co-author Dr Rob Hough , of says the search for the meteorite was helped by the fact the Nullarbor Plain is marked by white limestone rocks .
" A dark meteorite on the white surface is easier to find , however it 's very tiny , so the discovery is still quite amazing , " says Hough .
Bland says because they can trace the meteor 's orbit , they can calculate not only where they land , but also where they came from .
He says only a handfull of meteorites found on Earth have had their orbit 's traced .
According to Bland most meteors come from the asteroid belt - a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter .
The asteroid belt contains a mixture of rocks , ranging in size from dust - like particles through to miniature - planets , which orbit around the Sun , he says .
" It 's rubble that did n't accrete into a planet . "
Not from Vesta
Bland says most basalt meteorites , like the one found in the Nullarbor , originate from a large asteroid called Vesta .
But the Bunburra Rockhole meteorite is different .
" Our little guy ca n't be from Vesta , the composition is all wrong , " he says .
Bland says his colleague , Bill Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado , developed a computer model to identify where in the asteroid belt different meteorites come from .
Bottke 's model suggests that when the solar system was forming the objects in the inner region of the solar system would have melted at some point .
Over time , these objects slowly migrated further away from the Sun .
" But there was a lot of other stuff out there at the time and these melted objects got battered around , " says Bland , with only the survivors of this battering making it into the asteroid belt .
Bottke 's model predicts that these survivors should be in the inner-most part of the asteroid belt , he says .
" That 's exactly where our little guy comes from . "
Bland says the find is really exciting because it gives clues about the early solar system .
The researchers are currently analysing the meteorite to more accurately detemine its age .
Bland believes the meteorite might also provide additional clues on how the inner planets formed .
" There might be other processes that went into making planets like the Earth , Mars and Venus , " he says .

David M. Herszenhorn , on Capitol Hill , and Katharine Q. Seelye , in New York , live blogged the president ’s speech and reaction tonight .
President Obama laid out themes of “ security and stability ” in an effort to reassure Americans about his health care plans .
Advance text of the speech .
Katharine Q. Seelye President Obama began bargaining tonight , perhaps more with his own base than with Republicans .
He paved the way for some compromises , especially on the public option .
That may satisfy some Blue Dogs but may cost him some liberals .
On the other hand , where are those liberals going to go ?
Probably not to the Republicans , whose reactions during the speech — with Representative Joe Wilson yelling out “ You Lie ! ” and another checking his BlackBerry — only highlighted the anger that has swept portions of the Capitol .
So did the cynical laughter that greeted his remark that some “ significant details ” still need to be “ ironed out . ”
Of course , many details remain to be ironed out .
And many questions persist :
Did he reassure those who are happy with their insurance that an overhaul is worth the effort ?
Did he convince seniors that Medicare will not be cut or that care will not be rationed ?
What effect will the speech have , if any , on the Senate Finance Committee ?
For Mr. Obama , the campaign continues , with remarks on Thursday and a rally in Minneapolis on Saturday .
But the speech also had its distracting moments , especially Mr. Wilson ’s outburst and the poignant mentions of Senator Kennedy and his family , including the mention of the letter Mr. Obama received from the senator .
From Jeff Zeleny : Mr. Wilson issued these comments afterward : “ This evening I let my emotions get the best of me .
While I disagree with the president ’s statement , my comments were inappropriate and regrettable .
I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility . ”
Mr. Wilson ’s outburst caused Obama to pause briefly and say , “ That ’s not true . ”
Behind him House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be seen glaring in Wilson ’s direction , but there was no move by Democratic leaders to censure Mr. Wilson .
First lady Michelle Obama , in the visitors ’ gallery , shook her head from side to side disapprovingly .
Neither the House nor the Senate health care overhaul bills would provide coverage for illegal immigrants , the mention by the president that prompted Mr. Wilson ’s comment .
Related articles — an overview by Jeff Zeleny and Sheryl Stolberg ; details of the plan by Jackie Calmes and Robert Pear .
David Kirkpatrick Chip Kahn , top lobbyist for the for - profit hospitals ’
Federation of
American Hospitals , watched the president ’s speech tonight .
A Republican , Mr. Kahn stressed how Mr. Obama carefully parsed his support still for a public insurance option .
Doctors and hospitals strongly
oppose such a program because they fear it could drive private insurers out of business , especially if it were paying Medicare rates or under the control of a federal health department .
Mr. Obama ’s call for a public plan , however , omitted any discussion of what rates it might pay or who might control it , and at one point he referred to it only as a “ not for profit ” as opposed to government
plan .
“ It is the payment of Medicare rates that is the issue for us , the control by government fiat ! , ” Mr. Kahn said .
“ He worded it really carefully , because he said ‘ not for profit ’ and he did n’t say it had
to be controlled by the government , ” Mr. Kahn added .
“ The way he described it , we could support that ! ”
Doug Mills / The New York Times
An outburst by one of the House members during Mr. Obama ’s speech has caused a little bit of a flap , and we ’re still trying to sort out the details .
But The Times ’s Carl Hulse reported that Representative Joe Wilson , Republican of South Carolina , shouted out that the president lied as Mr. Obama asserted that his health care plan would not cover illegal immigrants .
From Mr. Hulse :
Following the speech , Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , approached lawmakers on the floor to ask who had accused Mr. Obama of lying .
Mr. Emanuel was told it was Representative Wilson .
“ No president ever has been treated like that , ever , ” Mr. Emanuel told reporters .
Later on CNN television interviews , Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , called for Mr. Wilson to apologize , saying it would be disrespectul in any forum .
Jackie Calmes points to the biography of Mr. Wilson in CQ’s “ Politics in America , ” which includes this line : “ Wilson ’s sharp and careless remarks sometimes land him in hot water . ”
One example listed was Mr. Wilson ’s constant criticisms of Senator John Kerry during the Democrat ’s presidential campaign , and even includes a reference to Mr. Wilson ’s characterization of the news that Strom Thurmond had fathered a daughter with a black woman .
Even after the longtime Republican senator ’s family acknowledged the paternity , Mr. Wilson called the notion a “ smear on the image ” of Mr. Thurmond .
Mr. Wilson , 62 , whose district runs from the coastal border of Georgia into central South Carolina , from Hilton Head to Columbia , was first elected to the House in 2001 .
Katharine Q. Seelye
On CNN , Senator John McCain basks in the re-run of Mr. Obama ’s shout - out to him , and he says soothingly that “ there are a lot of things we can agree on . ”
But Mr. Obama ’s proposal for pilot projects on altering the malpractice system is not one of them .
A pilot project , Mr. McCain said , “ does n’t get it , ” in terms of limiting suits and costs .
He also said that Mr. Obama ’s allusion to Mrs. Palin , his former running mate , was unnecessary “ and did nothing to contribute to bipartisan dialogue . ”
But he went mavericky on her charge that the Democrats would create “ death panels . ”
Asked if he believed there would be such panels , Mr. McCain said no .
Katharine Q. Seelye
Here ’s something that the administration will take as encouragement — a neutral statement from Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine .
In other words , unlike many other Republicans , she did n’t trash Mr. Obama ’s speech .
She , of course , is one of the very few ( perhaps two or three )
Republicans who may be in the persuadable camp ( the other being her Maine colleague , Olympia Snowe ) .
Ms. Collins said in her statement that she was deeply concerned about the price tag of any overhaul , but concluded on this non-committal note : “ The Senate Finance Committee continues to work to come up with bipartisan legislation that addresses these concerns .
I look forward to seeing what its negotiations produce . ”
In this debate , non-committal might be considered a win .
Katharine Q. Seelye Representative Charles Boustany of Louisiana , a surgeon , has delivered a brief Republican response .
He has the same problem typical of those who deliver such responses ( and not , in his case , just relative anonymity ) — he is standing by himself somewhere , without the animation that comes from interacting with a live audience .
At the same time , Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee , put out a statement summing up the Republican view : “ The president has proven his ability again to speak very well and say very little .
He continued to try and sell his government - run health care experiment even though it will increase costs , increase taxes and increase the deficit . ”
From Bernie Becker “ Republicans are ready – and we ’ve been ready – to work with the president for common - sense reforms that our nation can afford , ” said Dr. Boustany , now in his third term representing a district in southwestern Louisiana , adding “ it ’s clear the American people want health care reform , but they want their elected leaders to get it right . ”
Dr. Boustany talked of four areas where he thought there was an opportunity for consensus , including ensuring everyone has access to coverage and allowing insurers to offer wellness incentives .
But as his Republican colleagues have been doing for weeks , Dr. Boustany also stood firm against increased government involvement in the health care system .
“ Replacing your family ’s current health care with government - run health care is not the answer , ” he said .
“ In fact , it ’ll make health care much more expensive . ”
David M. Herszenhorn Lawmakers are still milling about the House chamber , but the Republican Senate leader , Mitch McConnell , has already issued a statement trashing the president ’s proposals and urging him to take up Republican ideas instead .
“ The false choice between a massive government takeover , or no reform at all , is one that has been soundly rejected across the country , ” Mr. McConnell said in the statement .
For the moment , it seems , Mr. Obama ’s belief that partisan acrimony can be surmounted will have to wait for another day .
The president ’s speech lasted 47 minutes .
He closes on a strong note :
What was true then remains true today .
I understand how difficult this health care debate has been .
I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them .
I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road – to defer reform one more year , or one more election , or one more term .
But that ’s not what the moment calls for .
That ’s not what we came here to do .
We did not come to fear the future .
We came here to shape it .
I still believe we can act even when it ’s hard .
I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility , and gridlock with progress .
I still believe we can do great things , and that here and now we will meet history ’s test .
Doug Mills / The New York Times
David M. Herszenhorn Mr. Obama is speaking emotionally now about the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy and his passion for providing universal health insurance to Americans .
And the president just gave an important shout - out to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the senior Republican on the Finance Committee and a lead negotiator in the effort to broker a compromise health care bill .
The TV cameras are showing Mr. Kennedy ’s widow , Victoria , tearing up as she listens while sitting with the first lady , Michelle Obama .
Mr. Kennedy ’s children are also in attendance .
Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
Katharine Q. Seelye Perhaps surprisingly , Mr. Obama makes a nod to the clamor for changing the malpractice system ( a k a tort reform ) .
This is one way of showing he is open to Republicans .
He says that changing malpractice will not be a silver bullet , but he knows that doctors practice defensive medicine , which helps drive up costs .
So , he said , he would support a Bush idea of demonstration projects in individual states to test some ideas about “ how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine . ”
Just recently , Howard Dean , the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee , noted that members of his party do n’t want to tackle this issue because of the powerful trial lawyers lobby .
David M. Herszenhorn Mr. Obama was just trying to make one of the toughest arguments in the health care debate but perhaps one of the most important : that better medical care is often cheaper medical care and that government spending on Medicare can be reduced substantially not by limiting treatment and care for Americans over 65 , but by providing more effective and better coordinated care .
Many Americans over 65 are worried that proposed Medicare cuts would limit their access to care .
The president tries to reassure them : “ So do n’t pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut – especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past , and just this year supported a budget that would have essentially turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program .
That will never happen on my watch .
I will protect Medicare . ”
Carl Hulse , the Times ’s chief Congressional correspondent , is in the House chamber and says the mood is extremely tense , with very sparse Republican applause .
Katharine Q. Seelye
He may be walking the wire , but he just dumped his “ progressive friends . ”
The public option , he said , is “ only a means ” to the long - sought end of ending insurance company abuses .
“ And we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal . ”
Fiscal conservatives join with Democrats in jumping to their feet and applauding when Mr. Obama promises his plan wo n’t add a dime to the deficit .
The camera focuses in closely on Senator Olympia Snowe , Republican from Maine , who is considered a critical vote for Democrats on this issue but also often raises the financial ledger in discussing how to pay for initiatives .
David Herszenhorn
“ It is a lie , plain and simple , ” Mr. Obama says about the charge that health care legislation would create “ death panels ” to counsel the elderly to forgo care near the end of their lives .
But almost as shocking as that false allegation is that Mr. Obama is still fighting it weeks after major media outlets reported that it had no basis .
Mr. Obama says he does n’t want to put private insurance companies out of business .
“ I just want to hold them accountable , ” he said , as be begins a careful tight - rope on the issue of creating a government - run health care plan , a so - called public option .
What ’s clear from the speech is that Mr. Obama is willing to settle for a public option on a so - called “ trigger ” that is , a public plan would kick in only if the health care legislation fails to provide affordable insurance for a sufficient number of Americans .
Liberals will likely be disappointed .
Republicans will probably not be appeased .
It ’s a walk on a wire , but he seems to be keeping his balance .
David M. Herszenhorn
A seemingly genuine smile and applause from his old opponent , John McCain , as Mr. Obama says low - cost insurance should quickly be made available to hose who need it , even before the major provisions of any overhaul take effect in four to five years .
Katharine Q. Seelye Republicans may be applauding , some , at the big clarion calls .
But elsewhere , they are more critical .
The Republican National Committee , for example , notes that Mr. Obama has said that “ the health care problem is the deficit problem , ” and adds : “ Too bad his government - run health care experiment will just make it worse . ”
Light chuckles erupt in the audience as the president suggests , grinning , that there are just a few details left to be ironed out in his plan .
David Herszenhorn
“ That ’s what Americans can expect from this plan , more security and more stability . ”
Security and stability seem to be a refrain in this speech , reflecting a keen awareness on the part of the White House that Americans feel deeply uncertain about the prospects of sweeping health care legislation .
But Mr. Obama still faces the challenge of presenting enough detail to reassure folks who already have insurance and worry they have more to lose than to gain from any changes .
David Herszenhorn
“ The time for bickering is over , ” Mr. Obama declared .
And there was notable applause from Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , and Judd Gregg , Republican of New Hampshire , two of the most earnest members of the Senate who disdain bickering but neither has expressed support for the Democratic proposals on health care .
David Herszenhorn
But now the Repblicans are standing , even John Boehner , the House Republican leader , applauding Mr. Obama ’s assertion that it ’s better to build on the existing system than start from scratch .
Katharine Q. Seelye
Who needs Pilates if you ’re a Democrat and in the House tonight ?
The members of President Obama ’s party are getting plenty of exercise , standing up and applauding at numerous lines of his speech .
Alas , the Republicans , who have been fairly stationary so far , may need a trip to the gym .
David Herszenhorn Mr. Obama is making his initial pitch to the 180 million Americans who currently have health insurance — stressing the risks to every American that they could lose their coverage if they lose or change their jobs , or for any number of technical reasons .
Many of these Americans are among those showing up in polls who do n’t really understand what ’s in the bill for them , or “ what ’s in this for me ? ” as Mr. Obama asked in an earlier speech .
And now we are starting to hear the bitter pill : Americans pay more for health care than people in any other country but get worse results .
Those facts are indisputable .
But another problem is that even if health care legislation is adopted , Americans will still likely pay for more health care than people in any other developed country .
The president has just given the requisite nod to Representative John Dingell of Michigan , the most senior member of the House , and a champion of a health care overhaul .
His father began introducing bills for overarching health care decades ago , and Mr. Dingell continues to do so , the president notes .
David Herszenhorn Mr. Obama ’s opening comments , about the improvements in the economy — “ we have pulled this economy back from the brink ” — are not just a bit of self - praise for his administration and Congressional Democrats but rather a pointed reminder that not a single House Republican voted for his economic stimulus package .
And so his opening would seem to be a warning to Republicans who so far have opposed his health care proposals .

The sergeant - at - arms announces his arrival into the House chamber : “ The president of the United States . ” Mr. Obama enters the chamber at 8:11 , along with Senator Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader , grinning rather uncomfortably behind him .
And not quite glad - handing his colleagues the way Mr. Obama is .
Senator Harry Reid , the Democratic leader , also looks rather unanimated .
Mr. Obama has an embrace — and kiss — for Mrs. Clinton .
He whispers in her ear and they share a laugh .
His introductory applause as he walked the aisle and reached the podium lasted a full five minutes .
Katharine Q. Seelye Members of the Cabinet , including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , have arrived and are making their way down the aisle .
It is interesting to see Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , in a fire - engine red suit .
She was so associated with health care for so long — not exactly to her advantage — but has been totally absent from the current debate .
Is anyone else wondering whether she has talked with President Obama about health care ?
Lately ?
It was one of the few policy areas that the two disagreed on during the Democratic primaries .
And speaking of her husband , former President Bill Clinton , he too gave a joint speech to Congress about health care in 1993 .
At our sib - blog , Economix , Catherine Rampell looked at sections of Mr. Clinton ’s address that might serve Mr. Obama well 16 years later .

The level of rebuttal and pre-buttal flying around the Web is rather dizzying tonight .
It reflects how high the stakes are .
And it reflects just how many moving parts there are to a big national debate .
And , of course , it reflects the sophistication on both sides of the spin machines , honed during recent presidential campaigns .
But here is an “ oh , really ? ” moment .
On MSNBC , Senator Dick Durbin , Democrat of Illinois , was asked if he explained to his junior colleague , Barack Obama , that “ the politics of governing are about a thousand times more complicated than the politics of campaigning ? ”
Mr. Durbin replied : “ Well , we did sit down and talk .
And believe me , his experience in the Illinois State Senate prepared him for the rough and tumble of Congress on Capitol Hill . ”
Really ?
David Herszenhorn
The president ’s speech has n’t even started but a sub - theme of his talk is already clear : do it for Teddy .
Senator Edward M. Kennedy , the Massachusetts Democrat who died of brain cancer last month , was a strong advocate for overhauling the health care system .
And Mr. Kennedy ’s family will be at the Capitol tonight in a strong showing of support for Mr. Obama .
Mr. Kennedy ’s widow , Victoria Reggie Kennedy will be sitting with the first lady , Michelle Obama .
And Mr. Kennedy ’s children will be special guests of the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi .
One son , Representative Patrick Kennedy , a Rhode Island Democrat , would be in the chamber anyway .
Ted Kennedy , Jr. will be in the speaker ’s box along with his sister , Kara Kennedy , and two
of Senator Kennedy ’s grandchildren , Grace Kennedy Allen , 14 , and Max Greathouse Allen , 12 .
Mr. Obama is almost certain to pay tribute to Senator Kennedy in his speech .
And with so many family members in the audience the message is clear : health care is a legacy issue for
Mr. Kennedy , the former chairman of the Senate health committee .
David Herszenhorn
The Senate , led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is arriving now in the House chamber .
Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader , seems unusually chipper .
Max Baucus , the chairman of the Finance Committee and a leading architect of the health care legislation is smiling tightly and shaking hands .
( Here ’s what Mr. Baucus had to say earlier today . )
Katharine Q. Seelye
We asked our readers yesterday to tell us what they would like to hear President Obama say tonight .
The main thing is , they want him to be very specific about what he wants .
In that , they are no different from members of Congress , especially Democrats who are trying to defend his goals .
From the excerpts of Mr. Obama ’s speech released so far , he is offering some specifics but they are not markedly different from what he has said before .
Here ’s what one reader wrote : “ It ’s not good enough to say that there will be no rationing when funding is getting cut by hundreds of billions .
It ’s not believable if he says that we will pay for the healthcare for 47 million people ( at $ 10k / person , i/e. $ 470 billion / year x 10 years = $ 4.7 trillion ) – and that this will be paid for by finding ‘ efficiency ’ .
Bah . ”
At the same time , some readers are fed up with numbers : “ Keep it simple , ” one advised .
“ If he starts pulling all kinds of numbers out of the air I ’m going to be pulling my hair out . ”
Clearly , President Obama is facing a tough audience tonight .
There are a couple of other common threads running through the comments .
Many readers want to hear him support a public option , which seems unlikely .
Some think he should extend Medicare , which also seems unlikely .
“ President Obama should adhere to his moral pronouncements and do the right thing : a public option for competition and universal coverage as a RIGHT , not a privilege , for those who ca n’t afford the premiums that insurers impose , ” another reader wrote .
Readers also like the idea of overhauling the malpractice insurance situation , an issue that has been raised repeatedly at the town - hall - style meetings .
“ Wherever I go , even avowed Democrats do not favor the current reform package , ” wrote one reader .
“ They want to see tort reform , more competition from the insurers themselves and less government . ”
In a preview from the Capitol , David Herszenhorn offers us the leadup to tonight ’s speech on health care reform :
Even before a few snippets of President Obama ’s big speech on health care were released by the White House on Wednesday evening , many lawmakers and staff members on Capitol Hill were in full battle mode .
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the senior Republican on the Finance Committee and a lead negotiator on the health care legislation , issued a statement urging Mr. Obama to use his speech to promise that he will not pursue a government - run health insurance plan .
“ To start building the kind of legislation that could win the support of 70 to 80 senators , the President needs to demonstrate that he ’ll fight , through the end , for a proposal that reaches common goals without creating government health care . ”
Mr. Grassley also used his pre-speech statement to level blistering criticism at the versions of health care legislation approved by the Senate health committee , and by three committees in the House of Representatives .
Democrats , meanwhile , sharpened their daggers and took aim at Representative Charles Boustany of Louisiana , a former cardiac surgeon who was tapped to give the Republican response to Mr. Obama ’s speech .
The Democrats circulated copies of a video in which Mr. Boustany seemed to support the so - called “ birthers , ” whose claims about the legitimacy of Mr. Obama ’s Hawaiian birth certificate have been largely discredited .
Democrats also pointed to malpractice suits brought against Mr. Boustany during his medical career ( few doctors are not sued ) , and distributed excerpts of interviews in which he seemed to make comments critical of Republicans on the health care issue .
In terms of defining the camps , some Congressional Democrats and White House officials have expressed hope that retiring Republican lawmakers might be more likely to sign on to compromise health care legislation .
But one of those departing Republicans , Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio , lashed out even before Mr. Obama had said a word :
“ To date , many of his ideas have lacked vital details and have left me with more questions than answers .
I am pleased that he has pledged to clear up the ‘ ambiguity ’ tonight , and I hope my questions will finally be addressed . ”
Mr. Voinovich also complained that Mr. Obama , in his public remarks on health care , rarely if ever mentions medical malpractice lawsuits as a factor in the nation ’s high health care costs – a criticism echoed by many other Republicans .
Details of the president ’s plans were not revealed in early excerpts released by the White House , but the advanced text indicates that he will try to appeal to those who have differed — sometimes vehemently — with him :
“ Well , the time for bickering is over .
The time for games has passed .
Now is the season for action .
Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together , and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do .
Now is the time to deliver on health care .
The excerpts also included a warning to some of the president ’s opponents : “ Know this .
I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it ’s better politics to kill this plan than improve it .
I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are .
If you misrepresent what ’s in the plan , we will call you out .
And I will not accept the status quo as a solution .
Not this time .
Not now . ”
Many Congressional Democrats are extremely eager for Mr. Obama to express more specific preferences about the health care legislation , which they believe may help to resolve some outstanding internal disagreements among Democrats on many different issues .
The excerpts suggest that Mr. Obama will deliver at least some specifics as he outlines his plan for overhauling the health care system .
But of course there is peril in getting too specific , especially as negotiators in the Senate continue to work on a bipartisan compromise .
In the Capitol , the House chamber is ready .
Security has been extra tight all day .
And there will be special guests , including Victoria Reggie Kennedy , the widow of Senator Edward M. Kennedy , sitting in the box with the first lady , Michelle Obama .
One of our White House correspondents , Sheryl Stolberg , listed others — some of whom are ordinary citizens with health stories to tell — who will be seated with her tonight .
Mr. Obama has declared health care to be his top domestic priority , which arguably makes this the most important speech since his inaugural address .
Colleague Katharine Q. Seelye looked at other presidents and how they ’ve used joint addresses during times of crises , and some not .
In this speech , every phrase will be analyzed , every word scrutinized and the tenor of every rhetorical point weighed carefully .
( Minute by minute actually , with not only journalists but even the Cato Institute and the Republican National Committee live blogging the speech , and with Democrats offering rapid response . )
The question , of course , is can Mr. Obama make the big sell , not just to Congress but to the American public .
Stay tuned .
The computer gaming industry is not pleased with comments that AT&T filed with the Federal Communications Commission on how to define " broadband , " particularly the suggestion that online games should be relegated to the category of " aspirational services . "
" For Americans who today have no terrestrial broadband service at all , " AT&T wrote the FCC , " the pressing concern is not the ability to engage in real - time , two - way gaming , but obtaining meaningful access to the Internet ’s resources and to reliable email communications and other basic tools that most of the country has come to expect as a given . "
This did not sit well with Kenneth L. Doroshow , Senior Vice President of the Entertainment Software Association .
" What AT&T describes as aspirational services are no less important to the future of the Internet than email and web browsing were to the past and are today , " he told the Commission on Wednesday .
They 're used for employee training and in schools , he noted .
" Online video games are a meaningful part of our participative culture .
They remove geographic barriers , connecting people from across the country and around the world .
They teach cooperation , cultivate leadership skills , and empower users to express their creativity . "
AT&T did acknowledge that the capacity to play games should be included in a larger definition of broadband .
But at present , the concept " should take the form of a baseline definition of the capabilities needed to support the applications and services Americans must access to participate in the Internet economy — " the company wrote , " to learn , train for jobs , and work online . "
AT&T's " minimal set of applications " includes the ability to use email , instant messaging , and basic Web surfing .
" It also should include the ability to engage in Internet - based education programs , interact with Internet based government services , and participate in online energy , healthcare , and public - safety programs . "
But as Doroshow points out , interactive games are already used for employee training and in schools .
" Entertaining does not mean trivial , " he wrote .
Is gaming " civic " ?
So is there a case for seeing two - way gaming as central to a definition of broadband ?
The cooperation / leadership argument may not be the strongest point , at least not if the implication is that games make gamers more helpful to society .
A Pew Internet and American Life study released last September on Teens , Video Games and Civics concluded that almost all teens ( 97 % ) play computer , Web , portable , or console games for sure .
And over a quarter of these kids play with others connected to the Internet .
But Pew also found that the most common civic behavior teens displayed while playing was helping others learn the game of the moment .
Linking the play experience to moral , ethical , or social issues took place much less frequently .
" There is little evidence to support the idea that playing video games , in general , is associated with a vibrant civic or political life , " the survey concluded .
On the other hand , Pew did notice that teens tended to link gaming to civic issues more often when playing together in the same physical place , rather than when playing alone or with others online .
Enjoying games together , they were more likely to look online for information about politics , raise money for charity , or try to persuade someone how to vote in an election .
But if the civic case for including games in a definition of broadband is still uncertain , the argument that they boost demand for the service seems stronger .
Pew 's latest report says that one out of every four " economic users " of the Internet — folks who go online to look for jobs or keep track of the economy — also go there to relax by watching a video or playing a game .
This is especially true for young users ( 18 - 29 ) , half of whom reported playing on the ' Net on a regular basis .
If speeding up the rate of broadband adoption requires stimulating demand as well as availability , extending gaming capacity to a definition of broadband becomes that much more credible .
What it enables
All this has become part of the broadband definitional debate .
And there 's a noticeable divide here between the telcos and cable companies on one side , and content providers and users on the other .
The latter camp very much wants the FCC to embrace an " application - based approach " to the broadband definition question , as the FCC put it in its request for definitional comments .
Google leads the pack on this issue .
" Ultimately what interests us about broadband is not what it is , but what it enables , " the search engine giant wrote to the Commission .
Broadband should be defined at speeds " that enable full utilization of broadband services and applications . "
The connections should be " sufficiently robust " enough to let users " receive , generate and interact with voice , data , graphics and video , which will enable users to receive the maximum value of broadband . "
Google 's dream definition of broadband ?
" A high - quality , ' always on , ' packet switched , technology - neutral , high speed communications transmission platform , " the company suggests .
" This platform further should allow users to harness the Internet , access and upload content , and otherwise engage in high - speed two - way connectivity and interactivity . "
Internet2 , a non-profit representing enterprise server users , argues in a similar vein .
A definition " should encourage the construction of networks that will ensure that such users have access to the applications they need , " the group argues .
It is critical , contends the Schools , Health and Libraries Broadband ( SHLB ) Coalition , that " community anchor institutions " have access to the bandwidth that " enables them to utilize all of the applications the public needs , not just a few of them . "
But do we " need " online games ?
There 's a question to keep us busy for eternity .
Britain must concentrate all its efforts on the military campaign to conquer the Taliban as its attempts to achieve a wide - ranging " rescue " of Afghanistan have failed miserably , an influential committee of MPs warns today .
A report on the Afghan campaign from the Foreign Affairs Committee claims that British politicians have allowed " mission creep " to interfere with the original objectives set eight years ago , but they have still failed to pull off wider goals including stamping out the opium trade .
Instead , the MPs insist , the UK should target its resources on " one priority , namely security " and allow the international community to spearhead the broader effort to rebuild Afghanistan .
The dismal verdict on the UK's all - round performance in Afghanistan came as Britain 's most senior diplomat warned that Britain 's involvement in the country will last for " decades " .
Sir Nigel Sheinwald , British ambassador to Washington , painted a bleak future for British forces in the week that the Panther 's Claw operation in Helmand was declared a success .
In an intervention laying out the longest official timetable yet seen for Britain 's commitment to Afghanistan , he predicted that the tide would turn against the Taliban " over the next year or so " rather than in a matter of weeks .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We 're going to have a very long - term commitment to Afghanistan 's future .
This is not just one year , " Sir Nigel said in an interview with The Boston Globe .
" This is going to be for decades .
We 're going to help them get to a state which can they can ward off the return of the Taliban and al - Qa'ida .
That 's our strategic objective .
We need to avoid the vacuum returning .
And that 's what this huge effort is about . "
The committee report , Global Security : Afghanistan and Pakistan , followed a three - month inquiry which took evidence from more than 40 individuals and organisations , including the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband .
It also concluded that the security situation in Afghanistan , particularly in the south where the majority of British troops are based , would remain " precarious " for some time .
But the report said there could be no question of the international community abandoning Afghanistan , and that the issue at stake must be how best the UK and its allies " can allocate responsibilities and share burdens so as to ensure that the country does not once again fall into the hands of those who seek to threaten the security of the UK and the West " .
The committee chairman , Mike Gapes , said : " The UK has experienced mission creep from its initial goal of supporting the US in countering international terrorism , far into the realms of counter - insurgency , counter - narcotics , protection of human rights and state building .
It is clear that despite the commendable efforts of the Foreign Office in adopting a broad - ranging , holistic approach to tackling narcotics in Afghanistan , success in that area depends on a range of factors which lie far beyond the control and resource of the UK alone . "
The committee recommended that the lead international role on counter - narcotics should be transferred away from the UK , and that the Afghan government should be partnered at an international level by the United Nations and the Nato International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in Afghanistan , which is better equipped to co-ordinate international efforts .
Although the committee backed the current " surge " which has claimed the lives of so many British troops , members fired a broadside against " caveats " used by Nato members to limit military involvement in Afghanistan .
The committee said a negotiated , Afghan - led political settlement with broad popular support represented the only realistic option for long - term security and stability in Afghanistan .
Mr Gapes added : " Bearing in mind that this is the first Nato deployment outside of Nato 's ' area ' , this has now become a most critical and seminal moment for the future of the alliance .
The failure of some Nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in Afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries . "
William Hague , the Conservative spokesman on foreign affairs , seized on the report 's findings to demand greater clarity from ministers about the UK 's strategy in Afghanistan .
He said : " This report should be a wake - up call to the Government .
It confirms what we have been saying for months : Britain 's objectives in Afghanistan should be realistic , tightly defined , and subject to regular formal assessment .
The Prime Minister must make clear which minister has primary responsibility for our policy in Afghanistan and the Government should make quarterly reports to Parliament , covering Britain 's objectives , the progress made in achieving them and the resources required . "

If you 're itching to get your hands on Intel 's latest mid-range supremo , here 's another good sign .
Last week it was a dual - retail listing of the so - called 570 entrant of the upcoming Core i5 line , now we have pictures of the 750's retail box and specs -- making us wonder if , perhaps , those two retailers do n't share a case of mild dyslexia .
This new source has a definite case of Русский язык , but from what we can glean from our high - school Russian lessons ( and a little help from The Googles ) this is , again , a 2.66GHz chip with 8 MB of cache that 's due in the very near future .
This site mentions the price as " estimated at $ 196 , " a bit cheaper than we 've seen so far and perhaps good tidings for bargains to come .
Stay tuned for more info on that front , but go ahead and click on over for more pictures of this chip and its companion heat sink .
Whatever the real story out of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's office is on the public option , the Senate Finance Committee still has to vote on it , probably tomorrow ( unless Baucus finds another way to delay ) .
To recap , Senators Rockefeller and Schumer are presenting three public option amendments .
The first is from Rockefeller , and it fairly closely follows the public option House version , which is stronger than the Senate HELP version .
The other two are from Schumer , one that would add the same language as is in the HELP bill , and one that would create a " level playing field " option , the weakest of the three amendments .
Getting any of the three of these amendments out of the Finance Committee , but particularly either Rockefeller 's or Schumer 's first , is an uphill climb .
But getting as much Dem support for any of them in this committee as possible is important .
It will reinforce the message and the reality that the majority of Democrats -- you know , the actual party that is in the majority in the Senate - - support the public option , and that it needs to be in the bill the Senate sends to conference .
As I wrote on Friday , based on informed reporting from Jane , there are five Dem members to target specifically :
Max Baucus -- has said he supports a public plan , despite the fact that his bill does n't contain one .
Bill Nelson -- acknowledges that a public option would address lack of competition in the health care industry , but said he was against it , then he was " open " to it , and most recently says it must be subject to triggers .
Bill Nelson -- says emerging public option is " attractive . "
Kent Conrad --
Has always said that " there are n't enough votes for a public option , " but would n't say if he was one of them .
Told Ezra Klein today he would only be open to one that was n't tied to Medicare rates -- which Schumer 's " level playing field " is n't .
Blanche Lincoln -- said in July that a public insurance option should be included in any health care bill , but since then has changed her position like some people change their hair color .
Tom Carper -- thinks the job of the Senate Finance Committee is to honor back room deals with PhRMA .
Wo n't say how he feels about a public option .
There are 13 Democrats and 10 Republicans on the committee , which means they can only lose two Democratic votes and still pass the amendment .
So , in order for a public plan to come out of Finance , three of these are going to have to get off the fence .
And remember this , from Friday 's post , too :
Contacting these , and all of the Dem members of the committee would be worth our while .
It would help to remind them of a few factors :
The CBO scoring of the House bill shows an additional $ 85 billion in savings over the Blue Dog / Energy & Commerce version : the public option will save money and bend that cost curve .
The public option remains popular with majorities of Americans .
The public option is popular with swing state voters .
In national polling , voters oppose a mandate to purchase private insurance by 64 % to 34 % but support a mandate with a choice of private or public insurance by 60 % to 37 % .
Contact info for all Dem Senators on Finance is below the fold .
The focus should be on Baucus , Nelson , Conrad , Lincoln , and Carper .
But if you live in any of the states represented by the Senators below , calls to them certainly wo n't hurt , as well as " thank you " calls to Rockefeller and Schumer .
( CNN ) -- A Wisconsin judge ruled there is enough evidence for four women to stand trial for their roles in a staged motel tryst that ended with a man tied to a bed , his penis super - glued to his stomach , a lawyer for one of the women said Wednesday .
Michelle Belliveau , Wendy Sewell , Therese Ziemann and the man 's wife appeared in court Tuesday .
A Calumet County Circuit Court Judge issued the ruling Tuesday after hearing from the alleged victim , who spent about 90 minutes on the witness stand describing his ordeal , attorney Rob Bellin said .
The 37 - year - old man , who is in custody on charges in an unrelated case , delivered his testimony wearing an orange jailhouse jumpsuit .
" I was telling them they could n't do this , that it 's assault .
Hello , let me leave , " the alleged victim said , according to CNN affiliate WBAY .
The man 's wife and two of his girlfriends hatched a plot to lure him to a Stockbridge motel on July 30 and confront him after learning that he was having " sexual relations " with all of them , a criminal complaint states .
Therese Ziemann , Wendy Sewell , Michelle Belliveau and the man 's wife are accused of felony false imprisonment , which carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison .
Ziemann , who is also accused of misdemeanor sexual assault and battery , faces arraignment on October 5 .
Belliveau pleaded not guilty on Tuesday , and the others have motion hearings scheduled in October .
CNN does not name victims of alleged sexual assault and will not name the alleged victim 's wife since they use the same last name .
Ziemann told investigators that her lover 's wife contacted her the day before the incident and revealed that he was married with children and seeing other women for money .
Ziemann said she confirmed the information with Sewell , and the three arranged to confront him " without him knowing , " the complaint says .
Belliveau , Ziemann 's sister , was allegedly also present .
The man went to the hotel on July 30 to meet Ziemann , who told investigators that she met him on Craigslist and fell in love , paying for their hotel rooms and lending him $ 3,000 , the complaint says .
The alleged victim told police that when he arrived , Ziemann told him she wanted to " tie him up and give him a rub down . "
She used bed sheets to tie him to the bed , and blindfolded him with a pillowcase before cutting off his underwear with scissors , according to the complaint .
She then texted the other women to let them know " he 's tied up . "
After they arrived , they peppered him with questions like , " which do you love more ? " and " who do you want to grow old with ? "
Ziemann told police she slapped her lover and asked " can you handle that ? " before using Krazy Glue to stick his penis to his stomach .
The man told police that the women took his wallet , cell phone and car and left him tied to the bed .
He chewed on the bindings to free himself and eventually called police .
The man , who has a criminal record in Wisconsin dating back to 1998 , is in custody on unrelated charges of child abuse , theft and harassment .
His next court appearance in that case is scheduled for Thursday , September 17 .

Man on Wire : Extreme climber risks his life inching across world 's most stunning landscapes
Extreme climbing is not a sport the majority can stomach , but for Heinz Zak it 's all in a day 's work .
51 - year - old Zak has spent the last eight years touring the globe and trying out his terrifying high - altitude wire - walking wherever he can find the right spot .
Zak , pictured here walking across a chasm in Yosemite National Park on a 173 - metre rope , thrives on walking across chasms , over tiny inch - wide strips of material .
Leap of faith :
As Zak crosses the gap between Lost Arrow on El Capitan , he says he remains ' super - focused '
Sunset view :
As it gets darker , Zak is not fazed , but continues to walk
Zak , from Scharnitz in Austria , said he ' loses himself ' when he is walking , becoming hyper - focused as he does so .
' If you think about anything else it could mean death , ' he explained .
' What I do is not about adrenaline , ' he said .
' Walking a highline is my way , it 's just what I do . '
Zak is regarded by fans as a pioneer in the field .
Looking down : Zak steps out over the crowd in Munich , Germany , with a steady foot
Just visible :
You can just about see Heinz Zak walking across his highline over El Capitan in Yosemite National Park
His fascination with the sport began in the 1980s , when he visited Yosemite National Park with some friends and discovered a slackline .
He has travelled through Austria , Germany , America , Italy and the Czech Republic .
Besides the highlining shown here , Zak also enjoys slacklining , where he crosses lakes just feet from the surface .
Long - term thing : Zak has been interested in high and slack lining since the 1980s but has come to prominence in recent years
Slacklining : Zak walks across a lake in Austria , ignoring the picture - perfect view to concentrate on getting across without falling in
1 - Inch Piece of Plastic Spoon Removed From Man's Lung Wendy 's logo on the side of piece of plastic removed from lung after two years .
Sept. 18 , 2009  -- John Manley complained of fatigue , coughing fits and pneumonia spells and now , after two years of agony , doctors at Duke University Hospital believe a small piece of plastic is to blame .
Manley , 50 , apparently inhaled the 1 - inch plastic fragment while eating at a Wendy 's restaurant .
The Wendy 's logo can still be seen on the side of the plastic .
" My assistants that were working with me started spelling out these letters , " said Dr. Momen Wahidi , a pulmonologist at Duke University in Durham , N.C. " They started making out that there was an A - M - B .
We eventually realized that this was a hamburger , the word ' hamburger . '
This was a surprise to all of us . "
Manley does n't remember feeling anything but said he does have a habit of wolfing down his food .
" I 'd go in there and eat quickly and take bigger bites , " he said .
" I came from a big family .
You eat fast if you want your food . "
Doctors Removed the Plastic Object
Doctors removed the plastic from Manley 's left lung last week , and he is expected to make a full recovery .
" Watching him on the lawn mower , which John loves , is fantastic , " wife Karen Manley said .
Manley and his wife did not understand his sudden coughing fits and fatigue after they moved to North Carolina from New York City two years ago .
" I put myself in a hospital because I was spitting up blood , " Manley said .
After meeting with multiple doctors , they discovered that there was a foreign object lodged in his left lung .
Manley has not decided whether he will contact Wendy 's about the incident .
Wendy 's spokesman Denny Lynch told The Associated Press that he has never heard of a situation like this in his 29 years with the company and said that Wendy 's would contact Manley at the appropriate time .
" I 'm just glad to get it out of me and get back to a normal life , " Manley said .

Scientists in Israel have devised a portable breath tester that detects lung cancer with 86 percent accuracy , according to a study released Sunday .
The device could provide an early warning system that flags the disease before tumours become visible in X - rays , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
" Our results show great promise for fast , easy and cost - effective diagnosis and screening of lung cancer , " they said .
The sensor uses gold nanoparticles to detect levels of so - called volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) -- measured in a few parts per billion -- that become more elevated in cancer patients .
Early detection of lung cancer dramatically increases the odds of survival .
Currently , only 15 percent of cases are discovered before the disease has begun to spread .
Screening via computerised tomography ( CT ) or chest x-rays can reduce lung cancer deaths , but is expensive and exposes patients to undesirable radiation .
In the study , a team of researchers lead by Hossam Haick of the Israel Institute of Technology took breath samples from 56 healthy people and 40 lung cancer patients .
To avoid contaminants , participants repeatedly filled their lungs to capacity for five minutes through a filter that removed 99.99 percent of organic compounds from the air , a process called " lung washout " .
Then the scientists hunted for VOCs present only in the cancer patients that could serve as biomarkers for the disease .
They found 33 compounds that appeared in at least 83 percent of the cancer group , but in fewer than 83 percent of the control group .
The next step was to design an assembly of chemical sensors using gold nanoparticles measuring five nanometres across .
An average strand of human hair is about 100,000 nanometres in width .
After " training " the arrays to detect a selection of the cancer - specific VOCs , Haick and his team tested it on both artificial mixtures of biomarkers and real human breath .
The devices were able to " distinguish between the breath of lung cancer patients and healthy controls , without the need for de-humidification or pre-concentration of the lung cancer biomarkers , " they concluded .
They also suggested the technique could be extended to other forms of cancer .
" Given the impact of the rising incidence of cancer on health budgets worldwide , the proposed technology will be a significant saving for both private and public health expenditure , " they say .
Lung cancer claims some 1.3 million lives worldwide each year , accounting for nearly 18 percent of all deaths from cancer , according to the World Health Organisation .

One of the first things a novice SQL developer learns about is called thinking in SQL , which is usually being opposed to procedural thinking
Let 's see what part of brain does this intellectual activity take and how to use it .
Two features distinguish SQL from other languages you learned as a 11 - year old kid on your first PC , like BASIC or perl or maybe even C++ if you 're such a Wunderkind .
First , SQL is set - based .
It does things with sets .
Every tool is designed to do things with something else .
Like , you use a hammer to do things with nails , or use a screwdriver to do things with screws , or use an oven to do things with food .
Same with computer languages .
BASIC does things with variables .
perl does things with scalars , arrays , hashes and file streams .
Assembly does things with registers and memory .
You should not be confused by something like registers are just a special case of variables , or a hash is just a generalized container which exposes this and this method or something like that .
No .
A hash is a hash , a variable is a variable and a register is a register .
Like , an egg is a food and rice is a food and it 's possible to cook some eggs in a rice cooker and vice versa , but they are just wrong tools to do that .
Prehistoric men had to make do with hammerstones and lithic blades ( even to court their women ) , but now we have a whole district in Tokyo City for gadgets with USB type A , and another district for gadgets with USB type B .
So if you feel the urge to hash something and then make a good old array out of this , you do n't use assembly , but perl or PHP instead .
Same with SQL .
SQL does things with sets .
It 's a tool that allows you to take a dozen or two of sets , mix them together , knead and wedge them then chop them apart and mix again , but the output you get is still a set and all inputs are sets .
Eeverything you do in SQL , you do it on sets .
That 's why SQL is called a set - oriented language .
Ok , that was the first feature that distinguishes SQL from other languages .
What 's the second one ?
SQL is a declarative language .
This means that you express what you want to do with sets , not how you want to do it .
This requires a little explanation .
In fact , every language is declarative , even assembly .
When you issue a command like xor eax , eax , you just command your CPU : go warm up your circuits and make it so that I see a zero in EAX right this nanosecond ! .
This command needs to be translated into an opcode , and the opcode should go to the instruction pipeline and dispatched into some circuits and make some transistor to change their state , but it is none of your concern .
The language and the CPU abstract all this from you .
In the same way , perl abstracts hashes and arrays , ASP abstracts HTTP requests and responses and Windows API abstracts windows and controls .
SQL , of course , abstracts sets .
Abstractions simplify your life .
But an abstraction in computer world usually means one of two things :
You save some time on brainless operations , like typing or remembering , or
You save some time on decision making
Brainless part is easy : you just do things human way and make computer to do same things computer way .
This is usually a one - to - one mapping .
For instance : xor eax , eax is much easier to remember than 31 C0 .
That 's why we use assembly .
int __stdcall is much easier to remember than pass variables by value in stack , rightmost first , return the result in EAX and clean the stack inside the calling function .
That 's why we have calling conventions .
Darling Ctrl - K is much easier to type than something like my spouses really long email address made up by a sysadmin whose head is full of unwarranted self importance at example dot com .
That 's why we use address book in Outlook .
These examples do n't imply any decision making .
There is hardly a way to mess something up here , that 's why computers are very good in these things .
Decision part is more complex , and it usually deals with more complex abstractions .
In an x86 CPU there are at least two ways to zero a EAX :
xor eax , eax , and
, and mov eax , 0
The first instruction is more efficient and takes only 2 bytes in code , while the second one is ( or at least was ) less efficient and takes something about 5 bytes .
The problem is that the first instruction works only on zeros .
Like , for the following C code :
if ( myfunc ( ) ) return 1 ; else return 0 ;
, an efficient C compiler should generate different opcodes for different execution paths , despite the return construct being the same .
This is where compiler makes a decision : if I need to return a zero in EAX , I 'll better use xor eax , eax , otherwise I just have no choise but to use mov eax .
Note that the code will still work if the compiler makes incorrect decision , it just will be 3 bytes longer and maybe several nanoseconds less efficient .
That 's what distinguishes time saving features from decision making features .
In the first case , you know in advance how the computer will make something , and if it 's doing it wrong way , it 's doing it wrong .
In the second case , you know what will it make , but do n't know ( or do n't care ) how as long as it's done .
SQL heavily , vastly relies on decisions made by the computer .
Probably more than any other widely used language .
There is only one way to translate a xor eax , eax into an opcode .
Two ways to compile return 0 in an stdcall function .
Probably a dozen ways to decide which dead object should be recycled by a garbage collector .
But for a simplest SELECT query which is only 30 rows long , there are hundreds of decisions to make , and I 'm not making this up :
There are FULL SCAN , INDEX FAST FULL SCAN , INDEX SKIP SCAN , INDEX RANGE SCAN to retrieve the values from the tables
, , , to retrieve the values from the tables
There are NESTED LOOPS JOIN , MERGE JOIN and HASH JOIN to join them
, and to join them There are NESTED LOOPS SEMI JOIN , MERGE SEMI JOIN and HASH SEMI JOIN to check IN and EXISTS predicates
, and to check and predicates
There are NESTED LOOPS ANTI JOIN , MERGE ANTI JOIN and HASH ANTI JOIN to check NOT IN and NOT EXISTS predicates
, and to check and predicates
There are SORT DISTINCT and HASH AGGREGATE to group the records
and to group the records
There are LAZY SPOOL and EAGER SPOOL to build temporary indexes for the duration of the query
and to build temporary indexes for the duration of the query
There are numerous ways to pipeline and parallelize the resultsets to benefit from multiprocessing
There are bitmap indexes to indicate existence of a record in a memory - efficient way
There is CONNECT BY PUMP to keep the recursion stack for recursive queries
etc , etc .
But why so complex ?
As I already said , SQL works on sets .
Sets are very complex things which can take lots of memory and disk resources , and operations on them may be very costly .
And worse than that : there are many operations for which there are no single algorithm of choice .
For instance , there are 3 widely used JOIN algorithms : NESTED LOOPS JOIN , MERGE JOIN and HASH JOIN .
The first one is best for joining a resultset on a selective indexed field , the second one is best for joining sorted resultsets , and the third one works equally poor for everything , but still exposes the best time when the resultsets are neither filtered nor sorted , but this only applies for joins on equality condition , otherwise it 's impossible to use it , et cetera , et cetera .
The whole point of SQL is that it abstracts all this complexity from you .
You just write your SELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2 and let the optimizer choose all these , Lord help me , hashes or merges or indexes or whatever .
The first thing any SQL developer should learn is formulating his needs in the terms of sets .
I wo n't give a lecture of relational algebra here , but there are some basic operations you can do with sets , like joining them , grouping , sorting etc. , and by combining these operations , you can do almost everything with sets .
Like with plain algebra : there is addition , and subtraction ( which is just a generalized addition ) , and multiplication ( which is a generalized addition too ) , and so on , and finally we get a proof Fermat 's Last Theorem ( which is probably is a very , very generalized addition too , but I 'm not smart enough to grok it ) .
So , thinking in SQL means an ability to formulate your needs in terms of set operations and to tell your database system how exactly you 'd like to mutilate your data before it 's output to you .
Here 's the magic of SQL , kids .
You just tell it what you want , and it decides the best way to do it , that 's how smart computers are .
Thank you for your time , goodbye .
Why , you 're still here ?
Oh , I finished on thinking , and my article was called double - thinking ?
OK .
Remember I said that SQL decides the best way ?
Well , no , it does n't .
And every SQL developer sees it very , very soon .
Columnist Joel Spolsky coined the term Leaky Abstraction for the situations when the abstracting tool gives you a result in a non-optimal way , or gives no result at all .
And SQL is number 2 in his list of examples , right after iterating a two - dimensional array which can cause lots of page faults if done improperly .
He writes :
The SQL language is meant to abstract away the procedural steps that are needed to query a database , instead allowing you to define merely what you want and let the database figure out the procedural steps to query it .
But in some cases , certain SQL queries are thousands of times slower than other logically equivalent queries .
A famous example of this is that some SQL servers are dramatically faster if you specify where a=b and b=c and a=c than if you only specify where a=b and b=c even though the result set is the same .
You 're not supposed to have to care about the procedure , only the specification .
But sometimes the abstraction leaks and causes horrible performance and you have to break out the query plan analyzer and study what it did wrong , and figure out how to make your query run faster .
The most interesting thing he mentioned is the query plan analyzer .
Let 's return to other languages .
Like PHP .
PHP abstracts lots of things , but among the most used ones are arrays , HTTP requests and web servers .
In PHP , you just write something like $ a [ 0 ] = $ _SERVER [ ' HTTP_USER_AGENT '] and the string that browser identified itself with in the HTTP request goes to the array .
Ask almost any decent PHP developer on what 's going on inside the computer when this command executes , and he or she will most probably shrug and give an answer like
It must allocate some memory , probably , then get the string out of Apache , and then , um , put the string into the memory and increase the counter somewhere .
In other words , they do n't know and do n't care .
But they still are brilliant PHP developers , they can do wonders with arrays and requests .
gcc has an option to output the assembly when you compile a program so you can check how effciently it did its work .
But ask any C++ programmer what switch do you use to do that , and 9 of 10 would not be able to remember it .
It 's just not used frequently .
Knowing the PHP or gcc internals is not required to use these tools efficiently .
PHP just works and you can program good PHP all your life without ever knowing how exactly does the PHP interpreter push a function reference to an array of hashes .
And of course no PHP distribution comes with a debugger that shows you what is it going do on each step : look , I 'm going to allocate this memory and fill it with zeroes and scan it and put a string here .
However , every decent RDBMS has some mean to preview an execution plan for your query .
How exactly will the query work ?
What algorithm does the query optimizer use ?
Will it scan table A or table B first ?
I know no other tool or language that exposes so much of its internals .
To know what PHP or perl does when allocating an array , you 'll have to run it under debugger .
To know what .NET does when creating as instance of List is probably a licence violation , a felony and a deadly sin , all at once .
Many products just refuse to run under debugger so that their precious internal logic of twice two making a wax candle would not leak outside .
But when it comes to SQL , Microsoft gives a graphical tool which allows you to see what exactly happens when you run an SQL query .
And unlike gcc -s , this tool is used heavily .
They actually made an effort to show you what 's going on inside their product .
To show , not to hide .
They are exposing exact algorithms used by the server , they are explaining how much time will an operation take , and they are not hiding it in a dusty PDF file : they make it so that you can actually understand it , with icons and arrows and nice charts .
This is of course not because they are so generous and open - hearted and want to contibute their knowledge to a free world .
This is because if not for this tool it would be impossible to use their product at all .
Stay assured that if they invented an algorithm that would allow generating optimal queries , they would do anything possible and impossible to keep it secret .
SQL abstraction leaks like a sieve filled with superfluid helium .
And this is not because RDBMS developers are dumb .
This is because the thing they are trying to abstract is way too complex to do it efficiently .
The possible operations on sets and the intermediate results of these operations are so numerious and multifarious that with current level of technology it 's just not possible to write an efficient optimizer , an optimizer as in optimal .
In SQL world , a correct query does not mean an optimal query , which is true for almost tools .
But is does n't even mean a usable query , since the query plan can be so unoptimal that you will wait forever for a query to complete .
Any decent SQL developer should know everything about execution plans and see in advance how efficient or not efficient they are .
Here is a classical example .
Do n't worry , it 's quite simple .
Say , we need to select all rows from a table along with a running sum :
id value sum 1 10 10 2 20 30 3 15 45
sum here accumulates value added on each step .
In relational algebra , it 's super easy to write a query that would make this resultset :
SELECT t1.id , t1.value , SUM ( t2.value ) FROM mytable t1 JOIN mytable t2 ON t2.id <= t1.id GROUP BY t1.id , t1.value [ / sourcecode ]
This reads as < q > for each < code > id </ code > , return the sum of < code > value < / code > in rows with < code > id </ code > less or equal to given .
</q >
Quite simple , right ?
Wrong .
No < strong > SQL </ strong > engine I 'm aware of can run this exact query optimally .
An optimal solution would be something like < q > take a row from the table , record the current value of < code > sum </ code > , take next < code > value < / code > , add it to < code > sum </ code > , pipeline the result </q > .
But the optimizers are not programmed to see this algorithm in the query worded as above .
Best they can do is something like < q > take a row from the table , then take all other rows with smaller < code > id </ code >s , calculate their sum , pipeline the row , then forget the previous result and do it all again , on a larger set of rows < /q > .
It the < em > best </em > algorithm they can come up with , and I 'm not making this up .
There are worse algorithms , like < q > select all matching rows , hash them together , calculate the sums and use disk space to keep intermediate results for they do n't fit into memory < / q >
Of course modern systems can use more efficient queries , like this : SELECT id , value , SUM ( t1.value ) OVER ( ORDER BY id ) FROM mytable
, but this is different query .
An optimizer cannot see that this query is identical to the first one in terms of results .
It 's the task of an SQL developer to see it and reformulate the query .
Optimizers can efficiently do some simple tasks like picking a correct index , choosing correct access method depending on the filter selectivity and so on .
However , it 's not enough to allow formulating your queries in SQL so that they are just correct .
You still need to formulate your queries so that they are usable , i. e. an optimizer is able to build an efficient plan for them .
That of course means you should know how optimizers work .
In eariler systems , like Oracle before version 8 , optimizer had a set of rules .
Like , if we see a filtering condition on an indexed field , we use that index , etc .
For simple queries , that yielded decent plans , for more complex queries that was a pain .
More advanced optimizers try to predict how much time will one or another plan take .
Usually they gather statistics to do that .
That is , from time to time they see how the values are distributed along your tables , keep some aggregates , and try to predict the query time .
They sometimes mistake , but this is not the real problem .
The real problem is that even the brightest of optimizers cannot reword even the simplest queries .
They cannot even change a self - join to a window function in the query above .
This still should be done by an SQL developer .
Thinking in SQL means formulating you needs in terms of set operations .
This is what usually said .
And this is truth , but not the whole truth .
This is not enough to be a good SQL developer .
To be a superb SQL developer , you need to doublethink in SQL .
This Orwellian term describes the process the best :
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one 's mind simultaneously , and accepting both of them .
To be a good SQL developer , you should be able to imagine the query in terms of sets and in terms of algorithms at the same time .
It 's not enough to come up with a set operation that yields correct results .
It will be inefficient .
It 's not enough to come up with a good algorithm that transforms your set as you need and try to force - feed it to the server using procedural approach .
The servers are not good at that .
What you need to do is to formulate your query so that the optimizer chooses exactly the algorithm you need .
And to do this , you should know both the algorithm and the set operations .
You need to doublethink .
This is not always an easy task to do .
But it definitely deserves learning .
And only if you learn it you will be able to harness all the power of SQL .
Quakers Honoured At Stormont
A religious charity closely involved in prisoner care is to be recognised today .
Quaker Service , a family welfare charity pioneered and developed by the Religious Society of Friends ( known as Quakers ) , is celebrating 40 years of providing services in Northern Ireland .
At an event in Stormont - hosted by Junior Ministers Gerry Kelly and Robin Newton - a Quaker volunteer who was based n Belfast in the troubled days of the 1970s will be the special keynote speaker .
Stephen Pittam , who is also the Trust Secretary of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust , will be joined at the event by other speakers including volunteers and senior staff .
Many of these people have been involved in setting up various services and programmes over the years for families and children , particularly at the Long Kesh / Maze Prison complex and at Quaker Cottage in west Belfast .
The event also provides an opportunity to launch the book ' Coming from the Silence ' , which describes the work of four major projects and a number of smaller initiatives taking place between 1969 and 2007 , setting the work in a wider Quaker context .
Stephen Pittam , who also penned the preface of the book , said : " The fundamental belief of that of God in all people has led Quakers to bear witness for equality , justice , reconciliation and peace throughout the world .
" It is these values that underpin all the work described here ( in the book ) , " he said .
Roy Blair , Chairman of Quaker Service , said : " We are welcoming many friends from our past and present and sharing our experiences over the past 40 years .
" Quaker Service emerged as a response to the outbreak of sectarian violence in 1969 and has developed into a professional family and childcare agency providing a range of support and therapeutic services in the largest prison in Northern Ireland and at a cross community family centre in West Belfast , " he explained .

PORT BLAIR , India ( Reuters ) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck in the Indian Ocean off India ’s Andaman Islands early on Tuesday , but a tsunami alert for India , Myanmar , Indonesia , Thailand and Bangladesh was later canceled .
A massive magnitude 7.6 quake struck in the Indian Ocean off India 's Andaman Islands , triggering a tsunami watch for India , Myanmar , Indonesia , Thailand and Bangladesh , the U.S. Geological Survey reported on Monday .
REUTERS / Graphics
Three hours after the earthquake there were no reports of a tsunami or of any casualties from the tremor , officials said .
“ We all ran out as fast as possible and have not gone back inside , fearing another quake .
Everything was shaking , we are all very , very scared , ” Subhasis Paul , who runs a provision store in Diglipur island in North Andaman , told Reuters by telephone .
“ People are calling each other out of their homes and everyone is huddled together outside , ” Paul said from Diglipur , about 300 km ( 185 miles ) north of Port Blair , the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
The small chain of islands lie hundreds of miles east of India in the Indian Ocean .
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake , initially reported as a magnitude 7.7 , struck at 1:55 a.m. ( 1955 GMT on Monday ) .
It was relatively shallow , at a depth of 33 km ( 20.6 miles ) , and was centered 260 km ( 160 miles ) north of Port Blair .
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there could be a destructive wave along coasts up to 1,000 km ( 600 miles ) from the epicenter , but it later withdrew its warning .
“ Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated , ” it said in a statement .
Officials at the tsunami alert center in southern India said chances of a tsunami were remote .
“ The earthquake has not caused displacement of water necessary to generate a tsunami either in the deep sea or near coastal locations , ” said Rajesh , a senior official at the Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services .
“ We are monitoring the situation , but everything appears normal so far .
It seems we have been lucky , ” added Rajesh , who goes by one name .
A 7.6 magnitude quake is classified by the USGS as a major earthquake and is capable of widespread , heavy damage .
A massive quake in the Indian Ocean in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed some 228,000 people , the majority in the Indonesian province of Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra island .
WOKEN BY A JOLT
“ I was on the balcony , and it felt very strange for a while , like my chair was leaning to one side , ” said Reuters correspondent Martin Petty in Bangkok .
“ So I got out of there sharpish .
Aftershocks went on for a good few minutes . ”
In Indonesia , a meteorology agency official said his agency was monitoring Aceh , but there had been no reports of a tsunami .
“ I was waken up by the jolt , ” said Kyaw Min , a resident of Yangon in Myanmar .
In the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago , officials said there was no news of any immediate loss of life or damage .
“ We have patrol parties everywhere possible and everything appears normal .
We are asking people not to panic and return to their homes , ” P. Karunakaran , a police superintendent in charge of the North and Middle Andaman region said by telephone from Mayabandar , 270 km ( 165 miles ) north of Port Blair .
Academic Programmers - A Spotter 's Guide
Pete Fenelon
Department of Computer Science ,
University of York
Introduction
Disclaimer : this was written when I should have been concentrating on my current research project , the one my previous contract was for AND my DPhil thesis !
No resemblance to individual researchers alive , dead or at York is intended .
1 " I Am The Greatest "
IATG spent most of his undergraduate days in the terminal room and only got a degree because he could break security and decrypt the exam answers .
Thinks in a mixture of C and assembly language , thinks Real Programmers are sissies , has memorised even the unwritten volumes of Knuth ( who he believes sold out the moment he started writing TeX ) and has most of the source to obsolete Unix kernels in his room .
Has VMS source on microfiche , mysteriously acquired .
Knows what the Lions Book is and has his own n-th generation copy of it .
Has played a Plan 9 distribution CD ROM through an audio player for fun .
Nobody else can understand IATG 's code , which suits him fine , and absolutely nobody can use his customised environment , which also suits him because it means he does n't have to answer questions about it .
Absolutely lethal on any project which involves collaboration , documentation , theory , or distributing code to other sites ; IATG is best steered away from research and into hacking for GCHQ or similar .
2 " Internet Vegetable "
IV can survive at sites with tolerant sysadmins and good connectivity - but use of disk space is tremendous and demands for OS upgrades , net bandwidth and new disks phenomenal ... once in a while IV finds something useful but is usually too busy looking for something else to actually install it or port it .
3 " Rabid Prototyper "
RP tends to have an arcane knowledge of Unix tools like lex , yacc , Perl and Awk and RP systems are usually held together by the most incredible array of plumbing since an Italian hotel water closet .
With someone to catch the pieces thrown away by a good RP things might actually get done , and it can't be denied that they often have good ideas , but the sheer lack of commitment makes them impossible to cope with for any length of time .
4 " Get New Utilities "
On the rare occasions when GNU actually does write some code it'll require the entire GNU CD - ROM to be shipped with it before it 'll even compile on a standard machine .
Useful to have at least one of them around , but beware getting two GNUs , since they 'll inevitably both want their own collection of software ...
5 " Square Peg ; Round Hole "
The old program will either grow enormously into a multi-modal , immense crock held together by hidden parameters , mode bits , recondite options and obscure data types , or will shatter into a disk full of libraries , macros , class hierarchies and fiddly little separate programs which used to fit together but now need so many intermediaries to communicate that they 've become incomprehensible .
SPRH often looks productive , but that 's because most of the work was charged to another project five years ago , or whatever work is going on is just another attempt to bludgeon code into an alien Weltanschauung .
6 " Objectionably Oriented "
Instead , it kept sending messages to itself asking it what direction it was facing in and would it mind having a look around and send me a message telling me what was there ...
OO thinks in Smalltalk and talks to you in Eiffel or Modula - 3 ; unfortunately she 's filled the disk with the compilers for them and instead of getting any real work done she 's busy writing papers on holes in the type systems and , like all OOs , is designing her own perfect language .
The most dangerous OOs are OODB hackers ; they inevitably demand a powerful workstation with local disk onto which they 'll put a couple of hundred megabytes of unstructured , incoherent pointers all of which point to the number 42 ; any attempt to read or write it usually results in the network being down for a week at least .
7 " My Favourite Toy Language "
The problem with TL compilers is that the code they generate is often inefficient and impossible to debug ; however good MFTL is as a programmer the system will be huge and clunky ... in many cases the TL also needs extensive runtime libraries and support tools to be distributed .
Is more likely to spend time tinkering with the TL compiler than actually working on the project ; dreams of the day when TL is implemented in TL , and will probably resign as soon as it is , unless it 's a Functional Programming project - almost all of them are about writing compilers for someone else 's TL .
8 " Give Us The Tools ... "
It does n't run on any of our machines .
GUTT seems to have been living in an alternate reality in which Scrotely Whizzbangs running ScroteOS and StainedGlassWindows are the most popular computing environment and has begged , stolen , borrowed or even written software to suit .
The problem is of course that outside Ruritania nobody on Earth has ever heard of Scrotely Systems and the software is n't worth a row of beans to anyone ...
Since Scrotely went out of business five years ago , truly great GUTT people spend months trying to write a Scrotely emulator on your local machines ; mere mortals spend their time posting to comp.sys.scrotely and comp.sys.foobar to ask whether anyone has ever tried porting anything to a Foobar 250 ...
9 " Macro Magician "
Whether it 's solving the Towers of Hanoi in vi or sorting lists in TECO , UMM knows how to do it .
UMM pipes his .
profile through the C pre-processor and watches it rewrite itself every time he logs in ; the vast majority of UMM systems are implemented in Emacs Lisp and require all 2.5 Gbytes of the latest distribution before they 'll even think about running .
They usually take at least as long to run as to write .
... at the other end of the scale MMM is into HyperCard , ToolBook and other BiCapitalised pieces of syntactic sugar , although also relishes the chance to delve into the macro languages of word processors , databases and spreadsheets , preferably all at the same time ; ideally using everything to build an application which takes a week to start up and keeps flashing up obscure menus and dialogue boxes .
No cure for either of these , sadly .
Best bet is 240 v through their chair .
10 " Nightmare Networker "
There is no doubt that NN can create a system which works , but it 's impossible to explain to mere mortals and keeps getting more and more complex .
NN firmly believes that " it 's all virtual anyway " , unfortunately including such things as execution time and network bandwidth .
NN can be exhilarating to work with but also infuriating - never let NN tinker with your workstation because in no time flat it'll be running EBCDIC to SixBit translation software routing X.500 address requests from Uzbekistan to Ouagadoudou via a steam powered TCP / IP to Alohanet gateway in Auchtermuchty ...
Best relegated to a support job if at all possible .
11 " Configuration Unmanageable "
Somewhere in there are 14000 versions of the source to the current project ; CU saves and generates a new build every time a single character changes because " you can never be too sure " ...
CU is also an archive freak and his office is habitually filled with magtapes , QICs and Exabytes containing a complete backup of the revision notes about the versioning policy of the document identification scheme for the change - management procedure for the backup procedures for the system .
Words like " anal retentive " have been used to describe CU but he can't look them up because there 's no longer enough space for the online dictionary ...
Impossible to work with and to get any work out of .
Is more likely to be out spotting trains or collecting stamps than working in any case .
12 " Artificial Stupidity "
The problem with AS researchers is that the systems they create are at least as stupid as the people who create them .
Avoid at all costs .
13 " Number Crusher "
NN is often not a computer scientist - physics or maths backgrounds are common - and tend to have the clunkiest working environments on machines you 've ever seen .
Keep all their files in one directory and name them F44433232.DAT and suchlike .
Almost always have a Julia set as their screen wallpaper ( Mandelbrot is a bit old hat and does n't take up enough processing power ... )
Knows a lot about the likes of Uniras , GINO-F and similar .
Can be relied upon to have the floating point format for the machine tattoed inside her eyelids and mumbles Denormal , Abnormal , Inf , NaN ! in her sleep ( while the system recompiles ) .
Is the only person in the office who can remember O - level maths and as such is occasionally useful .
14 " Meta Problem Solver "
Often sounds plausible , but the meta - problem which MPS keeps trying to solve generally generates a whole slew of meta - meta - problems , and the meta - meta - problems in turn infect the project with meta - meta - meta problems , and eventually MPS either disappears up his own rear end or ends up having to solve the Halting Problem before he can get anything else done .
An MPS on the team can be extremely exhilarating , but most of the time it 's downright difficult .
Many MPSs were formalists or mathematicians in another incarnation , which can make them difficult to deal with .
Their programs often run better on a whiteboard than on a computer .
15 " What 's a Core File ? "
As long as you can convince WACF not to do any programming you might have a chance of getting something done .
Ideally one should buy them a PC or Macintosh which is n't attached to the net .
Oh , and protect the system files , because WACF has been known to delete things like MSDOS .
SYS to save space .
16 " I Come From Ruritania "
Some ICFRs are actually excellent programmers by any standards , but the effectiveness of their work is blunted rather by the fact that ( A ) if you can persuade them to write user documentation it will display a choice of grammar and vocabulary which is at best idiosyncratic and at worse somewhat like a Sun manual ; added to this the code is of course all commented in perfect Ruritanian .
It 's often fun to dig out their CVs or read their mbox files , which they often seem to leave unprotected .
Unfortunately in several cases ICFRs have left their girlfriends back home unprotected just before coming to the UK ; being present at the birth by email is a difficult option .
17 " Old Fart At Play "
OFAP has occasionally been convinced to port some of his code to Unix , but of course never got further than V7 .
Once tried to port Spacewar to a modern machine but it was n't fast enough .
Knows that Sketchpad is the greatest drawing program ever .
Knows what all the funny mode bits in obscure TECO Q registers are used for , and exploits them in his programs , which are an unholy mixture of assembly language and TECO macros .
Dangerous , usually has a beard ( even if female ) , but is useful to have around because s/he has seen it / done it all before and knows the tricks - just do n't let OFAP implement anything .
18 " I Can Do That "
Combining an ICDT with another programmer is often a damn good idea as long as someone can curb his enthusiasm .
There is a slight downside in that most ICDT programs are predicated upon a huge and unreliable user interface class library - InterViews is particularly popular for creating mock - ups of programs that will never work , although in this enlightened day and age Visual Basic and Visual C++ are starting to take over as media for creative delusions .
May be a useful member of an HCI group or some other motley crew in which programming skill is n't important but getting pretty pixels on screen is vital .
19 " What Colour Should That Be ? "
WCSTB basically prefers tinkering with typefaces , colours , screen layouts and window - management policies to programming , although most WCSTBs have a working knowledge of some of the surprisingly grubby depths of either X or Windows , in order to facilitate the above .
A typical WCSTB " Hello World " program is four hundred lines long and takes up a meg and a half when linked , but is essentially a complete multimedia experience with a non-threatening user interface and configurable options ; at that rate it 's perhaps surprising that none of the WCSTBs ever get anything more substantial written .
20 " It 's Safety Critical ... "
In theory this is fine , but occasionally ISC is forced into writing some code by whoever holds his grant .
Depending on what sort of safety critical project he 's involved in , this will either be low - level bit - twiddling in C , PL / M or assembler on a single - board computer ( which ISC secretly loves because you basically do n't have to do any V&V on it ) or will involve interacting with twenty different CASE tools , eight design notations and four formal methods with subtly incompatible semantics .
Tends to be employed on long contracts , and with a development process like that can you blame him ?

8 ) OPEC spare capacity - According to the International Energy Agency , total effective spare capacity ( excluding Iraq , Venezuela and Nigeria ) in August 2009 remained stable at 5.30 million from July .
Of total August spare capacity according to the IEA Saudi Arabia can produce an additional 3.4 million b/d within 90 days , the United Arab Emirates 0.58 million b/d , Angola 0.31 million b/d , Iran 0.20 million b/d , Libya 0.22 million b/d , Qatar 0.13 million b/d , and the other remaining countries 0.46 million b/d .
Total OPEC spare production capacity in August 2009 declined by 690,000 b/d to a level of 3.51 million b/d from 4.2 million b/d in July according to the Energy Information Administration .
Of total August spare capacity , 2.60 million b/d is estimated to come from Saudi Arabia by the EIA , 0.22 million b/d from Qatar , 0.19 million b/d from Angola , 0.20 million b/d from Kuwait , 0.30 million b/d from the United Arab Emirates , 0.10 million b/d from Iran , and no spare capacity from other countries .
9 ) OECD oil stocks - Industrial inventories of crude oil in the OECD in July 2009 increased to a level of 1012 million from 1011 million barrels in June according to the latest IEA statistics .
Current OECD crude oil stocks are 54 million barrels higher than the five year average of 958 million barrels .
In the August Oil Market Report of the IEA , a total stock level of 990 million barrels was tabulated for June which has been revised upwards to 1011 million barrels in the September edition .
Industrial product stocks in the OECD in July 2009 increased to 1470 million from 1459 million barrels in June according to the latest IEA Statistics .
Current OECD product stocks are 72 million barrels higher than the five year average of 1398 million barrels .
In the August Oil Market Report of the IEA , a total stock level of 1467 million barrels was tabulated for June which has been revised downwards to 1459 million barrels in the September edition .

The Forum ( the newspaper in Fargo – the largest city in North Dakota ) had an article on their website today .
The Insurance Commissioner of North Dakota has been looking into BCBSND .
Here ’s the lede from today ’s Forum story ( DETAILS ONLY IN TODAY'S FORUM : Blue Cross Blue Shield execs profited from bogus bonuses -- unfortunately , you may have to sign up with the website to read the story ) :
Nearly $ 15 million in employee bonuses that were almost assured regardless of performance .
Sales reward trips to posh resorts totaling $ 1.2 million .
A $ 3.5 million investment in a murky hotel partnership lacking audited financial statements .
All this and much more during just the past five years are among almost half a billion dollars in expenses detailed in a report by state insurance examiners who probed spending practices by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota .
Also , they ’ve been jacking up their prices every year .
Why not ?
They ’re almost a monopoly .
And they need that money to fly their top salespeople to the Grand Caymans .
It gets cold in North Dakota .
Yeah , they ’re non-profit .
Yeah , they ’re " owned " by policyholders .
They ’re almost a co-op .
But they ’re also the best argument for getting rid of health insurance and switching to a government plan .
Wait , there 's more .
Before posting this , I checked DKos and found Kiku ’s diary , Conrad 's co-op would include BCBS .
Here ’s a quote from the NY Times ( thanks , Kiku ) :
Mr. Conrad ’s own state demonstrates the uncertainties surrounding cooperatives .
Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota dominates the state ’s private insurance market , collecting nearly 90 percent of premiums .
As a nonprofit owned by its members , the company would hope to qualify as a co-op under federal legislation , said Paul von Ebers , its incoming president and chief executive .
Kiku not only links to the NY Times article , but to a couple other diaries .
If you want , you can read lots more about BCBSND .

WOW !
Rec-listed .
Cool .
UPDATE : BCBSND called a press conference for 2 pm ( Central ) , but it was pushed ahead to 3 pm and now 4 pm ( 2 pm Pacific , 5 pm Eastern ) .
If it happens , you can stream it from wday.com ( click on the AM radio button ) .
Here 's what I learned .
The 100 - page insurance commissioner 's report was finished last week .
Blue Cross Blue Shield of ND asked for two weeks to read it and come up with a reply .
It was supposed to be made public on Sept. 18 ( which just happens to be three days after the Sept. 15 deadline for a health care bill ) .
But it was leaked to the Forum , who wrote a story about it .
BCBSND gave the insurance commissioner permission to release the report today .
So I think that 's what will happen at 4 pm .
Stories about it will be in the news tonight .
I 'm guessing that later tonight or tomorrow , you can also probably download a PDF from the ND Insurance Commissioner 's website .
Re-update : Nothing very interesting .
BCBS says , basically , " We got caught .
We 're sorry .
It wo n't happen again . "
The ND Insurance Commissioner 's Report is here : Hamm releases Blue Cross Blue Shield target exam report .
There 's a link that gives you the PDF .

The significance of the German elections
25 September 2009
None of the problems confronting working people can be resolved through the Bundestag ( federal parliament ) elections this Sunday , September 27 .
The working class needs a new party based on an international socialist programme .
This is the significance of the participation of the Partei für Soziale Gleichheit ( PSG — Socialist Equality Party ) , the German section of the Fourth International .
Never before have Bundestag elections been manipulated to such an extent as this Sunday ’s poll .
For months , the government , the establishment parties and the media have been trying to hide what is coming after the election .
The vote takes place in the midst of the deepest economic crisis since the 1930s .
But the crisis has not been a topic of discussion in the election campaign .
The government has spent billions in reflationary measures , incentives to purchase autos , and an extension of income supplements for those on short - time work in order to postpone a social confrontation until after the election .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( Christian Democratic Union — CDU ) has conducted a presidential - style election campaign that has evaded any concrete proposals .
All the other parties in the Bundestag have joined in the charade .
They have made all sorts of promises , knowing that they will be dropped as soon as the polling stations close and the business of repaying massive state debts gets underway .
The Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) announced reforms in family and educational policy .
The CDU suggested an increase in the child benefit .
And the posters of the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) demand that “ Work must become worthwhile again ! ”
The worst deceiver is the Left Party , which claims in all seriousness that it is possible to return to the reformist politics of the 1970s without challenging the power of the banks and corporations .
Only in recent days has the veil begun to lift somewhat .
Some in the media believe it is time that the public consider what is to come after the election .
Behind the scenes , all parties are agreed — including the Left Party — that what is required is a government that will declare war on the working class , a government that uses all of the state ’s means of coercion to shift the burden of the economic crisis onto the backs of working people .
The economic weekly Wirtschaftswoche launched the first salvo last week .
The morning after the election , “ Germans will wake up in a different country , ” it wrote .
Then everyone will be talking about what was not mentioned in “ the so - called election campaign ” :
“ A 152 billion euro shortfall in revenues , 320 billion euros in new debts , holes in the social insurance scheme , 90,000 jobs that are in jeopardy in the auto industry , 180,000 jobs at risk in the financial sector , the soon to be four - to - five million unemployed .
Regardless of the election results , the next government will be talking about ‘ blood , sweat and tears . ’ ”
On the Anna Will talk show last Sunday evening , Economics Minister Karl - Theodor Freiherr zu Guttenberg ( Christian Social Union — CSU ) and Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück ( SPD ) spoke about harsh austerity measures .
“ Yes , we will have to make savings , and we will have to do without one or other of our comforts , ” said Guttenberg .
Steinbrück put the new budget deficit at 100 billion euros and indicated that the deficit , together with an expected 320 billion euro reduction in tax revenues , meant drastic cuts would be required .
Since then , representatives of the employers ’ associations and banks have made clear what they expect from the incoming government — or , to be more precise , what they require of the next chancellor .
“ A harsh austerity course ” is inevitable .
The expiration of the short time work regulations will mean a dramatic rise in unemployment .
The pressure on the social security system will increase and therefore benefits will have to be reduced , while state revenues are boosted through tax hikes .
While the banks and speculators have received hundreds of billions of euros to cover their losses , without a single person responsible for the financial disaster being held to account , we are now being told , “ The coffers are empty ; the population must pay for the mounting state deficit . ”
The same bankers and executives who have pillaged the state treasury and received bonuses worth millions from the bank rescue package are now demanding drastic social cuts , the expansion of low - wage labour , and an increase in value added tax .
Rarely before has the class character of society been so clear .
But all such questions were systematically excluded from the election campaign .
Voters were robbed of any possibility of debating and democratically registering their will on the critical issues .
Another question was also suppressed in the election campaign : the war in Afghanistan .
Behind the scenes , it was long ago decided that the number of German troops will be increased substantially after the election , escalating the death toll of German soldiers .
The recent massacre in Kunduz , the greatest war crime committed by the German army since the end of the Second World War , signalled the new course .
An air strike carried out on the orders of a German officer cost at least one hundred lives , including many civilians .
The media and politicians reacted with war hysteria .
The Sьddeutsche Zeitung said it was time to put an end to “ sugar - coating and self - deception . ”
Germany was at war in Afghanistan and should “ finally do it properly . ”
Chancellor Merkel unreservedly supported the military leadership and said in a government statement that she would not tolerate any criticism “ from home or abroad . ”
In this question too , voters are being excluded from any influence on government policy , although the majority of the population opposes the Afghanistan war .
All parties in the Bundestag agree that the German armed forces should not be withdrawn from a war for control of the most important oil and gas reserves in the world .
Here too , the Left Party plays a particularly cynical role .
While it demands the withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan on its election posters , it has long since adapted its politics to those of the federal government .
It reacted to the massacre in Kunduz by making it clear that it was not demanding an immediate withdrawal , and instead called for an “ exit strategy . ”
“ Exit strategy ” is just another term for an escalation of the war and an increase in the number of troops deployed .
The same phrase was used by Foreign Minister Steinmeier to support his plan to expand the number of German soldiers and trainers .
This nascent German militarism is not only directed abroad , but also at home .
Since the crimes committed by Hitler ’s armies , the use of the German armed forces at home has been banned .
But the plans of the Interior Ministry to overturn this ban are far advanced .
This goes hand in hand with increasingly severe restrictions on fundamental democratic rights .
Last year , the state stepped up its monitoring of telephone and computer traffic by 30 percent .
The state and government officials look on the population as opponents and prepare to suppress all resistance from below .
The election next Sunday will not decide whether planned attacks on the population and escalation of the Afghanistan war will take place .
These decisions have long since been made .
The election will merely determine which government constellation carries them out .
Until recently , a coalition of the Christian Democratic Union / Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party was the favoured outcome in ruling circles .
The FDP is considered to be a guarantor of business interests , and by entering the government it would also strengthen the business wing of the CDU .
Moreover , the return of the Social Democrats ( SPD ) to the opposition benches could be used to deflect the danger of the development of powerful extra-parliamentary opposition — as arose during the CDU - SPD grand coalition of the 1960s .
But this scheme is now regarded as too risky .
FDP leader Westerwelle and his demands for tax cuts for high earners and employers have come under increasing criticism .
They could provoke resistance that might overwhelm a coalition between the CDU / CSU and the FDP .
More recently , those calling for a continuation of the existing CDU - SPD grand coalition have found increasing support .
At the beginning of the week , Die Zeit ran an article headlined , “ Once again , CDU - SPD would be the best . ”
The newspaper argued that “ the approaching trials facing our country ” could be managed only “ by a strong and self - confident SPD . ”
The social cuts carried out under the previous SPD - led government of Gerhard Schröder had proven this .
Meeting the coming challenges would demand “ everything from the future federal government .
Only the two people ’s parties can do what is necessary and long overdue .
Together ! ”
It is thus quite possible that the grand coalition under the leadership of Chancellor Merkel ( CDU ) will survive the September 27 poll and remain in office .
However , that does not mean everything will stay the same .
The coming attack on the working class has been under preparation for a long time .
The Left Party and the Greens play a crucial role in this .
Both parties have already shown that they unreservedly support attacks on the fundamental rights of working people .
The Greens , in coalition with the SPD , enacted the welfare and labour “ reforms ” of the Hartz laws and Agenda 2010 .
They also played an important role in removing restrictions on the German armed forces , making possible its deployment in international military operations .
For eight years in the Berlin city legislature , the Left Party has clearly shown how mendacious its social criticism is .
Wherever the party has taken on government responsibility , it has acted as a right - wing party of state .
In the new parliament , the Left Party and the Greens will play a double role .
They will offer a phoney parliamentary opposition in order to prevent the development of extra-parliamentary opposition .
At the same time , both are prepared to take on government responsibility in one form or another in order to stabilise bourgeois rule .
These conditions underscore the significance of the participation of the Partei für Soziale Gleichheit ( PSG — Socialist Equality Party ) in the elections .
We are standing candidates in order to take forward the building of a new party which will enable working people to intervene independently in political events .
We are the only party to openly say that capitalism has failed and that the great social problems of the day can be solved only through the socialist transformation of society .
The election is taking place in the shadow of great historical events .
Seventy years ago , the Second World War began , whose terrible consequences can still be felt today .
As then , the working class today confronts a social struggle that has only two possible outcomes :
Either the working class conquers political power and forms a workers ’ government , breaking the dictatorship of the banks and democratizing the economy , or the ruling class will resort to dictatorial measures and , as in 1933 , impose a dictatorship , mass poverty and war .
The building of a new party must be based on the lessons and principles of past class struggles .
While nationalism and chauvinism are being systematically encouraged , the PSG fights , as the German section of the Fourth International , for the unification of the working class throughout Europe and worldwide on the basis of a socialist programme .
Under these conditions , the building of the PSG takes on enormous significance and urgency .
We call on all readers of the World Socialist Web Site able to cast a ballot on September 27 to vote for the PSG and to actively participate in the building of our party .

The idea of the Rear Projection Urinal is good , although potentially disturbing — especially when your favorite TV anchor appears .
Or when people instinctively follow the ball and end peeing on the next guy in line .
Or when they play a Nicholas Cage movie .
Yes , this can be disturbing and very wrong .
Not as disturbing as the crazy singing clown urinal from Osaka , but close .

5 テンポラリファイルの扱い
背景
2008 年下期には 、Perl の File :: Path モジュールの rmtree 関数に関する CVE が 3 件発表された 。
( CVE-2008-2827 , CVE-2008-5302 , CVE-2008-5303 ) また、symlink attack に関する CVE は 100 件 以上出ている 。
テンポラリファイルの扱いに関する問題は古くからあるが、いまだに多くの問題が発生する。そこで本稿ではテンポラリファイルの扱いかたについて解説する。また、安全な削除に利用できる新しいシステムコールが提案されているので、それについても触れる。
1 テンポラリファイル
テンポラリファイルはプログラムが一時的に利用するファイルである。
Unix においては / tmp や / var / tmp というディレクトリが提供されており、すべてのユーザがそのディレクトリ下にテンポラリファイルを生成・削除するのが慣習である。本稿では、これらのディレクトリの代表として /tmp を例として用いる。
この慣習では、/tmp を複数ユーザで共有する。そして、マルチユーザシステムにおいては他のユーザは必ずしも信用できない。そのため、テンポラリディレクトリ内でのファイル操作には他のユーザが任意のタイミングで介入する可能性があり、通常のファイル操作以上に注意が必要である。不適切に操作を行うと、意図しないファイルの削除や書き換えといったセキュリティ問題を引き起こすことがある。
また、本稿では /tmp 直下にある他ユーザのファイルは unlink , rmdir , rename できないものと仮定する。これは sticky bit ( S_ISVTX フラグ ) の効果であるが、これについては後で述べる。
さらに、テンポラリディレクトリはローカルなファイルシステムであることを仮定する。
つまり NFS 等のリモートファイルシステムについては考慮しない。
2 テンポラリファイルの作成
ディレクトリでない、通常のファイルを /tmp 直下に生成する場合、open システムコールにおいて、第2引数 flags に O_EXCL フラグを指定しなければならない。O_EXCL は、ファイルが既に存在したら失敗するという指定である。また、第3引数 mode には 0600 など、他ユーザはアクセスできないパーミッションを指定する。
たとえば、読み書き両用で foo という名前のテンポラリファイルの生成に挑戦する場合、以下のようになる 。 int fd ; fd = open ( " /tmp/ foo " , O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL , 0600 ) if ( fd == - 1 ) { 失敗に対応する }
もし /tmp/ foo が存在した場合、O_EXCL
の効果によってこの open は失敗する。これにより、例えば他ユーザが
/tmp/ foo から重要なファイル(/etc/passwd や ~/.ssh/authorized_keys など ) へのシンボリックリンクを作るという攻撃を行っても、重要なファイルを意図せず書き換えてしまうことを防ぐことができる
また、パーミッションを 0600 とすることにより、umask の設定に依存せず、他ユーザがファイルを書き換えてしまうことを防げる。
テンポラリファイルを生成するという目的のためには、ファイルが存在して失敗したときには、ファイル名を変えて再挑戦する必要がある。言語や環境によってはこの再挑戦まで含めて安全に行う機能がライブラリとして用意されており、可能ならそれらを使ったほうがよい。そのようなライブラリにはたとえば以下がある。
C 言語の mkstemp ( Single Unix Specification )
C 言語の tmpfile ( ISO C )
シェルスクリプト用の mktemp コマンド ( OpenBSD )
Perl の File :: Temp ライブラ リ
Python の tempfile ライブラ リ
Ruby の tempfile ライブラ リ
PHP の tmpfile なお、歴史的な経緯から、ファイル名を生成するだけの関数がライブラリに用意されていることがある。ファイル名を生成するだけの関数は、間違えた使いかたをしやすいため、基本的には避けるべきである。そのようなものにはたとえば以下がある。
C 言語の mktemp ( Single Unix Specification )
C 言語の tempnam ( Single Unix Specification )
C 言語の tmpnam ( ISO C )
3 テンポラリファイルの削除
/tmp 直下にテンポラリファイルが安全に作成された場合、削除は単に unlink システムコールを使えばよい。
たとえばテンポラリファイルの名前が /tmp / foo であれば、以下のように行う。 if ( unlink ( " / tmp / foo " ) == - 1 ) { 失敗に対応する }
4 テンポラリディレクトリの作成
テンポラリディレクトリを安全に作成するには mkdir システムコールを使用する。その際、第2引数 mode には 0700 など、他ユーザはアクセスできないパーミッションを指定する。 if ( mkdir ( " / tmp / foo " , 0700 ) == - 1 ) { 失敗に対応する }
open とは異なり、mkdir にはフラグ引数がない。mkdir は指定されたファイルが既に存在したときには常に失敗する。なお、指す先が存在しないシンボリックリンクが存在した場合も同様に失敗する。したがって、mkdir が成功すれば、テンポラリディレクトリの作成に成功したことが保証できる。
また、パーミッションを 0700 とすることにより、umask の設定に依存せず、他ユーザがディレクトリを書き換えてしまうことを防げる。
5 テンポラリディレクトリの削除
自分で作ったテンポラリディレクトリを削除する場合には、rmdir システムコールを使用すればよい。例えば以下のように行う。 if ( rmdir ( " / tmp / foo " ) == - 1 ) { 失敗に対応する }
ただし、rmdir は空のディレクトリしか削除できないため、rmdir に先立って内部のファイルをすべて削除しておかなければならない。サブディレクトリがあるのであれば、その内部のファイルを事前に削除しなければならず、一般には再帰的な処理が必要である。
ここで以上の操作が安全なのは、信用できない他ユーザは書き込めないディレクトリを削除する場合である。そうではない場合、すなわち、信用できない他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを削除する場合には必ずしも安全ではない。これについて次に述べる。
6 他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリの削除
他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを削除するにはかなりの注意が必要である。冒頭に触れた
Perl の rmtree の CVE もこの状況を扱う場合の話である。
他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを扱う状況はたとえば以下が考えられる。
テンポラリディレクトリを作成するときに、mkdir に指定するパーミッションとして
たとえば 0777 を指定してしまうと、umask によっては誰でも書き込めるディレ
クトリができてしまう。
たとえば 0777 を指定してしまうと、umask によっては誰でも書き込めるディレ クトリができてしまう。 複数ユーザでディレクトリを共有してファイルを管理する状況。なお、この想定は
テンポラリでないファイルを扱う状況である。
テンポラリでないファイルを扱う状況である。 一般ユーザのテンポラリディレクトリを管理者が削除する場合、管理者にとって、
その一般ユーザという他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを扱うことになる。（な
お、一般ユーザがディレクトリを削除するとき、そのディレクトリは管理者という
他ユーザが書き込めるが、 管理者を信用するのは前提であるため、これは危険
とはみなされない。 ) 最初の状況を避けるのは簡単である。テンポラリディレクトリを生成するときに、mkdir に指定するパーミッションで 0700 を指定すればよい。
しかし、後のふたつの状況を避けることは困難である。複数ユーザで意図的にディレクトリを共有するのであれば、ときに削除が必要になる。また、管理者が一般ユーザのテンポラリディレクトリを削除するのは、/tmp を掃除するときに必要になる。
信用できない他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを削除するのが危険である理由を例によって説明する。
ユーザ A が /tmp / foo に以下のようなディレクトリおよびファイルを作って放置し、管理者が削除することを決定したと仮定する。
/ tmp / foo 所有者がユーザ
A のディレクト リ
/ tmp / foo / passwd 所有者がユーザ A のファイ ル
rmdir システムコールでディレクトリを削除する場合、中身が空でなければならない。
このためディレクトリを削除するツールは、削除対象のディレクトリから末端のファイルまでたどり、末端のファイルから削除を始める。
ディレクトリ構造をたどるには、ディレクトリとそれ以外のファイルを区別し、ディレクトリの場合は再帰的に削除を行うという判断が必要である。このとき、あるパス名が指す実体がディレクトリかどうかを判断するには lstat システムコールを使う。lstat はシンボリックリンクをたどらないため、ディレクトリと、ディレクトリを指すシンボリックリンクを区別できる。
また、ディレクトリであると判明した後に、その直下に存在するファイル名を得るには opendir/readdir/closedir 関数を用いる。以下ではこれらを opendir とだけ記述する。 これを例に適用すると素朴には次の動作となる。
/tmp / foo がディレクトリかどうか lstat で調べる -> ディレクトリである /tmp / foo ディレクトリの中身を opendir で調べる -> passwd がある / tmp / foo / passwd がディレクトリであるかどうか lstat で調べる -> ディレクトリでない /tmp / foo / passwd を unlink で削除する / tmp / foo を rmdir で削除する なお、ここで例にあげたディレクトリ構造ではディレクトリにひとつのファイルしか入っていないため、上記のようなシーケンシャルな動作になるが、一般にはひとつのディレクトリに複数のファイル・ディレクトリが入っているため、再帰的な動作が必要になる。
ところで、 / tmp / foo はユーザ
A が所有しているため、ユー ザ A はいつでも書き換えられる。ここで 、4 の直前、すなわち管理者が / tmp / foo / passwd を lstat でディレクトリでないと判断した後、 / tmp/foo/passwd を unlink で削除する前に、以下の変更を加えた場合を考える。 3.1 . ユーザ A が / tmp / foo を /tmp / bar に rename システムコールで改名す る
3.2 . ユーザ A が /tmp / foo から /etc へのシンボリックリンクを symlink システムコールで作成す る
この場合 、4 で管理者 は /tmp/ foo/ passwd を削除するが、これは /tmp/ foo が /etc へのシンボリックリンクになった後であるため、/etc/passwd を削除することになる。 /etc / passwd は /tmp/foo 内のファイルでは無く、これは意図された削除ではない。/etc/passwd が削除されると、ログインできなくなる等、多くの問題が発生する可能性がある。つまり、ユーザ
A によるシステムへの攻撃が成功する 。
このように上述の素朴なディレクトリ削除は危険である。
同様に、複数ユーザでディレクトリを共有した場合、共有ディレクトリ内で素朴な削除を行った場合、共有していないユーザ個人のファイルの削除を引き起こす可能性がある。
この危険性は、/tmp/foo/passwd というパス名が指すファイルの実体が/ , /tmp , /tmp/foo というパス内の上位の要素の変化に伴って変わりうる、という点が原因である。/
と /tmp が指すファイルは管理者しか変更できないので問題ないが、/tmp/foo はユーザ A が変更できるので現実的な問題となる。
上記の素朴な削除では、/tmp/foo がシンボリックリンクでない本物のディレクトリであることを一度は確認しており、その確認した時点では
/tmp/foo/passwd を削除すべきであるという判断は正しい。しかし、/tmp/foo はユーザ
A がいつでも変更できるので、実際に削除する時点でもその判断が正しいという保証はなく、そのずれが脆弱性を生んでいる。このように確認してから実際に行うまでの時間差の問題を
TOCTTOU ( Time of Check to Time of Use ) 問題という 。
これを安全に削除するひとつの方法は、chdir システムコールを用いてカレントディレクトリを移動し、unlink に与えるパスは / を含まない単純なファイル名にすることである。chdir でカレントディレクトリを移動した後、本当に削除対象のファイルがあるディレクトリに移動できたかどうかを検査し、意図どおりに移動できていなかったら中断する。 chdir はファイルシステムを変更しない操作なので、ここで中断すればファイルシステムに悪影響を与えない。そして、/
を含まない単純なファイル名での unlink は、カレントディレクトリ直下のファイルしか削除できない。このため、unlink によってどのファイルが削除されても、それは削除対象ディレクトリ直下のファイルであるから削除対象であり、削除して問題ない 。
ここでカレントディレクトリが本当に意図したディレクトリであるかどうかという検査が必要になる。これは lstat システムコールで得た st_dev ( デバイス番号 ) と st_ino ( iノード番号 ) を比較することで行う。削除対象のディレクトリのパス名で lstat した結果と、chdir した後にカレントディレクトリ " . " を lstat した結果で st_dev と st_ino がそれぞれ一致すれば、意図どおりのディレクトリに移動できたことがわかる。もし異なれば、lstat してから chdir するまでにディレクトリがシンボリックリンクにすり替えられる等の攻撃を受けていることになる。
この方法により前述 の /tmp/foo を安全に削除すると以下のようになる。
/tmp を lstat して結果を記録する /tmp に chdir で移動する カレントディレクトリを lstat して / tmp の lstat の結果と比較する -> 異なっていたら中断する foo を lstat してディレクトリかどうか調べる -> ディレクトリである foo に chdir で移動する カレントディレクトリを lstat して 、foo の lstat の結果と比較する -> 異なっていたら中断する カレントディレクトリの中身を opendir で調べる -> passwd がある passwd を lstat でディレクトリかどうか調べる -> ディレクトリでない passwd を unlink で削除する 親ディレクトリ " .. " に chdir する カレントディレクトリを lstat して、 / tmp の lstat の結果と比較する -> 異なっていたら中断する foo を rmdir で削除する このように削除しているとき、ユー ザ
A が /tmp / foo を /tmp / bar に rename し、 /tmp/ foo を /etc へのシンボリックリンクにする攻撃を行うと考える。
この攻撃が 4 以前に行われると 、foo はディレクトリでないと判断され、攻撃で作られたシンボリックリンク foo を unlink して終了する。つまり、 / etc / passwd は unlink されず、攻撃は失敗する 。
攻撃が 4 と 5 の間で行われると、5 の chdir では /etc にカレントディレクトリが移動することになる。しかし、6 の検査で意図しないディレクトリに移動したことが検出されて中断する。つまり、/etc/passwd は unlink されず、攻撃は失敗する 。
攻撃が 5 以降 12 以前に行われると、削除開始時点におい て
/tmp/foo/ passwd に存在したファイルの削除が行われる。/etc/passwd は unlink されず、攻撃は失敗する。なお攻撃 が
9以前である場合は、削除されるファイルは /tmp/bar/ passwd という削除対象外のパスに移動している。しかし、削除開始時点においては
/tmp/foo/passwd という削除対象であったため、これを削除することは間違いでない。
攻撃が 12以降に行われた場合、/tmp/foo が存在しないため、/tmp/foo を /tmp / bar に rename することができない。このため、攻撃は失敗する。
このように、どのタイミングで攻撃が起きても、/etc/passwd は unlink されず、攻撃は失敗する 。
一般には、chdir でをカレントディレクトリに移動したときに、意図どおりに移動できたことを確認すれば、関係ないファイルの削除を防ぐことができる。
7 新システムコール : openat とその仲 間
前節では他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを chdir を用いて安全に削除する方法について述べた。
しかし、chdir はカレントディレクトリというプロセス属性を変更するため、スレッドセーフでない。これは rm のような削除専用コマンドであれば問題にならないが
、Perl などのように用途を限定しない言語のライブラリとしては問題がある。
スレッドセーフかつ安全に他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを削除するのは簡単でない。
カレントディレクトリに依存せずに /tmp / foo / passwd を削除するには、/tmp/foo/passwd というパス名を unlink に与えざるを得ない。したがって、他ユーザ が
/tmp/ foo を変更できるとすれば危険性を排除できない。この危険性を排除するためには、/tmp/foo
を他ユーザが変更できないようにすることが考えられる。たとえば、/tmp/foo の所有者を自分に変更して、パーミッションを
700 に変えるなどである。
しかし、所有者を変更することは管理者しかできない。また、所有者やパーミッションの変更はそれ自体が symlink attack の対象になるため、注意深い実装が必要である。
スレッドセーフかつ安全に他ユーザが書き込めるディレクトリを削除することにはさまざまな困難があり、可能な限り避けたほうがよい。とくに、テンポラリディレクトリを生成・削除するだけであれば、生成時にパーミッションを
0700 に設定するだけで避けられるのでぜひそうやって避けるべきである。
ただし、最近、安全なディレクトリの削除にも利用できる新しい
API が実装・提案されている。openat に代表されるこの API は、ファイルディスクリプタを活用して、パス名をたどってファイルの実体を得る操作を削減可能とする。まず、パス名を受け取る多くのシステムコールに対応して、加えてカレントディレクトリの代わりになるファイルディスクリプタも受け取るシステムコールが用意される。また、パス名を受け取る代わりにファイルディスクリプタを受け取るシステムコール・関数もいくつか用意される。
たとえば、open システムコールに対応して、openat システムコールが定義される。openat は open の引数に加え、ディレクトリを示すファイルディスクリプタを受け取り、パス名が相対パスだったときに、起点にカレントディレクトリでなく指定されたファイルディスクリプタを用いる。
また、これらのシステムコールの多くにはフラグ引数も追加され、動作を修飾できる。たとえば、指定したファイルディスクリプタでなく、プロセスのカレントディレクトリを用いるというフラグが指定ができる。また、fstatat システムコールでは、シンボリックリンクをたどるかどうかを指定でき、stat と lstat のどちらの動作も選べ る。unlinkat システムコールはディレクトリの削除かどうかを指定でき、unlink と rmdir のどちらの動作も選べる 。
さらに fdopendir 関数が用意され、open して得たファイルディスクリプタをもとに DIR 構造体を生成できる。これにより、ディレクトリを open した結果を 、readdir / closedir に使うことができる 。
これらにより、カレントディレクトリに依存せずに安全なディレクトリの削除を実装できる。つまり、カレントディレクトリの代わりにディレクトリを open したファイルディスクリプタを使えばよい。たとえば、前述した
/tmp/foo/passwd の削除は以下のように実現できる。
/tmp を lstat して結果を記録する / tmp を open する -> fd_tmp が得られる fd_tmp を fstat して / tmp の lstat の結果と比較する -> 異なっていたら中断する fd_tmp から相対で foo を fstatat してディレクトリかどうか調べる -> ディレクトリである fd_tmp から相対で foo を openat する -> fd_foo が得られる fd_foo を fstat して foo の fstatat の結果と比較する -> 異なっていたら中断する fd_foo の中身を fdopendir で調べる -> passwd がある fd_foo から相対で passwd を fstatat でディレクトリかどうか調べる -> ディレクトリでない fd_foo から相対で passwd を unlinkat で削除する fd_foo を close する fd_tmp から相対で foo ディレクトリを unlinkat で削除する fd_tmp を close する なお、ここで fstatat はシンボリックリンクをたどらないようにフラグを指定して使用するものとする。
この方法は、chdir による方法と同様に安全であり、かつ、カレントディレクトリに依存していないのでスレッドセーフである。
openat は Solaris 9 で実装され 、Linux 2.6.16 でも実装された。POSIX
の次期バージョンにも提案されており、広く普及していくことが期待される。
8 sticky bit
本稿では /tmp 直下にある他ユーザのファイルは unlink , rmdir , rename できないものと仮定している。これは /tmp には sticky bit ( S_ISVTX フラグ ) が設定されていることを意味している。
Unix では原則的に、あるファイルの unlink や rename はそのファイル自身の所有者には関係なく、そのファイルが存在するディレクトリに書き込み権限があるかどうかによって決まる。
この原則 を /tmp にそのまま適用すると、/tmp は誰でも書き込み可能であるから、 直下に作ったテンポラリファイルは誰のファイルでも削除・改名できることになる 。
この場合、自分が作ったテンポラリファイルを後で open して使ってはならない。たとえば他のコマンドにパス名を渡して使わせるのも危険である。そのコマンドがそのパス名で open するとき、そこにあったファイルは削除されたり、別のファイルにすり替えられている可能性がある。
このように自由に削除・改名できてしまうのは不適切であるため、ディレクトリには sticky bit を設定できる 。
sticky bit が設定されているディレクトリ下のファイルは、その sticky bit の設定されているディレクトリもしくは削除対象のファイルの所有者か、あるいは特権があるユーザしか unlink はできな い。unlink だけでなく、rename にも同様な制約がある 。
この制約により、/tmp 直下にテンポラリファイルを生成すると、生成したファイルは信用できない他ユーザにすり替えられることはない。
9 環境変数 TMPDIR
ここまでに述べたように、テンポラリファイルを安全に扱うには注意が必要である。しかし、そもそもそのように注意が必要なのは、ユーザ全員が /tmp を共有しているという理由が大きい。
もし、/tmp のような共有ディレクトリを用いず、個々のユーザ専用のディレクトリ内にテンポラリファイルを生成するのであれば、危険性はかなり抑制される。
そこで、テンポラリファイルを生成するアプリケーションは、生成するディレクトリを外部から指定できることが望まれる。
そして、外部からテンポラリファイルのためのディレクトリを指定するには環境変数
TMPDIR を使うという慣習がある。もし TMPDIR が設定されているなら、そのディレクトリ内にテンポラリファイルを生成することが期待される。
アプリケーションが TMPDIR をサポートしていれば、 / tmp を避けることが可能となる。
ただし 、TMPDIR を使うには TMPDIR 環境変数が悪意をもって設定されてはならない。従って、リモートから環境変数を任意に設定できる機能を持っているアプリケーションでは素朴にサポートしてはならない。
なお、C 言語の mkstemp , tmpfile 関数は TMPDIR をサポートしていないので、サポートするには別途コードが必要になる。また、OpenBSD の mktemp コマンドは -t オプションにより TMPDIR を使うようになる 。

Computer Scientists Take Over
Electronic Voting Machine with
New Programming Technique
By Daniel Kane
The Sequoia AVC Advantage electronic voting machine that the computer scientists demonstrated could be turned against itself and used to steal votes .
Computer scientists demonstrated that criminals could hack an electronic voting machine and steal votes using a malicious programming approach that had not been invented when the voting machine was designed .
The team of scientists from University of California , San Diego , the University of Michigan , and Princeton University employed “ return - oriented programming ” to force a Sequoia AVC Advantage electronic voting machine to turn against itself and steal votes .
“ Voting machines must remain secure throughout their entire service lifetime , and this study demonstrates how a relatively new programming technique can be used to take control of a voting machine that was designed to resist takeover , but that did not anticipate this new kind of malicious programming , ” said Hovav Shacham , a professor of computer science at UC San Diego ’s Jacobs School of Engineering and an author on the new study presented on August 10 , 2009 at the 2009 Electronic Voting Technology Workshop / Workshop on Trustworthy Elections ( EVT / WOTE 2009 ) , the premier academic forum for voting security research .

Computer science professor Hovav Shacham ( left ) and computer science Ph.D. student Stephen Checkoway ( right ) .
Checkoway did the bulk of the reverse engineering of the voting machine software .
In 2007 , Shacham first described return - oriented programming , which is a powerful systems security exploit that generates malicious behavior by combining short snippets of benign code already present in the system .
The new study demonstrates that return - oriented programming can be used to execute vote - stealing computations by taking control of a voting machine designed to prevent code injection .
Shacham and UC San Diego computer science Ph.D. student Stephen Checkoway collaborated with researchers from Princeton University and the University of Michigan on this project .
“ With this work , we hope to encourage further public dialog regarding what voting technologies can best ensure secure elections and what stop gap measures should be adopted if less than optimal systems are still in use , ” said J. Alex Halderman , an electrical engineering and computer science professor at the University of Michigan .
The computer scientists had no access to the machine ’s source code — or any other proprietary information — when designing the demonstration attack .
By using just the information that would be available to anyone who bought or stole a voting machine , the researchers addressed a common criticism made against voting security researchers : that they enjoy unrealistic access to the systems they study .
“ Based on our understanding of security and computer technology , it looks like paper - based elections are the way to go .
Probably the best approach would involve fast optical scanners reading paper ballots .
These kinds of paper - based systems are amenable to statistical audits , which is something the election security research community is shifting to , ” said Shacham .
“ You can actually run a modern and efficient election on paper that does not look like the Florida 2000 Presidential election , ” said Shacham .
“ If you are using electronic voting machines , you need to have a separate paper record at the very least . ”
Last year , Shacham , Halderman and others authored a paper entitled “ You Go to Elections with the Voting System You have : Stop - Gap Mitigations for Deployed Voting Systems ” that was presented at the 2008 Electronic Voting Technology Workshop . ”
http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/papers/hrsw08.html
“ This research shows that voting machines must be secure even against attacks that were not yet invented when the machines were designed and sold .
Preventing not - yet - discovered attacks requires an extraordinary level of security engineering , or the use of safeguards such as voter - verified paper ballots , ” said Edward Felten , an author on the new study ; Director of the Center for Information Technology Policy ; and Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton University .
Return - Oriented Programming Demonstrates Voting Machine Vulnerabilities
To take over the voting machine , the computer scientists found a flaw in its software that could be exploited with return - oriented programming .
But before they could find a flaw in the software , they had to reverse engineer the machine ’s software and its hardware — without the benefit of source code .
Princeton University computer scientists affiliated with the Center for Information Technology Policy began by reverse engineering the hardware of a decommissioned Sequoia AVC Advantage electronic voting machine , purchased legally through a government auction .
J. Alex Halderman — an electrical engineering and computer science professor at the University of Michigan ( who recently finished his Ph.D. in computer science at Princeton ) and Ariel Feldman — a Princeton University computer science Ph.D. student , reverse - engineered the hardware and documented its behavior .
It soon became clear to the researchers that the voting machine had been designed to reject any injected code that might be used to take over the machine .
When they learned of Shacham ’s return - oriented programming approach , the UC San Diego computer scientists were invited to take over the project .
Stephen Checkoway , the computer science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego , did the bulk of the reverse engineering of the voting machine ’s software .
He deciphered the software by reading the machine ’s read - only memory .
Simultaneously , Checkoway extended return - oriented programming to the voting machine ’s processor architecture , the Z80 .
Once Checkoway and Shacham found the flaw in the voting machine ’s software — a search which took some time — they were ready to use return - oriented programming to expose the machine ’s vulnerabilities and steal votes .
The computer scientists crafted a demonstration attack using return - oriented programming that successfully took control of the reverse engineered software and hardware and changed vote totals .
Next , Shacham and Checkoway flew to Princeton and proved that their demonstration attack worked on the actual voting machine , and not just the simulated version that the computer scientists built .
The computer scientists showed that an attacker would need just a few minutes of access to the machine the night before the election in order to take it over and steal votes the following day .
The attacker introduces the demonstration attack into the machine through a cartridge with maliciously constructed contents that is inserted into an unused port in the machine .
The attacker navigates the machine ’s menus to trigger the vulnerability the researchers found .
Now , the malicious software controls the machine .
The attacker can , at this point , remove the cartridge , turn the machine ’s power switch to the “ off ” position , and leave .
Everything appears normal , but the attacker ’s software is silently at work .
When poll workers enter in the morning , they normally turn this type of voting machine on .
At this point , the exploit would make the machine appear to turn back on , even though it was never actually turned off .
“ We overwrote the computer ’s memory and state so it does what we want it to do , but if you shut off the machine and reboot from ROM , the exploit is gone and the machine returns to its original behavior , ” explained Checkoway .
The computer scientists tested a machine that is very similar to machines that are used today in New Jersey and Louisiana .
These New Jersey and Louisiana machines may have corrected the specific vulnerabilities the computer scientists exploited , but they have the same architectural limitations .
The researchers highlight the possibility that current voting machines will be vulnerable to return - oriented programming attacks similar to the attack demonstrated in this study .
“ This work shows how difficult it is to design voting machines that will remain secure over time .
It ’s impossible to anticipate what new kinds of attacks will be discovered in the future , ” said Halderman .

Long before Flight of the Conchords landed themselves a series deal with HBO that would one day lead them to a scad of surprise Emmy nominations , the British cult comedy duo known as the Mighty Boosh had produced a couple of seasons ’ worth of highly acclaimed and utterly hilarious shows for the BBC .
The show , which focuses on the wildly surrealistic adventures of the androgynous hipster Vince Noir ( Noel Fielding ) and the jazz - loving intellectual Howard Moon ( Julian Barratt ) , has been a smash success in the U.K. since its premiere in 2004 , but is only just now making its way to these shores .
Not only does the program air at 1 a.m. — on Sunday nights during the Cartoon Network ’s Adult Swim block — but the first three seasons were just released on DVD last week .
Vulture sat down with the Mighty Boosh at the Soho Grand last week , on the eve of their first - ever United States performance , to discuss their plans to win over audiences Stateside , how their show might have been different had they launched it in the U.S. , and what they ’re planning on doing next .
We were n’t invited !
We always did want to come over here , but we ’re very English , so we have to be asked .
We ’re not just gonna turn up .
Well , at least not without wine and cake .
We find it slightly embarrassing to just turn up , and to sell yourself , as well .
Over here , it ’s very understood that you have to sell yourself and we ’ve always been a bit more , a bit more … Cool .
Yeah , we want to come to you like a summer breeze .
A nice , summer , balmy breeze .
That light summer breeze you get on a hot beach that just gets you cool .
Do you have any ambitions to …
Noel : None at all .
… to do any of the live shows that you ’ve famously put on overseas ?
Noel :
We have a lot of big shows that we do in England ; we ’d love to come and do that over here .
It ’s a big old production , with trucks and a band and revolving sets .
We ’d love to come and do that here .
Hopefully , if we can give people sort of a taste of what we do , they ’ll invite us back for a bit of a bigger - scale production .
One of the things that has always struck us about the show is that there ’s clearly such a great dynamic between you two as performers .
But Howard and Vince have such a weird friendship ; they just seem so different .
Noel :
Well , I think that ’s true of a lot of your friends , is n’t it ?
I ’ve got a lot of friends who I ’m like , “ How am I friends with you ? ”
Julian :
They ’ve been around each other a lot , so they ’ve got a lot of shorthand .
Noel :
And they ’re terrible without each other .
So it ’s a yin -yang sort of thing ?
Noel : Yeah , I think so .
A bit like brothers , actually .
I used to do that with my brother , who plays Naboo on the show .
As soon as my mother would separate us , I ’d be like , “ Where ’s Michael gone ? … now I ’m really bored . ”
The show seems to have a real surrealistic streak to it .
Can you tell us a little bit about …
Noel : About surrealism ?
No , more about the creative process and how you two come up with such bizarre settings and plotlines .
Noel :
We start with the ideas , big ideas for the episodes sort of thing .
Like , maybe Naboo turns Bollo back into a man , because that ’s the backstory of Bollo .
He was maybe a man who was cursed , we were thinking about doing an episode about that .
That gives you enough to start with .
Julian :
We did n’t start out sketching out whole seasons , arcs , or stories .
We were just happy to get on TV , so we did n’t really think too much , long - term , about what happens to the characters over the length of the show .
Noel : In England , it needs to work quite well straight away .
You have to do fairly well in order to get another series .
Julian :
We do things that are very personal to us .
We thought if we were true to what makes us laugh , that would be a powerful thing that people could get into .
Do you think things might ’ve been different had you originally done the show for U.S. television instead of the BBC ?
Julian :
Well , when we first went into it , we had producers telling us …
Noel : [ In a producer voice ] “ You should get a woman in it ! ” [ In his voice ] “ But I ’m the woman !
We already have a woman ! ”
But here ’s what happened , because we actually thought about that .
We thought , “ Oh , actually , it would be really funny if there were a woman that Howard really fancied that did n’t even know he existed . ”
So if we think of a good idea that requires a funny woman in it , we ’re not against anything , really .
As you can see , we have an ape in our show — we ’re not against anything !
Well , I guess he ’s an alien , is n’t he ?
We thought that the shaman would be supernatural and sort of from different planets .
We thought of a spinoff series focusing on the shaman .
Like X - Files , only they never solve anything .
We did think that something like that is more easy to understand because you know straight away that it ’s weird , whereas with our show , it creeps up on you .
You ’ve already conquered radio , live shows , and television .
Do you have any plans to take on Hollywood ?
Noel :
We ’re starting writing a film actually , soon .
We ’ve sort of got some backing to make a film ; we just want to make sure we ’ve got the right idea .
That we ’ve got an idea that will carry .
Julian :
We want it to work for people who have n’t seen the show on television .
Noel :
Also , we ’ve done a lot of narratives , have n’t we ?
We ’ve done like maybe 30 or 40 narratives …
Julian :
We ’ve done as much narrative as Shakespeare .
Much more .
Noel : Slightly clunkier , though .
We get drawn to stories when we work together .
We were always obsessed with epic journeys , like Sinbad and Arabian Nights .
So that ’s something we always thought would be nice , to take two idiots who just live in London — one thinks he ’s trendy and the other thinks he ’s intellectually supreme — and then they go out and actually get involved in quests .
[ In Tony Harrison ’s voice ]
“ When I go , I go big !
” We just find it funny that these mythical beasts would do drugs , and what would happen to them when they did .
Tony Harrison , he ’s a bit like a dad , is n’t he ?
When he goes on trips to France , he ’s got a flask , he ’s not “ I ’m off his face . ”
He does love his poppers , though .
I ’ve got a few questions about some of the show ’s most famous characters .
Let ’s start with the Moon .
Is he , um , mentally challenged ?
Noel :
He ’s retarded .
No , he ’s very old , is n’t he ?
He ’s very old and he ’s quite simple .
I do n’t know where that voice came from , really ; he sounds a little bit like an old Eastern European daft — a simpleton .
And how about Old Gregg ?
Julian : Oh , you mean the transsexual sea creature ?
It came from a basket that we have in the basement .
No , I mean , we have no idea where these things come from , we just talk and it all comes out .
Noel :
Well , we thought it would be funny if it were a merman instead of a mermaid , and then we thought it ’d be a bit funny if he were like Rick James , because we were really into Rick James , ODB , Wu - Tang Clan , and Little Richard at the time .
And then we thought , “ What if he had a vagina ? ”
But seeing as how he ’s a man , we figured it should be a mangina .
And he ’s a little bit like a serial killer as well .
He genuinely loves Howard , but he ’s confused .
So what ’s next on the horizon for the Mighty Boosh ?
Is there a series four in the works ?
Noel :
We have to make a decision , do n’t we ?
We ’re either going to make an album , a film , or a season four .
We ’ve got offers to do a few things , we ’re just trying to decide what we should do next .
In England , people are like “ When ’s season four coming out ? ” and we go , “ You ’re not in America ; they ’re called series here . ”
And then we slap them [ laughs ] .
Who knows , maybe a dance piece ?
NOT only is it disgusting , it is one of the surest ways to spread swine flu .
But people are getting away with spitting in the street because a loophole in the law has left councils powerless to act .
With health experts warning the habit can transmit infectious diseases , including the N1H1 influenza strain which has so far killed 36 people in NSW , a flaw in government legislation means any fines issued for spitting would be lost in court .
Public spitting was decriminalised in 1993 and is no longer part of the Public Health Act.
Rockdale Mayor Bill Saravinovski said : " We keep being told by the Government that we can prosecute people but our legal advice is that we 'll lose the cases if they go to court because it is not a criminal offence .
" I'm not going to waste ratepayers ' money by taking matters to court that are not going to win when all we need is the Government to make one change and there would be no problem .
" I find spitting disgusting but , more importantly , we want the Government to ban it for health reasons , particularly with the swine flu . "
He and Auburn Council Mayor Irene Simms said the Government refused to listen and that changes were needed to the Local Government Act to back fines for spitting .
But Local Government Minister Barbara Perry was adamant no changes were needed because " all councils have the power to prohibit spitting in designated areas " and people breaching that rule could be fined $ 110 .
" If councils provide me with any specific instances where they have encountered difficulties in enforcing fines , I 'll look into them , " she said .
The impasse has lasted three years since Fairfield Council tried to fine people for spitting in 2006 .
A council spokeswoman said that when it asked for spitting to be made illegal , NSW Health responded that " spitting does n't impact on the transmission of infectious diseases " .

The government 's dizzying statistic that over seven million Brits are involved in online piracy comes from dubious research commissioned by the music industry itself .
When the UK government advisory body , the Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property , released an 85 - page report in May pronouncing billions of pounds worth of economic losses and thousands of jobs lost annually due to illegal downloads , its claim of more than seven million freeloaders residing in Britain made headlines .
But the BBC Radio 4 show More or Less has investigated the figure and uncovered not only its rather questionable origin , but the massive statistical assumptions used to arrive at seven million .
The Advisory Board said it commissioned its digital piracy research from a team of academics at University College London called CIBER , which cited the 7 million figure as originating from a paper published by Forrester Research .
But when More or Less got a copy of the Forrester paper cited in the study , they discovered the 7 million figure was never actually mentioned .
So they contacted one of the Forrester paper 's authors , Mark Mulligan , who explained the number actually came from a separate report he had written for the Forrester subsidiary , Jupiter Research .
A paper that was privately commissioned by the British recording industry trade association , BPI .
A government advisory body quoting figures paid for by a trade association that 's actively lobbying for a crackdown on file - sharers is n't the worst of it either .
According to More or Less , the 7 million figure was actually rounded up from 6.7 million .
The 6.7 million came from a 2008 survey of a mere 1,176 households connected to the internet .
For the survey , 11.6 per cent of respondents ( 136 people ) said they had used file - sharing software .
The 11.6 per cent figure was then adjusted upwards to 16.3 per cent to reflect the assumption that more people would n't admit to file sharing .
( Mulligan told the show that the adjustment was n't pulled out of thin air , but based on unspecified evidence ) .
The BPI - sponsored research also went under the assumption that there were 40 million people online in the UK in 2008 — a figure much higher than the Office of National Statistics ' estimate of 33.9 million that year .
The show notes that even if you accept the statistic that 16.3 per cent of the UK 's online population is involved with illegal file - sharing , using the ONS figure would result in only 5.6 million offenders .
And if you also do n't adjust for under - reporting , it drops down to 3.9 million .
While neither of the numbers are necessarily more accurate than the BPI - sponsored estimates , it does illustrate that a few cooked assumptions here and some generous rounding there makes for a statistic specifically designed to scare .
That number can also easily ooze up the ladder directly into the government 's ear .

I still get a thrill whenever I get my hands on a confidential memo with “ The White House , Washington ” appearing on the letterhead .
Even when – like the one I 'm looking at now – it's about a snoozy topic :
This week 's G - 20 summit .
But the letter 's content shook me awake , and may keep me up the rest of the night .
The 6 - page letter from the White House , dated September 3 , was sent to the 20 heads of state that will meet this Thursday in Pittsburgh .
After some initial diplo - blather , our President 's “ sherpa ” for the summit , Michael Froman , does a little victory dance , announcing that the recession has been defeated .
“ Global equity markets have risen 35 percent since the end of March , ” writes Froman .
In other words , the stock market is up and all 's well .
While acknowledging that this year 's economy has gone to hell in a handbag , Obama 's aide and ambassador to the G - 20 seems to be parroting the irrational exuberance of Federal Reserve Chief Ben Bernanke who declared last week that , “ The recession is very likely over . ”
All that was missing from Bernanke 's statement was a banner , “ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED . ”
And the French are furious .
The White House letter to the G - 20 leaders was a response to a confidential diplomatic missive from the chief of the European Union Fredrik Reinfeldt written a day earlier to “ Monsieur le Président ” Obama .
We have Reinfeldt 's confidential note as well .
In it , the EU president says , despite Bernanke 's happy - talk , “ la crise n'est pas terminÃ©e ( the crisis is not over ) and ( continuing in translation ) the labor market will continue to suffer the consequences of weak use of capacity and production in the coming months . ”
This is diplomatic speak for , What the hell is Bernanke smoking ?
May I remind you Monsieur le Président , that last month 216,000 Americans lost their jobs , bringing the total lost since your inauguration to about seven million .
And rising .
The Wall Street Journal also has a copy of the White House letter , though they have n't released it .
( I have : read it here , with the EU message and our translation . )
The Journal spins the leak as the White House would want it : “ Big Changes to Global Economic Policy ” to produce “ lasting growth . ”
Obama takes charge !
What 's missing in the Journal report is that Obama 's plan subtly but significantly throttles back European demands to tighten finance industry regulation and , most important , deflects the EU 's concern about fighting unemployment .
Europe 's leaders are scared witless that the Obama Administration will prematurely turn off the fiscal and monetary stimulus .
Europe demands that the US continue pumping the economy under an internationally coordinated worldwide save - our - butts program .
As the EU 's Reinfeldt puts it in his plea to the White House , “ It is essential that the Heads of State and Government , at this summit , continue to implement the economic policy measures they have adopted , ” and not act unilaterally .
“ Exit strategies [ must ] be implemented in a coordinated manner . ”
Translating from the diplomatique :
If you in the USA turn off fiscal and monetary stimulus now , on your own , Europe and the planet sinks , America with it .
Obama 's ambassador says , Non !
Instead , he writes that each nation should be allowed to “ unwind ” anti-recession efforts “ at a pace appropriate to the circumstances of each economy . ”
In other words , “ Europe , you 're on your own ! ” So much for Obama channeling FDR .
The technical policy conflict between the Obama and EU plans reflects a deep difference in the answer to a crucial question :
Whose recession is it , anyway ?
To Obama and Bernanke , this is a bankers ' recession and so , as “ stresses in financial markets have abated significantly , ” to use the words of the White House epistle , then Happy Days Are Here Again .
But , if this recession is about workers the world over losing their jobs and life savings , the EU view , then it 's still Buddy , Can You Spare a Dime .
If Bernanke and Obama were truly concerned about preserving jobs , they would have required banks loaded with taxpayer bail - out loot to lend these funds to consumers and business .
China did so , ordering its banks to increase credit .
And boy , did they , expanding credit by an eye - popping 30 % , rocketing China 's economy out of recession and into double - digit growth .
But the Obama Administration has gone the opposite way .
The White House letter to the G - 20 calls for slowly increasing bank reserves , and that can only cause a tight credit market to tighten further .
It 's not that the White House completely ignores job losses .
The US letter suggests , “ The G - 20 should commit to … income support for the unemployed . ”
You can imagine the Europeans , who already have generous unemployment benefits – most without time limits – turning purple over that one .
America 's stingy unemployment compensation extension under the Stimulus Plan is already beginning to expire with no live proposal to continue aid for the jobless victims of this recession .
The Europeans are so cute when they 're angry , when they pound their little fists .
Obama assumes he can ignore them .
The EU , once the big player in the G - 7 , has seen its members ' status diluted into the G - 20 , where the BRIC powers ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) now flex their muscle .
But Europeans have a thing or two to teach Americans about the economics of the twilight of empire .
Maybe the differences are cultural , not economic ; that Europeans lack America 's Manifest Destiny can - do optimism .
So , to give the visitors a taste of the yes - we - can spirit , Obama should invite Pittsburgh 's 93,700 jobless to the G - 20 meet to celebrate that 35 % rise in the stock market .
Or — my own suggestion — change Bernanke 's medication .

Replica of the Ark of the Covenant in the Royal Arch Room of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial .
When you hear the words “ Ark of the Covenant ” what comes to mind ?
For some , Steven Spielberg ’s film “ Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark ” provides the most vivid pop-culture reference to this mysterious sacred object .
The quest to find the real Ark has inspired generations of adventurers and Hollywood directors , but the trail has always gone cold .
Is the Ark of the Covenant real ?
“ Different people will give you different answers to that question , ” said Baruch Halpern , Penn State professor of ancient history , classics and ancient Mediterranean studies , and religious studies .
“ The Ark is a regular feature in the Old Testament , making several appearances in the first five books of the Bible .
There are many consistent references to the Ark , and when you add it all up , it seems like the Ark was a real article . ”
According to scriptural accounts , Halpern said , the Ark is a box made from acacia wood , covered in gold and used as a container for the stone blocks bearing the Ten Commandments .
Said to have been built at God ’s command , the Ark is believed to measure about 4 feet by 2 feet by 2.5 feet and features gold rings on the two long sides that hold the wooden poles used to carry it .
The top surface of the Ark is decorated with two cherubim , or angels , who crouch facing each other with wings outstretched , forming a seat .
Believers say God himself occupies that seat , while the Ark served as a footstool , Halpern said .
There are references in other ancient texts of similar “ containers ” used to transport sacred relics , and the image of God sitting on the wings of cherubim with his feet resting on the Ark below fits with depictions of ancient kings , he said .
“ It ’s also important to note that it was n’t just the Ark being carried into battle .
YHWH , the name accorded the god of Israel in much of the Bible and later literature , accompanies the Ark into battle , giving it miraculous power , ” Halpern said .
There are many references to the awesome power of the Ark , he said .
Various Bible stories describe how , during the exodus of the Israelites , the power of the Ark parted the river Jordan to allowing the people to pass .
During the siege of Jericho , the Ark was toted around the city walls in a seven day procession accompanied by seven priests sounding seven trumpets – and made the city walls come tumbling down .
The ferocity of the Ark was so great that it had to be covered by a veil while being carried around , and could bring misfortune and tragedy on those who disrespected it .
Despite the powers it was said to possess , the Ark was eventually lost to the sands of time .
The last Biblical mention of the Ark comes when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple where the Ark was stored , Halpern said .
After this point , the fate of the Ark is the subject of much speculation .
One theory is that the Ark was captured by an Egyptian pharaoh , a tale that gave rise to the Raiders of the Lost Ark movie plot .
Another possibility is that the Ark was hidden by priests under the Temple Mount for safekeeping , or spirited away to an unknown site before the Babylonians even arrived in Jerusalem .
Other suggestions are that the Ark was removed by divine intervention , taken by an Ethiopian prince , or destroyed in battle .
“ They ’re all fantasy , and we ’ll never really know which one is true , ” Halpern said .
“ Some theories seem more plausible than others .
Was the Ark hidden from the Babylonians ?
Unlikely .
Did the Babylonians take it ?
That theory is more probable . ”
Like Indiana Jones , some real - life scholar - adventurers are on the trail of the Ark , with one researcher claiming to have found the remnants of the Ark stored in a library in Zimbabwe .
Could this be true ?
In some ways , the story of the Ark is similar to other Judeo - Christian religious relics such as the Shroud of Turin and Noah ’s Ark , Halpern said .
“ You have to remember why this scripture was written in the first place , and see the Ark ’s symbolic power to people as a sacred object .
If you try to over - explain it , you lose the power of the story . ”

IRELAND HAS agreed to accept two Uzbek detainees at the US military prison at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba for resettlement in Ireland .
Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said the Government had told US authorities that it would accept two detainees , and two Uzbek nationals had been identified by the US for patriation to Ireland .
“ The US authorities have identified two people from Uzbek who have been in Guantánamo for some time .
There has been a campaign in relation to one of them , his advocates believe he was completely wrongly brought to Guantánamo and we are currently examining those , ” said Mr Martin .
A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs could not name the individuals or say when they might arrive other than to say he expected they would be transported here “ when the prison closes or when they are released ” .
Amnesty International welcomed the announcement but also could not provide information about who the two were .
A spokesman however said it was thought one may be Oybek Jabbarov ( 31 ) .
“ He is one we suggested to the Department of Foreign Affairs and whose case they would certainly be very thoroughly aware of .
He has also expressed a preference for Ireland as he comes from a rural background and speaks fluent English , ” said the spokesman .
In testimony given to the US House of Representatives ’ House Committee on Foreign Affairs ; Subcommittee on International Organisations , Human Rights , and Oversight on May 6th , 2008 , Mr Jabbarov ’s lawyer said his client had been living with his elderly mother and pregnant wife with other Uzbek refugees in northern Afghanistan in 2001 when fighting broke out between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance .
He had not been involved in the conflict , according to the testimony .
“ He accepted a ride from a group of Northern Alliance soldiers he met at a roadside teahouse who said they would give him a ride to Mazar - e - Sharif .
“ Unfortunately , instead of driving him to Mazar - e - Sharif , the soldiers took Oybek to Bagram air base where they handed him over to US forces , undoubtedly in exchange for a sizeable bounty . ”
Mr Jabbarov was transferred to Guantánamo and has spent eight years there .
Executive director of Amnesty International , Ireland , Colm O’Gorman , has called on the department to allow Mr Jabbarov come to Ireland after his release and for his wife and two children to be allowed to join him .
A man with a shotgun was arrested on Wednesday night by U.S. Capitol Police while attempting to gain access to Capitol grounds as President Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE began to deliver his speech to a joint session on healthcare .
Capitol Police stopped Joshua Bowman , 28 , of Falls Church , Va. , at approximately 8 p.m. on Wednesday night several blocks away from the Capitol as he made a “ failed attempt to gain access to [ a Capitol ] barricade , ” a spokeswoman said .

After consenting to an administrative search of his vehicle , a shotgun in its case with ammunition was found in the vehicle ’s trunk .
He was transported to Capitol Police headquarters where he was processed and charged with carrying an unregistered firearm and possessing unregistered ammunition .
While the arrest was made by Capitol Police officers , the department was working in conjunction with U.S. Secret Service on Wednesday night as members of the White House and nearly the full body of Congress attended Obama ’s speech .
Nightmarish and chilling program could be expanded nationwide
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , September 14 , 2009
The Associated Press reports today on a truly chilling and nightmarish police program that we have highlighted before – cops forcibly jabbing a syringe into your arm and extracting blood if you are “ suspected ” of drunk - driving .
The opening two paragraphs in the AP report alone sound like something straight out of a twilight zone episode where vampires have taken over America and turned it into a tyrannical police state in order to satisfy their blood lust .
Sound overstated ?
Read it for yourself .
When police officer Darryll Dowell is on patrol in the southwestern Idaho city of Nampa , he ’ll pull up at a stoplight and usually start casing the vehicle .
Nowadays , his eyes will also focus on the driver ’s arms , as he tries to search for a plump , bouncy vein .
“ I was looking at people ’s arms and hands , thinking , ‘ I could draw from that , ' ” Dowell said .
The article then goes on to describe how officers in Texas and Idaho are training to withdraw blood from “ suspects ” as a replacement for the standard breathalyzer test , primarily because police can’t make anyone breathe into a tube but apparently , in the “ land of the free , ” they can forcibly hold someone down and jab a needle into their arm and take their blood , “ a practice that ’s been upheld by Idaho ’s Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court , ” according to the report .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The U.S. Supreme Court also once ruled that black people were slaves , property of their slaveowners with no inherent rights whatsoever , and that those designated to be “ feeble minded ” by the government could be sterilized – in neither case was either of these rulings in accordance with natural God given rights bestowed upon mankind , as history has shown .
Likewise , cops forcibly jabbing needles in people who are merely “ suspected ” of being drunk drivers is a total abomination , a complete violation of basic human rights under the Nuremberg code , and one that will likely lead to many injuries and infections – not to mention a cascade of lawsuits .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Despite being littered with internal checkpoints that are now starting to pop up all over America , not even the Nazis or the Soviets sank to the depth of having their goons forcibly stick needles into people ’s arms to take their blood .
The practice of cops drawing blood at the side of the road has been in place in some areas since 1995 but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has indicated that the program is ultimately intended to be introduced nationwide .
Nicole Watson , the College of Western Idaho phlebotomy instructor teaching the Idaho officers , described how the process would unfold .
Once they ’re back on patrol , they will draw blood of any suspected drunk driver who refuses a breath test .
They ’ll use force if they need to , such as getting help from another officer to pin down a suspect and potentially strap them down , Watson said .
Of course , once Americans are trained to accept authority figures jabbing them with needles against their will on a whim , programs for mandatory mass vaccination will be all the more easier to implement .
Cops across America are already armed with Tasers for the purpose of inflicting “ pain compliance , ” otherwise known as torture , now they will also be wielding needles while eyeing up your “ plump , bouncy vein ” .
Welcome to Amerika 2009 – land of the vampires , home of the slave .

As nuclear negotiations between Iran and the West continue to move slowly , U.S. President Barack Obama is coming under growing pressure from what appears to be a concerted lobbying and media campaign urging him to act more aggressively to stop Iran ’s nuclear program .
Obama has given Tehran an end - of - September deadline to respond substantively to his offer of diplomatic engagement .
But already hawks in the U.S. – backed by hardline pro-Israel organizations – have pressed him to quickly impose " crippling " economic sanctions against Tehran , and some are arguing that he should make preparations for a military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities .
The pressure campaign kicked off in earnest this week .
On Thursday , hundreds of leaders and activists from the U.S. Jewish community descended on Washington to lobby for harsher sanctions , while widely - publicized media reports suggested that Iran is already nearing the verge of a nuclear capability .
Leaders from Jewish groups came for a national " Advocacy Day on Iran , " during which they met with key Congressional figures .
Rep. Howard Berman , a California Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee , suggested that the clock " has almost run out " on Iran ’s nuclear program , and indicated that he would move ahead next month with a bill imposing sanctions on Iran ’s refined petroleum imports " absent some compelling evidence why I should do otherwise . "
The bill , the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act ( IRPSA ) , has for months been the top lobbying priority of hawkish pro-Israel lobbying groups led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
To their frustration , Berman has held up consideration of the bill for most of the past year
Not all U.S. Jewish groups are lining up behind the legislation , however .
Americans for Peace Now ( APN ) , for instance , issued a statement arguing that " arbitrary deadlines are a mistake " and that " pursuing sanctions that target the Iranian people , rather than their leaders , is a morally and strategically perilous path that the Obama Administration must reject . "
M.J. Rosenberg , a foreign policy analyst at Media Matters Action Network , suggested on the website TPMCafe that the advocacy day " marks the start of the fall push on Iran . "
The advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran ( UANI ) has launched an intensive television advertising campaign this month claiming that the U.S. " must isolate Iran economically to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon . "
UANI ’s two co-founders are now both high - ranking officials in the Obama administration – Dennis Ross , currently overseeing Iran policy at the National Security Council ( NSC ) , and Richard Holbrooke , now the State Department special representative in charge of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Also on Thursday , the New York Times published a front - page story claiming that U.S. intelligence agencies believe " that Iran has created enough nuclear fuel to make a rapid , if risky , sprint for a nuclear weapon , " although the article did not provide an estimate of when Iran could have a nuclear capability .
The same day , the Wall Street Journal published an op -ed by former Senators Charles Robb and Daniel Coats and retired four - star Air Force General Chuck Wald .
Claiming that Iran " will be able to manufacture enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in 2010 , " the authors urged Obama " to begin preparations for the use of military options " against Iran .
However , official U.S. intelligence estimates provide a far slower timeline .
In February , Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) Dennis Blair told Congress that Iran would be unable to produce highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) until at least 2013 , and stated that there is " no evidence " that Iran had even made a decision to produce HEU .
Iran insists that its nuclear program is intended solely for civilian purposes .
In 2007 , the U.S. intelligence community released a National Intelligence Estimate suggesting that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
The campaign comes on the eve of a series of key international meetings in late September , including the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly in New York and the Group of 20 ( G20 ) Summit in Pittsburgh .
Iran and its nuclear program are expected to be a major topic for world leaders who will attend these meetings , and hawks in Washington and Jerusalem hope that Obama will use them to push for the imposition of far - reaching economic sanctions by the U.N. Security Council as soon as possible .
While Obama faces pressure to move quickly to sanctions , the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is still struggling at home to overcome challenges to its legitimacy resulting from the disputed presidential election in June .
Many analysts suggest that Iran ’s government is currently in no position to respond coherently to U.S. engagement .
This week , Ahmadinejad ’s government finally issued a formal reply to proposals by the P5+1 powers — the U.S. , China , Russia , Britain , France , and Germany — for talks on its nuclear program and related issues .
But the five - page - reply has been deemed too vague by Washington , with State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley dismissing it Thursday as " not really responsive " to U.S. concerns .
Other analysts suggested that the Iranian proposal was more promising than initial media reports would indicate .
" Iran ’s uncompromising stance and its cursory references to nuclear matters are most likely an opening bid , and not a red line , " wrote National Iranian American Council ( NIAC ) president Trita Parsi in the Huffington Post .
He suggests that the proposal ’s language " may offer an opening to push strongly for transparency and acceptance of intrusive inspections and verification mechanisms . "
The Obama administration , however , continues to hold out hope for the engagement strategy .
" We ’ll be looking to see how ready Iran is to actually engage , and we will be testing that willingness to engage in the next few weeks , " Crowley said .
At the same time , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov all but ruled out his country ’s cooperation with new sanctions against Tehran at the Security Council , and called instead for renewed negotiations based on Iran ’s reply .
Lavrov ’s comments came shortly after a secret and still - mysterious visit to Russia by Israel ’s right - wing prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu .
The latest developments — along with growing amount of attention being paid to U.S. policy in Afghanistan , at the expense of Iran — have only added to the frustration of Iran hawks in Washington .
They believe increasingly that economic sanctions alone , even if they are imposed multilaterally , are unlikely to be enough to persuade Tehran to halt what they see as its drive to obtain a nuclear weapon .
For this reason , many suggest that the U.S. should either make preparations to attack Iran militarily itself , or step aside and allow Israel to do so .
" No one should believe that tighter sanctions will , in the foreseeable future , have any impact on Iran ’s nuclear weapons program , " former U.N. ambassador John Bolton , a noted hardliner , wrote in the Wall Street Journal last month .
" Adopting tougher economic sanctions is simply another detour away from hard decisions on whether to accept a nuclear Iran or support using force to prevent it . "
Earlier that month , the Journal featured an article by Gen .
Wald — who was one of the co-authors of Thursday ’s op - ed urging preparations for a military strike — entitled " Of Course There ’s a Military Option on Iran . "
But critics suggest that the constant threats of military action against Tehran will only make the regime ’s leadership more intransigent on the nuclear issue .
" Pointing a gun at their heads merely reinforces their desire for a reliable deterrent , and probably strengthens the hand of any Iranian officials who think they ought to get a bomb as soon as possible , " wrote Stephen Walt , a professor of international relations at Harvard University , on the website of Foreign Policy magazine .

A few weeks ago the ABC's Middle East correspondent Anne Barker was caught up in a violent protest involving ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in Jerusalem .
As Anne tried to record the protest , against the opening of a municipal carpark on the Jewish Sabbath , the mob spat on her repeatedly .
She says if she had been a man it might have been less traumatic , but being a woman and being spat on by so many men was a very distressing experience .
The ultra-Orthodox Jews ' protests , staged every weekend , have become a tourist attraction of sorts , and a form of entertainment for the rest of Jerusalem 's population .
Their issue : the secular mayor 's determination to open extra parking to cater for the increasing numbers of tourists and locals visiting the old city on weekends .
Even opening a car park is a violation of Shabbat - or the Jewish Sabbath - because observant Jews are forbidden from doing anything that equates to work , which can include driving , using any kind of machine , or even turning on a light switch .
Tourists come in increasing numbers to watch the spectacle of the protesters - with their curly sidelocks , long coats , and round box - like fur hats - clashing with police .
Often the protesters will throw themselves against cars , or even under them , to stop people from driving .
Some weeks they throw stones or rocks at police or anyone they perceive to be desecrating Shabbat - or Shabbes - as they call it in Yiddish .
At other times , they have thrown dirty nappies and rotting vegetables , and often they take to spitting .
It even pays to take an umbrella , as Anne learnt the hard way .
As she took out her radio recorder to capture the sound , the mob suddenly turned on her , screamed in her face , and spat repeatedly - in her face , hair , all over .
Men ' felt threatened '
Anne , along with The Australian newspaper 's correspondent in Jerusalem , John Lyons , invited two men from the ultra-Orthodox community to explain the protesters ' actions .
Did they spit at her because she was a woman , or a journalist , or not Jewish , or not dressed modestly enough ?
Yoel Weber , a rabbinical student , told her the ultra-Orthodox community feels a deep animosity towards any media it perceives does not understand it .
" The minute people feel that the media comes in and tries to cover our gatherings and they do n't know who we are and basically they cover us as some kind of interesting species , we feel very annoyed , " he said .
" We feel very endangered , very , very , very , very uncomfortable , with that situation . "
Mr Weber told Anne a woman does not belong in a group of men .
" So when we have a demonstration , we see a woman just frolicking , walking around , the normal reaction would be 'lady , can you please , there 's the men , the ladies ' side , please walk on the other side ' - that 's the normal reaction , " he said .
He says had it been a man reporting , things might have been very different .
" It will be easier because a lady automatically says ' you know what , I belong to these kind of people that we have no problem of the sexes - we can be a man covering the men issues , and men covering ladies ' issues even ' , " Mr Weber said .
" That 's against our teachings and all our way of thinking . "
Anne says while she was helped to clarify the attitudes of the ultra-Orthodox community , she is still troubled .
How , she asks , in a democratic , largely secular and supposedly egalitarian Israel , where ultra-Orthodox Jews are in the minority , can the rest of the community be expected to live and work by their rules ?
' Should n't have happened '
Mr Weber says the spitting incident should not have occurred .
" Spitting is a very , very uneducated , unhuman way of reacting to a certain thing , so spitting is a very primitive and very nonsense way of reacting to a certain situation , " he said .
Rabbi Shmuel Pappenheim says whatever the views in the ultra-Orthodox community , he believes spitting is wrong .
" It 's very embarrassing - it 's not right , " he said .
" These people go to the demonstrations from rage , from anger .
There 's fear of police , fear of collaborators , and people do things that are undesired - that are not wanted .
" It does n't reflect their education to respect individuals . "
Rabbi Pappenheim offered Anne an apology on behalf of the community .
" In the name of our rabbis , I apologise , and I very much hope that this will not influence your experiences here and your coverage , " he said .
A struggle for Jerusalem
Anne says since she arrived in Jerusalem only a few months ago , she has been told many times that if you take two Jews , you will find at least three opinions .
Even within the ultra-Orthodox community there are disparities - not just on whether it 's right or wrong to spit on a woman , but even the more fundamental questions of Zionism , the creation of Israel and how to treat the Palestinians .
If this extreme end of Judaism is so diverse , it is no wonder there is a widening gulf between the city 's ultra-Orthodox community and secular Jews .
The protest over a carpark might seem incredibly parochial , but it is emblematic of a wider struggle over Jerusalem itself .

You 're smart enough to know that take - out pizza does n't look as good as on TV .
Same with the chips , the candy bars , and ice cream .
But your stomach might disagree , and lead you to eat more when you 're channel surfing .
As anyone who 's watched television for 10 minutes knows , junk food is everywhere .
Children and adults alike , according to a recent Yale University study , eat when they 're not hungry when gloriously bad - for - you foods are displayed :
One test found that children aged 7 to 11 who watched a half - hour cartoon that included food commercials ate 45 percent more snack food while watching the show than children who watched the same cartoon with non-food commercials .
...
In another experiment , adults who saw TV ads for unhealthy foods ate much more than those who saw ads that featured messages about good nutrition or healthy food .

How does one fight " automatic eating ? "
Being sure to skip the commercials —
TiVo forwarding or walking away for a minute should do the trick .
If snacking is something you 're doing because you actually get hungry at TV time , try eating one substantial snack instead of lots of little bits , or switching to nuts , yogurt , or other high protein / low calorie snacks .

TV Ads Trigger Mindless Eating [ US News and World Report ]
The trooper was deeply skeptical .
He figured out how to subpoena Mr. Shaw ’s phone records .
Six months later , with help from a state public safety investigator , they got the records and their proof : Mr. Shaw and his girlfriend had sent 11 text messages to each other in the 30 minutes before the crash , the last one at 6:47 a.m. , a minute before Mr. Shaw called 911 .
Investigators concluded he sent that last text when he crossed the yellow line .
Still , county prosecutors thought they were unable to charge Mr. Shaw with something other than “ left of center . ”
For instance , if they wanted to prove Mr. Shaw guilty of negligent homicide , a misdemeanor , they would need to show he knew of the dangers or should have known of the dangers of texting while driving .
Mr. Shaw , who had retained a lawyer , would not discuss the issue with law enforcement or prosecutors .
Then Terryl Warner , a victim ’s advocate in the county where the accident occurred , got involved .
Ms. Warner had a personal interest in the case because she knew the family of one of the scientists .
In July 2007 , Ms. Warner , convinced by the trooper ’s evidence , wrote to prosecutors arguing for a vehicular manslaughter charge .
She said the dangers of texting and driving were broadly known , therefore Mr. Shaw should have known better .
Mr. Shaw had just started a Mormon mission in Canada when he was called home to face charges of negligent homicide .
The trial was set for early 2009 .
Then , just before Thanksgiving in 2008 , at a hearing , Mr. Shaw looked at the families of the two dead scientists and decided he could no longer keep dismissing the phone records that showed he was texting , even though his lawyers advised him to remain quiet .
“ It hit me that I was being selfish dragging this on , ” he said .
“ I decided I ’ve got to do whatever it takes to make this come to an end .
If there was anything I could do  spend a year in jail , two years in jail , whatever  I ’d do it . ”
People usually do n’t like what ’s written about them .
If you ’ve ever been quoted in an article somewhere , you know that journalists mess up and mangle what you say beyond recognition .
One wonders why people even bother talking to them ( us ) at all .
Recently on The American Prospect ‘s website , Courtney E. Martin had a really thought - provoking short piece “ questioning journalistic objectivity . ”
In it , she argues for a kind of journalism j - school professors would cringe at :
I ’m deeply committed to this collaborative process of talking and listening , writing and responding , editing and reflecting with my subjects .
That ’s the least I owe them , and rather than discouraging a poignant or honest portrait , I think it often enhances my work .
The courage it takes to write about people as I really see them , flaws and all , is related to the courage it takes for them to expose themselves , and then engage in the process of commenting on my portrayal .
This congruency seems to support a certain sort of magic on the page — a process of mutual pursuit of a truth , rather than a one - sided , hubristic claim on the Truth .
It ’s a wonderful idea , one that has had a lot of appeal for me over the years in both journalistic and scholarly work .
By sharing drafts and exchanging ideas about the finished product , the writer can forge a deeper , more trusting relationship with the subject , with the goal of creating something they can both be proud of .
I love it when the people I write about recognize themselves in what I ’ve written , and I ’m proud that they often say they do .
It is more than a matter of accurate portrayal ; when that happens , the two become partners in a common project greater than themselves .
Then again , it does n’t always work out that way .
Some people I write about purposely present a false image of themselves and expect me to promulgate it .
Other times , I simply disagree with their position so much that my portrayal cannot in good conscience be as sympathetic as they ’d like .
Or their story , in the context of different perspectives , gets cast in a light they were n’t expecting .
Collaboration , in these cases , might be challenging and instructive , but it also might be impossible .
Martin situates her argument in the context of a particular project .
I ’m on the final stages of writing a book — a collection of profiles of ten people under 35 who are doing interesting social justice work .
It ’s been necessarily intimate ; these are 8,000 word , very in - depth , largely psychological profiles .
They require a level of openness , on the part of the subject , and a level of listening , on the part of the journalist , that surpasses any of the shorter , less personal genres .
One can see how a collaborative model would make so much sense here .
She is writing about people whom she can get behind , whom she admires .
If she does n’t already feel a sense of shared purpose with one , I imagine , she would n’t include them in the book .
But sometimes it is necessary , important , and beautiful to portray those for whom this is n’t the case .
During my recent travels in Costa Rica , for instance , I went with the intention of finding people who I really could admire , whose stories we might craft together as collaborators .
But what I found was that some of the most potent stories were n’t quite that way .
My account could only be true to my experience if it diverged from that which the subjects would give of themselves .
In religious studies graduate school , I learned much the same methodology that Martin attributes to journalism school : collaborate with the subject so far as necessary to get the facts right , but do n’t bring them into the process of analysis and synthesis .
My professors distinguished between description and explanation .
Subjects should recognize themselves in a description , but not necessarily in an explanation — that ’s where the scholar takes control .
Religion in particular , they taught , requires special care in this regard , since religious systems often provide their own self - explanations that do n’t measure up to the standards of scholarship .
Of course this is insanely arrogant to say , and we all knew it .
I would put the compromise this way : let writing be an encounter .
Sometimes that encounter can be more collaborative than others .
A published text can be part of a challenging conversation between writer and subject , and they may disagree about how it comes out .
The writer ’s responsibility is to stand in some awe before that encounter , taking seriously the transcendent otherness of the other .
My purpose is not to stand in judgment , but to be curious , careful , artful , and true to experience .
Not necessarily to Truth , which stands beyond even this profession , but at least to the truths that we are privileged to witness .
I almost never share a draft of an article with a subject .
But I always try to send the finished product , asking for feedback , asking for a response , asking that it be considered .
Often , they are the audience I care most about — not because I want to please them , necessarily , but because they did me the honor of speaking to me and I want to speak to them back .
I hope that they will learn from what I write , not simply bask in it .
Martin situates her piece in the context of the present moment ’s storied decay of journalism .
She offers her approach as a new way forward .
What I fear from it , though , is the even further convergence between journalism and public relations , wherein the independent press is traded for a dependent team of ghostwriters .
That may be fine for Martin ’s world - savers , but in other contexts , it wo n’t do .
What journalism needs are people who are willing to give testimony to the inconvenient in ways that are also respectful and constructive , even if not always welcome .
The Council of Graduate Schools just released data on graduate schools for 2008 , and total graduate student enrollment by gender is displayed in the chart above ( based on Table 2.13 ) .
Women represented 58.9 % of all graduate students in 2008 , meaning that there were 143 women enrolled in graduate school for every 100 men .
Further , women were overrepresented in 7 out the 10 fields of graduate study and underrepresented in three fields ( business , engineering and physical sciences ) .
Q : Why does the underrepresentation of women in engineering , math and science get so much more attention than the underrepresentation of men in arts and humanities , biology , education , health sciences , public administration , and social sciences ?
After all , male graduate students are about as underrepresented in fields like health sciences ( 20.1 % male , and 398 women per 100 men ) , education ( 24.8 % male ) and public administration ( 25.5 % male ) as women are underrepresented in engineering ( 22 % female ) .
Defence Personnel Minister Greg Combet has found himself in the firing line over a new drive which could see Australian women serving in frontline combat missions in countries like Afghanistan .
The Government wants to attract more women to the Australian Defence Force by removing blanket restrictions which stop women from joining frontline infantry units , including the commandos and the SAS , as well as taking on certain roles in the Navy and Air Force .
He says the Federal Government wants to break down gender barriers in the ADF by reviewing who does what based on physical capabilities , rather than gender .
But Mr Combet says the Government will not make any decision until the new physical standards are finalised , which he says could be several years away .
" At this stage no decisions have been taken in relation to that and it's important to note that women are already undertaking a significant number of very important roles within the ADF , " he said .
Mr Combet says 92 per cent of jobs within the ADF are already available to women and several have served in deployments in Afghanistan , Iraq and East Timor .
Women now make up around 13 per cent of ADF personnel but the Government would like that number to be much higher .
But Liberal backbencher and former infantry officer Stuart Robert has branded Mr Combet 's push to have women on the frontline as " outrageous " , saying he needs to " think before he opens his mouth " .
The Member for Fadden had a 12 - year career in the military and served in a peacekeeping force in Bougainville after its civil war .
He has urged the Government to think " long and hard " before it allows women on the frontline .
" My concern is that really only Israel and a handful of countries whose very existence is threatened have gone down this path - the rest of the Western world has n't , " he said .
" [ Mr Combet ] has never parachuted at night in the rain , he 's never carried a mortar baseplate for 50 kilometres in a route march .
" For him to stand there and give his opinion and push the Government into something is simply outrageous . "
A high - ranking Australian Army officer has backed Mr Combet 's move .
Speaking from Darwin's Robertson Barracks , 1st Brigade Commander Brigadier Michael Krause says it has been an " enormous generalisation " that women are not strong enough for the job .
" It 's not gender - based that they 're doing this , they 're doing this based on the requirements of the task , and the task is not going to change , " he said .
" All they 're really saying is ... that if you 're fit enough , and you 're strong enough to do the job , you can do the job - whether you 're female or male . "
New South Wales Labor MP Lynda Volz , who was in the Army until 1993 , also lent her support .
" You talk to any men who do triathlon and marathon running and ask them if there are not a few women out there that are freaks of nature that beat them home every time , " she said .
" There are some very physically and mentally strong women and if they are capable of doing the course physically they should be allowed to . "
' Leave it to the military '
But Opposition Defence personnel spokesman Bob Baldwin says there is no public clamour for women to be given more combat roles .
" Whether women should be on the frontline ... is a question that is yet to be resolved , [ but ]
I do n't think that public opinion in Australia is ready to support that at this stage , and neither is the Coalition . "
Opposition Leader Malcolm
Turnbull says there is room for a discussion , but any decisions on the matter should only be made by those with first - hand knowledge of military demands .
" The primary objective has to be the safety and the effectiveness of our armed forces , that 's something that I 'm sure we 'll have an informed discussion on , and it should be led by those with real knowledge , real frontline experience in the field , " he said .
Who 's strongest ?
The long - standing logic in the ADF is that men are stronger than women , so women cannot do everything men can .
" It is perfectly valid to argue that all categories should be open to women , the only exceptions should be where the physical demands cannot be met regardless of gender according to criteria that are determined on the basis of scientific analysis rather than cultural assumptions , " Mr Combet said .
Mr Combet has told Parliament that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation will develop a new set of physical employment standards , which will determine who is fit to do what .
" The development of these new standards will also help inform the Government on the appropriateness of the possible expansion of the roles that women can play in the ADF , " he said .
" A priority of the Government is to improve the recruitment and retention of women in the ADF . "
But the executive director of the Australia Defence Association , Neil James , has serious doubts about the minister 's plan .
" Physical employment standards are already the prime criteria , you 'd have to wonder who 's been briefing him , " he said .
" Some of his reported comments just do n't seem correct - they do n't reflect what reality is .
" The whole idea that the current policy is discriminatory [ is false ] , I mean it 's not discriminatory in a gender - equity sense at all . "
' Laws of physics ' '
Mr James says the ban on women performing certain roles in the military is for good reasons .
" I do n't think the people of Australia would like to see their daughters , sisters , wives or female friends killed in disproportionate numbers to male service personnel , " he said .
" It 's a simple physicality thing .
On the battlefield , academic gender equity theory does n't apply .
The laws of physics and biomechanics apply . "
Mr James says there is also evidence that male soldiers are overly protective of women in the battlefield , which is a distraction from the task .
Eva Cox from the Women 's Electoral Lobby says that is an outdated argument .
" Grow up , I mean get over it , because that 's something that comes out of some very ancient views about women and chivalry , " she said .
" I do n't think most men , most young men these days , are particularly aware of it .
" Modern younger men do n't share those sorts of views and I think they 'll learn how to take care of their companions regardless of whether they 're male or female in a way that 's most appropriate .
" Being told that you can't do something , that you 're not allowed to do something , that you 're inadequate in some way to do it , or that you 're going to be just so distracting that nobody else is going to be able to do their job properly , I think it undermines the whole way that the culture or organisations work .

The latest case of malware infestation is once again targeting Facebook , this time masquerading as a virus removal kit designed to rid the computer world of a bogus " Fan Check " bug .
Fan Check : Valid App , but ' Bug ' is Bogus
While the Fan Check " bug " does not really exist , Fan Check is in fact a valid Facebook application used on Facebook.com .
The purpose of the Fan Check application is to rank friends based on how often they interact with your Facebook pages .
( Source : facebook.com ) .
The new malware , however , is rather devious because it pretends to defend against a made - up virus , while in actuality it is eliciting one of its own .
The reason for the success of the false anti-virus is because it capitalizes on the novelty of the term " Fan Check " .
This provides a perfect platform for hackers to ply their trade .
( Source : sophos.com )
Fan Check Malware : Details of the Scam
Here 's how the hack works : a person researches the term " Fan Check " by searching for it online using Google , Bing , Yahoo , or any major search portal .
The online search engine then pulls up a list of results , with some web pages set up by hackers in an attempt to trap the inquiring person .
The information tells of the horrors of the latest " Fan Check virus " to get unsuspecting victims to install fraudulent software and relinquish credit card information .
Hackers are essentially playing on paranoia with great success .
When people are led to believe that " Fan Check " is a virus , some will readily give out their financial information to immunize their computer against it .

Analysts : Consult Reputable Sites Only
Analysts are asking those in need of malware information to resist the urge to simply " Google " the term , and instead , consult a reputable tech news medium ( like Infopackets.com ) .
If there is a new piece of malware making its rounds , these mediums will usually report it first .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Federal agents raided residences in New York City early Monday as part of a terrorism investigation , law enforcement sources said .
Sen . Charles Schumer , D - New York , said the raids were " preventive " but not related to the president 's visit .
Sen . Charles Schumer , D - New York , confirmed the raids in an interview with CNN affiliate WABC .
" There was nothing imminent , and our law enforcement officials are very good now at tracking potentially dangerous actions , " Schumer said , speaking from Washington .
" This was preventive . "
Schumer said the raids were unrelated to President Obama 's visit to New York on Monday for a speech .
Citing " speculation the two were related , " Schumer said : " They 're not . "
Watch witnesses react to raid »
But two other sources contradicted Schumer , telling CNN that authorities had acted in part because of concerns that the president would be in town .
There was no indication of a specific plot against the president , the sources said .
One of those sources , a member of Congress , said authorities took action " out of an abundance of caution . "
Another member of Congress , Republican Rep. Peter King of New York , confirmed the raids to CNN .
" I can tell you that the raids were carried out -- in Flushing [ and ] Queens .
There was a search warrant and there is an ongoing investigation , and it 's being treated very seriously , " King said .
" As far as I know , there are no arrests . "
A source at the New York Police Department confirmed to CNN that the Joint Terrorism Task Force executed multiple search warrants early Monday at more than one building in Flushing , Queens , a borough of New York City .
The source said the search warrants were part of an ongoing investigation , but provided no further information on the number executed .
A federal law enforcement source confirmed the Joint Terrorism Task Force 's involvement in the raids , adding that agents were searching for a particular individual who was n't at the raided buildings .
In Washington , the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Mississippi , was briefed Monday on the situation , a congressional source told CNN .
A spokesman for Thompson declined to comment further , saying the briefing was classified .
Schumer told WABC he was unable to provide further information due to the classified nature of the case .
He said the FBI and New York City Police Department told him they would provide further information when appropriate .
The raid happened in the early morning and involved dozens of agents , some wearing FBI jackets , some wearing suits , and many carrying weapons , according to an eyewitness who lives in one of the raided buildings .
The witness said agents emerged from one building carrying a black document box .
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh , Deb Feyerick and Kiran Khalid contributed to this report .

Leaders of the G20 group of the world 's most powerful countries pledged to bring the world economy out of recession when they met in London in April .
As they meet in Pittsburgh , five months later , just how far have their governments gone in meeting some of their key commitments ?
In April , headlines trumpeted a $ 1.1 trillion deal to help countries fight the economic crisis .
Much of this funding was to be directed toward the International Monetary Fund .
The G20 has succeeded in increasing the IMF 's lending capacity by $ 500bn to $ 750 bn .
The target was only met earlier this month after the EU increased its initial pledge of about $ 100bn to $ 178bn .
Only a tiny fraction of this ( $ 2.3bn ) has so far been allocated The IMF has allocated an additional $ 250 bn worth of reserves to member countries that can be tapped when needed .
Around $ 100bn has been allocated to developing countries
The IMF has also approved its first major sale of gold since 2000 to raise money for additional financing for poor countries .
The sale of 403 metric tonnes of gold should raise $ 13 bn - more than the $ 6bn asked for by the G20 The G20 also pledged to help boost trade by providing $ 250 bn worth of financing , with $ 50 bn expected to come from the World Bank .
The G20 says that $ 65 bn has been taken up so far .
For its part , the World Bank has only received commitments of $ 7.8 bn from donors
The G20 said it would support an increase in lending to poor countries of at least $ 100 bn through multilateral development banks ( MDBs ) .
The G20 says MDBs are planning to lend an extra $ 110 bn this year but concrete figures are hard to come by and it's not clear if this is from fresh or existing funding .
G20 governments pledged a total of $ 5tn in stimulus measures to boost their own economies , predicting that the extra cash would increase global economic output by 4 % by the end of 2010 .
However , few countries have detailed exactly how much they have spent and the IMF 's own estimate is slightly more cautious at 2 % of GDP in 2009 and 1.5 % of GDP in 2010 .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has suggested that more than half of the $ 5tn has yet to be committed and has warned against switching off " the economic life support " .
However , the debate in Pittsburgh is likely to turn to how the the global economy can wean itself off the extra support now that there are signs of a recovery .
There are also fears that increased public spending could jeopardise any rebound given high levels of government debt and the deficits they have created in some countries .
For historical reasons , smaller European countries like the Netherlands and Switzerland are over - represented on the IMF board in relation to the size of their economies , while emerging giants like China are clamouring for more power .
Reform has long been regarded as necessary but calls have gathered pace in the wake of the financial crisis .
According to a draft G20 communique , an agreement has been reached on how to shift voting power to under - represented countries .
It calls for a shift in voting power by at least five percentage points away from developed countries .
If implemented , the move would hurt EU countries most , with France and the UK expected to see a dilution in voting power .
It would also be a big win for the Obama administration , which proposed the 5 % shift .
The G20 agreed in April that hedge funds , which have been subject to much less regulation than other investment funds , should be better supervised as part of wide - ranging measures to strengthen financial oversight .
The EU has proposed a draft law that would subject the industry to much tougher rules and make them more transparent .
Funds which did n't abide by the rules would not be able to operate in its 26 member countries .
The UK thinks parts of the draft law go beyond what is required to make the sector safer and could drive hedge funds out of London , where many are now based .
However , there is broad agreement among G20 members that hedge funds should be required to submit more information and data to regulators .
The G20 reckons there has been most progress on this issue , with governments eager to boost tax receipts as the recession hits public finances .
Since April 2009 , 13 jurisdictions , including Belgium and Austria , have implemented internationally agreed tax standards , according to the OECD which monitors tax matters .
Switzerland and Liechtenstein remain on a " grey list " of about 33 tax havens but have agreed to co-operate with foreign tax authorities .
The G20 has given tax havens until March 2010 to co-operate on tax evasion or face sanctions .
Still to implement agreed tax standards : Andorra , Anguilla , Antigua and Barbuda , Bahamas , Belize , Brunei , Chile , Cook Islands , Costa Rica , Dominica , Gibraltar , Grenada , Guatemala , Liberia , Liechtenstein , Malaysia , Marshall Islands , Monaco , Montserrat , Nauru , Netherlands Antilles , Panama , Philippines , St Kitts and Nevis , St Lucia , St Vincent and the Grenadines , Samoa , San Marino , Singapore , Switzerland , Turks and Caicos Islands , Uruguay , Vanuatu

There has been broad backing for restrictions on banking bonuses , which have been blamed for encouraging excessive risk - taking by some in the financial industry .
Individual countries have already enacted some measures , but the US and UK have rejected calls for mandatory caps on bonuses .
Given this disagreement , the G20 is most likely to agree some kind of " set of principles " for banker compensation .
Broadly speaking , European countries - France , Germany and the Netherlands - are taking tougher action than the US and UK .
The G20 in April agreed to establish the Financial Stability Board to make the financial system less vulnerable to future crises by encouraging cross - border cooperation on regulation .
Based in Basel , Switzerland , the international agency is a beefed - up successor to the Financial Stability Forum and brings together national regulators to discuss issues such as banker pay , accounting standards and requiring banks to hold more capital to absorb losses .
It held its second meeting earlier this month and will submit papers to the G20 in Pittsburgh on bonuses , on progress since the first summit and what future steps need to be taken to better regulate the financial industry .
To date , however , the most concrete steps on strengthening financial regulation have taken place at the national level and it is not yet clear how important a body this will become .

ere 's a common scenario : a base class has multiple constructors , each of which takes a different number of parameters of various types .
A derived class has to declare " mirror constructors " with signatures that correspond to the base class constructors .
Each mirror constructor merely forwards its arguments to the matching base constructor .
Defining the mirror constructors manually is a laborious and error - prone task , because you must update them whenever the base class 's constructors change .
Fortunately , a new C++0 x feature called inheriting constructors lets you delegate that task to the compiler .
This 10 - Minute Solution shows how inheriting constructors can make your code more secure , easier to maintain , and more readable .
When deriving a class from a base class , you need to define constructors that mirror those of the base class .
Rather than defining the mirror constructors manually , let the compiler generate them using the inheriting constructors feature .
Apple rejected a free iPhone application that advocated a single - payer health system , calling the application " politically charged , " according to the app 's developer .
Red Daly , a 22 year - old computer science grad student at Stanford , submitted his iSinglePayer iPhone app for Apple 's approval on Aug. 21 .
A little more than a month later Apple rejected it on the grounds of its content , Daly told Wired.com .
The iSinglePayer application includes facts and figures that support a Canadian - style health insurance plan where the government insures citizens and reimburses health providers , but does n't employ the doctors .
The app also uses GPS to determine a user 's political representatives , and how much money health companies have given them in campaign donations .
It also gives users a single button to call lawmakers .
Daly said he made the application as a way to express his opinion and to help others express theirs .
" I went to the app store because I felt like I did n't have much of a voice in other spheres , " Daly said .
" When the mainstream media talks about single payer , they emphasize the negatives and this was my foray into the debate .
It seemed like this would be the most effective way to reach people , since it is a phone and people can call right from it . "
Daly said he anticipated the rejection after Apple called a few weeks ago to ask if he was working on his own , or on behalf of a group or politician .
He said he was just working as his own small company , which he suspects led to his rejection .
Apple 's preference for the establishment annoys Daly .
" I feel like politicians already have a megaphone and Apple is making it worse instead of making it easier for a regular guy to get an application into the store , " Daly said .
Apple did not reply to a request for comment .
Daly , who has successfully submitted other apps such as Quiz Tunes , suspected something was off when he did not get an answer from Apple quickly .
Then on Saturday morning , Daly got a call from an Apple employee who identified himself as Richard , who told him verbally that his app had been rejected .
When Daly asked if there was anything he could do to make it less politically charged , Richard replied that the problem was the app was politically charged .
Apple has already drawn scrutiny from federal regulators over its management of the iPhone app store , which is the only path users can take to add applications to their phone without voiding the warranty .
Users have downloaded more than two billion applications .
In August , Apple resorted to hair - splitting in its response to the FCC 's inquiry about why it rejected a Google Voice iPhone app .
Apple said it was worried the service would confuse its users , but said it was still studying the issue — something contradicted by Google 's response to the feds .
Apple has been criticized for blocking video and internet telephony applications that compete with the telecoms it partners with .
But it 's also taken heat for approving applications like the infamous Baby Shaker app , which it subsequently took down after a public outcry .
Daly says he knows that Apple does n't have the same First Amendment obligation that the government has , but he thinks there 's a better way .
" I do n't think there is any sort of corruption — like Apple does n't want single payer , " Daly said .
" I think its more like they do n't want to get involved in the health care debate .
" Apple should look out the for user and make sure an app functions well and does n't have a viruses .
But I do n't think they should be in the business of censoring political speech and I do n't think they should be regulating content . "

Sexy Beast The Mysteries of the Giant Pacific Octopus
Paul Hoppe
Buster is feeling shy , as usual .
Buster is so acutely shy that researchers at the Seattle Aquarium can't tell whether this giant Pacific octopus is a boy or a girl .
If Buster is a boy , he 'll have a special tentacle ( the third to the right , going clockwise , from the front of its mantle ) that is both an arm and a dick .
And , since the suction cups on octopuses * also function as taste buds , his special tentacle will be an arm and a dick and a tongue — making all octopus sex fisting and intercourse and cunnilingus , simultaneously .
The young blonde giving the " feeding demonstration " to a large pack of squirming schoolchildren explains these facts more delicately .
" What if you tasted everything you touched ? " she asks .
The children are silent .
" When you open the bathroom door ?
When you tie your shoes ? "
The kids offer a few ewws to her and each other .
An assistant perched on top of Buster 's tank , her feet dangling above the water , skewers some oily herring onto a spear .
While the assistant submerges and gently jiggles the herring in front of Buster 's cave ( the only things visible are an eye and an indistinct bulge of octopus flesh ) , the guide gives her spiel about octopuses — how the only bony part of their body is a beak , allowing them to squeeze into small places ; how octopuses have three hearts in their mantles ; how they squirt ink at predators to disorient them ; how they are masters of disguise .
They have three sets of camouflage cells that can mimic almost any pattern behind them — a checkerboard , multicolored coral , the moving shadow of a passing cloud — and they can flatten and pucker the texture of their skin to blend into most surfaces .
( Compared to octopuses , chameleons are pikers . )
Despite the vast palette of their skins , octopuses are colorblind .
" Until they 're full grown , octopuses are the cupcakes of the sea— everybody likes to eat them , " the guide says .
Buster shifts a little , sensing the herring .
" If you see his special tentacle , let us know , " the guide tells the children hopefully .
Buster reaches out with an unspecial tentacle , grabs the fish , and tucks it discreetly under his body to eat .
The children lean forward , mesmerized , quiet .
The mystery of Buster 's genitals abides .
Some aquariums will pay $ 1,000 for a giant Pacific octopus — they 're big , they 're weird , and kids love them .
( Henry Lee , a 19th - century naturalist at the Brighton Aquarium , once wrote that " an aquarium without an octopus was like a plum - pudding without plums . " )
If Buster does n't shape up and get over his stage fright , says aquarium employee Giovannina Souers , they might have to send him back .
Which is n't as big a headache for the Seattle Aquarium as it is for other aquariums , because Puget Sound is home to the biggest octopuses in the world .
The aquarium dives for its own octopuses and sometimes sells them to other aquariums as far away as Sweden .
( One of the four Scandinavia - bound animals died in the plane because its flight had been delayed . )
Washington State allows divers to harvest one giant octopus per day anywhere besides Hood Canal .
Divers will locate an octopus den and squirt in a noxious chemical to disorient and dislodge the animal .
Copper sulfate and chlorine bleach were favorites but have been banned because they killed nearby sea life .
Clove oil , Souers says , is the new favorite .
The aquarium sometimes gets donations — an out - of - town angler once gave the aquarium a 26 - pound octopus he accidentally caught while fishing from his window at the Edgewater Hotel .
Buster 's tank , the guide tells the schoolchildren , sits on top of a rock outcropping with an underwater octopus den .
After watching Buster 's coy performance , you could , in theory , jump out the window , swim to the bottom , and wrestle another one out of a cave .
Not that you 'd want to .
Giant Pacific octopuses are , well , giant — the largest ever found , according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium , was 600 pounds and 31 feet from tentacle to tentacle — and they 're disproportionately strong , all muscle and protein .
While trying to escape , a 40 - pound octopus at the Seattle Aquarium once pushed a 60 - pound weight from the top of its tank .
They have venom for drool and their mouths look like something from Alien : two sharp beaks hiding a drill - like instrument called a radula that scrapes through thick shells to paralyze whatever 's inside before the octopus sucks out its innards .
And sometimes they attack divers .
A 2007 article from the Canadian Field - Naturalist described several attacks :
One octopus off San Juan Island grabbed a diver 's legs and held him underwater while he struggled , long enough that the diver used up most of the air in his tank and nearly died — as if the octopus knew that divers have only a certain amount of breathing time .
Another octopus in Washington waters pounced on a diver , flaring its tentacles in a hunting gesture .
The diver fended it off and swam away , but the octopus followed , crawling toward him on the ocean floor , and pounced again .
Luckily , this octopus was small — but bizarrely aggressive for its size .
Off Vancouver Island , an underwater film crew swam off , leaving one diver near an unseen octopus den .
An octopus crawled out , anchored itself with two tentacles to the rocks below , and wrapped the other six around the diver 's face and chest .
It ripped off the diver 's mask , reached for his breathing regulator , and tried to pull him into its lair :
The diver eventually outlasted the octopus but in the struggle lost his mask and had his hood pulled partially off and had his dry suit flooded .
As might be expected , he also used up a significant amount of his breathing gas .
The octopus finally gave up on this test of strength and let go .
The diver felt that , had he lost his regulator or had he been low on air , he would have undoubtedly died .
The octopus was just too strong for him to do anything but hang on to his regulator and brace himself from being pulled into the den ...
So far , we can document no case of Giant Pacific Octopus attack that has resulted in a diver fatality , but there have been diver deaths where no cause is found to explain the tragedy .
Perhaps octopuses were involved in these deaths , but even if they were not , it is wise for all divers to be respectful of the potential danger of these powerful animals .
In 1940 , two years after he opened the Seattle Aquarium on Pier 54 , Ivar Haglund staged an underwater wrestling match between a giant octopus and an old prizefighter named Two Ton Tony .
Haglund and the octopus 's " trainers " shook its limbs furiously while Two Ton Tony grimaced and grunted .
Tony won , but the fight was a lie — the octopus was dead before the match began .
The author of the octopus - attack article , Dr. Roland Anderson , retired this March after 31 years at the Seattle Aquarium .
The man loves octopuses and knows more about cephalopod behavior than most people in the world .
The other day , he arrived at the 14 Carrot Cafe , just a few blocks from his Eastlake apartment , wearing an octopus baseball cap and an octopus T - shirt , and carrying a bag ( emblazoned with an octopus ) full of gifts he 's gotten recently : a squid egg beater , a squid soap dispenser , a glittery octopus Christmas ornament .
" I 'm not sick of octopuses yet , " he said , smiling wanly .
" I am a little tired of octopus trink . "
Dr. Anderson has written 241 articles , both scholarly and popular , about cephalopods , but says he still knows precious little about the giant Pacific octopus .
If anyone knew how many live in Puget Sound it would be him , but he does n't know and is n't willing to guess .
" We know how many killer whales there are , " he says .
" We have estimates for salmon .
There 's an annual sea - otter census .
But nobody really looks for octopuses besides me . "
For the past 10 years , Dr. Anderson has run octopus surveys during President 's Day weekend , asking recreational divers to report sightings .
Typically , 200 divers participate and report around 70 octopuses , but that does n't mean much .
Puget Sound is too big , cold , dark , and deep for a comprehensive census — some of its depths have n't even been mapped yet .
Researchers could chemically estimate the giant - octopus population by taking biopsies for DNA analysis .
( By comparing variations in genetic samples from different animals , scientists can get a sense of the population size . )
Anderson says the Seattle Aquarium is getting " close " to nailing down a method but is n't quite ready yet .
" It takes time and money to figure out the genetic markers , " he says .
" And we 're already dealing with staff furloughs because of the city budget crisis . "
Similar DNA analysis is used to estimate the population size of six - gill sharks , another gigantic , mysterious , primitive creature from Puget Sound 's depths ( and a predator of octopuses ) .
Six - gill sharks live all over the world , from East Africa to Puget Sound , but scientists know very little about them except that they 're huge — around 16 feet long .
The Seattle Aquarium is unusually well situated to study the giant sharks because Puget Sound is deep , narrow , and steep .
At night , the sharks ascend to the shallows to feed , right up to the pilings under Pier 54 where , every few months , aquarium divers set up cameras , bait traps , and wait in a cage to take biopsy samples .
One recent weekday in the bowels of the aquarium , among pipes and tanks and thrumming water pumps , six - gill researchers sat around a table , reviewing their dive plan .
" When 's splash time ? " one asked .
" As long as we 're down there , might as well do a kelp harvest , " another offered .
" Let 's get the bags and suit up . "
In most other six - gill habitats , researchers have to catch the sharks , hauling them up to the surface with rod and reel , to tag and biopsy the animals .
" They seem to recover all right , " says Souers , the aquarium staff member .
" But the less invasive the technique , the better . "
In Seattle , researchers buy fish parts from Pike Place Market , saving one set until it 's rancid enough to set in a bait trap and freezing another set into " chumsicles " — giant iced lollipops anchored to the floor of Puget Sound .
The rancid fish attract the sharks , but the sharks prefer to chew on the chumsicles .
The researchers do n't understand why .
Once the divers have set the bait , they surface and wait .
Researchers watch video monitors for several hours .
If they see sharks , the divers go back down to take biopsies and implant tags .
But the sharks have n't been showing up for the past few months , since the pier has been reconstructed .
The researchers think something about the new pilings or diver cage is scaring them away .
No sharks show up that night , though ratfish swarm the bait .
" We 're jaded to see ratfish , " says one researcher .
" But it 's actually pretty rare .
They typically live at incredible depths . "
The tallest building in Seattle is 930 feet ; the deepest trough in Puget Sound is 937 feet — just north of the city .
The bright , people - filled skyscrapers of Seattle are reflected in a dark , creature - filled world next door .
During the year after college I spent teaching in Japan , one of my students ' favorite games was Let 's See What the Foreigner Will Eat .
They could n't stop taking me to restaurants , ordering dishes they thought I would think were gross , and gleefully watching as I chewed raw horse , fish heads , cod sperm , spaghetti omelets , otoko kaoru ( " man-smell " ) chewing gum , and the snottier side of Japanese cuisine ( raw sea urchins , fermented soybeans ) .
The rules were simple :
If I could eat it with a smile , I won .
If I grimaced , I was weak .
The game was a complicated mix of cultural diplomacy , table etiquette , and sadomasochism .
They politely applauded my successes but savored my failures , clucking and laughing .
I had won every round so far except for the slimy natto — fermented soybeans .
They look like deer poop , smell like rot , and taste like something from the bottom of a porta - potty doused in soy sauce .
I lost that round the last time we all went out drinking .
I was determined to win this one .
We were in a nice restaurant near Osaka , in a private upstairs room with dark cedar paneling .
I was sitting with my legs crossed on a tatami-mat floor while 20 Japanese adults eagerly studied my expression as a mouthful of raw , writhing octopus tentacle attacked my cheeks and tongue .
That tentacle had been attached to a living octopus only minutes ago , finely chopped , and set before me in what looked like a bowl of pale , squirming worm parts .
Its suckers flexed spastically as I chewed , trying to hurt me as much as I was hurting it .
The battle was protracted and painful .
Of all the faces staring at me , I remember Dr. Booka 's the best .
He liked talking about Greek philosophers and looked like an old - timey doctor from a Meiji - era photo : round wire glasses , clipped mustache , button - up shirt .
I chewed stoically , using my tongue to pry away the needling suckers .
I swallowed .
Dr. Booka smiled .
" Mmm , sugoi , " he grunted .
" Very good . "
Dr. Booka later said that this stunt dish originated in Korea ( cheaters ! ) , but Japan has its own deeply kinky relationship with octopuses ( tako is their word for them , which also means " kite " and " callus " ) .
Japanese octopus erotica has a long and venerable history .
Hokusai , Japan 's most famous wood - block artist , made the iconic Tako to Ama ( translated as Octopus and Diver , also called The Dream of the Fisherman 's Wife ) in 1814 :
It depicts two octopuses wrapped around a naked woman reclining on some ocean rocks .
The smaller octopus kisses her mouth and curls its tentacles around her nipples while the larger octopus nuzzles between her legs , its mantle pulled back , its eyes bulging .
Scholars think the woman is a mythic abalone diver and the sex is consensual , but later octopus porn took a turn for the violent .
Japanese censorship laws prohibit depictions of the penis — though old Hokusai - era porn featured enormous cocks that looked like gnarled tree trunks — which explains why so much Japanese porn involves penetration with everything else .
One scrap of manga porn I found floating under a bridge in the small town where I was living ( honest ) depicted one schoolgirl stuffing another with the contents of her pencil box .
In lieu of pencils and Sharpies , manga cartoonist Toshio Maeda started drawing violent tentacle porn .
Maeda 's Demon Beast Invasion was the beginning of the modern tentacle - rape ( shokushu goukan ) genre : A race of nasty creatures invades Earth and impregnates as many human women as possible .
( In 1999 , a comic - store clerk in Dallas was convicted of " promoting obscenity " and fined $ 4,000 for selling a copy of Demon Beast Invasion to an undercover cop .
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal . )
In an interview on a manga blog , Maeda said he wanted " Tentacle Master " inscribed on his tombstone .
A Google search for " tentacle rape " turns up 163,000 hits .
Plain old " tentacle porn " only turns up 96,600 .
The real sex life of an octopus is sufficiently tragic without Maeda 's help .
A giant Pacific octopus has sex only once , then loses its mind and dies .
The sex itself is dull .
Octopuses tire easily — their blood is n't so good at carrying oxygen — so the athletics are minimal .
Using his special tentacle , the male extrudes a meter - long sperm packet ( it looks like a milky worm ) out of a special sac in his body / head and into the female 's body / head .
If the female does n't like it , she 'll push him and his sperm packet away and look for someone else .
If the female likes it , the two might entwine in dispassionate embrace for three hours or more .
Then the bad times come .
" It 's called senescence , " says Dr. Anderson .
" And it 's similar to human dementia .
Males go crazy , stop eating , rove around aimlessly , not being careful .
It 's hormones — females go into senescence , too .
My father had Alzheimer 's , and I 'm sorry to say he wandered off a time or two and it did n't make a lot of sense what he was wandering off for .
Octopuses are the same way . "
Unlike humans with dementia , senescent octopuses sometimes chew off their own arms .
Their immune systems also shut down , allowing the small lacerations they accumulate from bumping into things during senescence to develop major infections .
The postcoital male goes directly to feeding the top of the local food chain ( seals and sharks ) and the bottom ( Aeromonas , Vibrio , and Staphylococcus bacteria ) .
The female retires to her cave , decorating it with garlands of tear - shaped eggs .
She tends to the strands , blowing them with soft jets of oxygenated water for six months .
To keep up her energy , the female metabolizes her own body , losing up to 70 percent of her weight .
Soon after her eggs hatch , she dies .
As Dr. Anderson repeated several times during our conversations : " There 's no such thing as safe sex for octopuses . "
Fittingly , Japanese doctors named a heart condition after the octopus : takotsubo cardiomyopathy or " broken - heart syndrome . "
The condition , in which a part of the human heart suddenly enlarges , is often caused by emotional stress like the sudden death or disappearance of someone you love .
According to a study by the Mayo Clinic , takotsubo cardiomyopathy is fatal in 3.6 percent of cases .
It got its name from either the clay jars used by Japanese fishermen to catch octopus ( which resemble the shape of the heart enlargement ) or after a story about a Japanese fisherman who fell in love with an octopus who did n't love her captor back .
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is proof that it is medically possible to die of a broken heart .
Walking from the cafe to his apartment to look for a rare book on octopuses in Haida mythology , I asked Dr. Anderson what draws certain people to cephalopods .
The way he talks about them suggests an interest than runs deeper than science — he talks about why people do n't care about them as much as otters and killer whales and sharks , animals with " charismatic megafauna effect , " and the edges of his voice take on a tinge of resentment .
" Nobody 's looking at octopuses besides me , " he said .
" There are two species , maybe three , living in Puget Sound .
The Enteroctopus dofleini and the red octopuses , which like to live in beer bottles .
Nobody knows how many there are of those , either .
I once found eight in eight beer bottles in a row .
On a night dive , I saw 12 in one spot .
But nobody seems to care . "
He talked about how octopuses have personalities and maybe even emotions .
" Nobody has proved that yet , " he said .
" It might be up to me . "
It takes a special kind of person , he suggests , to devote a life to the study of cephalopods .
What kind of person ?
He paused .
" You have to be different .
They 're not cute and cuddly .
Some would say they have a cold intelligence . "
That cold intelligence has confounded and intrigued people throughout history .
Ancient cultures all over the world have assigned the octopus esoteric and malevolent powers : Hawaiian creation myths describe octopuses as alien leftovers from another incarnation of the universe .
Kanaloa , one of the four ancient Hawaiian gods , is an octopus who lives in the underworld — or , alternately , a secret island full of beautiful people where it is forbidden to weep — and teaches magic .
He 's a little bit scary but also helpful , invoked to protect fishermen and to help find freshwater springs bubbling up from below .
When Christian missionaries showed up , they tried to recast the four gods as the trinity and Satan , and Kanaloa became the bad guy .
( To be fair , Kanaloa did lead a rebellion of spirits against the god Kane and was cast into the underworld , just like Satan in the Book of Revelation and Paradise Lost . )
The Haida of the Pacific Northwest tell stories about octopuses devouring canoes and sometimes whole villages , of fights and reconciliation with the tetchy Octopus People who live under the sea .
Pliny the Elder was n't a fan : " No animal is more savage in causing the death of a man in the water , " he wrote .
( Though Pliny also suggested curing a scorpion sting by incinerating the animal and drinking its ashes mixed with wine . )
The Roman naturalist and lecturer Claudius Aelianus wrote about an octopus in the coastal town of Puteoli that climbed through the sewers into the house of a local fisherman to steal his catch .
This story is not as crazy as it sounds — octopuses get around .
In 1998 , a group of Brazilian biologists watched an octopus catch a sea bird that was standing on land , drag it into a tide pool to drown it , and begin gnawing on its tail .
Octopuses can leave the water for short periods of time and have certain skills of escape artists .
Keeping an octopus in its tank has been a major preoccupation for aquariums since the beginning .
From Cassell 's Natural History , 1892 :
The Octopus , like many other predaceous animals who seek their prey by night , habitually returns to skulk in the same retreat in the daytime .
This practice enabled the resident Octopus of the Brighton Aquaa'ium to enjoy , for many weeks , the run of all the neighbouring tanks by night undetected , for , like the celebrated robber Peace , he was always to be found at home in the morning .
But the rate at which he thinned the young Lump - fishes in an adjoining tank led to give suspicion , and after too hearty a meal one evening he imprudently stayed out all night , and was caught red - handed , gorged to distention , next morning , in the Lump - fishes ' abode .
Octopus escapes are the leading reason amateur aquarists are discouraged from keeping the deadly blue - ring octopus .
They 're gorgeous , iridescent creatures , the size of a golf ball , and one of the most dangerous things in the ocean .
Each blue - ring octopus carries enough paralytic venom to kill 26 human beings in minutes .
While they have a low escape value ( 1.7 on a scale of 10 ; the giant Pacific octopus rates 6.7 ) , pet - advice sites are unequivocal : " There are many instances where a hobbyist has stepped on their octopus in the morning a few rooms away from where the tank is ... from time to time you may see the small blue - ring octopus for sale , DO NOT buy it , they are very venomous and can kill you .
There are a lot of other species available that pose no danger to you or unsuspecting children or guests . "
Several years ago , Dr. Roy Caldwell , a biologist at the University of California at Berkeley , was working on Thailand 's Andaman Sea when the local morgue called his biology station .
A German tourist had died on the beach near some tide pools , and the police could n't figure out how .
Dr. Caldwell found a small incision on the tourist 's right shoulder , just the size and shape of a blue - ring octopus bite .
The tourist , he concluded , found the lovely , shimmering creature in a tide pool , admired its pale skin and alien blue rings — the angrier they are , the more vibrantly beautiful they become — and put it on his shoulder , maybe for a photo .
He was probably dead within minutes .
The last giant octopus escape at Seattle Aquarium was several years ago , when a night watchman found the creature in a quiet and nearly dead puddle of flesh on the floor .
It recovered quickly after being returned to its tank , but the aquarium lowered the water level to discourage future escapes .
When they can't get out , some octopuses tear up their tanks .
Another octopus at the Seattle Aquarium , nicknamed Lucretia McEvil , destroyed her life - support system in one night :
She dug through several centimeters of sand , chewed through wires lashing down an undergravel filter plate ( a ridged plate that covers the bottom of an aquarium , allowing beneficial bacteria to process ammonia buildup ) , yanked up the plate , and ripped it into pieces for the staff to fish out of her tank .
Octopuses also squirt water at their keepers ( either in play or hostility — it 's hard to tell ) , and Dr. Anderson has heard of sensitive lab equipment ruined by precisely aimed jets of salt water .
Freud , of all people , was mysteriously quiet on the subject of octopuses , though he did write a letter from a vacation in Italy , boasting to his brother about " tickling an octopus . "
Some of Freud 's disciples suggest that , in dreams , an octopus represents the superego .
It did in one of Ian Fleming 's final James Bond stories , " Octopussy . "
In the end , one of the villains — a retired intelligence agent who snorkels every day in Jamaica — is held underwater and drowned by an octopus he thought was his friend .
The disturbing sensation of eating the chopped tentacle in Japan stuck with me —its spastic movements felt so specific , so alive , like the tentacle knew what was happening .
Strangely , it might have .
" Consciousness " is a hot word among scientists .
Hardly anybody agrees on what it means and whether any species has it besides humans .
But the octopus has a memory and , perhaps , self - awareness .
It can learn to navigate mazes , open jars and bottles , and play — a startling discovery that landed Dr. Anderson and his coresearcher Jennifer Mather in the New York Times .
Mather and Anderson watched octopuses play catch with floating pill bottles , blowing them toward the jets in their tanks , catching them on the return shot , and blowing them back .
One octopus experimented with angles , finding a way to send the pill bottle in circles .
Anderson also found that giant octopuses could recognize individual faces using a simple good - cop / bad - cop experiment .
Twice a day , five days a week , one person would feed eight different octopuses and another person would rub them with an irritating , bristly brush .
The octopuses began to reach out toward the feeder and shrink away from — or blow hostile jets of water at — the hassler .
Within two weeks , the feeder and the hassler could walk up to the tank without any food or brush and get the same response .
" Giant Pacific octopuses are not as smart as a dog or a cat , " Dr. Anderson says .
" But they 're smarter than your average tweety bird . "
Giant octopuses require greater intelligence than deep - water octopuses to survive their changeable tidal environment , Anderson explains .
" I had a friend who worked on the deep - water octopus .
Said it was dumb as a doorknob . "
Because giant octopuses lead solitary lives and do n't learn from each other , they need memory to successfully explore crevices , find food , and flee prey .
A 2006 paper by Mather suggests octopuses are a lot smarter than " your average tweety bird . "
They lateralize information , transferring it from one half of the brain to another : something mammals can do but birds cannot .
( The study involved training an octopus to make a visual distinction with one eye — right eye learning a shape , for example — which only goes to one half of the brain .
They then surgically disconnected the two halves of the brain and found the octopuses could recognize the shape with the other , " untrained " eye .
Researchers found that the information , with repeated exposure to that shape , could travel to the other half of the brain . )
Mather also ran sleep tests , discovering that if octopuses were kept awake , they showed sleep rebound — longer , deeper sleep — the following night .
She also suggests octopuses have a kind of REM sleep : " During the sleep time , [ Mather and her team ] found a specific colour change not seen at other times , leading them to suggest a cephalopod equivalent of mammalian REM sleep , which is commonly associated with consolidation into episodic memory . "
Tucked into the nooks of their underwater skyscrapers - in - reverse , the giant octopuses might be dreaming .
Weirder still is a passage from an article coauthored by experimental neurobiologist David B. Edelman in a 2005 issue of Consciousness and Cognition :
A peculiarity of the octopus nervous system is the density of neurons located in the tentacles , which taken together , exceeds the total number of neurons in the brain itself .
[ Three - fifths of an octopus 's neurons are in its limbs instead of its brain . ]
Consistent with this fact , a recent study showed that a detached octopus arm could be made to flail realistically when stimulated with short electrical pulses ...
Accordingly , in a detached vertebrate limb it is simply not possible to produce the suite of coordinated movements that is characteristic of complex vertebrate locomotion .
In contrast , what is striking about the octopus is the sophistication of the semi-autonomous neural networks in its tentacles and their local motor programs .
These observations bear on the assessment of consciousness in the sense that they may alter the notions of embodiment and bodily representation as they have been set forth by cognitive scientists and philosophers .
In any case , it is not likely that the question " what is it like to be an octopus tentacle ? " will ever be posed by any rational philosopher .
Maybe not .
But with all those " semi - autonomous neural networks , " maybe a severed octopus tentacle has a kind of intelligence that a human limb does n't .
I 'm beginning to wonder what the tentacle I was chewing , back in that dark - paneled room in a restaurant in Osaka , was thinking .
Baby octopuses might be the cupcakes of the sea , but the adult octopus resists cooking .
Its arms are raw power — great , tapering cylinders with a sticky membrane , perfectly adapted for reaching and grabbing , but a challenge to a chef .
Prepared properly , well - cooked octopus needs little embellishment .
It 's subtly sweet , not too briny , never mushy , not quite of the ocean but not quite of the land .
The ancient Hawaiians were n't far off :
The texture and taste is alien .
Like organ meats , oysters , and bone marrow , cooked octopus has a magical quality , as if eating it gives you special powers .
While in Japan , I taught a terse , hulking high - school student who wanted to be a professional wrestler .
He ate a lot of everything , but his favorite foods were octopus and rice .
" When I eat rice , I feel The Power , " he would say .
" And the tako — makes strong ! "
Octopus is easy to screw up .
Prepared poorly , it 's as tasteless and tough as a garden hose stuffed with condoms .
Sushi chefs slice the tentacles very thinly , massage them , then pound them with peeled daikon radish before poaching .
The chefs at Txori — serving some of the best octopus in Seattle — get their cephalopods from the cold Atlantic waters of Galicia , in northern Spain , and serve them in the traditional way : three - step poaching ( put salted water on the stove to boil , throw in the octopus , bring it to a boil , remove and cool , repeat twice ) before grilling it , dusting it with paprika , and placing the slices atop a piece of red potato .
They also follow the tradition of placing a wine cork in the poaching water­ — whether this tradition has its origins in science or superstition , they can not say .
The pulpo is one of Txori 's most popular dishes — it 's the lead photo on their homepage — but they 've been out for a couple of months .
( Txori 's mustachioed chef , Joseba Jiménez de Jiménez , is currently in Spain , in part to sort out their octopus situation . )
Right now , you can find octopus ( Eledone cirrhosa , also called the " curled " or " horned " octopus ) prepared in a Filipino - Italian style at Tavolàta in Belltown .
The handsome chef de cuisine , Morgan Medlock , meets me in the open kitchen and leads me down the stairs to a walk - in cooler where trays of chanterelle mushrooms nestle against unlabeled boxes and a raw purple octopus , dead and reclining in a tub of cool water .
Medlock learned to cook octopus during a year in the Philippines , braising it for four hours in red wine and salt , then charring it on a grill .
A tall , young sous chef named Brandon , who is also downstairs , had a different idea — he suggested braising it in red wine and red - wine vinegar , with sprigs of thyme and a bay leaf , a method he learned in San Francisco .
" We took the Pepsi challenge , " Medlock says .
" And his version won . "
The cooks at Tavolàta discard the head ( though Txori chops and uses its in a salad ) then cut the beast in half for the long braising .
The tentacles cook down to a tamed , almost shriveled version of their oceanic glory .
Tavolàta cuts those halves in half and braids them , leaving the suckers as the " show side . "
Back upstairs , a cook named Brendan rubs the cooked tentacle - braid with oil and salt , and sets it on the grill .
While it cooks , Brandon prepares a dish of halibut on a bed of chanterelles and greens , carefully sculpting off loose bits of halibut and wiping the plate while Medlock watches like a piano teacher at a recital , frowning with concentration but nodding with approval .
Somebody mentions this season of the reality show Top Chef ( with two contestants from Seattle : Ashley Merriman of Branzino and Robin Leventhal of the defunct Crave ) .
The chefs , normally tattooed and stoic and manful , immediately begin gossiping like preteen girls , swapping rumors about whether Merriman won and the multimillion - dollar nondisclosure agreement she had to sign .
Finally , the octopus braid is done .
Brendan scoops two little mounds of spicy golden tomato confit , pulls apart some Italian parsley , and slices baby zucchini and heirloom cherry tomatoes for an accompanying salad .
He sets the braids on top , sucker - side up , and slides the dish toward me .
Tavolàta does it marvelously :
The tentacles are dense , but not at all tough , their purple color darkened by the wine and the charring — all those neurons , taste buds , muscle power , and protein rendered tame , delicious , and still .
As I swallow , I can feel The Power .
* People used to think the word " octopus " came from Latin and its plural was " octopi . "
Turns out , the word was probably borrowed from Greek , making " octopodes " the technically correct plural .
But some Latin inflections offend American ears , and people who are n't either scientists or show - offs wo n't say " octopodes , " just like they do n't say " agendum " or " datum " or " dogmata " — which leaves us with " octopuses . "
Both Merriam - Webster 's Tenth Edition and the Oxford English Dictionary basically throw their hands up on this question and remain agnostic .
MOSCOW 
For hundreds of years , mariners have dreamed of an Arctic shortcut that would allow them to speed trade between Asia and the West .
Two German ships are poised to complete that transit for the first time , aided by the retreat of Arctic ice that scientists have linked to global warming .
The ships started their voyage in South Korea in late July and will begin the last leg of the trip this week , leaving a Siberian port for Rotterdam in the Netherlands carrying 3,500 tons of construction materials .
Russian ships have long moved goods along the country ’s sprawling Arctic coastline .
And two tankers , one Finnish and the other Latvian , hauled fuel between Russian ports using the route , which is variously called the Northern Sea Route or the Northeast Passage .
But the Russians hope that the transit of the German ships will inaugurate the passage as a reliable shipping route , and that the combination of the melting ice and the economic benefits of the shortcut  it is thousands of miles shorter than various southerly routes  will eventually make the Arctic passage a summer competitor with the Suez Canal .

At 9:40 p.m. EDT ( 0140 GMT ) Wednesday from Madison , Wisconsin , Abe Megahed photographed the trail made when the space shuttle Discovery dumped waste water .
The beautiful trail in the sky looked like a mysteriouscelestial event .
In reality , it was urine .
Some skygazers were treated to the unexpected view of abright sparkling glow Wednesday night , created when astronauts aboard the spaceshuttle Discovery dumped the wasteout into space .
The water dump was a scheduled task for STS - 128 pilot KevinFord , who poured out urineand waste water stored aboard the shuttle in preparation for a landingattempt Thursday .
Weather thwarted that try , but astronauts plan anotherlanding attempt Friday at 5:48 p.m. EDT ( 2148 GMT ) in Florida , though rain andhigh winds are expected again .
The light show Wednesday was aided by an unusuallylarge amount of water being dumped all at once - about 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) , said NASA spokeswoman Kylie Clem .
Discovery had just undocked from the International Space Station the day before , and had not been able to unloadwaste water during the 10 - day visit .
" It would have been a large quantity because we don ? tdo water dumps while docked to the station now , " Clem told SPACE.com in ane - mail .
" That is a fairly new restriction over the last couple of flightsin order to prevent potential contamination of the Kibomodule . "
The Kibo module is a new Japanese - built research lab on thespace station that includes an external platform to expose science experimentsto the space environment .
Water dumps from a docked shuttle could potentiallypollute the experiments .
In general , though , spotting space water dumps from Earth iscommon , Clem said .
Waste water usually freezes upon jettison into a cloud oftiny ice droplets .
Then when the sun hits , the ice sublimates directly intowater vapor and disperses in space .
A number of people in North America apparently spottedWednesday 's dump , and some sent pictures to the Web site SpaceWeather.com .
One of them , Abe Megahed , photographed the tail at 9:40 p.m.EDT ( 0140 GMT ) Wednesday from Madison , Wisconsin .
" I just watched theshuttle and station flyover ( 8:40 PM CST 9/9/09 ) and was surprised to see thatthe shuttle was sporting a massive curved plume , " he wrote .
" Whatcould it be ?
Something venting ?
An OMS burn ?
RCS thrusters ?
A massive , recordbreaking urine dump ? "
It turns out he was n't wrongabout that last one .
Talk about a makeover .
Just imagine what an iBook or iPhone would look like with this image on it : definitely not as chic .
Ronald Wayne designed Apple 's original logo in 1976 when the company was still operating out of a garage .
It shows Isaac Newton sitting beneath a tree with an apple dangling precariously above his head .
Rob Janoff used the same apple in his redesign a year later .
" You can almost feel the '70s and ' 80s taking place when you take a look at that rainbow apple , " says Bill Gardner , principal of Gardner Design .
Apple dropped the multi-colored logo in 1998 for a monochromatic version , produced in every color imaginable , until transitioning it to today 's popular shade of chrome .
The Kelvin structure is made up of truncated octahedra .

A researcher from the University of Bath has tackled an old geometric problem with a new method , which may lead to advances in creating hip replacements and replacement bone tissue for bone cancer patients .
The Kelvin problem , posed by Lord Kelvin in 1887 , is to find an arrangement of cells , or bubbles , of equal volume , so that the total surface area of the walls between them is as small as possible — in other words , to find the most efficient soap bubble foam .
The problem is relevant to bone replacement materials because bone tissue has a honeycomb - like structure , similar to a bubble foam .
The Weaire - Phelan structure ( top ) is made up of tetrakaidecahedra ( bottom left ) and irregular dodecahedra ( bottom right ) .
Kelvin suggested that the solution to his problem was a structure made up of slightly curved copies of a truncated octahedron : a shape with six square faces and eight hexagonal faces , which you get when you cut the corners off a three - dimensional diamond shape .
Kelvin 's structure , as his foam became known , was believed to be the most efficient solution for over 100 years , until the physicists Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan showed in 1993 that there is an even better foam .
The Weaire - Phelan structure consists of two different bubble shapes : an irregular dodecahedron , which has twelve irregular pentagonal faces , and a solid with two hexagonal and twelve pentagonal faces , known succinctly as a tetrakaidecahedron .
The structure is completely regular , and therefore easy to construct , but it also mimics the irregular appearance of a real foam rather well .
This is why it was chosen as the inspiration for the 2008 Olympic swimming venue in Beijing , known as the Water Cube ( see Plus article Swimming in mathematics to find out more ) .
The Water Cube , built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics , was inspired by the Weaire - Phelan structure .

Phelan and Weaire showed that their structure 's surface area is 0.3 % less than that of Kelvin 's solution .
Although an infinite number of foams that beat Kelvin 's structure have been found since 1993 , the Weaire - Phelan structure remains the most efficient of them all .
But whether or not there is an even more efficient foam out there , waiting to be discovered , still is n't known .
Gabrielli's new structure .
The new research comes from Ruggero Gabbrielli , who studied the honeycomb - like structure of bone replacement materials for his PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of Bath .
Gabbrielli's new foam , a complex structure made up of polyhedra with 13 and 14 faces , does n't beat the Weaire - Phelan structure in terms of packing efficiency , but the method he used to find it represents a new way of approaching the problem .
Ultimately , it could discover more efficient foams than the ones currently known , and possibly even lead to a proof showing that a given structure is indeed the best possible .
The Swift - Hohenberg equation in action .
The top row shows the image on the left evolving into a stripy pattern .
In the bottom row the parameters have been chosen to give a hexagonal pattern .
Image : Michael Cross .
Gabbrielli's method uses the Swift - Hohenberg equation , a partial differential equation developed in 1977 to describe the transfer of heat through fluids .
The equation can be used to generate patterns in two dimensions .
Imagine a rectangular digital image , in which the location of each pixel is given by a pair of co-ordinates , and the colour of the pixel at is defined by a numerical value .
The Swift - Hohenberg equation gives a rule dictating how the colour values of the various pixels should change over time and space .
The equation depends on two parameters , which you 're free to choose .
If you let your image evolve according to the equation 's rule , then depending on the parameter values you chose , you 'll soon see a regular pattern emerge on your screen .
Some parameters will give you stripes while others give you spots - it 's possible to evolve different patterns from the same image , simply by choosing different parameters .
It does n't matter what kind of image you choose to start with , as a given choice of parameters will always produce the same kind of pattern .
( See this website to see an animation of this process . )
Gabbrielli realised that the Swift - Hohenberg equation can also be used to generate patterns in three dimensions .
With the help of the equation and other existing techniques , he developed a new way of " growing " a whole range of foams — not as real structures , but as models on a computer .
Some of these foams are indeed new : one of them is the first to contain quadrilateral , pentagonal and hexagonal faces , and it does so in ratios that are very similar to those occurring in real foams .
Most importantly , its surface area is less than that of the Kelvin structure , raising hopes that the method may in future find foams that even beat the Weaire - Phelan structure .
Gabbrielli's results have been published in Philosophical Magazine Letters .
The political party that sent European copyright holders into a spin has opened a branch office in Australia and is recruiting office bearers and supporters .
The Pirate Party , which evolved from cultural and legal skirmishes with authorities in Sweden and Germany , last week updated the Australian website it registered last year and advertised for a president , treasurer , secretary and supporting positions .
A party spokesman , Rodney Serkowski , said the group was close to establishing a beachhead in Australia .
He said that with 300 supporters it was on its way to signing the 500 it needed to become an official Australian political party .
" We are currently an online community , working together with the intention of becoming a registered party , and we 're coming closer to reaching that goal , " Serkowski said .
" If we can get the required 500 members , and be registered by years end , I think it is highly probable that we will contest the next Federal election in Australia . "
At the weekend about two percent of Germans voted for the Pirate Party although it needed at least five percent to gain a seat in the German parliament , the Bundestag .
Serkowski said that one of the parties ' aims was to counter the online censorship scheme proposed by Communications Minister Senator Stephen Conroy .
" We hope that their [ the German Pirate Party 's ] success will help us in our push for registration , so that we can actively change the landscape of Australian politics by advocating fairer copyright , freer culture and ensuring the protection of civil liberties , sending a strong message to Mr Conroy that his censorship scheme is not welcome in Australia , " Serkowski said .
Serkowski said the party 's Australian policies would reflect those positions taken by its affiliates in Sweden and Germany .
He also said that illicit copying and sharing of content on online networks did n't equate to lost income for producers of such works .
" It is not the party 's understanding that file sharing affects the artist detrimentally , " Serkowski said .
" We believe that file sharing , even though it may be represented as a lost sale - that tired old drum the [ music ] industry beats , despite a 28 percent leap in profits for digital music last year recorded by the IFPI - it is in fact one of the best means of advertising for artists .
" It is only a matter of time before artists that have n't already made this realisation , do , " Serkowski said .
" It allows for entire niche genres and unknown artists to propagate their creative works to fans , without the controls imposed by industry , allowing more vibrant cultural and economic outcomes for artists . "
Serkowski also said the Pirate Party supported the legislation of non-commercial file sharing .
He also voiced concerns about Senator Conroy vowing to tackle illegal file - sharing by looking at initiatives such as a ' three strikes ' law which could see internet users disconected after infringing copyright three times in a row .
" We do n't want a three strikes situation to happen in Australia , as is being proposed in the UK , and has been suggested by Senator Conroy and ARIA , " he said .
" [ It ] threatens freedom of expression and due process - especially when socially , culturally and economically we have become dependent on the internet ,
" Any attempt to disconnect a citizen and seperate them from these fundamental rights for the purposes of protecting a monopoly is offensive . "
Elections will be held online at 8 pm on October 7 for the National Council of the Pirate Party of Australia .
Chanel was sensitive to the cold , her owners say
The dog who held the record as the world 's oldest has died at 21 years old , her owners have said .
Chanel died on Friday aged 147 in " dog years " , said owners Denice and Karl Shaughnessy , at her home in suburban New York state .
Guinness World Records officials presented Chanel with a certificate as the world 's oldest dog at a birthday party in Manhattan last May .
Chanel was walked daily , her owners said , but also had unhealthy habits .
She enjoyed butter sticks and chocolate - usually feared to be toxic to dogs - Mrs Shaughnessy said .
" She once ate an entire bag of Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups , and , you see , she lived to be 21 , so go figure , " Mrs Shaughnessy told Associated Press .
Chanel also liked wearing jumpers , as she was sensitive to the cold , the Shaughnessys said .
Rival
The couple attributed Chanel 's longevity not to healthy living but to God .
" Dogs are God 's angels sent here to look out for us , " Mrs Shaughnessy said .
Mr Shaughnessy had nominated her for the title after noticing there was no record listed in Guinness World Records .
But there are rival contenders for Chanel 's title - including Max , a dog in Louisiana whose owner , Janelle Derouen , has submitted documentation to Guinness apparently showing that he is 26 .
With a spate of new shows arriving next month , I have some predictions for the success of the new shows .
I have n't watched any of the new pilots , but based on the concepts , buzz , and marketing I can make a few speculations .
Today I am starting with the CW which only has a few new shows .
Melrose Place
Another 90's primetime soap reboot along the lines of 90210 .
I expect it to pull almost the exact numbers 90210 has .
Since this is CW , it wo n't be pulling big numbers , I 'm guessing it will get between 2 - 3 million viewers in fact , however , it will bring the demographic CW is looking for -- 18 - 34 women .
The Vampire Diaries
I expect this to get numbers larger than those of Supernatural and Smallville which would be considered huge for the network .
Those tweeners who have suddenly become interested in vampires due the Twilight fad and never heard of Anne Rice until a few years ago will find a perfect TV show .
Vampires , cheesy storylines , and pretty guys .
Those adults that still have n't upgraded to True Blood will probably be engrossed .
Too bad they could n't be there to save Moonlight .
The Beautiful Life : TBL
Mischa Barton 's breakdown may actually help generate some publicity for the show .
Paired with America 's Next Top Model , I think this show will do OK for CW standards which at quite low .
CW knows who they are targeting and this show goes right along with the type .
If anyone is wondering , I will not be watching any of these new shows ( big surprise ) .
I approach these shows with a 50 - foot stick .
I may not be watching , but I 'm sure CW will find success with these shows .
Even if their numbers do n't match up , CW knows the formula :
Trashy , sex , cheap .

Mozart , Orwell , Einstein , Beethoven and Newton all had it , and now new research funded by the Department of Health shows that one in every 100 adults has it too – autism , that is .
Autism is much discussed but less well understood .
Those with the disorder are sometimes mistakenly believed to be naughty , disruptive , antisocial , rude or just weird .
In reality they have a developmental disability with uncertain origins that has no cure , with symptoms they can do little if anything to control .
While some autistic people live fairly independent lives , others need constant specialist help .
However , all those with autism have difficulty with three things , says the National Autistic Society ( NAS ) .
1 ) Verbal / non-verbal communication
That can result in taking everything literally and misinterpreting jokes or sarcasm .
Facial expressions and tones of voice can also cause problems .
2 ) Social interaction " People with autism often have difficulty recognising or understanding other people 's emotions and feelings , and expressing their own , " says the NAS .
That trait can mean that an autistic person can prefer his or her own company , or come across as insensitive , or might not comprehend unwritten rules of behaviour – they may stand too close or initiate an inappropriate conversation .
3 ) Social imagination
This can mean trouble comprehending danger , such as a busy road ; preparing for change and planning for the future ; and handling unfamiliar or unexpected situations .
Some people may also have one or more of the following : a love of routines ; over - or under - sensitivity to the senses , such as not feeling pain or extremes of temperature ; special interests that are pursued intensely , often from an early age ; and learning disabilities .
Cooker that ' grows ' meat in your kitchen beats teleporting fridge and two - second clothes cleaner to win design prize
A controversial cooker that ' grows ' meat and fish by heating animal cells in your kitchen claimed first prize in the Electrolux design competition tonight .
The invention , called Cocoon , could develop food with the make - up and nutrients of real meat .
Mr Hederstierna , 27 , said : ' This will create 100 per cent pure meat without the need for animals to be killed and with no risk of contamination .
It will change everything .'

A food generator is a popular concept in science fiction programmes such as Star Trek .
Swedish industrial design student Rickard Hederstierna , 27 , said it could tackle food shortages as the world 's population spirals .
And the glass cooker , which would heat pre-mixed food packets containing muscle cells , oxygen and nutrients , would put an end to messy and time - consuming preparation .
Competition panelist David Fisher , design director of consultants
Seymourpowell , described the invention as ' controversial ' .
He said : ' Dealing with controversial issues and managing them sensitively is very important .
Real insight fed this idea .
It deals with a problem ( of food shortages ) that wo n't go away and we are going to have to deal with it in future . '
Other designers also tackled chores that are the bane of the busy homeowner 's life .

The kitchen of the future could have a fridge that teleports food from around the world and a flying rain - catcher that would pour cool water whenever you were thirsty
A two - second steamer that cleans and irons clothes and a fridge that teleports food direct to the kitchen have been unveiled as the time - saving appliances of the future .
The steamer 's designer Louis Filosa , 23 , from Chicago in the US , said : ' I wanted to turn the family laundry day into a laundry second .
By the year 3000 , housewives could also be served water by a flying rain - catcher that knows how thirsty you are , according to tomorrow 's industrial designers .
Eight quirky inventions made the shortlist .
A sun lounger that washes your clothes while you lie back and relax was also included .
Feeling hungry ?
Designers created a 3D molecular food printer and a robotic greenhouse that could be used for a journey to Mars called ' Le Petit Prince '
[ caption ]
The machine relies on nano - coated fabrics , which have a reactive chemical covering , becoming the norm over the coming decades .
The Naturewash sun lounger runs negative ions through real grass on its surface , which act as a catalyst for self - cleaning chemicals in the garment .
It even add the odour of flowers to your underwear .
Meanwhile , a food ' printer ' could pipe food molecules from a computer - programmed blister pack to create intricate starters , cake and sweets .
[ caption ]
And to wash up the plates will be a wall - mounted double dishwasher that saves you from bending down and provides space for dirty dishes while one machine is in motion .
Those travelling further afield could make use of ' Le Petit Prince . '
The robotic greenhouse was designed for use on a long journey to Mars .
Henrik Otto , of Electrolux , said : ' The designs have been innovative and exciting .
Our homes will be revolutionised over the next 90 years as products work together with humans to make a faster , simpler and more desirable home life . '
The city - run experiment to reduce traffic on San Francisco 's Market Street kicked off Tuesday with few reported problems and a lot of promise for a city intent on promoting alternatives to driving .
The day began with traffic cops directing private cars off eastbound Market Street at Eighth and Sixth streets in a six - week trial to make the busy traffic corridor safer for pedestrians and bicyclists and less congested for the 12 Muni lines that use the thoroughfare .
While some drivers appeared confused , the officers patiently waved them toward their new - unintended - destinations .
" For the most part , " said Lt. Mike Favetti of the San Francisco Police Department traffic unit , " I think it 's going well . "
Drivers who disobey the new traffic rule face a $ 167 fine , although authorities plan to issue warnings - not citations - for now .
The first bottleneck cropped up midday , starting just west of Ninth Street , when drivers had to sit through several cycles of traffic signals to travel one block .
The holdup was at Eighth Street , where cars had to wait for pedestrians to cross in front of them before they could turn right .
Once past that choke point , however , what traffic remained ran smoothly .
On many blocks , bikes outnumbered cars on Market Street , which is usually clogged with traffic .
" I 've not seen anything like this on a weekday , " said David Levine , a restaurant manager who commutes on bike down Market Street to his job on the Embarcadero .
" There are still buses and trucks , but there 's more room , less need to zigzag . "
Alternatives suggested
During the trial , cars heading east on Market Street toward the Ferry Building must turn right onto Eighth and Sixth streets and find alternative routes to get downtown .
Transportation planners suggest Mission and Folsom .
Congestion did not surge on those streets through the early afternoon .
But the big test will come during evening commutes .
Folsom is a major feeder street to the Bay Bridge .
Officials hope to discourage drivers from using the well - known Market Street corridor that runs from Eureka Valley to the Financial District as a thoroughfare .
Cars are not being diverted off Market Street east of Sixth Street .
In addition , the new rules do not apply to commercial trucks , taxis and buses .
Westbound traffic is not affected .
City officials met after the morning commute to debrief and propose tweaks .
They decided they needed to post more traffic signs and portable electronic message boards further west to warn drivers of the forced turns .
They also suggested having officers hold back pedestrians crossing Eighth Street before the light changes to red to give drivers more time to turn .
Cyclists also have to get used to the changes and pay extra attention to the right - turning cars , officials said .
Mayor Gavin Newsom and other political , civic and business leaders are eager to transform Market Street into a more vibrant boulevard , and , at one time , considered an all - out ban on cars .
That proposal was dropped , but the question of how to remake the street has been a challenge for decades .
One idea is to pursue a more pedestrian - friendly model to help spark the makeover , and the car restrictions put into place Tuesday are considered a first step .
Seedy target
The target is the mid-Market area - a seedy stretch between Van Ness Avenue and Powell Street that is pocked with sidewalk drug deals , public drunkenness and panhandling .
Over the next year , the city plans to install new landscaping and street furniture .
Newsom said the forced - turn pilot project will be abandoned if it does n't show positive results .
Restricting cars on Market Street is the latest project by City Hall - as described by Newsom - " to democratize our streets . "
Short stretches of 17th Street in the Castro neighborhood and the road where San Jose Avenue and Guerrero Street converge in the Mission District have been closed temporarily and turned into mini-plazas , and more are planned .
From Software has just annouced that their upcoming blocky RPG , 3D Dot Game Heroes , is to be released in Japan on November 5th .
The game , being developed by Silicon Studio takes place in a classic RPG kingdom whose king , following the successful defeat of a demon lord , declares that the world should be 3D rather than 2D .
Somewhere along the lines , trouble arises , and it is up to the player to solve the mystery .
Something else that was revealed is the ability to create the hero of your choice , just in case the one provided for you does n’t suit your needs .
No word yet on the depth of the customization , but if I have my way the world will be saved by Sephiroth , just for a touch of irony .
So for those of you brave enough to import , what kind of hero will you make ?

Google 's employees , it seems , do n't just get a free lunch .
The Internet giant 's questionable decision to reprice employee stock options , implemented three days before stocks hit their nadir in March , also has proved a nice perk for employees .
Google exchanged a total of 7.6 million stock options with an average exercise price close to $ 522 for an equivalent number exercisable at $ 308.57 , Google 's then - market price .
In recent days Google has traded above $ 500 , which means each option now has built in profits of nearly $ 200 ...
There is little hard evidence as to how many are ' addicted ' to painkillers
Over the counter painkillers containing codeine can become addictive in just three days , the government 's drug watchdog has said .
Packets of the medicines , which include Nurofen Plus and Solpadeine Plus , will now come with stronger warnings on the risk of dependency .
It comes after a parliamentary report warned of the dangers of the drugs .
Figures show 27 million packs of codeine - containing painkillers are sold every year in the UK .
It has been reported that 30,000 people have become addicted to medicines containing codeine - an effective analgesic which is combined with other painkillers such as paracetamol for sale by the pharmacist .
But MPs have warned this figure could be the tip of the iceberg .
These products can be addictive and we are taking action to tackle this risk
Dr June Raine , MHRA
The medicines , which are used for migraine , backache , dental pain and period pain , will have to carry more prominent warnings on addiction both on the packaging and the leaflet inside , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , said .
And consumers will be warned not to take them for more than three days at a time .
It will also include advice on using them only for pain not relieved by simple painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen .
Any suggestion that the pills should be used for colds , flu , coughs and sore throats , as well as references to minor painful conditions will be removed .
Large packs of effervescent codeine drugs will only be available on prescription .
Pack sizes will be limited to a maximum of 32 , but the All Party Parliamentary Drug Misuse Group had called for them to be restricted to 18 pills per pack .
Clear information Please turn on JavaScript .

Dr June Raine , MHRA director of vigilance and risk management , of Medicines said that taken in the correct manner and for the right purposes , codeine and dihydrocodeine are very effective and acceptably safe medicines .
" However , these products can be addictive and we are taking action to tackle this risk , " she said .
PRODUCTS AFFECTED Co-codamol Codis 500 Cuprofen Plus Migraleve Pink Migraleve Yellow Nurofen Plus Panadol Ultra Paracodol Capsules and Tablets Paramol Tablets and Soluble Tablets Solpadeine Max Solpadeine Migraine Ibuprofen & Codeine Tablets Solpadeine Plus Capsules , Tablets and Soluble Tablets Syndol Veganin Tablets
She added they wanted to ensure that people had clear information on what the medicines should be used for and how to minimise the risk of addiction .
" Anyone who has concerns should speak to their pharmacist or a doctor . "
The Proprietary Association of Great Britain ( PAGB ) , the trade association representing manufacturers of over the counter medicines , said they supported the moves .
Sheila Kelly , PAGB executive director , said safety was of paramount concern .
" PAGB member companies already voluntarily restrict pack sizes to 32 tablets and added addiction warnings to packs back in 2005 .
" The new labelling to increase the prominence of the addiction warning by moving it to the front of the pack , and to limit the indications to moderate acute pain that does not respond to paracetamol , ibuprofen or aspirin alone , will be introduced as soon as possible . "
She added that the vast majority of people use codeine containing products correctly and have no need to worry that they are doing themselves any harm .

Rarely does the British Journal of Psychiatry produce in the reader anything other than déjà vu at best and ennui at worst ; but an article in the July issue was startling in its implications and accordingly won wide publicity .
Researchers carried out a double - blind trial of the effect of vitamin and mineral supplements on the behavior of prisoners aged 18 to 21 .
Two hundred and thirty - one such prisoners were divided randomly into two groups : one that received real vitamins , one that got only a placebo .
Those who received the real vitamins committed about a third fewer disciplinary offenses and acts of violence during the follow - up period than those who took the placebo .
The researchers demonstrated that the two groups of prisoners did not differ in any respect before the trial ( though , importantly , they did not control for previous or current usage of illicit drugs ) .
Thus the reduction in antisocial behavior was in all probability attributable to the vitamins .
True , the results have yet to be reproduced elsewhere , and reproducibility is the hallmark of genuine scientific discovery .
True , too , the researchers offered no explanation of why the vitamins produced their alleged effects — and the supplements contained so many vitamins , minerals , and fatty acids that it would take several lifetimes to establish exactly which ones produced the alleged effect .
Still , the trial raised hopes of a breakthrough for Britain ’s crime - ridden , even crime - dominated , society .
Could it be that simply handing out vitamin pills to our potential burglars and muggers could make our homes and streets more secure ?
Those who have long been on the lookout for reasons to exempt criminals from responsibility for their acts — as a sign of their own generosity of spirit — will conclude from these results either that crime is a manifestation of physical illness of the brain or that it is the result of poverty that itself gives rise to that illness .
But we should exercise caution : other interpretations are , as always , possible .
That many young inmates are grossly malnourished when they enter prison I have absolutely no doubt , because each day I see cases of severe malnutrition among those who have recently entered the adult prison in which I work .
Of an average daily intake of 20 prisoners , perhaps six , of whom four are drug addicts , show obvious outward signs of malnutrition .
A rough estimate ( allowing for recidivism ) would suggest that perhaps 1,000 malnourished men arrive in my prison annually : that means ( if my prison is typical , and there is no reason to suppose otherwise ) that each year at least 25,000 malnourished men enter the British prison system .
What is more , the malnutrition that I see in the prison is also to be found in the hospital in which I work , among men ( and , to a lesser extent , among women ) of the same social class as the prisoners .
Were a film director to need extras to play the part of starving Bosnians in a movie about the Serbian atrocities , he would need to look no further than my prison ’s daily intake .
The prisoners ’ sunken eyes , which appear disproportionately large in the setting of their sunken cheeks and prominent cheekbones , their spindly limbs , and their hollow chests with paper - bag skin , punctuated with unhealing sores , over their bony rib cages , would fit the director ’s bill perfectly .
The prisoners ’ teeth are falling out ; their tongues are glisteningly smooth , angrily magenta red , and the corners of their mouths are cracked , as in vitamin B deficiency .
They are in their early twenties to their early thirties .
From the dietary point of view , freedom has the same effect upon them as a concentration camp ; incarceration restores them to nutritional health .
This is a new phenomenon , at least on the scale on which I now see it .
Last week , for example , I treated in my hospital a skeletal man who had been released from prison only two months before and had in that short time lost 44 pounds .
A recidivist , he had served many short sentences for theft , and his weight went up and down according to whether he was in prison or at liberty .
This is a common enough pattern of weight gain and weight loss among the males of my city ’s underclass .
It has a meaning quite alien to those who believe that modern malnutrition is merely a symptom of poverty and inequality .
About two - thirds of these malnourished young men take drugs , upon which they spend sums of money that , however obtained , would secure them nightly banquets .
The drugs they take suppress their appetite : the nausea induced by heroin inhibits the desire to eat , while cocaine and its derivatives suppress it altogether .
The prostitutes who stand on the street corners not far from where I live — they work a shift system and commute in from a nearby town in buses chartered by their pimps — are likewise grossly malnourished ( they often end up in my hospital ) , and for the same reason .
You ’d think famine were stalking the land .
Not all the malnourished are drug - takers , however .
It is when you inquire into eating habits , not just recent but throughout entire lifetimes , that all this malnutrition begins to make sense .
The trail is a short one between modern malnutrition and modern family and sexual relations .
Take the young burglar whom I saw in the prison last week .
There was nothing remarkable about his case : on the contrary , he was , if I may put it thus , an average British burglar .
And his story was one that I have heard a thousand times at least .
Here , if anywhere , is the true banality of evil .
He smoked heroin , but the connection between his habit and his criminality was not what is conventionally assumed : that his addiction produced a craving so strong , and a need to avoid withdrawal symptoms so imperative , that resort to crime was his only choice .
On the contrary — and as is usually the case — his criminal record started well before he took to heroin .
Indeed , his decision to take heroin was itself a continuation , an almost logical development , of his choice of the criminal life .
He was thin and malnourished in the manner I have described .
Five feet ten , he weighed just over 100 pounds .
He told me what many young men in his situation have told me , that he asked the court not to grant him bail , so that he could recover his health in prison — something that he knew he would never do outside .
A few months of incarceration would set him up nicely to indulge in heroin on his release .
Prison is the health farm of the slums .
I examined him and said to him , “ You do n’t eat . ”
“ Not much , ” he said .
“ I do n’t feel like it . ”
“ And when you do eat , what do you eat ? ”
“ Crisps [ potato chips ] and chocolate . ”
This pattern , however , was not the heroin talking , as addicts sometimes put it .
Rather , it was the story of his life .
He had never known his father , who had not even achieved the status of myth in his mind .
His father ’s existence was more of a logical deduction , the product of the syllogism that runs : all humans have fathers , I am a human , therefore I have a father .
To make up for it , he had known stepfathers aplenty , the last of whom was in a steady , though violent , relationship with his mother , a relationship that required the frequent intervention of the police to prevent its premature end through murder .
He had left home when he was 16 because his stepfather had made it clear that he was de trop .
I asked the young man whether his mother had ever cooked for him .
“ Not since my stepfather arrived .
She would cook for him , like , but not for us children . ”
I asked him what they — he and his brothers and sisters — had eaten and how they had eaten it .
“ We ’d just eat whatever there was , ” he said .
“ We ’d look for something whenever we was hungry . ”
“ And what was there ? ”
“ Bread , cereals , chocolate — that kind of thing . ”
“ So you never sat round a table and ate a meal together ? ”
“ No . ”
In fact , he told me that he had never once eaten at a table with others in the last 15 years .
Eating was for him a solitary vice , something done almost furtively , with no pleasure attached to it and certainly not as a social event .
The street was his principal dining room , as well as his trash can : and as far as food was concerned , he was more a hunter - gatherer than a man living in a highly evolved society .
Far from being unique , his story was typical of those that I have heard hundreds — no , thousands — of times .
Another young man , also expelled from home at an early age because his new stepfather , only a few years older than he , found him surplus to requirements , had been obliged to drift from friend ’s house to friend ’s house for six years .
Unfitted by training or education for any particular job , he had worked only casually , for a few weeks at a time , and so never had the financial stability to pay rent on a place of his own ( in conditions of shortage , public housing goes preferentially to young single women with children , and he had made the situation worse by having two children of his own by two young women ) .
Needless to say , he had no domestic skills either , never having been taught any ; and his friends , coming from the same social milieu , were just as undomesticated .
They too ate in an unsocial fashion and expected him to fend nutritionally for himself , which he did by eating chocolate , the only food he could remember having eaten with any consistency over the last few years .
Apart from his time in prison ( for stealing from cars ) , he had n’t eaten a meal in a decade .
It ca n’t be long before someone suggests that the solution to a problem like this is to fortify chocolate with minerals and vitamins .
I meet at least one young man every week in the hospital with a similar story to relate .
It is a story that angers and frustrates me .
These young men ’s malnutrition is the sign of an entire way of life , and not the result of raw , inescapable poverty .
Another patient whom I saw soon after , similarly malnourished , told me that he ate practically nothing , subsisting on sugary soft drinks .
It never takes many links in a chain of reasoning to get from their smooth and raw magenta tongues to the kind of family breakdown favored by a certain ideology of human relations , encouraged by our laws and fiscal system , and made viable by welfare payments .
It is the breakdown of the family structure — a breakdown so complete that mothers do not consider it part of their duty to feed their own children once they have reached the age at which they can forage for themselves in a refrigerator — that promotes modern malnutrition in Britain .
Such malnutrition , according to the public health establishment , now affects millions of British households .
And it is hardly surprising if young people who have not learned to socialize within the walls of their own homes , who have not learned even the minimal social disciplines required by people who eat together , should be completely antisocial in other respects .
One of the things British prisons could usefully do , therefore , but do not even attempt , is to teach young men how to eat in a social fashion .
Instead , they reinforce the pattern of solipsistic consumption by making prisoners take their food back to their cells , where they eat it in the same solitary and furtive fashion as they masturbate .
As to whether the malnutrition consequent upon a profoundly asocial way of life itself contributes to antisocial behavior , by affecting the brain and hence the capacity of the malnourished person to make reasonable choices , only future research will prove .
I personally do not find the idea inherently improbable .
The existence of malnutrition in the midst of plenty has not entirely escaped either the intelligentsia or the government , which of course is proposing measures to combat it : but , as usual , neither pols nor pundits wish to look the problem in the face or make the obvious connections .
For them , the real and most pressing question raised by any social problem is : “ How do I appear concerned and compassionate to all my friends , colleagues , and peers ? ”
Needless to say , the first imperative is to avoid any hint of blaming the victim by examining the bad choices that he makes .
It is not even permissible to look at the reasons for those choices , since by definition victims are victims and therefore not responsible for their acts , unlike the relatively small class of human beings who are not victims .
One might extend La Rochefoucauld ’s famous maxim that neither the sun nor death can be stared at for long , by saying that no member of the modern liberal intelligentsia can stare at a social problem for very long .
He feels the need to retreat into impersonal abstractions , into structures or alleged structures over which the victim has no control .
And out of this need to avoid the rawness of reality he spins utopian schemes of social engineering .
The British intelligentsia has thus come up with an abstraction that fits this particular bill perfectly — that is to say , the need to explain widespread malnutrition in the midst of plenty without resort to the conduct of the malnourished themselves : food deserts .
A food desert is a poor area of a town or city , in which there are few shops selling food , and in which those few offer a restricted range of unhealthy and unnourishing produce at relatively high prices .
The huge supermarket chains , unwilling to carry out their social duty , have retreated to prosperous areas , where they can sell profitably to people who do not have to worry about what they spend on what they eat .
Particularly lacking in a food desert are fresh comestibles : all food available is processed or precooked , full of salt and the worst kind of fat , and lacking in vital ingredients .
The people who live in a food desert , therefore , have no choice but to eat unhealthily .
Of course , the real — that is to say , ultimate — cause of food deserts is modern capitalism , the system that created and perpetuates the food deserts .
It has become a truth universally acknowledged that food deserts actually exist and must be the fault of the supermarket chains ( and , by extension , the System ) .
Indeed , the government , ever on the lookout for new areas of life to control with its dictatorial benevolence , has proposed a new law to eradicate what is now known as “ food poverty ” by irrigating these deserts with subsidies to food suppliers .
As yet the additional provisions of the bill are not at all firm , except for the establishment of a Food Poverty Authority in every district , manned by bureaucrats , who will measure food poverty and count the miles people have to go to get fresh vegetables .
One man ’s poverty is another man ’s employment opportunity : as long ago as the sixteenth century , a German bishop remarked that the poor are a gold mine .
Recently , at a lunch I attended , given by a left - wing magazine to which I sometimes contribute , the matter of food poverty and food deserts came up , and it was with some pride that I heard an area , not more than a mile from where I live , described as the very worst of these deserts , positively the Atacama of food .
As the only person present with personal knowledge — what Bertrand Russell used to call “ knowledge by acquaintance ” — of the area in question , I felt constrained to point out that I frequently shopped there , at a small Indian store in which one could buy , for example , 22 - pound sacks of onions for about $ 3.40 , and in which a huge variety of extremely fresh vegetables could be bought at prices less than half of those in the supermarket chains .
Yet the only poor people who shopped there were Indian immigrants or their descendants — housewives who sifted through the produce looking carefully for the best .
Practically no poor whites ( or blacks ) ever went there , though plenty of both live in the area .
Only a few members of the white middle class from outside the area took advantage of the wide range and exceptionally low prices .
Moreover , unlike the people who spoke so fluently of the food deserts , I had , in the course of my medical duties , visited many homes in the area .
The only homes in which there were ever any signs of genuine cookery and of eating as a social activity , where families discussed the topics of daily life and affirmed their bonds to one another , were those of the Indian immigrants .
In white and black homes , cookery meant ( at its best ) re-heating in a microwave oven , and there was no table round which people could sit together to eat the re-heated food .
Meals here were solitary , poor , nasty , British , and short .
The Indian immigrants and their descendants inherited a far better and more elaborate cuisine than the native British , of course , but this is not a sufficient explanation of their willingness still to buy fresh food and to cook it : they continue to cook because they still live in families , and cookery is a socially motivated art .
Even among Indian heroin addicts ( principally Muslim ) , the kind of malnutrition I have described is rare , because they do not yet live in the solipsistic isolation of their white counterparts , who live alone , even when there are other people inhabiting the house or apartment in which they themselves live .
Drug addiction is thus a necessary condition for much of the malnutrition that I see , but not sufficient .
The owners of the shop only a mile from my door , serving poor Indian immigrants , are almost certainly millionaires : and the fact that their customers are poor has not prevented them from establishing a conspicuously flourishing business .
If , however , you examined the convenience stores in predominantly white working - class areas ( where the per- capita income is not lower ) , you would find a much reduced range of produce , very little of it fresh , and the great majority of it processed for ease of preparation .
While the Indian store gives the impression of intense activity and hope , the convenience store in a white working - class area gives the impression of passivity and despair .
If food deserts truly exist — and they cannot in these times of easy transport be very extensive — the explanation lies in demand , not in supply .
And demand is a cultural phenomenon .
The connections I have drawn are obvious , yet denied — or rather avoided altogether — in the typical modern British approach to social problems .
The article in the British Journal of Psychiatry at least refrains from trying to explain away the malnutrition of the young prisoners without reference to their choices , ideas , habits , way of life , and pattern of social and family relations .
It is completely agnostic as to the source of , or reasons for , their dietary deficiencies .
Nor does it attempt to disaggregate the results according to ethnic group : the numbers involved in the trial were probably too small for this to be feasible , even had the authors desired to do so .
The liberal intelligentsia has several reasons for failing to see or admit the cultural dimension of malnutrition in the midst of plenty — in failing to see its connection with an entire way of life — and in throwing the blame instead onto the supermarket chains .
One reason is to avoid confronting the human consequences of the changes in morals , manners , and social policy that it has consistently advocated .
The second is to avoid all appearance of blaming people whose lives are poor and unenviable .
That this approach leads it to view those same people as helpless automata , in the grip of forces that they cannot influence , let alone control — and therefore as not full members of the human race — does not worry the intelligentsia in the least .
On the contrary , it increases the importance of the elite ’s own providential role in society .
To blame the supermarket chains is implicitly to demand that the liberal and bureaucratic elite should have yet more control over society .
This is how the British government ’s current Food Poverty Eradication Bill should be interpreted .
By attempting to tackle the sources of supply rather than those of demand , it will sidestep the question of an entire way of life — a problem that it would take genuine moral courage to tackle — and aim at an easy target instead .
The government will increase bureaucracy and regulation without reducing malnutrition .
This , in miniature , is the story of modern Britain .
When it comes to raising consumer awareness for the their new baby , Sony wastes no time .
I do n’t know what Sony ’s marketing team is on , but whatever it is , I want some .
The commercials highlight Sony ’s latest marketing campaign titled “ Playface Derby ” .
Starting September 3rd , and lasting through November 24th , Sony ’s “ Playface Shooting Caravan ” will travel throughout Tokyo and Osaka .
It ’s mission : medical experimentation capture people ’s faces while they play their favorite games .
Once uploaded to the Playface . jp website , the videos will be subjected to a public voting system , where one very lucky winner will receive the grand prize of 2.5 million yen ’s worth of PSN points .
For non-econ majors , that ’s roughly $ 26,500.00 USD .
Unfortunately , Sony has no plans to extend this promotion beyond Japanese borders , which proves once and for all that Sony hates everyone else .

BBC reporter
A BBC investigation has uncovered evidence of exploitation of migrant workers at some of London 's leading hotels .
Examination of the time sheets and pay slips of 12 room attendants working for a contract cleaning company at hotels in the Park Plaza chain reveal that they have regularly been paid below the £ 5.73 per hour minimum adult wage .
And two undercover reporters , whom the BBC sent to work as room attendants at the Park Plaza County Hall Hotel and Park Plaza Riverbank , were only paid for about half the number of hours that they actually worked .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The room attendants at the centre of the investigation by Newsnight and Radio 4's PM programme are all from Poland .
Use of migrant labour is widespread in the UK hotel industry , which is well known for demanding long hours in return for low pay .
Polish workers , together with workers from most eastern European countries , have the same legal rights and protection in the UK as any British worker .
However , foreign workers are often unaware of their rights and lack English language skills , making them easy victims for exploitation .
Lucrative contracts
The 12 workers whose pay the BBC examined asked not to be identified for fear of losing their jobs .
You 'll get £ 5.73 per hour , but you have to clean two and a half rooms per hour .
If you do n't , you do n't get that
Hotelcare representative
Hotels rooms ' not properly cleaned '
Hotelcare response Park Plaza Hotels reponse
They are all employed by Hotelcare , a leading contract cleaning agency responsible for 30,000 rooms a day at 150 hotels around the country .
The company employs around 2,000 workers and has won lucrative contracts to clean rooms at many popular hotel chains .
Park Plaza
Hotels have told the BBC that it takes the allegations " very seriously " and that they have launched an internal investigation .
Hotelcare also said it was investigating the allegations .
Examples which the BBC uncovered include one worker who is underpaid by £ 113 over a two week period , and another who is underpaid by £ 69 .
The agency pays the room attendants not according to the hours they work , but the number of rooms they clean within the working day .
This has led to them being underpaid , and , it is claimed , some rooms not being cleaned properly : " I was appalled at what I experienced , " Basia Mowiska , a 24 - year - old Polish woman who previously worked as a room attendant at two hotels run by the Park Plaza group , told the BBC .
" The supervisors treated us like cattle .
Often there were no cleaning products and we had to use whatever came to hand , like shampoos or shower gels for the guest rooms .
We were often in tears when we were cleaning the rooms , but we had to grit our teeth .
We had to work .
We had families to support . "
Breaking the law The BBC sent two undercover reporters to work for Hotelcare in order to investigate claims the law was being broken .

They used secret filming equipment while they worked as room attendants at the luxury Park Plaza County Hall Hotel and Park Plaza Riverbank , which are located across the River Thames from the Houses of Parliament .
In one secretly recorded conversation during registration for a job , the reporter is told by a Hotelcare representative she will be paid the minimum wage .
However , there is a catch : " You 'll get £ 5.73 per hour , " she is told .
" But you have to clean two and a half rooms per hour .
If you do n't , you do n't get that . "
The reporter asks , " So if I clean less than two and a half rooms I receive less money ? "
The Hotelcare representative 's response is a nod of the head .
Underpaid
The productivity rate is the device Hotelcare uses to justify payments below minimum wage .
However , two employment lawyers have told the BBC that it is against the law to pay less than minimum wage and that the company 's attempt to link the pay to a productivity rate would not stand up in court , because the employer sets the hours and tasks .

" The employer is entitled to set a productivity rate , like a number of rooms per hour , but they can't pay them less than £ 5.73 , " Rakesh Patel , from the law firm Thompsons , said .
" If they do n't seem to be working hard enough , it becomes a disciplinary matter . "
When one of our reporters received her first pay - slip she found that she had been paid for only 22.9 hours , even though the time sheets and the filming evidence showed she had worked 44 hours that week .
Her pay was £ 131.27 when it should have been £ 252.12 .
She is also seen on film with a colleague who is visibly upset when she discovers that she has been paid only £ 149 for a work week of approximately the same length .
The reporter complained to her boss , Hotelcare Area Manager Iwona Pirog , who was secretly recorded appearing to blame staff from Park Plaza County Hall hotel for the underpayment .
" I only have what the hotel sent me , " Ms Pirog claimed , " I do n't have access to the time sheets .
You have been paid according to the documents the hotel has sent me . "
Demanding work However , the BBC has seen copies of detailed documents sent from another Park Plaza hotel to Hotelcare each week detailing the actual hours each room attendant worked and the numbers of rooms they cleaned .
It 's a low paid job with low status , so you can only expect migrants to do the job and this makes them very vulnerable
Marzena Cichon , London Citizens
This information is designed so that Hotelcare can bill the hotel for its services , and calculate pay for each worker .
And , as our undercover reporters found , this is tough , physical work .
The room attendants work for around eight hours a day , starting at around 0800 , and often do not take meal breaks .
They are entitled to a half hour break , but are not paid for the time .
They work at least five or six days a week , and experienced workers are expected to clean up to 16 rooms a day , sometimes more .
Training is compulsory , but is expected to be carried out in the employees ' own time , or on days off , as they are not paid for the time spent training .
Seeking help
The room attendants took their concerns to London Citizens , a community group working to improve pay and conditions for low paid workers in the capital .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The organisation has previously had success in raising wage levels for cleaners working in the banking sector , and introduced the concept of a " living wage " which is now supported by the London Mayor Boris Johnson .
The living wage is currently set at £ 7.60 per hour .
According to London Citizens , the British Hospitality Association , representing hotels and restaurants , has refused to discuss the idea of introducing a living wage into the hotel sector .
" It 's a low paid job with low status , so you can only expect migrants to do the job and this makes them very vulnerable , " said Marzena Cichon from London Citizens .
" Agencies know these people lack the language skills , they know that these people do n't know the law , and they know they do n't know what their rights are in this country .
They do n't know who to turn to for help . "
Pat McFadden , the Business Minister , has promised to investigate the BBC 's allegations , saying : " We know that there will be a minority of employers out there who will try to get around the law and perhaps that temptation increases in a recession , but we are determined that the recession must not be an excuse for people to be denied their basic employment rights .

Who are the " birthers " -- the Americans who believe in the face of all available evidence that President Barack Obama was not born in the US and is therefore not eligible for the presidency ?
A poll by Public Policy Polling reveals they 're overwhelmingly white , conservative and male .
The poll found that nearly a quarter of Americans believe Obama was born outside the US , while 62 percent of Americans understand Obama is a native - born American and 14 percent are not sure .
Who are those 14 percent ?
- 62 % are Republicans , 20 % are Democrats , and 18 % are independents
- 57 % are conservatives , 33 % are moderates , and 9 % are liberals
- 56 % are men , 44 % are women
- 86 % are white , 7 % are Hispanic , 4 % are black , and 3 % are other races
The poll does not reveal which brand of tinfoil the birthers prefer for their hats .

Ignore the way he spoke ; much of what Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi said in his speech to the United Nations about the UN was both sensible and defensible .
Gaddafi tore up the UN Charter .
I would too .
This is a document of lies about democracy , peace and security and universal rights ; rights that the imperialist powers trample over every day .
Gordon Brown in speaking after Gaddafi ’s said he had come to defend the UN Charter , not to tear it up .
He called on all nations to support its universal principles .
Perhaps Britain and the other members of the Security Council – the US , China , Russia and France – could begin by doing just that .
It is not the poor and oppressed nations who invade other countries and kill millions ; it is not the poor and oppressed nations who enslave Africa and many other parts of the world in poverty ; it is not the poor and oppressed nations whose militaries threaten the world ; it is not the poor and oppressed nations who imprison Palestine ; it is not the poor and oppressed nations who threaten us all with nuclear annihilation .
Here ’s one quote from Gaddafi ’s speech , a quote that most people can agree with :
Superpowers have interests and they use the power of the United Nations to protect their interests .
The third world is terrified and being terrorised and living in fear .
Gaddafi ’s point was that the UN is the plaything of the big powers .
When these robber baron nations agree ( for example over Afghanistan ) then they mount joint imperialist wars against the oppressed nations .
When they disagree ( for example over Iraq ) the imperialist powers act unilaterally .
Either way the end result is a world living in fear – fear of imperialism and its soldiers , drones , mass killings and the misery and the poverty they inflict .
If the choice is between the principles of the UN or their own imperial interests , the major powers choose their own interests every time .
Let ’s take the UN commitment to peace and security .
The five permanent security council members have used this as a smokescreen to launch war after war since the UN was established .
Gaddafi named a few .
Korea , the Suez canal , Vietnam , Iraq and Afghanistan were at the top of his list .
He called for an investigation into these wars , with a view to prosecuting those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
There is nothing remarkable about this .
Any decent international human rights lawyer not caught up in the imperialist project can tell you that every US president since the establishment of the UN charter is a war criminal .
But given the fact that the US military is as big as the next sixteen nations combined , you just cannot prosecute them .
But it is not only ‘ direct ’ imperialist wars that we should consider .
As Gaddafi pointed out , since the establishment of the UN there have been 65 wars .
That ’s just over one a year .
Almost all of them are the consequence of imperialism , especially the rivalry between the major imperialist powers .
Gaddafi called the Security Council – made up of the five major imperialist powers and some elected nations – the Council of Terror .
He ’s not quite right there because that gives the impression that these major powers act in concert .
They do n’t often do so because their interests do n’t often coincide .
But they are the council of terrorists .
The US , often with Britain and sometimes with France in tow , has killed tens of millions around the world and displaced hundreds of millions to protect its pre-eminent role in the global economy and extend its Empire .
The British and French brutally established their colonies across the globe .
Russia , in its state capitalist days , held Eastern Europe in its grip .
Now it rules Chechnya and parts of Georgia brutally through puppets and troops .
The Chinese occupy Tibet and terrorise national minorities like the Uighur .
In the long term the Chinese pose the major threat to the American empire so US foreign policy is dominated by its attempts to both encircle and engage the Chinese ruling class .
It is this clash between imperialisms which is the driver for war in the world today .
Until working people in those countries overthrow their imperialist rulers there can be no peace .
Even most of the current wars are caused by imperialism or are proxies for imperialists fighting for influence and power .
Afghanistan is in part a US attempt to encircle China .
The invasion of Iraq with its million dead and millions dispossessed was mainly about the US controlling the flow of oil from the Middle East to China and showing the rest of the world that the US was the most powerful military power in the world .
If you do n’t obey us you could end up like Iraq .
Gaddafi also called for the will of the member nations to prevail over those of the five imperialist powers on the Security Council .
Again , there is nothing remarkable about this .
It is perfectly legitimate to call for the democratisation of the UN .
It wo n’t happen because the UN is the creature and plaything of imperialism , not its master .
Lenin called the League of Nations , the precursor to the UN , a unification “ on paper only ; in reality it is a group of beasts of prey , who only fight one another and do not at all trust one another . ”
He called it a Thieves ’ Kitchen , a “ piece of fakery from beginning to end ; it is a deception from beginning to end ; it is a lie from beginning to end . ”
The same is true of the UN .
The predilection of the Thieves ’ Kitchen for war since 1948 just shows this reality .
Gaddafi also called for the West to pay $ 7.7 trillion in compensation for its past and present stripping of the wealth of Africa .
Again , there is nothing remarkable about this .
Early capitalism was built on the labour of slaves and their trade .
The spread of capitalism to Africa saw its wealth and productive base stolen or destroyed .
Capitalism ’s wealth is built in part on that destruction .
Imperialism condemns Africa to a lifetime of poverty .
The UN perpetuates that .
A humane society would take steps immediately to organise production to satisfy the human needs of all – including our billion African brothers and sisters – to food , running water , housing and energy .
Such a society is only possible through the democratisation of production , that is through democratic working class revolution .
The West , and its mendicant media , will make fun of Gaddafi .
Let ’s cut through the bullshit .
Gaddafi was right .
The UN is part of the problem , not the cure .
When we see George W Bush , Tony Blair and John Howard , along with the new crew of criminals like Obama , Brown and Rudd , in leg irons at the Hague then and only then will we know that there is justice in the world .
Some Irish boys are still living with their mammies by the age of 33 .
Their failure to launch can be caused by a crippling shyness , or from the uncertainty about which path to take in life , but the result is usually the same -- after your friends have forged their own trails , some boys are still left tooling around the old haunts , waiting for their lives to begin .
Bestselling Irish author Derek Landy , 37 , knows all about it .
Sometimes called the Irish J.K Rowling , by the time Landy turned 30 there was a big question mark still hanging over him .
His brothers and sisters had grown up and moved on to successful city careers while he was still pursuing his dream to become a screenwriter .
Screenwriting meant flying to London year after year to have discouraging meetings with disinterested producers .
It meant staying in horrible , damp hotels waiting for a phone call that would never come .
His screenplay for an Irish zombie movie did n’t set the world on fire , and producers objected to his slasher thriller in which everybody dies .
Things looked bleak .
But just as he reached his lowest ebb the tide suddenly turned .
The idea for Harry Potter , the boy wizard that made J.K.
Rowling so rich that she is now said to possess more wealth than Queen Elizabeth II , reportedly just fell into the author ’s head one day as she was taking a train journey across England .
For Landy the process was exactly the same .
One day in 2005 he was over in London for a series of desultory film meetings that were dragging on and on .
Then it happened .
“ I had started writing movies that got made in 2003 and 2005 , ” Landy told sister publication of IrishCentral the Irish Voice .
“ But neither one made me a whole lot of money or got me to Hollywood or contributed to my actual career .
“ So I was over in London meeting with various producers and I was in a really horrible hotel room when the name Skulduggery Pleasant came to me , and that was pretty much it . ”
With the name came the fully - fledged character , including who he was and what he looked like .
“ He told me he was a detective who was also a skeleton , and instantly I knew what he was like .
But then I had to figure out if he was as interesting as I thought he would be , so I wrote a dialogue between him and an unnamed character where he explained what it was like to be a skeleton , what he missed about being alive , you know , just to see if he worked . ”
It worked .
In fact the idea worked so well it brought together all of Landy ’s main obsessions -- magic , martial arts , detective work , murder and mayhem .
“ Finally I had come up with an idea for a character who was a bona fide detective .
He wore a fedora and bespoke suits , and that really that allowed me to get away with the really fast dialogue that I absolutely adore , ” Landy adds .
The snarky film noir style banter between Landy ’s witty cast of heroes and villains ( much of the action of the “ Skulduggery ” books takes place in Dublin ) is one of the great joys of his series .
His evil characters are made so much more compelling because they ’ll fleece you with words before they actually attack you .
In fact Landy ’s delight in snappy word play is so obvious that some may be surprised to learn where it comes from .
“ I have a stammer .
I ’ve had it since I was about three .
I ca n’t remember it ever traumatizing me , but basically I grew up unable to spout these witticisms that were bubbling around in my head , ” he says .
“ Now finally with writing -- and with writing this style of character -- I can give vent without holding back .
Finally people can see how funny I ’ve always been . ”
Beginning with a terrific storyline and a host of dramatic events , Landy set about writing the first book in the series .
It only took him a few months .
“ To be honest I did n’t have a clue what I was doing .
The job of a writer is to look intelligent when really you have n’t a clue , ” he says .
“ In the past I would always get to about page 30 of any book I tried to write and I ’d just lose interest .
It always seemed to be at page 30 .
“ When I began to write ‘ Skulduggery Pleasant ’ I knew it was a book for younger readers .
But I did n’t know how to write it so I just wrote it . ”
Because Skulduggery Pleasant is a once in a lifetime character , Landy figured he owed it to himself and his new creation to really give the book his full attention .
Basically he packed the tale with everything he wanted to write and read about .
“ I would love to say that Skulduggery lived in my head for years .
Or that he was the result of years of hardship .
But really it was a blast , ” he says .
“ I got the idea in the summer of 2005 and I sent the completed manuscript out in the second month of 2006 .
I did n’t know what I was doing .
“ So I was completely free because I was living at home with the parents and I had no money .
I was just working part time on the family farm .
I had no other distractions .
The book was my source of entertainment for six months . ”
From his late bloomer launch to the unanticipated and wild success of the book “ Skulduggery Pleasant ” and its two sequels , “ Playing With Fire ” and “ The Faceless Ones , ” Landy feels like a Lottery winner .
Warner Bros. have already brought the rights to film the series , and it looks like he’s on the J.K.
Rowling fast track to fame and fortune .
Although many critics have compared Landy ’s work to the gold standard set by Rowling , the truth is there ’s really no contest : Landy is a much better writer .
His moral sense is certainly as keen , but his word play and his sense of fun are keener .
Also , the villains that fill the pages of his books make for real shivers , not just laughs .
There ’s no question that the series will darken as the “ Skulduggery ” books pile up ( he plans to produce nine in total ) .
“ All writers want to go darker , and I ’m not different .
I mean can you name a series that works the other way ?
It ’s certainly where I ’m headed with these , ” Landy says .
In the meantime Landy has moved out of his parents ’ house and bought his own place ( seven minutes away ) .
In a development worthy of his novels , the boy who had them all worried has turned out to be the most successful of the bunch .
In the meantime Landy ’s just enjoying the unexpected change of fortune .
“ As a writer you ’re always fully aware that this kind of success does not happen , ” says Landy .
“ If it does happen it will not happen to you .
You can keep the hope alive and you can dream about it , but my God you can not bank on it .
“ This is a story that happens to other people , a story to inspire you , and that ’s all it is .
To me it ’s been like a fairytale .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama , in an effort to stimulate the economy and support critical research , announced $ 5 billion in grants during a visit to the National Institutes of Health on Wednesday .
President Obama looks at a microscope with Dr. Marston Linehan at the National Institutes of Health on Wednesday .
The money comes from economic stimulus funds and is aimed at supporting research projects as well as the jobs related to them to fight cancer and other major diseases , Obama said in announcing the grants .
" Cancer has touched the lives of all Americans , including my own family 's , " the president said .
" We all know the terrible toll on families and the promise of treatments that will allow a mother to be there for her children as they grow up , that will make it possible for a child to reach adulthood , that will allow countless people to survive a disease that 's claimed far too many lives . "
Obama , joined by Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other top medical experts , toured a laboratory before speaking at the NIH campus in Bethesda , Maryland .
The White House says the research grants are part of the Recovery Act 's overall investment of $ 100 billion in innovative research and advancing science and technology infrastructure .

And so the guns come out blazing .
The Clearing House Association , another name for all the banks that were bailed out over the past year with the generous contributions from all of you , dear taxpayers , are now threatening with another instance of complete systemic collapse if Bloomberg 's lawsuit is allowed to proceed unchallenged , let alone if any of the " Audit The Fed " measures are actually implemented .
As a reminder , The Clearing House Association consists of ABN Amro , Bank Of America , The Bank Of New York , Deutsche Bank , HSBC , JP Morgan Chase , US Bank and Wells Fargo .
In a declaration filed in the Bloomberg Case ( 08 - CV - 9595 , Southern District of New York ) , the banks demonstrate no shame in attempting to perpetuate the status quo with regard to the Federal Reserve and demand that the wool over the eyes of the general population remain firmly planted in perpetuity .
The Clearing House submits this declaration because the Court 's Order threatens to impair the ability of our members to access emergency funds through the New York Fed 's Discount Window without suffering the severe competitive harm that public disclosure of their identity will cause .
Our members have accessed the New York Fed 's Discount Window with the understanding that the Fed will not publicly disclose information about their borrowing , especially their identity .
Industry experience , including very recent and searing experience , has shown that negative rumors about a bank 's financial condition - even completely unfounded rumors - have caused competitive harm , including bank runs and failures .
Surely transparency would facilitate rumor - mongering to an unprecedented degree .
After all rumors spread much easier when everyone knows the true financial condition of banks .
And here , in plain written Times New Roman , you see what racketeering by a major bank consortium looks like :
If the names of our member banks who borrow emergency funds are publicly disclosed , the likelihood that a borrowing bank 's customers , counterparties and other market participants will draw a negative inference is great .
Public speculation that a financial institution is experiencing liquidity shortfalls - which would be a natural inference from having tapped emergency funds - has caused bank customers to withdraw deposits , counterparties to make collateral calls and lenders to accelerate loan repayment or refuse to make new loans .
When an institution 's customers flee and its credit dries up the institution may suffer severe capital and liquidity strains leaving it in a weakened competitive position .
Pardon me if I am a broken record here , but would rumors not spread much less if there was more transparency , if investors and other financial intermediaries were fully aware of the conditions of their counterparties , if banks did not have to cover their billions in reserve losses by pretending they are viable and essentially being constant wards of the state ?
The Banks ' racketeering has gone on for far too long .
And yet , it does not stop : the conclusion from the banks ' letter :
In sum , our experience differs from the factual conclusions the Court appears to have reached about the nature of competition in the banking industry :
The competitive harm to institutions that are publicized as needing emergency funding is not " speculative , " but demonstrated by the recent multiple failures of financial institutions whenever information about their funding difficulty has been disclosed .
The disclosure does not involve mere " embarassing publicity " but information that could result in the immediate demise of an institution .
The disclosure would not merely " stigmatize [ ] " the institution or make it " look [ ] weak , " but goes to its very viability .
The disclosure of accessing emergency funding is not an " inherent risk " of market participation , but an extraordinary risk in extraordinary circumstances .
Competitors can use the disclosure to advertise or publicize that they are financial stronger because they do n't need emergency funding .
In a nutshell - the banks want their complete opacity cake and eat it too , or else , the racket goes , the transparency that will somehow promote massive rumor mongering will again destroy capitalism .
In the meantime , the Ken Lewises of the world can continue touting how stable their businesses are based on optimistic future projections , while implicitly , they continue to survive merely thanks to the cash granted them by you , taxpayers .

Recipe : candied lemon slices
*************
*************
our sleep olympian hard at work on her exhausting training regimen
the last of the harebells the local stands are still predominantly green
organic lemon
thin slices
brrrrrrrr !
talk about hot sweetness
draining off the excess sugar
chocolate - dipped and delectable
great as a garnish , but perfectly lovely on its own
Despite being insanely busy and turning down a lot of fun , exciting opportunities and events this month ( only because I ’m doing a ton of other fun , exciting things already ! ) , I promised myself that I would participate in Barbara ‘s annual LiveSTRONG : With a Taste of Yellow event .
This is important to me , not because I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 , but because I know a lot of people who had or have cancer .
I have lost beautiful friends and family to cancer .
And just last night , I learned that someone who saved my life is fighting for his own right now – fighting cancer .
Barbara holds this food and wine blogging event each year in support of The Lance Armstrong Foundation to raise cancer awareness around the world .
Last year was the first time I participated .
So if you want to participate there is still time ( Barbara has extended the submission date to September 18th ) .
Whip up something yellow – be it savory or sweet , and hop over to Barbara ’s page for instructions on how to be a part of LiveSTRONG : With a Taste of Yellow .
My submission is past the jump .
I ’m in the middle of the “ getting to know you ” period with my new camera .
I have n’t taken it out for serious shooting yet , but I have managed to screw around a bit .
Of course , the inaugural photo had to be Kaweah .
But you did n’t see the first few captures because I always shoot in RAW and my software was not compatible ( i.e. it ’s OLD ) with the latest Adobe RAW version .
After yet another upgrade ( phase 4 now complete ) , we are now cooking with gas !
I jumped from CS2 to CS4 ( sorry CS3 , never knew ya ) and I like it so far … as long as it does n’t require a desktop upgrade because we have all of $ .52 to our names now .
Our nights are flirting with frosts again and it is starting to smell like autumn .
I have apples on the brain too !
Okay , but we have just under two weeks left of summer , so let ’s not shortchange anyone .
Ever since I visited Seth Ellis Chocolatier a few weeks ago , I have had a minor obsession with candied lemon slices .
I ’ve candied orange peels out the hoohah , but only candied lemon slices twice .
The first time was by accident and the second time was a complete failure .
I tweeted with Rick ( @ricklevine ) about the recipe they use .
It takes 3 weeks !
I do n’t have 3 weeks to candy lemon slices right now .
Then Rick said I could just “ boil the * % out of some citrus for a couple of hours ” .
So that ’s what I did .
I blanched the slices in boiling water and then dumped them in ice water per the instructions on Martha ’s page .
My orange peel recipe blanches the peels three times , but I was afraid if I did that , there would be nothing left of the lemon slices except the rinds .
Once the slices were out of the ice water , I boiled a pan of sugar syrup .
Martha says 1:1 water to sugar , my orange peel recipe says 1:3 water to sugar .
I compromised with 1:2 water to sugar and let the slices simmer for an hour .
Based on prior experience , I should have let the lemons simmer for up to 2 hours .
At just over 1 hour of simmering , I think my slices tend to be more gooey and harder to handle ( because they do n’t dry completely ) .
I let the slices dry for about 24 hours on a cooling rack over a baking sheet to catch all of the sugar drips .
They look like little glass ornaments ( I was going to say they look like candy , but … they ARE candy – durrrr ) .
Tempering a batch of semi- sweet chocolate , I dipped half of the slices and left the rest plain .
These are gorgeous and delicate confections – chewy , sweet , lemony , but not bitter ( the blanching remedies that , I believe ) .
I think I love the combination of lemon and dark chocolatethan the previous reigning champion combo of orange and dark chocolate .
Definitely going into the handmade gifts arsenal .
These candied lemon slices are my contribution to Barbara ’s roundup for the LiveSTRONG : With a Taste of Yellow event .
1 - 3 organic lemons , washed
water for boiling
ice water
2 cups sugar ( you could increase this to 3 cups – I have n’t tried that with the lemons yet )
1 cup water
tempered chocolate for dipping ( optional )
Cut the lemons into thin slices ( not too thin or else they tear apart too easily ) removing seeds and the ends .
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and blanch the lemon slices for about a minute .
Drain the lemon slices and plunge them into a bath of ice water .
Drain .
Meanwhile , combine the sugar and 1 cup of water in a large saucepan and stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved .
Bring to a simmer and add the lemon slices .
Let simmer ( do n’t boil ) for an hour ( you can simmer as much as 2 hours ) .
Remove slices from hot sugar syrup and set on a cooling rack over a baking sheet to dry .
Could take up to 24 hours to dry .
Dip in tempered dark chocolate and set on parchment paper until chocolate has cooled and firmed up .
MANCIANO , Italy  Commemorating the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II , Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday recalled the “ tragedy of the Holocaust ” and the deaths of “ tens of millions ” in the conflict .
Speaking at an outdoor Mass on Sunday in Viterbo , north of Rome , Benedict said : “ We cannot forget the major events that took place during one of the most terrible conflicts in history , that left tens of millions dead and provoked so much suffering for our beloved Polish people , ” he said .
“ It was conflict that saw the tragedy of the Holocaust and the extermination of so many other innocents . ”
Just days after Poland held ceremonies marking the German invasion across its border that started the war , Benedict singled out the war ’s Polish victims , but he did not specifically mention the Jewish victims other than to broadly refer to the Holocaust .
Benedict , an 83 - year - old German , witnessed the Second World War firsthand , describing himself as an unwilling enlistee in the Hitler Youth and later the army .
He has decried totalitarianism and anti-Semitism many times over the years .
But as pope he has been criticized by Jewish groups as being insensitive at times .
__ 1991 : __Linus Torvalds , a 21 - year - old university student from Finland , writes a post to a user group asking for feedback on a little project he 's working on .
He 's built a simple kernel for a Unix - like operating system that runs on an Intel 386 processor , and he wants to develop it further .
The kernel eventually becomes Linux , which is released in 1994 and distributed over the internet for free .
Thousands of contributors began refining the Linux kernel and the operating system built on top of it .
Linux went on to become , arguably , the biggest success story of the free - software movement , proving that the work of thousands of volunteers can create a piece of free software as powerful as one sold by any corporation .
In the early 1980s , the Unix operating system was already in widespread use throughout academia and businesses for both servers and workstations .
It was being rapidly developed and deployed .
Unix code could be made to run on hundreds of different types of computer hardware .
This high level of portability was integral to its popularity .
But as it grew more complex , Unix ( and its many Unix - like cousins ) became increasingly saddled by licensing fees .
Demand began to rise for a free operating system , something as powerful and flexible as Unix , that could be distributed and modified openly and freely without the encumbrance of commercial licenses .
To that end , Richard Stallman , a programmer at MIT , founded the GNU Project in 1984 .
Stallman and his collaborators began assembling the various pieces of a free operating system that would be compatible with Unix , strictly adhering to the idea that software should be not only be freely available , but also give its users the ability to freely experiment with its inner workings .
A few years later , the GNU team ( the name is a recursive acronym for " GNU 's Not Unix " ) had created several of the building blocks of an OS , but a few of the key components , including a kernel — the master control program essential to an operating system — remained incomplete .
The project was stalled .
In 1991 , Linus Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki .
He had written some software that would enable his new workstation , a PC powered by a 386 processor , to access the university 's Unix servers .
Torvalds ' simple terminal emulator was based on Minix , a Unix - like operating system that worked on many different computer hardware platforms and was widely used in academia as a teaching tool .
Torvalds kept tinkering , and before long he had created a working operating system kernel .
Torvalds had borrowed none of Minix 's code , but he had adopted much of its architecture , including its file system .
So , he enlisted hackers from the Minix community to help him flesh out his project .
On August 25 , 1991 , Torvalds posted a note to the comp.os. minix
Usenet group titled , " What would you like to see most in minix ? " :
Hello everybody out there using minix — I 'm doing a ( free ) operating system ( just a hobby , wo n't be big and professional like gnu ) for 386 ( 486 ) AT clones .
This has been brewing since april , and is starting to get ready .
I 'd like any feedback on things people like / dislike in minix , as my OS resembles it somewhat ( same physical layout of the file - system ( due to practical reasons ) among other things ) .
I 've currently ported bash ( 1.08 ) and gcc( 1.40 ) , and things seem to work .
This implies that I 'll get something practical within a few months , and I 'd like to know what features most people would want .
Any suggestions are welcome , but I wo n't promise I 'll implement them :-) .
Linus ( torvalds@klaava.helsinki.fi ) PS .
Yes — it 's free of any minix code , and it has a multi - threaded fs .
It is NOT protable ( uses 386 task switching etc ) , and it probably never will support anything other than AT - harddisks , as that 's all I have :-(.
In a follow - up post , Torvalds asserted that his operating system " probably wo n't be able to do much more than minix , and much less in some respects , " and that it would be free " probably under gnu- license or similar . "
Unlike his initial announcement , Torvalds ' follow - up post contained no emoticons .
From these humble beginnings , a full operating system kernel would emerge .
The first version was called Freax , a name chosen by Torvalds because it incorporated elements of " free " and " freak " — the " x " at the end is a common attribute of the names of many Unix - like systems .
But when the source code files were posted to the FTP servers at the Helsinki University of Technology , the sysop renamed the kernel " Linux " in honor of its creator .
The first version of Linux , released in late 1991 , was published with its own license .
But since several pieces of GNU software were required to run the Linux kernel , Torvalds eventually relented and published Linux version 0.99 under the GNU Public License in December 1992 .
The change made Linux fully compatible with the rest of GNU 's software , and the GNU Project began integrating the kernel — the project 's biggest missing link — into its free operating system .
Linux 1.0 , the first fully - baked version of the GNU Project 's operating system , was released in March of 1994 .
It was quickly ported to multiple platforms and was updated to include support for multiprocessor installations .
By the late 1990s , Linux had grown into a major force in the server space , ending Unix 's dominance within corporations and becoming the biggest threat to Microsoft 's commercial - server - software business .
The Linux Foundation , a nonprofit group chartered with the task of promoting Linux and fostering its development , estimates the Linux ecosystem will reach the $ 50 billion mark by 2011 , as the software continues to make inroads on PC desktops , netbooks , servers , mobile phones and embedded devices like TV set - top boxes , GPS units , and media players .
Now , the Linux kernel is kept up to date by thousands of programmers from around the world .
Most of them are volunteer contributors or work under the sponsorship of corporations like IBM , HP and Intel .
Torvalds himself is now sponsored by the Linux Foundation and continues to work on the Linux kernel full - time .
In other words , it 's no longer " just a hobby . "

“ I can make a firm pledge …. no family making less than $ 250,000 will see any form of tax increase ….. not any of your taxes ” – Barack Obama , September 12 , 2008
Once again , President Obama has lied to the country .
After raising cigarette taxes earlier this year , Obama just ordered another tax increase .
This time , he raised every American ’s taxes without a vote of Congress and with the simple stroke of a pen .
Obama increased taxes on Chinese - made tires .
In one of his first major decisions on trade policy , President Obama opted Friday to impose a tariff on tires from China , a move that fulfills his campaign promise to “ crack down ” on imports that unfairly undermine American workers but risks angering the nation ’s second - largest trading partner .
The decision is intended to bolster the ailing U.S. tire industry , in which more than 5,000 jobs have been lost over the past five years as the volume of Chinese tires in the market has tripled .
It comes at a sensitive time , however .
Leaders from the world ’s largest economies are preparing to gather in Pittsburgh in less than two weeks to discuss more cooperation amid tensions over trade .
The tire tariff will amount to 35 percent the first year , 30 percent the second and 25 percent the third .
Which means American consumers will see an increase in prices of at least 35 % for their tires in the name of saving 5,000 jobs .
Chinese and US companies with factories overseas are not going to pay the tariffs , they ’ll pass them on to consumers .
There is also the latest example of the Obama administration diplomatic ineptness of angering trade partners before major trade talks with China among other countries .
Also , there was not much public debate over this , since this decision was reached behind closed doors with the help of an obscure Federal trade panel with no citizen input .
Of course with the Obama administration , there ’s always someone or some group to be paid back .
Although a federal trade panel had recommended higher levies — of 55 , 45 and 35 percent , respectively — the decision is considered a victory for the United Steelworkers union , which filed the trade complaint .
The United Steelworkers union endorsed Obama ’s presidential bid and the Steelworkers had a massive grassroots effort that claimed credit for helping win Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Virginia ; among other states .
“ Hope and Change ” indeed .

East Timor , which had been a Portugese colony , was already an independent country , as a result of the pro-independence political party Fretilin declaring East Timor independent on November 28 , 1975 .
But barely days after the independence proclamation , on December 7 , 1975 , the Suharto dictatorship in Indonesia used all its military firepower to invade Timor Leste .
September 30 , 2009 -- Dili --
What is commemorated as Timor Leste ’s ( East Timor ) “ liberation ” is the United Nations - facilitated referendum on August 30 , 1999 .
The invasion was brutal and the occupation lasted 24 years before the UN referendum in 1999 .
During the occupation , the Indonesian military tortured and slaughtered our people .
Such terrible acts became an everyday spectacle in Timor Leste .
During these most difficult times , a popular - based movement to win back independence became well - organised and strong .
This people ’s resistance movement was based on several pillars : the forces carrying out an armed struggle , an underground clandestine movement and a diplomatic wing .
These three pillars were united under one umbrella of people ’s resistance .
This umbrella took several forms , from the Revolutionary Council of National Resistance ( CRRN ) , National Council of Maubere Resistance ( CNRM ) , until finally at the time of the referendum in 1999 , the National Council for Timorese Resistance ( CNRT ) .
The continuing resistance forced the hand of the international community to intervene in Timor Leste .
During the 1970s and 1980s , the Timorese people fought almost alone against the Indonesian regime .
Most governments were silent about the torture and killings in Timor Leste .
The United States , Britain and our own closest neighbour , Australia , placed more importance on their relationship with the Suharto dictatorship than Timorese lives .
Documents and eyewitnesses prove these countries supported and aided the invasion and occupation of our country .
However , ordinary people in many countries were active in solidarity movements with Timor Leste , including Australia .
In the 1990s , groups formed in Indonesia , such as Indonesian People ’s Solidarity with the Maubere People ( SPRIM ) , linked to the People ’s Democratic Party ( PRD ) , Solidamor and Fortilos .
There was also media exposure through groups such as British human rights group Tapol , US - based East Timor Action Network and Amnesty International .
The support of these groups helped the self - determination movement to gain strength at the international level .
However , when we voted to separate from Indonesia in the 1999 referendum , the Indonesian military and allied militias went on a rampage and destroyed almost 90 % of our infrastructure .
The reconstruction of Timor Leste began when the UN formed its peacekeeping mission , UNTAET .
Several countries , which had directly or indirectly supported Indonesian occupation , suddenly became “ friends ” in the reconstruction process .
Was this change in attitude genuine ?
If only the answer was yes .
It seems many neighbouring countries are motivated by their own economic interests .
Nothing is given away for free in this capitalist system .
Reconstruction
The political struggle against Indonesia was victorious .
However , the issues of justice and bringing to account the Indonesian criminal generals are still unresolved .
But the new Timorese elites , such as Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao , would prefer to forget the past and enjoy close relations with the Indonesian government , including with those responsible for great crimes .
President Jose Ramos Horta , in his “ Liberation Day ” address this year , said there would be no international tribunal to bring those responsible for crimes in Timor Leste to justice — a balm to soothe any worried Indonesian general .
Ten years after the referendum , the issue of justice is still unresolved .
After the UN referendum , the UN formed UNTAET as the transitional government in Timor Leste .
The whole system was controlled from New York .
UNTAET head , Sergio Vieira de Mello , had absolute authority in Timor Leste .
Decision making and reconstruction rested in UNTAET ’s hands .
Participation by ordinary Timorese people in the development process became well nigh impossible .
We need to understand this in order to understand why the development process has experienced problems .
The problems we see today are related to the “ quick fix ” foundation put in place by UNTAET .
The first elections in 2000 for a constituent assembly were won by Fretilin .
The assembly drafted a constitution and became the country ’s national parliament .
Mari Alkatiri , as Fretilin chairperson , became prime minister .
In direct presidential elections in April 2002 , the people voted for our first president , Xanana Gusmao .
On May 20 , 2002 , the UN handed over sovereignty to the Timorese government amid much fanfare .
Political violence
In this first period after independence , there were some incidents , such as the violence on December 4 , 2002 , when Alkatiri ’s house and several public buildings were burned down .
Strangely , until now we do n’t know who was behind these incidents , although they occured when the UN police were still in charge of security .
It is difficult to end political conflict among the elites in Timor Leste .
Conflict was worsened by the UN mission indirectly favouring certain political forces .
The UN mission led by Sugehiro Hasegawa was complicit in the politically motivated violence in 2006 , which led to the fall of the Fretilin government .
The violence arose from a conflict within the armed forces over allegations of discrimination against soldiers from the western region of Timor Leste .
Major Alfredo Reinado led a walkout of hundreds of soldiers .
A demonstration of soldiers with grievances was fired upon by the police .
This led to a long period of conflict in Timor Leste , which was particularly intense in May - June 2006 , and the return of Australian troops to “ restore order ” .
The Timorese elite must bear responsibility for this political conflict , however the UN mission also needs to be mentioned here for its lack of action .
Ten years after the referendum , the people continue to be the victims of political conflict .
People were displaced after their houses were burned down .
Conditions in the displaced camps were very difficult in terms of food , clean water , sanitation and so on .
Was this the kind of independence we fought for ?
In 2006 , the state failed to provide security and comfort for its population .
Where is the social justice we hoped for after independence ?
There is no accountability by any of the political leaders for the violence that occurred .
This sets a bad precedent for a country that claims to base itself on democracy and the rule of law .
After the Fretilin government fell in 2006 , elections were held and Fretilin lost its parliamentary majority .
A new coalition of parliamentary parties , minus Fretilin , was formed under the prime ministership of Gusmao .
The refugee crisis began to be tackled , in stages .
The security situation began to improve .
The crisis in the police , an institution that came close to collapse in 2006 , dissipated .
Post - 2006 , maintaining “ security ” became a strong weapon for the government to mute conflict and dissent .
“ Security ” was the stick , but stability was also bought by distributing money — the carrot .
Long - term peace and wellbeing remain a distant hope .
Natural and human resources
Timor Leste has vast natural resources , primarily concentrated in the Timor Sea .
In the Joint Petroleum Development Area ( JPDA ) , there are a number of oil fields already in production .
The Bayu Undan oil field is being exploited with the Australian government , with 90 % of the proceeds for Timor Leste and 10 % for Australia .
However , the pipeline from the field goes to Darwin — ensuring , in this way , that Australian companies still make more profit .
Other oil fields have already been exhausted , such as Elang Kakatua and Kakatua Norte .
Timor Leste ’s main source of revenue is Bayu Undan ’s oil , reaching an overall total of US $ 5 billion this year .
The oil field is expected to last until 2024 .
As a result , Timor Leste no longer needs to depend on international donors .
The Timorese government has also signed an agreement with Australia on the exploitation of the largest oil field in the Timor Sea , Greater Sunrise .
The negotiations are currently over the direction of the pipeline .
In this field , the main operator is the Australian company , Woodside .
Proceeds are to be divided 50/50 between Timor Leste and Australia .
The Timorese government has also contracted out several oil and gas fields in its exclusive area to Italian company ENI and Reliance from India , both in the exploratory stage .
The government has also started a feasibility study about the possibility of the pipeline from Greater Sunrise coming to Timor Leste .
However , Timorese people continue to miss out on education and work opportunities .
Skills transfer to Timorese people , much touted by UNTAET , did not really take place .
The Gusmao government continues to rely on a large number of foreigners .
The finance department has up to 60 international staff on high wages , working as advisors .
From the very beginning , the Timorese government should have prioritised investment in the education sector from the oil proceeds .
The Fretilin - led government did make this a priority in its development program , but the education department was unable to implement it .
In spite of its weaknesses , the education department under Fretilin did make some important breakthroughs by working across departments .
It was at the forefront of implementing programs such as the cooperation on eduction and health with Cuba .
Cuban support
There are now 700 Timorese students studying medicine in Cuba .
Cuba ’s provision of medical training for Timorese students is an example of pure solidarity — cooperation without hoping for anything in return .
The Timorese government is beginning to provide scholarships for Timorese students to study overseas , in limited numbers .
A most important use of Timor ’s oil revenue is to develop its people .
Only by having healthy , educated people can we have the capacity to manage the country .
These were important objectives in Timor Leste ’s struggle for self - determination .
Economic justice for our 1 million people is still out of reach .
The United Nations Development Program lists Timor Leste as still the poorest country in Asia .
Why is it that the people are still very poor in a small country that is well endowed in oil and gas with large reserves stored away in a petroleum fund ?
Since the UNTAET period , experts from various countries came to give development advice .
The development process has entailed slavishly following economic formulas that do n’t prioritise the people .
Physical infrastructure such as roads into villages for farmers to transport their produce have not been prioritised .
Agricultural infrastructure suffered from poor planning and remains directionless .
The government is distributing tractors to farmers to increase yields , but without preparing farmers to make the transition to this kind of technology .
International advisors , alongside local technocrats , are looking at the possibilities of large - scale infrastructure construction projects , involving the construction of megaprojects , such as airport , ports and electrical generators .
But do these constitute basic needs for our people right now ?
Why not involve the majority of the people in determining their development needs , rather than elite - level policies where the process is dominated by a handful of people unfamiliar with the real situation of Timorese people ?
Timor Leste needs to come up with its own development plan .
Neoliberal formulas need to be rejected .
Formulas from overseas should be used as a reference , not slavishly followed .
The government and parliament need to begin to discuss with the people plans for development .
If not , we will just be subjected to neocolonialism — economic and political oppression .
If the neocolonial agenda holds sway in Timor Leste , our struggle for independence and self - determination will have been for nothing .
Ten years after the UN - supervised referendum , Timor Leste has not achieved full independence .
Neocolonial agendas have been implemented through United Nations missions and donor institutions , which continue to try to push back our struggle for full independence .
The people have not become self - sufficient , but instead are being marginalised by the development process itself .
All economic , social and political policies are dominated by the pro-neoliberal elites , supported by pro-neoliberal governments in other countries .
Are the people expected to sit by in poverty ?
Should the people be patient in their poverty ?
The Suharto regime fell in 1998 because the Indonesian people lost their patience .
These are some of the lessons we need to reflect on .
Leave behind the economic formulas from neoliberal “ advisors ” .
Start to think about our own priorities for Timor Leste itself .
A Luta Continua !
The struggle continues .

Wednesday nights jackpot stands at s2.4 million , but C4 bosses have banned Brown from buying a ticket .
Last night he told the Mirror : I realise there are a lot of questions this brings up and I hope they will be answered on the Friday night follow - up show .
For now ,
Im really excited and really nervous .
If Brown succeeds in revealing the correct numbers in advance of the draw , it has huge implications for the future of the Lottery .
But yesterday Camelot said it was relaxed about the stunt .
A statement said : Seventy per cent of the adult population will be trying to predict the six lucky numbers for Wednesday nights Lotto draw .
It is impossible to affect the outcome of the draw and Derren Brown is not suggesting he is doing this .
He is an illusionist creating an illusion that he can predict the numbers .
We wish Derren the best of luck .
Aug. 5 , 2009  -- Vicki , a 53 - year - old former rock promoter married to a stand - up comic , started smoking weed when she was just 13 .
" I had an older brother who was already getting high , hanging out with his friends and they invited me , " said the New York City mother of two teenagers .
" Unlike most people , I got high the first time and fell in love . "
" I was a daily smoker , 24/7 for over 30 years , " said Vicki , who did not want to share her last name .
" The only time I stopped was when I was pregnant .
Otherwise , I was high all my adult life . "
Then nine years ago , after standing on a radiator and hanging out a window to hide the smell of pot from her visiting father , she finally realized she was " an addict . "
But quitting was harder than she had ever imagined .
Even though Vicki rarely got the high anymore , she experienced withdrawal -- " complete sleeplessness , " as well as anxiety , dry mouth , sweats and the shakes .
Since the 1970s , when marijuana was the symbol of political protest , the risks of marijuana dependency have been clouded by the legalization debate and long - held beliefs that the illicit drug is harmless .
But new thinking on old scientific research has now prompted the American Psychiatric Association to consider including " cannabis withdrawal syndrome " in its next Diagnostic and Standards Manual for Mental Disorders , due to be revised in 2012 .
News Echoes 1936 Film ' Reefer Madness '
Those who have enjoyed pot for years with no ill effect , say it echoes the cult film , " Reefer Madness " that was made in 1936 when the drug was first demonized and made illegal .
In the film , high school students are depicted being lured by pushers to smoke the drug and a deadly hit - and - run accident , suicide and rape ensue .
Others , just think the new debate is a " gross exaggeration , triggered by fears surrounding the movement to legalize marijuana .
" Some research has shown that people who are heavy , regular users actually do have a physical addiction , " said Herbert Nieberg , a forensic psychologist and professor at Mitchell College in Connecticut .
" There are very few cases and not more , " he told ABCNews.com .
" Alcohol , opiates , ocycontin and vicodin , those are the biggies . "
Studies dating back to 1984 have documented a clinical syndrome characterized by " restlessness , anorexia , irritability and insomnia " that begins within 24 hours of discontinuation and can last for up to 10 days .
Today , there are no FDA - approved drugs to counteract withdrawal symptoms , although the synthetic cancer drug Marinol shows some promise .
Though withdrawal is not life - threatening , as it can be with opiates and alcohol , patients can experience high levels of anxiety , depression , become aggressive and even report referred pain , especially if they have been using marijuana to self - medicate .
" For me , the biggest withdrawal was emotional , " Vicki told ABCNews.com .
" I went into a total depression and severe mood swings that took a very long time to get over . "
For Vicki , who confessed her long - time marijuana use to her father , it took 18 months to come clean with the support of Marijuana Anonymous .
Marijuana Dependency : Shame and Guilt
" I was 45 years old and lying to my daddy , " she said .
" The shame was worse than the pleasure .
I was devoted to my kids , but I was the mommy in the sandbox with the sunglasses .
I was leading a double life and there was constant guilt and shame . "
The reclassification of marijuana is important , according to the APA because its omission as an addictive substance then professionals might not see treatment regimens for dependence as necessary .
" They are right on about that , " said Tom , a Long Beach , Calif. , graphic designer who has been clean for 18 years , thanks to Marijuana Anonymous .
" I was amazed at the depth of my addiction and how pervasive it was in my life , " said Tom , now 53 , who smoked for 19 years .
" If I started up again , I could n't put it down .
It 's just like alcoholics .
It does n't matter what substance it is , it 's the same disease . "
About 40 percent of all Americans aged 12 and older -- about 94 million -- have tried marijuana at least once , according to a 2003 survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) .
Of those , about 3.6 million were daily users .
As the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States , marijuana produces dependence and relapse rates comparable to other drugs some researchers believe .
About 9 percent of all those who used marijuana became dependent , compared to rates of 32 percent for tobacco , 23 percent for opiates and 15 percent for alcohol , according to the 1994 National Comorbidity Survey .
For daily smokers , that dependency rate soars to between 33 and 50 percent , say more recent studies .
The drug 's popularity reached its height in the 1970s among baby boomers -- about 40 percent of all high school seniors , compared with 20 percent today -- said they had smoked marijuana in the previous month , according to NIDA .
The active ingredient in marijuana that causes the " high " is tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC .
Orally , THC is used to treat nausea in cancer treatment and to stimulate appetite in AIDS patients .
Cannabis Potency Stronger Than Before
Today 's marijuana has far more THC than decades ago .
The average potency has gone up from about 3.4 percent THC in 1982 to approximately 10 percent in 2008 , according to NIDA .
With stronger pot , emergency rooms have reported more associated accidents .
Just this week , seven people were killed when the driver -- drove the wrong way on a New York highway and collided head on with a pickup truck .
Although the drivers family has disputed the results , toxicology tests showed high levels of alcohol and marijuana .
" The marijuana that is now out has been cross - bred like people breed flowers so what you have now is different from what you had 20 to 30 years ago , " said John Massella , regional program director for the Pittsburgh - based Gateway rehabilitation center , which treats 10,000 to 12,000 patients a year .
" They develop a tolerance and need more to get the desired effect , " he told ABCNews.com .
Gateway has seen an increase in number of marijuana dependency cases , mostly adults who do not come of their own volition .
Many have been referred by family or have had trouble with the law or have tested positive in an employment - related urine test .
Younger Pot Smokers More Vulnerable
The younger a person begins smoking -- especially at today 's higher potency levels -- when the brain is still developing , the greater the risk of dependence .
" The progression is more aggressive , " he said .
The biggest hurdle in treating these patients is that marijuana " still has a positive spin to it , " he said .
" People do n't believe it 's a problem . "
" Plenty believe that they can't get addicted or hold on to the idea that it 's only psychologically addictive and ' I can think my way out of it , ' " said Massella .
" But once you develop a dependency , there is always a dependency . "
Such was the case with Alex , a 55 - year - old Los Angeles lawyer whose life fell apart after a 39 - year dependency .
" My life crashed around it , " said Alex , who did not want to use his real name .
" Early on , I used it to escape and have fun , but it turned into a self - medication sort of thing .
Ultimately , I was using it morning , noon and night . "
Hitting Bottom After Three Decades on Weed
He became sober 12 years ago after hitting bottom :
His career had fallen apart , a relationship failed and he got a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder .
" I had a lot of inattention , lack of focus and difficulty completing projects .
Early on the marijuana helped , but then I used it more and more . "
" I have a lower bottom than a lot of people , " said Alex , whose parents encouraged him to seek help .
He spent 11 months in rehab and joined Marijuana Anonymous .
" I had my car repossessed , I was thrown from my home and I was living on a guy 's sofa and I was no longer able to practice law . "
" Whether it 's a physical addiction or not , I was behaving like an addict , " he told ABCNews.com .
" It 's a complex issue , " said Paul L. Doering , a professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Florida .
" Many can smoke once or twice a week and not have any problems . "
According to the American Psychiatric Association , a person is considered dependent if he or she meets three of seven criteria .
Only two of those criteria are associated with physiological symptoms like tolerance and physical withdrawal .
All addictive drugs have a " common signature , " according to NIDA director Nora D. Volkow .
" They increase dopamine levels in the brain 's pleasure center and produce repetitive behavior .
Marijuana appears do both , though at intermediate levels compared to other drugs .
Higher Doses of Cannabis to Get Same Effect
" Social variables play an important role in humans -- we are not lab animals , " she ABCNews.com .
" We live in a complex social network system .
Nicotine and alcohol produce lower increases in dopamine , but greater levels of addiction in society because they are legal and widely available . "
Why some like Vicki and Alex become dependent and others can smoke socially , is still a mystery .
" There is tremendous variability and vulnerability , " Volkow said .
" It 's like the H1N1 flu .
Some people do n't even get the symptoms and others die .
It 's the same thing with drugs . "
" There is a tendency to try to minimize the risks associated with drugs , " she said .
" The one that is targeted the most in marijuana .
For some , the willingness to experiment may be affected by how dangerous their perception of the drug is . "
Addiction experts agree that marijuana 's dangers pale in comparison to harder drugs .
But distorting its risks may encourage more young people to experiment with a drug that can cause dependency .
" Marijuana has a fascinating history in part because of the hyperbole and exaggeration to either scare people so they do n't use it or to justify more liberal laws , " said Roger A. Roffman , a professor of social work at University of Washington , who for 20 years has studied marijuana dependency counseling .
" The misrepresentations and half - truths and outright lies are really incredible . "
Hard to Lick Because of Societal Views
Though Roffman favors decriminalization , he struggles to help those who are dependent on marijuana , largely because societal views lead them to " wonder if they are over - exaggerating the harm to themselves . "
About 15 percent to 20 percent of those being treated for dependency in cognitive behavioral therapy or 12 - step programs are able to quit and some are able to cut back , more than half " do n't do very well , " according to Roffman .
" There 's not that high a success rate . "
He argues that the reform movement makes a " tragic mistake " to convince the public that marijuana is relatively harmless .
" They are not being accurate scientists and it can make a difference for those making choices about smoking , " said Roffman , especially young people who are the greatest risk for " derailing " their lives .
Meanwhile , Vicki said her own children , now 11 and 15 , have seen first - hand the risks of marijuana dependency .
" They are very much a part of my recovery and they come to meetings .
But , thank God , they do n't remember me high at all . "

Long Division on “ Mad Men ” September 16 , 2009
New York , N.Y .
I do n't often identify with characters in novels , movies , or television programs , but when I do , it 's probably not who you 'd expect .
Recently I 've found myself feeling some affinity with Sally Draper on Mad Men .
It might seem odd for me to " identify " with an 8 - year old girl , but when you consider that the year is 1963 , it makes a little more sense : Sally Draper is approximately my age .
In recent episodes I 've become more interested in how Sally views the world of 1963 , and more importantly , how the 1963 world views her .
Some younger fans of Mad Men may have been surprised when Sally Draper was n't allowed to attend her grandfather 's funeral , particularly considering how close they had become in the weeks before he suddenly died .
It 's even possible Sally did n't know that the funeral was taking place , or even that there was such a thing as a funeral .
I suspect this was a common practice with children in that era .
When I was six weeks shy of my 8th birthday , I did n't attend my father 's funeral , and I 'm pretty sure I was n't given any choice in the matter , or even that I knew that it was happening .
As far as I 've been able to determine , Mad Men is impeccably researched .
Whenever something has appeared in the program that I 've questioned , I 've later discovered that they got it right .
( For example , Jackie Kennedy 's famous TV tour of the White House really was broadcast on Valentine 's Day . )
But in last Sunday 's episode , Don and Betty Draper are having a little talk in a classroom with Sally 's teacher , and I was startled to see on the blackboard several rather gory exercises in long division — but not the way I learned long division !
The long division shown on the blackboard in Mad Men looked like this ( except adorned with several downward pointing arrows ) :
This is called — I did n't know these terms until I did a little Internet research this week — the Column Division method .
For each digit of the quotient you need to mentally find the largest number that when multiplied by the divisor wo n't exceed the remaining dividend .
In a public school in New Jersey I learned a technique of long division called the Partial Quotients method :
Each of the numbers to the right of the vertical line is multiplied by the divisor and then subtracted from the remaining dividend .
The advantage of Partial Quotients is that you do n't have to nail each digit exactly .
You can build up to it because you 're accumulating a list of numbers that sum to the total quotient .
I remember my mother attending a parent - teacher evening where my teacher demonstrated this method to the parents as the latest and greatest way for kids to do long division .
I know this because she later asked me about it , and then showed me the way she learned long division , and since that time I guess I assumed that the method I learned was ubiquitous in the early 60s — at least in schools in the northeast .
But I 'm probably wrong about that .
I suspect that different schools and different teachers taught long division differently , and it appears as if the Partial Quotients method is still sometimes taught , although I hope that Column Division is then introduced as an alternative , and Short Division as an option when the divisor is small .
( Obviously , the more of the division process that is moved to the brain , the smarter the student becomes . )
Still , I think Matthew Weiner missed an opportunity here : A blackboard full of exercises in Partial Quotient long division might have seemed more unusual and " exotic " — and emphasized once again just how long ago 1963 really was .
US credit card companies jack up rates
By Andre Damon
2 July 2009
Credit card companies have in recent months sharply raised the rates they charge customers , as credit card defaults have risen to record levels .
Citigroup , the recipient of a $ 25 billion government bailout , has increased rates for millions of credit card customers by around one fourth .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the largest issuer of credit cards , also said it would raise its minimum payment rate from 2 to 5 percent for customers behind on payments .
The hikes come amid news that default rates for personal credit cards have hit record high levels .
Fitch Ratings reported Tuesday that defaults on credit cards hit a record 10.4 percent last month amid rising unemployment , falling home values and reduced wages .
Total losses on loans that credit card companies have given up on collecting have risen more than 62 percent from a year ago , according to the credit - rating agency .
On Tuesday , the Financial Times reported that Citi raised interest rates on 15 million cards co-branded with companies like Sears and Macy’s .
Cardholders who did not pay off their entire balance saw their credit card rates increase by an average of 24 percent , according to research by Credit Suisse cited by the FT .
Meanwhile , JPMorgan
Chase said that it would raise its balance transfer fees 3 percentage points , to 5 percent .
It also announced plans to raise minimum payments for customers behind on their payments to 5 percent , up from 3 percent .
The rate increase , scheduled for August , will come with additional fees for those borrowers who fail to make the minimum payment .
“ I got a Citi credit card in college because they were offering zero percent interest rates for a year .
They made it seem like you could just get credit for free , ” one University of Delaware graduate told the WSWS .
“ Now , I ’m out of college and have to pay my credit cards in addition to student loans .
I ’ve cancelled repayments on my student loans for a year just so I can pay the credit cards .
Citi is charging something like 13 percent , and if I ’m late on any payments the rate will be even higher . ”
From the standpoint of the banks , the seemingly absurd and self - destructive practice of raising interest rates for people already behind on their payments only makes sense in the long term .
These banks are ultimately betting that borrowers who are behind on their payments now will never pay back their principal amid falling wages and persistent unemployment .
The banks are moving to extract the most in interest and fees that they can get away with , even at the consequence of their borrowers ’ eventual default and bankruptcy .
Commentators noted that credit card issuers are raising rates preemptively to offset new federal regulations that would make it more difficult to raise credit rates for existing customers .
The Obama administration ’s Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act , signed into law in May and with some provisions taking effect next month , prohibits credit card companies from raising rates for existing customers unless they are at least two months behind on payments .
( See “ The credit card crisis and the false promise of the Obama administration ” )
The window between the law ’s signing and its adoption can only be seen as a deliberate loophole to allow credit card companies to raise rates to their preferred levels .
New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer on Tuesday made a show of denouncing the act ’s ineffectiveness , noting that the present outcome was entirely predictable .
“ This is what many of us feared about a law that did n’t take effect right away , ” he said .
“ Issuers are using the delay in the effective date to wring more dollars out of their customers , ” Schumer added .
Citigroup ’s announcement on rate hikes comes a week after it said it would increase the salaries of its top executives by as much as 50 percent .
( See “ Record bonuses at bailed - out US banks ” )
Only a few days later , Forbes noted that Citi has already put aside $ 3 million as signing bonuses for two unnamed former Morgan Stanley executives , and likely had even bigger bonuses in the works for other new executives .
Citigroup received $ 25 billion in government aid during the height of the financial crisis , and in February the company announced that this stake would be converted into stock , making the US government in effect the company ’s largest shareholder .
Unlike banks such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America , Citi has yet to pay back its nominal obligations to the government .
This has not , however , prevented it from raising compensation for its executives .
The Obama administration has explicitly opposed all limits on executive pay , even for banks in which the US government is the largest shareholder .
The government ’s entire policy has been aimed at inflating the profit margins of the banking system , at the direct expense of working people .
Even when the banks pursue policies — such as raising credit card rates — that hinder an overall economic recovery , the government has defended the most reckless short - term interests of Wall Street .
HOUSTON 
The natural gas industry has enjoyed something of a winning streak in recent years .
It found gigantic new reserves , low prices are encouraging utilities to substitute gas for coal , and cities are switching to buses fueled by natural gas .
But its luck has run out in Washington , where the industry is having trouble making its case to Congress as it writes an energy bill to tackle global warming .
For all its pronouncements that gas could be used to replace aging , inefficient coal - fired power plants  and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process  lawmakers from coal - producing states appear committed to keeping coal as the nation ’s primary producer of power .
Those influential lawmakers , from both parties , say that new technologies under development to capture and bury emissions of coal are a better bet than gas for long - term solutions to climate change .

The is_file / is_dir dilemma
Known from Apache´s .htaccess :
Hint : see url .rewrite - if - not - file for the !-f part
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.* ) $ index.php?q=$ 1 [ L , QSA ]
As lighttpd doesn´t provide this is_file / is_dir check out of the box , again mod_magnet comes into play .
I took the example for drupal from darix site ( http://nordisch.org/2007/2/6/drupal-on-lighttpd-with-clean-urls):
Lets assume drupal is already installed under http://example.com/drupal/
you now add the magnet part to it .
$ HTTP [ " url " ] =~ " ^/ drupal " { # we only need index . php here .
index-file.names = ( " index.php " ) # for clean urls magnet .
attract - physical - path - to = ( " /etc/lighttpd/drupal.lua " ) }
The drupal.lua :
-- little helper function function file_exists ( path ) local attr = lighty . stat ( path ) if ( attr ) then return true else return false end end function removePrefix ( str , prefix ) return str:sub ( 1 , #prefix +1 ) == prefix .. " / " and str:sub ( #prefix +2 ) end -- prefix without the trailing slash local prefix = ' / drupal ' -- the magic ;) if ( not file_exists ( lighty.env [ " physical.path " ] ) ) then -- file still missing .
pass it to the fastcgi backend request_uri = removePrefix ( lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] , prefix ) if request_uri then lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] = prefix .. " /index.php " local uriquery = lighty.env [ " uri.query " ] or " " lighty.env [ " uri.query " ] = uriquery .. ( uriquery ~= " " and " & " or " " ) .. " q= " .. request_uri lighty.env[ " physical.rel - path " ] = lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] lighty.env [ " request.orig-uri " ] = lighty.env[" request.uri " ] lighty.env[ " physical.path " ] = lighty.env[" physical.doc-root " ] .. lighty.env[ " physical.rel - path " ] end end -- fallthrough will put it back into the lighty request loop -- that means we get the 304 handling for free . ;)
Overwrite default mime - type / content - type
Add " magnet.attract-physical - path - to = ( " / path-to/change-ctype.lua " ) " to lighttpd.conf and save the following as " change-ctype.lua "
if ( string.match(lighty.env[" physical.rel - path " ] , " .swf " ) ) then lighty .
header [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / html "
Sending text - files as HTML
This is a bit simplistic , but it illustrates the idea :
Take a text - file and cover it in a " < pre > " tag .
Config-file
magnet.attract-physical - path - to = ( server.docroot + " / readme.lua " )
readme.lua
lighty .content = { " < pre > " , { filename = " / README " } , " < / pre > " } lighty .
header [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / html " return 200
Simple maintenance script
You need three files , maint.up , maint.down and maint.html .
maint.html holds a simple html - page of what you want to display to your users while in maintenance - mode .
Add " magnet.attract-physical - path - to = ( " / path -to - your /maint.lua " ) " to your lighttpd .conf , best is global section or within a host - section of your config , e.g. a board / forum / wiki you know a maintenance - mode is needed from time to time .
If you want to switch to maintenance - mode , just copy maint . down to maint.lua in your " / path - to - your / " location , and lighty will display your maint. html to all users - without restarting anything - this can be done on - the - fly .
Work is done and all is up again ?
Copy maint.up to maint.lua in your " / path - to - your / " location .
Whats maint.up doing ?
Nothing , just going on with normal file serving :-)
maint.up - all is up , user will see normal pages
--
This is empty , nothing to do .
maint.down - lighty will show the maintenance page -> maint.html
-- lighty . header [ " X - Maintenance - Mode " ] = " 1 " -- uncomment the above if you want to add the header lighty .
content = { { filename = " / path - to - your /maint.html " } } lighty .
header [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / html " return 503 -- or return 200 if you want
mod_flv_streaming
Config-file
magnet.attract-physical - path - to = ( server.docroot + " /flv-streaming.lua " )
flv-streaming.lua
if ( lighty.env [ " uri.query " ] ) then -- split the query - string get = {} for k , v in string.gmatch(lighty.env [" uri.query " ] , " ( %w+ ) = ( %w + ) " ) do get [ k ] = v end header= " " if ( get and get [ " start " ] ) then start = tonumber ( get [ " start " ] ) else start=0 end -- send te FLV header only when seeking + a seek into the file if ( start ~= nil and start > 0 ) then header = " FLV\1\1\0\0\0\9\0\0\0\9 " end lighty .
content = { header , { filename = lighty.env[ " physical.path " ] , offset = start } } lighty .
header [ " Content - Type " ] = " video/x - flv " return 200 end
You can also use a backend like php to use your own authorization or stuff like mod_secdl .
Just activate x-rewrite in the backend configuration and use a header like
header ( " X - Rewrite - URI : flvstreaming ? start= " .
$ start . " & path= " . $ path ) ;
The request is restarted and in the lua , you can catch the non-existing uri with the following code ( wrap it between the example below ) : :
if ( string.find(lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] , " / flvstreaming " ) then < flv streaming lua code >
end
In the future , there will be a new magnet for response headers , maybe you can give your own headers like : :
header ( " X - StreamMyFlv : $ path " ) ;
to lua and use the header data as parameter for the streaming .
selecting a random file from a directory
Say , you want to send a random file ( ad - content ) from a directory .
To simplify the code and to improve the performance we define :
all images have the same format ( e.g. image / png )
all images use increasing numbers starting from 1
a special index - file names the highest number
Config
server.modules += ( " mod_magnet " ) magnet.attract-physical - path - to = ( " random.lua " )
random.lua
dir = lighty.env[ " physical.path " ] f = assert ( io.open ( dir .. " / index " , " r " ) ) maxndx = f:read ( " * all " ) f:close ( ) ndx = math.random( maxndx ) lighty .
content = { { filename = dir .. " / " .. ndx }} lighty .
header [ " Content - Type " ] = " image / png " return 200
denying illegal character sequences in the URL
Instead of implementing mod_security , you might just want to apply filters on the content and deny special sequences that look like SQL injection .
A common injection is using UNION to extend a query with another SELECT query .
if ( string.find(lighty.env[" request.uri " ] , " UNION %s " ) ) then return 400 end
Traffic Quotas
If you only allow your virtual hosts a certain amount for traffic each month and want to disable them if the traffic is reached , perhaps this helps :
host_blacklist = { [ " www.example.org " ] = 0 } if ( host_blacklist[lighty.request [ " Host " ] ] ) then return 404 end
Just add the hosts you want to blacklist into the blacklist table in the shown way .
Complex rewrites
If you want to implement caching on your document - root and only want to regenerate content if the requested file does n't exist , you can attract the physical .
path :
magnet.attract-physical - path -to = ( server.document-root + " / rewrite.lua " )
rewrite.lua
attr = lighty.stat( lighty.env[" physical.path " ] ) if ( not attr ) then -- we could n't stat ( ) the file for some reason -- let the backend generate it lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] = " /dispatch.fcgi " lighty.env[" physical.rel - path " ] = lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] lighty.env[ " physical.path " ] = lighty.env[" physical.doc-root " ] .. lighty.env[ " physical.rel - path " ]
end
Extension rewrites
If you want to hide your file extensions ( like . php ) you can attract the physical .
path :
magnet.attract-physical - path -to = ( server.document-root + " / rewrite.lua " )
rewrite.lua
attr = lighty.stat( lighty.env[" physical.path " ] .. " . php " ) if ( attr ) then lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] = lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] .. " .php " lighty.env[" physical.rel - path " ] = lighty.env [ " uri.path " ] lighty.env[ " physical.path " ] = lighty.env[" physical.doc-root " ] .. lighty.env[ " physical.rel - path " ]
end
User tracking
... or how to store data globally in the script - context :
Each script has its own script - context .
When the script is started it only contains the lua-functions and the special lighty .* name - space .
If you want to save data between script runs , you can use the global - script context :
if ( nil == _G [ " usertrack " ] ) then _G [ " usertrack " ] = {} end if ( nil == _G [ " usertrack " ] [ lighty.request [ " Cookie " ] ] ) then _G [ " usertrack " ] [ lighty.request [ " Cookie " ] ] else _G [ " usertrack " ] [ lighty.request [ " Cookie " ] ] = _G [ " usertrack " ] [ lighty.request [ " Cookie " ] ] + 1 end print _G [ " usertrack " ] [ lighty.request [ " Cookie " ] ]
The global - context is per script .
If you update the script without restarting the server , the context will still be maintained .

Fight DDoS ¶
If your Server is under high load because of someone is flooding you with requests , a little bit lua might help you . ;)
In our case we 've got a lot of requests without a User - Agent in the request header .
if ( lighty .
request [ " User - Agent " ] == nil ) then file = io.open ( " ips.txt " , " a " ) file : write ( lighty.env [ " request.remote-ip " ] ) file : write ( "
" ) file : close ( ) return 200 end
The field request . remote - ip is available since Lighttpd 1.4.23 .
The file ips.txt must be writeable by the lighttpd user ( www - data ) .
The bad guys in the ips. txt file can be dropped into the firewall with a little shell script .
Do basic HTTP - Auth against a MySQL DB / Table ¶
This script works for me , doing HTTP - Auth against a MySQL Table with Lua :
-- vim : set ts =4 sw=4 sts=4 noai noet : --[[ MySQL Auth Lua Script for Lighttpd
How to use : 1 ) add this to lighttpd.conf magnet.attract-raw-url -to = ( " / path/to/script/mysql_auth.lua " )
2 ) Configure Database Access 3 ) Create this Table and fill it with users : CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` ( `fdMe` varchar ( 127 ) NOT NULL , `username` varchar ( 127 ) NOT NULL , `pass` varchar ( 127 ) NOT NULL , `realm` varchar ( 127 ) DEFAULT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `fdMe` ) , KEY `username` ( `username` ) , KEY `password` ( `pass` ) , KEY `realm` ( `realm` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT =' Users ' ;
The column fdMe may / should be changed to a autoincrementing unsigned int or whatever your primary key is .
If realm is NULL , a user has access to all realms !
If you want to change this , change the SQL - Statement in checkAuthMySQL ( ) ] ] --[[ Config Variables ] ] local dbConf = {} dbConf.database = '' dbConf.username = '' dbConf.password = '' dbConf.hostname = '' --[[ Requires ] ] -- Debian package : liblua5.1-socket2 -- required for Base64 De-/encoding .

find ( up , " ^(.+ ) :(.+ ) $ " ) -- split by " : " to get username and password supplied if ( not checkAuthMySQL ( username , password ) ) then return doAuth ( ) end -- return nothing to proceed normal operation return
This Script is blocking !!!
Lighttpd will hang , if there are MySQL connection problems .
Additionally , a whole new MySQL Connection is created with every request !
So you should n't use this on High - Traffic Sites .
Passwords are stored plain in MySQL - well , easy to fix .
Look for MySQL's PASSWORD function ....
Small Helpers ¶

Apache has mod_security available as a WAF ( web application firewall ) however this is n't available for other webservers .
I 've written a quick and dirty script to perform a similar task to mod_security using mod_magnet

other solutions ¶
external - static
I´ve seen this nice solution somewhere where they host some files locally on their machines .
If popularity gets to high , files are too big or for whatever reasons the files are moved to i think it was amazon´s S3 or akamai for faster serving or to cope with high traffic .
You still can use your hostname , urls , collect stats from your logs - your users are just redirected with a 302 to the files they ask for .
2008 - 11 - 17 : Found the source : http://blog.innerfence.com/2008/05/31/presto-move-content-to-s3-with-no-code-changes/
Request -> check for local copy -> 302 ( if not stored locally ) -> let users download from a big pipe
Add the following to your lighttpd .conf :
$ HTTP [ " url " ] =~ " ^/static / [^/ ]+[.] gif ( [ ? ].* ) ? $ " { #match the files you want this to work for magnet .
attract - physical - path - to = ( " / path-to - your/external - static.lua " ) }
Save the following to external - static.lua :
local filename = lighty.env[ " physical.path " ] local stat = lighty .
stat ( filename ) if not stat then local static_name = string .
match ( filename , " static / ( [ ^/ ] + ) $ " ) lighty .
header [ " Location " ] = " http://<new-location-with-big-pipes >/ " .. static_name return 302 end

Thousands of " the worst families in England " are being put in " sin bins , " or subsidized housing outfitted with closed - circuit cameras .
The cameras will be used to ensure that children do their homework and go to bed on time .
Holy shit .

The justification for this action is that if kids have structured upbringings , they wo n't get sucked into street crime and drugs .
And because the housing is subsidized , the government is n't technically putting cameras in private homes ; these are public homes .
But still , the precedent this sets is terrifying .
This is the definition of a nanny state , a government that does n't trust its citizens to live their lives autonomously so it sticks its nose into every little aspect of them for their own good .

A security analyst scheduled to perform a live demo of an ATM cracking operation at a hacker 's conference in Las Vegas has pulled out of the show after the cash machine manufacturer called for more time to protect bank customers from the vulnerability .
Barnaby Jack , a researcher with Juniper Networks , was to give a talk at the upcoming Black Hat conference showing how he could ' jackpot ' a popular ATM brand by exploiting a vulnerability in its software .
The conference blurb for his presentation promised that Jack would " explore both local and remote attack vectors , and finish with a live demonstration of an attack on an unmodified , stock ATM " .
However , the ATM vendor in question contacted his employer Juniper Networks and called for the talk to be pulled .
In a statement , Juniper says : " The affected ATM vendor has expressed to us concern about publicly disclosing the research findings before its constituents were fully protected .
Considering the scope and possible exposure of this issue on other vendors , Juniper decided to postpone Jack 's presentation until all affected vendors have sufficiently addressed the issues found in his research . "
Earlier this week , analysts at Trustwave warned of the spread of a malware infection on Windows ATMs that enabled criminals to harvest card data and PIN codes via the machine 's recipt printer .
Analysts also discovered code indicating that the malware could eject the cash dispensing cassette .
Back in 2003 , Diebold partnered with firewall vendor Sygate in an effort to protect its automated teller machines from future virus attacks after admitting that a computer worm had infected devices at two of its banking customers .
However , it issued an alert earlier this year warning that Russian hackers had installed rogue software on some Opteva ATMs in Russia and the Ukraine .
The vendor said it would issue a security software update to address the risk and recommended urgent installation on all of its Windows ATMs globally .
Seeking to avoid the public furor that erupted last spring , the American International Group has been quietly seeking approval from the new federal compensation czar to pay a total of $ 2.4 million dollars in bonuses to dozens of its senior executives .
Officials at the embattled insurance company , which has received more than $ 170 billion in taxpayer money , have sought meetings with Kenneth Feinberg , the pay czar , to review the payments for 40 of its highest ranking employees , according to individuals briefed on the matter .
Mr. Feinberg has been tasked with approving the pay for the 100 highest paid employees , but he also can also weigh in on other matters if a company requests .
A.I.G. executives want to make sure that Mr. Feinberg is comfortable with the company ’s compensation program and hoped to work with him to address any shortfalls , according to a person briefed on the situation .
The insurance giant does not actually need his permission .
But by obtaining Mr. Feinberg ’s blessing , the company would also have the political cover to shield it from criticism .
After The Pirate Bay Four were found guilty earlier this year they appealed , and the date for the new trial was set for November .
Now it seems that one of the planned lay judges could be disqualified from participation , since he is an employee of Swedish music outfit Spotify - a company partly owned by the plaintiffs .
Following the revelations that judge Tomas Norström from the original trial had connections with pro-copyright lobby groups , there had been hopes that the trial of the Pirate Bay Four could go to a retrial .
However , that eventuality was denied after the Appeal Court investigated the bias issue and ruled that the judge ’s ties to these groups did not influence his judgment .
Instead of a retrial an appeal has been granted which will take place in November .
The case will be handled by judge Ulrika Ihrfelt who was previously removed from the bias investigation of judge Tomas Norström , because she too was linked to pro-copyright groups .
Today there is yet another question mark hanging over the head of another judge scheduled to play a major part in the appeal .
Launched as an answer to the file - sharing problem and the possible savior of the music industry , Sweden ’s Spotify music service has been widely well received by both the industry and hardened pirates .
But there is a problem .
According to an SR.se report today , one of the lay judges in the case has been revealed as an employee of the fledgling streaming music service .
“ If the man is not judged to be biased he will be part of the court ’s team at the right time , ” said judge Ulrika Ihrfelt .
“ I would not say there is a problem , but we definitely consider it a factor to which we must draw the attention of the parties , given that Spotify is a company that provides online music , ” Ihrfelt added .
But of course , the problem goes just a little bit further than Spotify simply being a provider of online music .
It also counts the major music labels – the absolute arch - enemies of The Pirate Bay – as shareholders .
Both the plaintiffs and defendants in the appeal have been notified of the lay judge ’s affiliation with Spotify and it will now be down to the court of appeal to decide if there is a conflict of interest .
Here 's a letter to the editor of the Seattle Times and my response to that letter .
It is unlikely to be published in the Times , so I am submitting it here for the record .
Original letter :
" Agenda - driven citizens forget others disagree "
Here 's the answer to how Referendum 71 gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot [ " 137,689 names later , gay community asks :
How did they do it ? " page one , August 3 ] .
Look no further than the first sentence of the article , " The odds seemed almost insurmountable . "
There seems to be a disconnect with agenda - driven citizens , our governor included , in the belief that everyone agrees with them .
In this case it led to a surprise for the gay - rights activists .
There are a great many of us who desire to keep the definition of marriage as a legal and / or spiritual union between a man and a woman .
Not because we hate gays , not because we fear gays , not for religious reasons or fear of change -- but simply because marriage is between a man and a woman .
Please accept this as a difference of opinion .
I respect your right to your opinion , now please respect mine .
Regarding the recent University of Washington poll suggesting 77 percent of voters believe gay and lesbian couples should have at least some of the same benefits as married couples .
This can be accomplished with a civil union .
I am not opposed to the recognition of gay and lesbian families as Josh Friedes of Washington Families Standing Together also states , but I am just opposed to same - sex marriage .
It has been very frustrating to be confronted with vitriolic rhetoric concerning my intelligence and character when opposing these issues .
I agree voters need to look ahead in their consideration of Ref. 71 because it is critical stepping stone to same - sex marriage , not a step everyone wants to take .
-- Deanna Sundvick , Woodinville
My response :
Seattle Times editors :
In regards to the ' Agenda - driven citizens forget others disagree ' letter , there 's a disconnect between the rights of all citizens and Deanna Sundvick 's supposed right to impede the rights of gay people .
Deanna Sundvick of Woodinville says " Please accept this as a difference of opinion .
I respect your right to your opinion , now please , respect mine . "
This is about much more than ' an opinion ' ; you are trying to take away basic rights for US citizens THAT ALREADY EXISTS AS LAW .
This is ONLY your opinion and I do not respect it .
You are trying to make your opinion law and whining when someone calls you on your deceit .
Did you actually read what you wrote and still do n't understand the ' vitriolic rhetoric ' that 's directed at you because you do n't seem to understand that you are a bigot who is trying to take someone else 's rights away ?
We do n't like that sort of thing here on the West Coast in the United States of America ; perhaps you should check out Birmingham , Alabama .
You do n't seem to understand that we 're all US citizens with the right to have a loving relationship with whoever we want , including all the American amenities such as visitation , money and all other legal rights granted to American citizens .
By signing on to Ref 71 , you want to restrict the rights of other US citizens ; like you have the right to do this .
I do n't like your lifestyle ; do I have the right to stop you from living your lifestyle ?
This is n't about who agrees with who , this is about basic human US citizen rights .
Man , I do n't agree with you and I could care less what you agree with .
Just stay out of my way or you 'll get run over by the other humans .

There ’s a curious historical snippet in the latest edition of Neurology about how the famous French neurologist Jean - Martin Charcot designed a shaking chair for patients with Parkinson ’s disease after they reported sleeping better after a train or carriage ride .
The most obvious symptom of Parkinson ’s disease is tremor and name first given to the condition , by James Parkinson in his famous essay , was the ‘ shaking palsy ’ .
While Charcot ’s 19th century contemporaries had tried ‘ vibration therapy ’ here and there , he was the first to systematically apply it to patients with Parkinson ’s and found it helped with stiffness , discomfort and poor sleep .
Later Gilles de la Tourette , a one - time student of Charcot , developed the treatment into a type of electrical vibrating hat to specifically apply a 600 rpm treatment ‘ directly ’ to the brain .
The treatment was seemingly forgotten for many years but recently it has been revived and studies have found modest benefits for vibration therapy in Parkinson ’s disease .

The first natural history programme David Attenborough worked on adopted a very straightforward approach .
" A keeper from London Zoo would put some creature in a sack , " he recalls .
" It would then be transported to Alexandra Palace , where we'd have put a doormat on a table .
The keeper would put the animal on the doormat and then say to the camera , ' this is a lion cub ' .
In fact it could make for quite good television , " he laughs .
" The animal would sometimes escape and bite the keeper .
But it really was n't much to do with zoology . "
Within a year or two Attenborough had broken free of the studio and begun to create a body of work that ranks among the most memorable and technically innovative television ever made .
From his first trip to Sierra Leone in 1954 , where he filmed keepers from London Zoo searching for the bald - headed rock crow , to this month , when the 83 - year - old Attenborough will visit the north pole , he has hardly been off our screens .
In that time he has become one of the most trusted people on television and his programmes some of the best loved .
National treasure status was granted long ago , and was most recently evidenced by him not only occupying Alistair Cooke 's slot on Radio 4 but also appearing at the last night of the Proms in a performance of Malcolm Arnold 's uproarious A Grand , Grand Overture for orchestra , vacuum cleaners , floor polisher and rifles .
Attenborough played the floor polisher with gusto .
In the half century he has been broadcasting , the perception of Attenborough 's subject has changed .
Study of the natural world used to be a prime example of the apolitical , the reassuring and the timeless .
It has become contentious , alarming and urgent .
And Attenborough has not entirely escaped the crossfire .
George Monbiot crystallised the complaint of some environmentalists that Attenborough 's vision of the world too often underplayed the extent of humanity 's impact on the environment .
" There are two planet Earths .
One of them is the complex , morally challenging world in which we live , threatened by ecological collapse .
The other is the one we see on the wildlife programmes . "
Monbiot saw Attenborough 's " invocation of a fantastic , untainted world " as dangerous , claiming he had become , " in two respects , godlike .
He can , in the eyes of all who worship him , do no wrong .
And he has created a world which did not exist before .
He 's a fine man , but for 50 years he has perpetuated one of humanity 's most dangerous myths . "
The campaigner Jonathon Porritt recognises the charge .
He remembers environmentalists having " unbelievable respect " for the awareness Attenborough engendered in millions of people around the world .
" But that was tempered by a sense that he was less outspoken than he might have been in terms of the implications of human activity .
Those views persisted well into the 90s .
It was n't until comparatively recently that he emphatically said that we needed to get our act together .
That was an incredibly powerful moment , and his recognition of human impact on the natural world has become a more confident and up - front thread throughout his broadcasting . "
Porritt and Attenborough are now fellow patrons of the Optimum Population Trust , which campaigns on issues of human population and its impact on environmental sustainability .
Attenborough says that " the rather dated observation that you can travel to the heart of Africa and end up holding a Coca - Cola bottle was a kind of joke that has become an obvious reality .
But the important point is that the planet has become overrun with humanity and we can't go on expanding .
If we were another species , then predators or lack of food or lack of territory would deal with it .
Somehow we have accommodated ourselves , albeit often uncomfortably .
But none of these things is sustainable .
And unless we take some action , we will run out of food and places to live . "
He acknowledges that this approach " strikes at the fundamental rights of a human being to decide how many children they should have .
The only answer I have is that in every society where there is literacy and where women are treated as equals and have control over their own bodies , the birthrate drops .
So the way to stop population growth is to raise standards of living . "
When he was a boy , the idea of environmentalism , as we now think of it , did n't really exist .
" I was interested in the natural world , but it was nothing to do with saving the planet .
There were people who thought the country had been desecrated in terms of putting up pylons and things like that .
But the idea that you could actually destroy the Earth did n't really occur .
So we poured raw sewage into the sea because the seas were infinite .
If there were unpleasant smells from a factory then you would build a higher chimney .
The atmosphere was so big it could just absorb it all .
If you wanted to dig up a bit of forest , no one was going to stop you .
It was assumed the world was big enough .
Maybe it was .
But when I was a kid there were only a third of the people on the planet that there are today .
It does n't seem big enough any more . "
David Attenborough was born in 1926 , the middle of three brothers , and was brought up in Leicester .
His father , an Anglo - Saxon scholar , was head of a college at the university .
He attended a local grammar school and " within a half - hour bike ride I could get into a hedgerow or a wood or a wild field , fishing for newts or looking for fossils . "
In 1945 he won a scholarship to read natural sciences at Cambridge .
" It was the most marvellous time of my life .
It 's a cliché , but mostly clichés are true .
I encountered whole new areas of human experience : music and painting and talk with other students .
And there were great men around the place who had proved that continents moved or had mapped the history of the North Sea through pollen analysis .
But mostly I had an overwhelming feeling of good fortune .
I was sitting alongside people who had lost arms or legs – fighter pilots who had been shot up .
To say you were humbled would be putting it mildly . "
After university he completed his national service in the Navy and says that by the time he was demobbed he had begun to doubt whether he had the necessary dedication to be a scientist .
" I also did n't fancy going back to living on a grant .
I was used to earning a wage .
And I wanted to get married . "
He and Jane Oriel were married in 1950 , by which time he was a junior copy editor in an education publishing house .
They had two children and were married for 47 years until Jane 's death in 1997 .
Attenborough still lives in the Richmond home where they moved in 1952 , the year he joined the BBC .
He had initially applied , unsuccessfully , for a job in radio , but his CV was passed to the fledgling television service and , despite being unable to offer a critique of their programmes because he did n't own a television set , he was appointed as a trainee producer .
Opportunities for working on screen quickly presented themselves , despite an internal report on an early appearance insisting that he should not be used again because " his teeth are too big " .
There was a strong tradition of natural history on radio , and a lot of nature films had been made by independent companies , but Attenborough and his colleagues were essentially inventing natural history television .
Travel to the likes of Sierra Leone , Indonesia or New Guinea was unbelievably exotic .
" People knew what elephants and giraffes looked like .
But the komodo dragon we filmed was n't in any zoo .
We were the first to film lemurs in Madagascar , the first to film birds of paradise displaying in the wild .
This was all entirely new . "
Attenborough found himself back in front of the camera – despite the teeth – when a London Zoo keeper was taken ill on location .
He says he did a bit of amateur dramatics at school – " although not as much as my brother did " – but never had any ambition to perform .
" And it was all staff no fee in those days , " he laughs .
Michael Palin , perhaps the most travelled television presenter since Attenborough – and the first to perpetrate the many TV parodies of him with Monty Python – describes him as the consummate presenter : " There was no blather .
I learned from him that you could n't pretend to know what you are talking about , you really had to know .
He 's also a very good actor .
He knows how to draw an audience in , how to pause , how to create tension and how to play a laugh .
There 's an awful lot of craft at work . "
Despite burgeoning fame , in the mid-1960s , after 10 years as a presenter , Attenborough enrolled on a part - time anthropology course at the LSE .
" It was wonderful , but after two terms I was given this chance to run BBC2 , so I had to properly ask myself whether I was a broadcaster or an academic .
And I realised I was a broadcaster . "
He took over in 1965 and built the new channel as an alternative to BBC1 by encouraging new forms of programmes across the range of television output .
" So we televised floodlit football and snooker , which had n't been done before .
We did 26 - part classic drama serials .
We did science fiction .
In comedy we had Peter Cook and Dudley Moore and The Likely Lads .
Of course it is very much more difficult to do anything new today , " he says .
" But even so , the number of genres you now see on television is lamentably small .
All those cooking and property programmes are a bit depressing . "
Another promotion followed , to the BBC 's director of programmes , which , Attenborough says , " meant doing much more dogsbody work .
I had to fire people and work on budgets .
I was even responsible for the introduction of computers , which my children fall over laughing about as even now I do n't use email . "
He plays down the suggestion that he turned down the job of director general .
" My name was mentioned because I was a senior guy who'd been around for a while , but I would n't have been any good at it and I would n't have enjoyed it .
And I 'd got to the point where I thought , why on earth would I do something that I did n't enjoy .
So it was never me saying take away your gilded chariots . "
So he returned to programme making and began to build on his BBC2 legacy .
His ambition to reinvent documentary television coincided with the arrival of colour , and the upshot was Kenneth Clark 's mammoth art history series , Civilisation .
It was followed by other " tombstone " projects , as they became known , such as a history of science presented by Jacob Bronowski , The Ascent of Man , and Alistair Cooke 's America .
" So why not natural history ? "
Life on Earth took three years to complete and aired in 1979 .
Its combination of rare animals and state - of - the - art photography ensured it was an immediate success , and its follow - up series have built a globally successful franchise .
They have even cracked America .
" When we first went there , their nature programmes were all whiz - bang stuff such as catching elephants or lassoing rhinoceroses .
They thought the idea that you could do a programme on plants or caterpillars was absurd .
But people seemed to like it . "
Its reception in America was also an early indicator that Attenborough 's subject matter was becoming more contentious .
The series became embroiled in rows with the evolution and creationist lobbies .
Television , he says , does not deal easily with divisive opinions .
" The population issue has barely been covered at all , partly because there are large groups of people who might find it offensive .
And television , by and large , is not a crusading medium .
The BBC does n't like to take sides , and commercial television does n't want to antagonise large chunks of its audience , because that does n't encourage advertisers . "
He says climate change provides an interesting example of this predicament .
" When do you move from something being debated to being implacable fact ?
You first have to decide whether it is beyond the various extremes that have afflicted the world for the past thousand years .
The next debate is what is responsible .
It 's a very fine judgment .
And the BBC has a responsibility not to be too far ahead or too far behind general opinion . "
So is he comfortable putting his head above the parapet on population ?
" No , but I think you do have an obligation to speak the truth as you see it .
And while people say , with good cause , that it 's all doom and gloom , I also think we 've come a long way .
It 's not so long ago that the idea of having a minister for the environment would have been absurd .
Now no party could possibly be elected without a policy on the environment .
I think people are increasingly realising that if we get out of kilter with the natural world , we are heading for catastrophe .
And the associated emotional , spiritual and physical loss is the road to madness .
The natural world is still a source of solace and pleasure and delight and beauty and reassurance . "
After his north pole trip , Attenborough will travel to the south pole next spring and is also writing the script for a new BBC television series called Life – " not an entirely original title " – which will be screened next month .
" Yet again they have come up with some amazing material .
I 've just been looking at film of weedy sea dragons .
They are like elongated seahorses , and their fins have turned into what looks like fantastically coloured seaweed , so every part is fringed with fronds and tassels .
The film is of their courtship , which takes place off the Australian coast at dusk , so very few people have seen it before .
It is just the most remarkable thing .
You could cry at how beautiful it is .
It certainly does n't need words from me .
You just sit and gape at this wonder .
" No matter how long I have been involved with such things , it is simply impossible to become blasé and not be moved by something like this indescribably beautiful and wonderfully surreal creature . "

Critics say plantations are pushing further into the rainforest
The Brazilian government has unveiled plans to ban sugar cane plantations in environmentally sensitive areas .
The proposal , which must be passed by Congress , comes amid concerns that Brazil 's developing biofuels industry is increasing Amazon deforestation .
Environment Minister Carlos Minc said the measures would mean ethanol made from sugar cane would be " 100 % green " .
The government agenda is becoming more environmentally friendly ahead of the 2010 presidential poll , analysts say .
The plans unveiled by Mr Minc would limit sugar cane plantations to 7.5 % of Brazilian territory or 64 m hectares , and prevent the clearing of new land for the crop .
Brazil has a well - developed programme of ethanol fuel
The proposed legislation , expected to be put to Congress next year , would also prohibit the building of ethanol distillation plants in food - growing areas or in the vast wetlands of the Pantanal , on Brazil 's border with Bolivia .
Brazil , the world 's top producer of sugar , has long championed ethanol as an environmentally friendly source of energy but concerns have grown over its potential hazards .
Critics have said that the spread of sugar cane plantations into areas like the Amazon and the Pantanal has increased deforestation .
" This legislation is extremely welcome because it sends a clear signal to farmers and to the world that the government wants to exercise control , " Paulo Moutinho from environmental group Imazon told the AFP news agency .
Green votes
The debate over the environmental credentials of ethanol has become increasingly sensitive in Brazil , raising tensions among ministers , says the BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo .
But our correspondent says that as next year 's presidential election approaches , the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been stressing its green credentials with renewed vigour .
President Lula , who enjoys high approval ratings , cannot stand for a third term but is keen to see his chief of staff Dilma Rousseff succeed him .
Complicating the electoral scene , however , is the likely candidacy for the Green Party of Marina Silva , the former environment minister , who left the president 's Workers Party ( PT ) earlier this year .
Ms Silva , a stanch defender of the Amazon rainforest , is highly unlikely to win but with her green background she could help to splinter the PT base and take some votes from Ms Rousseff .

Picture youself in bed , waiting to fall asleep , when suddenly you start seeing millions of stars falling right in front of you .
You see a radiant light , one brighter than the rest , mingling with beautiful colours .
You feel ecstatic .
Everything appears to be shimmering and boiling and then , as suddenly as it came , it dissipates .
Throughout all of this , you are fully awake .
How would you react ?
How about if you were sitting in a room with a group of people and the whole room became infused with a heady scent of orange blossoms and only you could smell it ?
I have just described symptoms of neurological disorders .
The correct ( responsible ) response to experiencing anything similar to this would be to go to a doctor and get a neurological checkup .
Unfortunately , many of us are raised to believe in angels , demons , God(s ) and the Devil .
We are also told that these mythical beings are capable of interacting with us .
Angels guard over us , by our sides at all times .
Demons and sometimes Satan himself are constantly trying to lead us astray .
If you need advice , you can ask God - He will answer you .
It is hardly surprising , then , that many people who experience the symptoms I have described do not seek medical attention , but instead ascribe these events to miraculous visions or visitations from God ( or some other supernatural being ) .
Last weekend I read the following headline in a newspaper : " Jesus smells like orange blossoms " .
Why would the paper report such a thing ?
Because the lady who smelt it was busy praying in a group when she smelt this smell , so obviously it was Jesus ( she is also the wife of Angus Buchan , a famous evangelical Christian , making what she smells important enough to publish ) .
I 'm not saying she has a neurological disorder for sure , since it was spring when she smelt the blossoms , but an intense smell that only you can detect is definitely something that should be checked out .
The first scenario was experienced by Hildegard of Bingen , a nun who described her " visions " in great detail .
In his book , , Oliver Sacks explains that such experiences could be caused by hysterical or psychotic ecstasy , the effects of intoxication , epileptic fits or migrainous manifestations .
Hildegard 's vision described above was in fact " a shower of phosphenes in transit across the visual field , their passage being succeeded by a negative scotoma " .
Does n't sound so holy now , does it ?
A conversation with someone on youtube caused me great worry .
Here , have a case study : " God bless you .
And so your saying i didnt see things fall right infront of me when no body tough anything no air was on nothing like that .
And this happened many times .
So your saying my mom didnt see the devil in her mirror and she describes his face as being very very very wrinkles .
You atheist i feel bad for you are walking into hell my friend .
How sad " This young lady sees things falling when there is no rational explanation for them to do so and it appears to be a frequent occurrance .
Her mother saw impossible images in the mirror .
In a subsequent mail , she wrote to me " Not only did these things happen to my family .
Other things have happened . "
Clearly there is a hereditary condition here !
The knowledge we have today far surpasses that of 2000 years ago .
It far surpasses what we knew 150 years ago !
Gods do not exist .
Devils , angels , demons - none of that is real .
We do not have immaterial souls .
We are only physical bodies with physical brains .
Many supernatural events people have experienced can be reproduced by stimulating certain parts of the brain with electricity .
Out of body experiences , hearing voices , seeing things that are n't there , feeling a " presence " - all of this can be explained through science .
( You do n't even need internal brain functions to go awry for strange things to manifest themselves - consider the effects of infrasound in humans !)
It is a disgrace that we , in 2009 , still have to combat such ludicrous notions as miraculous visions and visitations from otherwordly beings .
By misrepresenting certain experiences , religious belief can prevent necessary medical intervention and cause irreversible damage or suffering due to lack of accurate diagnoses .
What I 'm trying to say is , do n't mistake your temporal - lobe seizures for messages from God .
Or , as Gregory House put it : " You talk to God , you 're religious .
God talks to you , you 're psychotic . "
* Disclosure :
As someone within the mental health care field , I stand to profit from people reporting their holy visions as neurological conditions .

I like this comic not just because of the irony , but because it raises the question of when does free speech end and offensive speech begin .
We all understand that yelling “ fire ” in a crowded theater is not about free speech , nor is encouraging others to perform illegal acts .
But that boundary is very very fuzzy .
Like most really good questions , I do n’t have an answer for it .

Remember when Lenin said capitalists will sell communists the rope they will use to hang us ?
Well , Mr. Marxist gave us way too much credit .
These days , in a different struggle , we are giving our enemies the fertilizer they will use to make bombs to kill and maim US soldiers .
Along with 300 metric tons of wheat seed shipped into Helmand Province this month as " as part of an initiative by the Afghan government " ( oh , come on , it 's USAID ) " to provide an alternative crop to poppy for farmers in the region , " went 1,050 metric tons of fertilizer .
This is supposed to give " farmers a better opportunity for success , " but it will surely give Taliban a better chance at making bombs .
Paticularly because the distribution is being handled by the " Afghan government , " which , as we know , has " weekend jihadis " on its payroll .
Earlier this month -- before that 1,000 - plus metric tons of fertilizer went into Helmand Province -- the New Jersey Star Ledger reported on the dangers of buried bombs in Helmand , where 90 percent of Marine operations are taking place on foot :
" We walk .
This is not Iraq .
We do n't drive around , " Cabaniss said .
Often , there 's no other option , Marines here say .
Mine resistant ambush protected vehicles , for example , are too big and heavy to allow nimble navigation of the labyrinth of irrigation canals and ditches in southern Helmand Province .
Add to that the fact that the bulk of the population in southern Afghanistan is located in rural areas .
" To be amongst the people --
Drinking tea , eating goat ...
-- you 've got to walk out there , " [ Marine Col . ]
Cabaniss said .
The strategy of keeping up a security force presence is a main theme of the current International Security Assistance Forces ' counterinsurgency campaign under way in Afghanistan .
...
Along with offerings of wheat and fertilizer .
But :
Fertilizer - based homemade explosives are increasingly being used against Marine and Afghan troops in the Garmsir region of Helmand .
Of the 13 Marines killed in the region since June , most all have been from IED attacks , said one military intelligence officer .
IEDs , or improvised explosive devices , act as a force multiplier for the Taliban in that they conserve fighters and resources , said Capt .
Trevor Hunt , intelligence officer for 2nd Battalion , 8th Marines .
I wonder what the " intelligence officer " thinks about us force - multiplying the Taliban 's force multiplier .
fALK sez , " This video shows a peacefull protester being beaten by policeman at the ' Freedom not Fear ' demonstration that was totally peaceful .
The demonstration was attended by 25.000 people and called for by more then 160 groups that are concerned about privacy , censorship and freedom .
I personally have been close to the beating and the police acted provocative in the time before hand – encircling one truck that took part at the demonstration and pulling out people harshly – there will likely more videos surface over the coming hours . "
I hope you help spread the word about this incident and help us find the brutal policeman .

12 August - Action must be taken to mitigate the impact of landslides such as those triggered recently in parts of East Asia by Typhoon Morakot , which has reportedly buried entire villages and killed scores of people , a senior United Nations official working on disaster risk reduction stressed today .
“ As this week 's tragic events in East Asia show once again , people living on unstable slopes and steep terrains are particularly at risk from landslides in the wake of torrential rain and flooding , ” said Margareta Wahlström , who heads the UN International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction ( UNISDR ) .
“ While landslides are hard to predict , people living in landslide - prone areas can be alerted in advance if there are monitoring and warning systems in place to measure rainfalls and soil conditions , ” she added .
Ms. Wahlström underlined the urgency of these measures by pointing to population growth and the urbanization of steep hillsides , along with the predictions by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) of more intense rainfalls in the future , leading to increased instability of slopes and making more people vulnerable to landslides .
She also highlighted the case of Hong Kong , where a ' Slope Safety System ' introduced in the mid-1970s has resulted in a 50 per cent fall in casualty rates from landslides since 1977 , and is targeting a further reduction – to 75 per cent – by 2010 .
In addition , an early warning system implemented in Costa Rica , which trained some 200 people in disaster preparedness and 30 people as radio operators , saw a dramatic improvement in the response to a second landslide in nine months , saving hundreds of lives .
“ Landslides are a growing problem in many countries , but , as these examples show , people living in landslide - prone areas can be better protected , ” said Ms. Wahlström , who is also Assistant - Secretary - General for Disaster Risk Reduction .

Which States Use the Most Renewable Energy … And How They Made it Happen
August 17th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Which state makes 15 percent of its electricity entirely from wind power ?
Iowa .
In 2006 , according to the Iowa Utilities Board , wind power provided 5 percent of the state ’s electricity .
Now , just three years later , Iowa produces between 15 and 17 percent of its own electricity from wind power .
MidAmerican Energy , Iowa ’s biggest utility , pays farmers $ 3,500 a year ( plus 2 % increase annually ) to rent locations for 102 wind turbines .
To scout the best locations , they paid $ 5 an acre to survey likely farmland , and will pay $ 10 an acre per year to keep those options open for future additional wind turbines .

NASA is taking the rare step of reaching out to the public for help .
The space agency is looking for the best way to analyze and electronically catalog a precious collection of notes that chronicle the early history of the human space flight program .
" We 're looking for creative ways to get it out to the public , " said project manager Jason Crusan .
" We do n't always do the best with putting out large sets of data like this . "
The notes [ pdf ] are those of rocket scientist Wernher von Braun , the fist director of NASA 's Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville , Alabama and are typed with copious hand written notes in the margin .
According to the official request for information [ pdf ] , NASA needs ideas on what format to use , how to index the notes and how to create a useful database .
The unique nature and historical value of the data , literally discovered in boxes six months ago , is what motivated NASA to ask the public for ideas .
" It 's first - hand insight on how management and engineering decisions were made on a real - time basis , " Crusan said .
" It 's quite scrawled upon all over the place . "
Von Braun was born in Germany and led the German army 's " rocket team " which developed ballistic missiles .
His V - 2 missile was used on European targets during World War II .
When it became clear to von Braun that Germany was going to lose the war , he surrendered himself , 500 of his best rocket scientists , plans and vehicles to the Allies .
The team moved to the United States and worked on missile development for the U.S. Army .
In 1960 , rocket development was shifted to NASA where von Braun headed Marshall Spaceflight Center and led the Saturn rocket project .
In 1970 he moved to Washington D.C. to lead the strategic planning of the project and in 1972 he retired from NASA .
The details of von Braun 's role in the German army ( he received an honorary SS rank from Heinrich Himmler ) and his conversion to a NASA pioneer are still being assessed , and his notes are considered a historically valuable source of information about Marshall .
" He was significantly important in the formation of the Apollo program , " Crusan said .
If you have ideas , let NASA know .
If that 's not your cup of tea , perhaps you can help NASA find a location for it 's 40th anniversary " Salute to Apollo : The Kennedy Legacy " party or sell them that automated torque wrench calibration system you 've been meaning to put on Craigslist .

A Sudanese woman was convicted Monday of public indecency for wearing pants at an outdoor cafe and jailed for one month when she refused to pay a fine .
The case has stirred international outrage and spawned protests in Sudan over the Islamic - dominated government ’s treatment of women .
Lubna Hussein , a journalist and former U.N. staffer based in Khartoum , the capital , could have received 40 lashes with a plastic whip under Sudan ’s criminal code , which is based largely on Islamic Sharia law .
Instead , a judge ordered Hussein -- who stood before the court in the same pair of pants that she wore when arrested -- to pay a $ 200 fine .
Hussein said she would refuse to pay , and was taken to a women ’s prison to serve a one - month sentence .

“ If I paid , it would mean I ’d lost the battle , ” Hussein said after the verdict was announced .
“ I would rather serve my time in jail . ”
Hussein was arrested in early July with a dozen other women , most of whom have since paid a fine or were lashed .
Western nations lodged complaints about the case .
Amnesty International , a human rights group , last week likened public floggings to “ state - sponsored torture . ”
Hussein , believed to be in her 30s , said she hoped her case would put a spotlight on the repressive treatment of women in Sudan .
Advertisement
More than 100 women held a protest at the courthouse , some dressed in pants , shouting slogans such as “ There is no justice in Sudan ! ”
Police arrested more than three dozen protesters and released them after the verdict was announced .
Sudanese women face widespread discrimination in the workplace and there are few high - ranking female politicians .
Even in southern Sudan , which is predominantly non-Muslim , women have faced arrest , discrimination and attack for behaving or dressing in ways that were perceived by local authorities as immodest .
As a United Nations employee , Hussein was entitled to immunity from prosecution , but she quit her job so that the case would not be dismissed .
She sent e-mails to journalists and diplomats inviting them to attend her sentencing .
“ I chose to resign from the U.N. so that I could face the Sudanese authorities and make them show to the world what they consider justice to be , ” Hussein wrote last week in an editorial in Britain ’s Guardian newspaper .
“ I also pray that the next generation will see we had the courage to fight for their future before it was too late . ”

Government officials declined to comment .
The sentencing was twice postponed , reportedly in hopes that Hussein would agree to a settlement and international attention would fade .
Hussein ’s attorney said his client would appeal the verdict to the nation ’s highest court .
Sudanese activists called on the government to reform and clarify the nation ’s indecency laws .
A 2005 peace treaty that ended the country ’s 21 - year north - south civil war called for legal reforms to strengthen human rights and reflect religious diversity , but the work has yet to be completed .
“ There should be definitions and guidance , ” said Anwar Bashir of the Child and Women ’s Rights Institute in Khartoum .
“ The law is there to protect people , not take away their rights . ”

Ahmed is a special correspondent .
A water drop with an electrical charge opposite to that of the water surface below will be either attracted permanently or repelled , depending upon the strength of the force pulling the two together .
Two oppositely charged liquids normally are attracted toward each , as can be seen in the upper row of images .
But when the attraction between them passes a certain critical point , the drop of liquid will no longer be able to merge with the surface .
Though still attracted , its attraction will be short - lasting .
The drop 's behavior will resemble that of a bouncing ball .
Image courtesy Ristenpart et al 2009
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Opposites may always attract .
But they may not remain together long - term .
In a counter - intuitive discovery published in the current edition of the journal Nature , researchers from Harvard , the University of California at Davis , Princeton , and Penn State University report that oppositely charged drops of water will not attract permanently , but instead will bounce off each other indefinitely when subjected to a force of attraction created by what physicists call an electric field that is too strong .
When William Ristenpart designed the experiment while a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard , he never expected to see what he saw .
( Ristenpart is now an assistant professor at the University of California at Davis . )
Knowledgeable of the work of his predecessors in the 19th century , Ristenpart , knew very well that opposite electrical charges attract each other .
" It ´s what ´s expected , " says the chemical engineer then in former - professor Howard Stone 's laboratory at Harvard .
When he set up his experiment - a glass cylinder with the bottom half filled with water , the top half with oil , and wires sticking through each liquid as electrodes - he cranked up the voltage and an explosion followed .
But it was n't the Bang ! that startled him .
What caught his attention was what happened next .
" Imagine a bridge of liquid in the shape of a cone emerging from the water at the interface between water and oil until the cone´s tip reached the top electrode of the cylinder , " he says .
" As soon as you have a bridge connecting the two electrodes at a very high voltage , a tremendous current flows through , " Ristenpart explains .
The sparks of the explosion create a big cloud of bubbles and dozens of water droplets .
" I turned the voltage down a bit and I kept watching .
The conical - shaped bridge retracted , but the bubbles floated to the top of the cylinder and the droplets , still carrying charge , were now bouncing back and forth from the top electrode to the water - oil interface , " he says .
Terribly confused , never having seen anything like that before , Ristenpart couldn´t understand why opposite charged droplets were failing to merge .
The researcher showed his results to a colleague , Andrew Belmonte , who was on sabbatical from Penn State .
James C. " Jacy " Bird , a graduate student in the Stone lab , realized that a similar phenomenon he observed with water drops in air was related and joined the team .
" They got interested , and we did a bunch of experiments , " Ristenpart says .
" Basically , one thinks when two drops of water come together they will merge .
Intuition tells us that , " Bird , coauthor of the report , says .
" And one way to get them to attract and merge even faster is to put opposite electrical charges on them -- one with a negative charge and one with a positive charge , " Bird adds .
" The surprising thing that we saw was that if you have two oppositely charged drops in a sufficiently strong electric field , they don´t coalesce , but actually repel and start bouncing off each other , " Ristenpart says .
An electric field creates a " force of attraction " between two charged entities driving their motion towards each other .
Increasing the strength of the field should hasten that motion .
" It 's what happens when you have a single nine - volt battery versus two nine - volt batteries .
The two nine - volt batteries will put more energy into the system so that charges will move toward each other more quickly , " Ristenpart says .
But in this case , that ´s not what happened .
" We spent the next few years studying that accident in detail , " he adds .
What started as a side project led to an explanation of when and why opposite electrical charges do not attract -- a process that , Ristenpart says , " appears to be a fairly robust phenomenon . "
" One of the first things we did was to figure out if this was reproducible , " Ristenpart says .
His team tested different combinations of fluids .
" We looked at vinegar and oil , colloidal suspensions , mineral oil and alcohol , air and water , and even crude oil and water , " he says , " and we saw bouncing happening in every system that we tested . "
To follow their observation more systematically , the scientists manually introduced a single drop of water into a set - up not unlike the original -- a cylinder half filled with air and half filled with water .
They played with the strength of the electric field ( the force of attraction ) between the single drop and the water below it .
" For high fields ( strong force of attraction ) we always had bouncing , " Ristenpart says , " but for low fields ( low force of attraction ) we saw a critical value for the attraction above which we saw bouncing and below which the drop merged with the water . "
Ristenpart and colleagues witnessed the phenomenon of non-merging at scales ranging from tens of microns -- about a tenth the width of a human hair -- up to several millimeters , but their explanation for its underlying physics didn´t depend on the overall size of the drops .
High - speed video revealed that above a certain value the force of attraction produced a double cone bridge ( like two cones with their tips touching ) between two oppositely charged drops of water .
" The drops themselves remain stationary ; what moves is the interface between them .
It deforms , forming the double cone , " Ristenpart explains .
The long and narrow structure of the " bridge " between the drops was preventing them from merging .
" Water molecules are trying to squeeze together .
It ´s like having thirty students stand on top of a very narrow desk hanging on to each other tighter and tighter so they don´t fall off , exerting pressure on each other , " Ristenpart says , " It´s what drives them to move away , back to their respective drops instead of merging . "
The counter - intuitive phenomenon has applications in the study of cloud formation , microfluidics -- where fluid motion is controlled at very small scales to study chemical reactions -- and the petroleum industry where strong electric fields are used to extract the crude .
It ´s still possible that merging can occur in less viscous systems where oppositely charged drops are already moving so quickly towards each other that the presence of a force driving them apart fails to overcome their motion .
" There is a bunch of other velocities and scales where other forces might be more important .
We just haven´t investigated yet . "

TALK about location , location , location .
If the sun had been born near the edge of the galaxy , chances are neither the Earth nor life would have arisen .
That ’s the implication of the first search for planet - forming discs on the Milky Way ’s outskirts .
The stars on the fringes of our galaxy have little oxygen , silicon or iron – chief ingredients of Earth - like planets – so astronomers have long doubted that life could exist there .
Now they have solid evidence for their pessimism .
Chikako Yasui and Naoto Kobayashi at the University of Tokyo , Japan , and colleagues observed two extremely young star clusters …
Neil Gaiman has just won this year 's Hugo award for best novel , for The Graveyard Book – and I can't be the only one who is n't surprised by the news .
I knew Gaiman was more than just a great writer when I read the comic mini-series Death : The High Cost of Living in 1993 .
I 'd already been blown away by The Sandman , but in the spin - off series featuring Dream 's older sister , Death , I found something more .
I found a grungy - looking young lad called Sexton , living with a hippie single mother and driven to the brink of suicide by a world in which the World Wrestling Federation could be allowed to exist .
Sexton meets Didi , either an orphaned young Goth woman or the personification of Death , who , for one day in every 100 years , must take human form .
This story could have been written for me .
I was a grungy - looking young lad .
I lived with a hippie single mother .
Suicide was never far from my muddled teenage thoughts .
And boy , did I want to meet a cute Goth girl who thought she was Death .
I was under Neil 's spell .
I was n't the first , and I would n't be the last .
By 1993 , Neil had entranced hundreds of thousands of readers with his Sandman stories : their re-mixing of mythology and fairytale , combined with brilliantly observed characters , had attracted an audience that few other writers were reaching .
Early graphic novels such as Violent Cases had marked Gaiman as an original voice in comics .
The Books of Magic , featuring a bespectacled young boy who discovers his destiny as a great magician , introduced Gaiman to a younger readership , that he would further entrance with novels such as Coraline .
Good Omens , written in collaboration with Terry Pratchett , is still a frequent presence on bestseller lists almost two decades after its publication .
But it was with the release of American Gods in 2001 that Neil finally captured a mainstream readership .
The story of an America populated by all the gods who had ever washed up on its shores , and a war between ancient magic and modern technology , resonated deeply with millions of readers who did not know how much they longed for myth until they were given one .
Neil Gaiman has won over his audience one - by - one with stories in which readers find intense personal meaning .
But that audience is now numbered in its millions because of Gaiman 's understanding of the primal role of myth in our lives , and our hunger for myths that suit our modern age .
His stories stitch together a 21st - century mythology , woven from the legends of ancient Greece and the Norse pantheon , eastern European folktales and the British literary tradition of Milton and Shakespeare , to name just a few of his sources .
Into this fabric are embroidered modern mythic figures for our age : Dream and his family of the Endless ; the bespectacled boy wizard ; and now the child raised by nightmares in a graveyard .
The Graveyard Book is a story that deserves to be told and retold .
The tale of Bod , whose parents are murdered and who is raised by the ghosts , ghouls and vampires inhabiting the graveyard where he takes shelter is more than just a spooky tale for children .
It 's a story for an age in which many people find that family does n't offer the security they need ; a story about the strength and love found in friendship , but also about the need for growth and change that means we must sometimes let go of friendship .
It 's the kind of tale people tell their children at bedtime .
The least we can do to celebrate it is to give the author a prize .
TIM NOAH had a good piece last week on a bogus Republican front group called the Physicians ' Council for Responsible Reform , which is not made up of physicians and does n't want reform , and is n't very responsible , either .
The organisation was launched and bankrolled by the National Republican Congressional Committee , and it 's basically a direct - mail and phone - bank scheme to harvest lots of names of doctors and affix them to the bottom of statements claiming they oppose the Obama health - insurance reform initiative .
It 's not clear whether doctors actually have to endorse the views in the mailers the PCRR sends out ; if they do n't explicitly call the organisation and say they oppose those views , they may end up on PCRR statements claiming they 're on board .
It 's a sort of " opt- out " method of grassroots organising — Cass Sunstein , of " Nudge " fame , would be proud .
Here 's another organisation that seems to consist of just a dozen or so staffers floating on a cushion of cash : the Independent Women 's Forum .
Is it independent ?
Well , most of its funding comes from four different Scaife foundations .
So , no , it 's not independent .
It 's conservative .
Is it a forum ?
Not really .
If you read the group 's blog , you find that there are n't very many commenters , and the comments that do appear are almost all furious negative responses by visitors outraged at the generally thin , propagandistic posts that appear there .
One of the more heavily commented recent posts attempts to rope in breast cancer treatment and Britain 's NHS as a reason to oppose the Obama health insurance reforms ; commenters rail at the poster for " irresponsible fear - mongering " and denounce the IWF as a tool of the insurance industry .
To the extent that the group generates a response from women outside its staff , it seems to consist of people angrily yelling at them to shut up .
Redstate it ain't .
Recently the group has begun broadcasting a television ad claiming that if the government " ran " health care in America , " 300,000 women could have died " of breast cancer .
That 's the kind of stat you just gotta love .
( Died when ?
Why ?
If what ?
Huh ? )
And it has sent out an anti-health - reform fundraising email with the subtle , sophisticated header " More American Women Are Going To Die . "
As Michelle Goldberg reports , until last year , the group shared its office and support staff with Americans for Prosperity , " a major organizer of anti-Obama tea parties and town hall protests . "
None of this has inhibited mainstream media outlets from featuring the group 's staff members as " independent " voices .
IWF president Michelle Bernard appears regularly on MSNBC , identified as a " political analyst " .
She was paid over $ 218,000 by the IWF in 2007 .
It 's obviously not the case that all conservative organisations are front groups represented by highly - paid , intellectually mediocre television personalities who just happen to belong to traditionally liberal ethnic or gender demographics , bankrolled by fanatically right - wing white male billionaires .
There are actually a whole lot of genuine conservatives in America , and they organise themselves into real community - based groups that authentically voice their interests and concerns .
Many church - based groups are exactly the kind of truly powerful grassroots organisations that Tocqueville praised when he wrote the book from which this blog draws its name .
But one thing about those kinds of groups is that you can usually tell who they are from their names .
The Moral Majority did n't give itself some kind of weak deceptive name designed to cloak its identity , " Americans for True Tolerance " or whatever .
That 's because the group was choosing a name that would appeal to its members , not one that would confuse its enemies .
You can tell the Physicians ' Council for Responsible Reform and the Independent Women 's Forum are astroturf outfits just from the names .
They 're not trying to appeal to their membership , because they do n't have any .
And one more thing , while we 're on the subject of women 's rights and authentic democracy .
Friday over at DoubleX Meredith Simons interviewed Haleh Esfandiari , the Iranian - American women 's - rights activist who was locked up in Tehran 's notorious Evin Prison for four months in 2007 .
Ms Simons asked Ms Esfandiari whether American democracy - promotion aid had been a good idea in Iran .
" The allocation of money to [ NGOs that ] promote democracy in Iran was counterproductive , " Ms Esfandiari replied .
Why might that have been ?
Ms Esfandiari chalks it up to Iranian popular paranoia after 30 years of poor relations with America .
But what if the NGOs America funded to promote democracy in Iran were really just grant - churning conservative front groups that themselves had no experience or competence in building grassroots democracy ?
Amount the Independent Women 's Forum received from the US State Department in a 2007 grant " to promote democracy for women in Iraq and Iran " : $ 392,240 .

- " L'autunno del sultano - il potere di Silvio Berlusconi cade a pezzi " .
Così , con durezza e toni espliciti insoliti rispetto alla freddezza e all 'estrema misura con cui i media tedeschi hanno trattato finora il tema , un editoriale di Die Welt ( quotidiano conservatore del gruppo Springer , testata ritenuta vicinissima alla CduCsu di Angela Merkel ) dedica ampio spazio oggi alle vicende del premier italiano .
" Chi ormai celebra da solo i suoi atti eroici è divenuto un monumento di se stesso che si sta sgretolando " , scrive Paul Badde , a lungo corrispondente da Roma della Welt .
Continua ricordando la conferenza stampa insieme a Zapatero : " Il piccolo uomo con i tacchi rialzati si è definito un superman , la sua popolarità lo conferma , e ( ha detto di ) essere il premier italiano di maggior successo negli ultimi 150 anni " .
Poi Badde commenta : sembra di assistere all ' ultimo atto di uno spettacolo triste , uno spettacolo in cui la vecchia commedia con Silvio Berlusconi protagonista sembra trasformarsi sotto gli occhi di tutti .
" Chi si presenta di persona come un Superman non lo è più , chi celebra da solo i suoi atti eroici è diventato un monumento di se stesso che si sgretola ... qualcosa è successo con il premier " .
L'articolo descrive poi Berlusconi come preso da un nuovo nervosismo , anche con accenti isterici ... certo , forse anche prima egli avrebbe ricorso ai suoi avvocati per denunciare una serie di media .
Ma - prosegue Die Welt - è " assolutamente nuovo " l'attacco condotto ' dal suo giornale di casa ' , il Giornale , che ha aperto un conflitto con la conferenza episcopale italiana .
Il premier ha perso il suo istinto strategico ?
Con la vittoria di Pirro delle dimissioni di Boffo per la prima volta ha arrecato gravi danni al principio - tattica ' vivi e lascia vivere ' , in base al quale la Chiesa cattolica ha tollerato finora gli spiriti liberi e i massoni nei partiti di Berlusconi .
Badde ricorda poi come il Giornale ha attaccato persino Fini con l'allusione a dossier piccanti .
E rammenta che non è l'opposizione ad averlo indebolito , ma piuttosto la causa sembra quanto Veronica Lario aveva detto in aprile a Repubblica , cioè che suo marito è ' malato ' .
Da allora , secondo die Welt , egli ha perso il suo senso d'orientamento del potere , finora preciso come quello d'un sonnambulo ... sua moglie ha aperto nell ' Ego di Silvio una ferita che non vuole guarire .
Die
Welt conclude : " L'autunno del patriarca dunque ?
Non necessariamente , perché Silvio Berlusconi , al contrario per esempio di Giulio Andreotti , non è mai stato un patriarca .
Non è nemmeno un dittatore , ma piuttosto un sultano , come il politologo Giovanni sartori ha affermato di recente .
Ma come che sia , si fa autunno attorno a lui .
E'però improbabile che dopo venga una Primavera nel sistema politico italiano .
Verrà Gianfranco Fini , il resto è incertezza " .
The frauds have left a huge dent in the society 's finances The Chelsea Building Society has revealed it has lost £ 41 m ( $ 67 m ) as a result of mortgage frauds involving some of its buy - to - let loans .
The frauds are the main reason for the society staying in the red , with overall losses of £ 26 m in the first half of the year .
The frauds appear to have involved professionals colluding to inflate the value of buy - to - let properties .
The society says the losses emerged after a review of all its loans .
" The society has been through a difficult period and reporting a loss in the first half of the year is disappointing , " said Stuart Bernau , the Chelsea 's chairman and interim chief executive .
" However , the underlying performance is strong , even though we have had to make provision for impairment and fraud losses . "
Last year , the Chelsea lost £ 39 m , the largest annual loss yet recorded by any building society .
Its chief executive agreed to resign earlier this month .
Explanation
The Chelsea explained that the potentially fraudulent loans it had discovered were mainly among buy - to - let loans made between 2006 and 2008 .
MORTGAGE FRAUD Mortgage fraud losses at Bradford & Bingley reach £ 271 m Similar losses at the Chelsea hit £ 41 m
More than 60 mortgage brokers have been banned by the FSA in three years
Rising fines for mortgage fraud
New rules to stop mortgage fraud
It said they were mainly due to " the artificial inflation of property values by third - party professionals involved in the transactions " , such as mortgage brokers and surveyors .
" This is not a massive number of individuals , " said Jeremy Hicks , a spokesman for the society .
He said it had decided to review all its mortgages after losing money with Icelandic banks last year , and had discovered some mortgages that fitted the profile of potential fraud cases .
As a result , the society concluded that it had to set aside £ 41 m in case the suspect loans were crystallised as cash losses .
A team of 12 to 16 people are now going through these cases individually to see if fraud has been committed .
" This could take some time , " Mr Hicks said .
In many of the cases , people are consistently making their repayments , and will be unaware that their home had been valued at more than it was worth .
Nobody has been prosecuted to date , but if evidence emerges , the building society will report this to the relevant authorities .
Mr Hicks added that other building societies would find they were in a similar position if they carried out a similarly thorough review of their own lending .
Earlier this month the now nationalised Bradford & Bingley said it had set aside a further £ 100 m to cover itself against losses from mortgage fraud and " professional negligence " on its loans .
This brought to £ 271 m the amount it has set aside for these problems since the start of 2008 , with the lender saying it had hundreds of cases of potentially fraudulent mortgage applications to resolve .
Niche player
The Chelsea stopped making any new buy - to - let , sub - prime , self - certification or commercial loans at the end of last year .
Ray Boulger of mortgage brokers John Charcol said the Chelsea had not in fact been a big player in buy - to - lending lending .
" It was n't particularly big in that market , the niche area it was most well known for was sub- prime lending . "
Mortgage lenders have been aware for some time of the heightened threat of fraud associated with buy - to - let and newly built properties .
At the beginning of 2008 the Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) warned that products such as " cash - back " deals might exaggerate the apparent market value of a house or flat .
The FSA then told lenders to tighten their defences against fraudulent mortgage applications , typically from dishonest mortgage brokers .
And new rules came into place last September for the conveyancing industry to prevent builders and developers inflating the value of their properties .
The Chelsea is the fourth largest building society in the UK , with 606,000 savers and 34 branches .
Mortgage arrears and falling house prices led the Chelsea to write off a further £ 12 m in the first half of 2009 , in addition to the money set aside for the mortgage fraud .
Its directors said the society was " comparatively well - placed " to deal with the problems of potential further losses and the difficulty of attracting savers , amid fierce competition from other societies and banks .
But the directors said they would " continue to review the strategic options available to the society " , a phrase often used by managements when they are considering seeking a buyer or a merger partner .

Proponents and Opponents Mull Over Marriage Equality in New York »
She had diabetes and high blood pressure .
And she was seeing a hematologist for a dangerously low white - blood - cell count that still was not explained .
None of that helped account for why she was so unsteady on her feet .
Although her legs were weak , Ahmed thought that it was mostly her balance that kept her from walking .
Balance is a function of the nervous system .
Diabetes can damage the nerves of the legs and feet but rarely causes this degree of disability .
Some type of injury to the spinal cord could cause this loss of feeling and coordination .
Had the narrow , bony tube that protects the spinal column been made even narrower by an overgrowth of bone ?
That kind of pressure on the nerves is a relatively common problem as people get older .
Some cancers could do this as well .
A wildly proliferating tumor will sometimes create proteins that attack nerve cells .
And cancer could account for her low white - blood - cell count as well .
Were the two symptoms linked ?
A deficiency of vitamin B12 could affect the nervous system and the production of white blood cells .
And it was also common in people over 60 .
The patient remembered being bitten by a mosquito before her symptoms started .
Could this be the West Nile virus ?
It often attacks the spinal cord , causing weakness that can be permanent .
Ahmed quickly came up with a plan .
Blood tests would show if she had been exposed to the West Nile virus or if she was low on vitamin B12 .
He would also test her for a cancer of the blood that could affect both blood and bone .
The M.R.I. could tell him if the spinal cord was damaged or if she had cancer .
After finishing his notes , Ahmed went to the radiology department to check out the M.R.I. of the patient ’s upper body and spine .
It was normal .
There was no sign of a cancer in the chest , abdomen or pelvis , and no sign of any damage to the spinal cord .
Image Tubes of denture adhesive
The next morning , results of the blood tests began to roll in .
The vitamin B12 level was normal .
She had never been exposed to the West Nile virus .
There was no evidence of any blood cancer , either .
Ahmed saw that the neurologist had ordered some blood tests before sending the patient for the M.R.I. — tests that Ahmed said he would not have thought of running .
Two were strikingly abnormal : she had almost no copper in her system ; and her zinc level was through the roof — more than twice the normal amount .
Ahmed was surprised .
Could abnormalities in these minerals do all this ?
He hurried to a computer to read up .
Robert Sawyer 's Alibis
Back in 2002 , science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer wrote an essay about the trade - off between privacy and security , and came out in favor of less privacy .
I disagree with most of what he said , and have written pretty much the opposite essay — and others on the value of privacy and the future of privacy — several times since then .
The point of this blog entry is n’t really to debate the topic , though .
It ’s to reprint the opening paragraph of Sawyer ’s essay , which I ’ve never forgotten :
Whenever I visit a tourist attraction that has a guest register , I always sign it .
After all , you never know when you ’ll need an alibi .
Since I read that , whenever I see a tourist attraction with a guest register , I do the same thing .
I sign “ Robert J. Sawyer , Toronto , ON ” — because you never know when he ’ll need an alibi .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/15 ) : Sawyer ’s essay now has a preface , which states that he wrote it to promote a book of his :
The following was written as promotion for my science - fiction novel Hominids , and does not necessarily reflect the author ’s personal views .
In the comments below , though , Sawyer says that the essay does not reflect his personal views .
So I ’m not sure about the waffling on the essay page .
I am completely surprised that Sawyer ’s essay was fictional .
For years I thought that he meant what he wrote , that it was a non-fiction essay written for a non-fiction publication .
He has other essays on his website ; I have no idea if any of those reflect his personal views .
The whole thing makes absolutely no sense to me .

Ever since the early days of radio , science fiction has found a natural expression via audio broadcasting .
The speculative themes of the finest SF seem ideally suited to be shared by the dramatic presentation of the spoken word .
Over the decades , SF has left a lasting mark on audiences who have heard it through the airwaves , on audiobook tapes and CDs , and in person , read aloud .
With the advent of the podcasting revolution , however , a new frontier opened for the expression and celebration of quality SF literature .
One of the leading pioneers of that frontier was StarShipSofa and its Aural Delights program .
Led by host Tony C. Smith , StarShipSofa became more than a podcast ; it grew into a new , vibrant , wholly 21st - century creature : an Audio Science Fiction Magazine .
In its first 100 programs , StarShipSofa ’s Aural Delights has offered exemplary readings of fiction by many of the luminaries of the SF field , from those whose works define the genre , to those newly recognized as ascending stars in its firmament .
In so doing , StarShipSofa has raised the bar for other SF podcasting endeavors to come while introducing new audiences to fantastic poetry , flash fiction , short stories , and novellas .
StarShipSofa now invites its listeners to celebrate its first 100 programs in the most traditional and classic of ways : by reading some of the excellent works it has been privileged to present in audio form .
This exceptional collection offers a reminder of all that StarShipSofa and its contributing authors and narrators have accomplished in the field of SF ; it also stands as a promise for the next 100 episodes of Aural Delights and all of the wonder they will share .
StarShipSofa Stories Volume 1
A 15 - YEAR - OLD girl whose family was murdered while she was overseas on a school trip learnt of their deaths on the social networking site Facebook .
A friend of Brenda Lin , who is the only surviving member of her immediate family , posted the horrific news on the schoolgirls Facebook page .
Min and Yun Li Lilly Lin , their sons Henry , 12 , and Terry , 9 , and Brendas aunt Yun Bin Irene 
Yin , were bludgeoned to death while asleep at the familys home in North Epping , Sydney , on July 18 .
Police are yet to make any arrests .
Brenda had been due to arrive home from a one - week school trip to New Caledonia on July 20 , but as a result of the news , the group returned a day earlier .
At Best Buy's Zune HD preview today a certain Matthew Arkin on Qik was able to shoot footage of the " Apps " item that resides within the " Marketplace " section on the device .
It 's still incredibly unclear what Microsoft 's plans are for that functionality -- they 've long admitted its existence , but have waffled on the name and have been reticent to show it off in meetings with us .
Microsoft so far has only promised to have applications on par with the games currently available for Zune , but there 's obviously a lot of implied competition with Apple 's App Store that the word " Apps " on a touchscreen device conjures up .
On video ( embedded after the break ) the rep is asked if there 's an SDK , and apparently Matthew got a " yes " offscreen , but we 're not really sure of the veracity of that statement , or what it means for developers at the moment -- hopefully good , freedom - ey things .

Hi Readers —
Here ’s a note from puzzlemeister Eric Berlin , author of The Puzzling World of Winston Breen .
Read it and peep .
Er…weep :
I ’m an author of middle - grade novels , and as such I have a lot of interaction with elementary school kids .
I ’m glad to say I have n’t often come in contact with the kind of paranoia you document on your blog , but today that changed :
I was setting up a phone call with a 4th - grade teacher and her class — they live a good thousand miles across the country from me .
I let her know that I have Skype , so nobody needs incur any long - distance charges .
Her response via e-mail just now : “ Is there a way to Skype with us being able to see you , but you not being able to see us ?
Due to confidentiality and other school district guidelines , I am hoping this is a possibility . ”
Truly , I am speechless .
I ’m just glad this wo n’t be an in - person school visit , because it would be really awkward wearing a blindfold all day , lest I actually lay eyes on these kids .
Hey Eric : Children are our most precious resource .
If we do n’t protect them from technology - assisted remote - site author visits , who will ?

Scientists from the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth are calling for urgent research to understand the impact of renewable energy developments on marine life .
The study , now published in the Journal of Applied Ecology , highlights potential environmental benefits and threats resulting from marine renewable energy , such as off - shore wind farms and wave and tidal energy conversion devices .
The research highlights the capacity for marine renewable energy devices to boost local biodiversity and benefit the wider marine environment .
Man -made structures on the sea bed attract many marine organisms and sometimes become ' artifical reefs ' , for example , supporting a wide variety of fish .
The study also points out that such devices could have negative environmental impacts , resulting from habitat loss , collision risks , noise and electromagnetic fields .
The study highlights the gaps in our understanding of the effects of marine renewable energy devices on the health of our oceans .
The team calls for more research to improve our understanding of these threats and opportunities .
The researchers also stress the importance of considering the impact on marine life when selecting locations for the installation of marine energy devices .
Corresponding author Dr Brendan Godley of the University of Exeter said : " Marine renewable energy is hugely exciting and it is vital that we explore the potential for it to provide a clean and sustainable energy source .
However , to date research into the impact of marine renewable energy on sea life has been very limited . .
Our study highlights the urgent need for more research into the impacts of marine renewable energy on marine life .
This will involve biologists , engineers and policy - makers working together to ensure we really understand the risks and opportunities for marine life . "
Professor Martin Attrill , Director of the University of Plymouth Marine Institute said : " Our paper highlights the need to take a fresh look at the effect marine renewable energy generation has on the environment if we are to deliver a higher proportion of energy from renewable sources and start to combat climate change .
We need to have the industry working directly with conservation bodies to plan the next phase of development .
We suggest further research could demonstrate the potential of security zones around , for example , wave farms to act as Marine Protected Areas .
Therefore , if all stakeholders can work together in a coordinated way we can possibly address two key issues - combating climate change and creating a network of MPAs .
We need the research on environmental impact to help move the whole field forward . "
This study was carried out by PRIMaRE ( the Peninsula Research Institute for Marine Renewable Energy ) , a joint £ 15 million institute for research into harnessing the energy from the sea bringing together the technology and marine expertise of the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth .
A couple who relied on homeopathic treatments for their eczema - stricken baby daughter have been jailed over her death .
Thomas Sam , 42 , and his wife Manju , 37 , were found guilty of the most serious case of manslaughter by criminal negligence .
The judge said their nine - month - old daughter Gloria had suffered helplessly and unnecessarily from a treatable condition and sentenced the pair to a total of 10 years behind bars .
Thomas
Sam got the longer sentence of at least six years because , as a homeopath , he had a double duty of care .
Minutes after he was handcuffed , his wife Manju was taken into custody for the first time .
She was jailed for four years .
Their daughter Gloria was so sick with eczema that she constantly cried in pain , her skin broken and oozing fluid , the court heard .
Both parents were well educated and the judge found they should have known better .
They repeatedly rejected conventional medical treatment and instead opted for homeopathic remedies .
Then , against doctors ' orders , they took the baby girl to India where her condition deteriorated .
Judge Peter Johnson concluded it was the " most serious case of manslaughter by criminal negligence " .
The couple wept as Justice Johnson detailed the pain their daughter would have experienced .
He said they should have known just how sick she was .
Instead they delayed her treatment at hospital because Manju said they were tired and jetlagged .
She died three days after being admitted to hospital .
" She was very a very sick infant with eroding skin , her distress would have been apparent to her parents , " Justice Johnson said .
Dejected supporters left court still reeling from the judgment .
For Thomas Sam , his legal fight is not over as he faces separate charges , accused of threatening his lawyers .
Newt Gingrich offers advice on what Sarah Palin needs to do to keep her presidential options open .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Newt 's advice for Palin comeback
If Sarah Palin wants to make a 2012 political comeback , she ’ll need three types of speeches , some serious television face time , a credible organization and a bucket load of sheer determination .
Oh , and she might want to get a place outside of Alaska , somewhere in the lower 48 .
Advertisement
That ’s some of the advice former House Speaker Newt Gingrich offered when POLITICO asked him what Palin needs to do to keep her presidential options open .
Since he ’s among the few to come close to pulling off what Palin , the ex-governor of Alaska , may ultimately seek to do , Gingrich is uniquely qualified to comment .
The former Georgia congressman has been out of elected office for more than decade , yet he ’s a perennial on the Republican Party ’s presidential watch lists , and he is regularly consulted by party insiders for strategic and policy advice .
It ’s a feat of political levitation that was n’t achieved by accident or through some natural political order .
In politics , power and influence are fluid assets , won and lost in a perpetual competition between rising newcomers , established players and fading stars .
Operating at the pinnacle of power requires a strategy for getting there and staying there .
Gingrich had such a plan — and it ’s one that he says could be tweaked to work for Palin , too .
Essentially there are six elements to his approach :
1. Write a book .
Palin is already set to do that , which Gingrich applauds .
A book , he said , helps a politician lay out his or her philosophy and experiences in their own unhurried words .
It also helps score TV time , which in turn helps sell books , he added .
2. Land a regular commentator slot on television .
It ’s a sure way for an outsider to stay inside the national dialogue and in touch with the incumbents , activists and strategists who can help launch a comeback .
3. Consider getting a condominium in New York or Washington .
An East Coast base of operations would ease what could become an onerous travel schedule from Alaska .
4. Write and master three types of speeches .
One speech “ is to make money , ” he said , and should be something smart and entertaining .
The second set of speeches includes what Gingrich calls “ high - value ” addresses designed to be delivered before major interest groups and universities , enabling Palin to “ project her brand . ”
The third speech , of course , is a campaign stump speech that she can take on the road in 2010 to help Republican candidates raise money and gain attention .
5. Create some sort of national project or center .
This can serve as a base for her political return and an incubator for ideas and action on issues .
A National Energy Project , Gingrich said , would be a natural for Palin .
6 . Plan on working really , really hard .
Many ex-politicians confuse being a celebrity with being a serious political player , Gingrich said .
“ She can be a personality for a long time , ” he said .
“ But that is very different from becoming a national leader . ”
Of course , even if Palin follows such a path , there are no guarantees .
Gingrich has cut a high profile through speeches , books and a campaign - style organization and website that regularly issues updates on his activities and constantly refreshes his list of donors and supporters .
His policy analysis on energy , health care and other issues are respected — although maybe not embraced — by both conservatives and liberals .
Just last week , Gingrich was stopped in a Capitol hallway by Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , a member of the bipartisan team of senators working on health care reform legislation .
“ I ’ve read everything you ’ve got , ” said Grassley , clutching Gingrich ’s hand .
Despite all that , Gingrich has yet to see the kind of “ Draft Newt ” movement that could lure him onto the presidential field .
In fact , the last Oval Office aspirant to dust himself off after a national defeat , stay in the game , and go on to win the White House was Ronald Reagan — and that was 30 years ago .
Many have tried to replicate that magic , including Dan Quayle , John Edwards and Jack Kemp , to name a few .
But , despite all their promises that they ’d be back , they all fell far short of Reagan ’s comeback .
Some of them lost because they overestimated their star power , some turned out to lack the requisite skill set , and others failed to build the type of machine that Gingrich describes , a vehicle that can command attention in the wilderness years .
Reagan ’s political recovery plan , which was relatively innovative for its time , included regular radio addresses and newspaper columns .
The disciplined writing schedule helped Reagan refine his thinking on policy and spread his message between 1976 and the launch of his second presidential campaign in 1979 .
Palin , like Reagan , is a galvanizing figure for conservatives .
( She also drives liberals crazy , like he did . )
And she exhibited plenty of raw political talent last year running beside John McCain on the Republican ticket .
But first and foremost , Gingrich said , Palin “ has to be clear in her own head what she wants to do . ”
Palin has said she is still mulling her options .
Her rambling farewell speech in Alaska seemed to suggest a fair amount of ambivalence about what course she ’ll take .
In that speech , Palin cast herself as both a victim of the national media and Hollywood and a fighter tough enough to stay in the political fray and stand up for conservative values .
Her lack of clarity left Alaskans in a muddle , too .
A statewide poll conducted after the speech showed a steep drop in her favorability ratings , with 48 percent viewing her negatively and 46 percent viewing her positively .
The negative perception at home is even more pronounced on the national level , which raises one of the biggest hurdles to a Reagan - like comeback for Palin .
Where Reagan used humor to disarm his opponents and win new converts , Palin uses it to eviscerate adversaries , an approach that can intimidate and alienate the unconverted .
Reagan ’s good - guy roles from his Hollywood days helped make him a familiar and likable figure , whereas the television parodies of Palin diminished her .
A recent NBC / Wall Street Journal poll found that 67 percent of Americans , including 43 percent of Republicans , would not like to see her as president someday .
Still , Gingrich believes she can overcome the caricatures and the poll numbers but that “ she has to decide how serious she wants to be about becoming a national leader . ”
Today we ’re going to discuss some of the best time travel movies .
Being a life - long Doctor
Who fan , I ’ve got a soft spot for time travel stories regardless of the medium – film , television , novel , audio , comic , etc .
Before we get to that , I gotta describe to you where I ’m sitting as I write this .
Since today is my birthday , I think you can indulge me for a paragraph or two ( truthfully , I ’m writing this on Monday afternoon and scheduling it to post on Wednesday , my birthday .
Geez , semantics ! ) .
I ’m currently sitting on the balcony of my 14th floor hotel room in Fort Lauderdale .
The sky is a gorgeous blue , there is a slight breeze , and the temperature is warm and relaxing without being too hot .
Tropical music is being carried upon the wind up to my room from the Tiki Bar below .
My balcony overlooks the beautiful pool , a marina full of impressive yachts , and the majestic river .
In the distance you can see downtown Fort Lauderdale and the Atlantic Ocean .
It ’s so relaxing sitting here watching the boats idle their way up and down the river , the seagulls floating on the gentle breeze , letting the music flow through me , and generally unwinding .
It does n’t get much better than this .
Okay … back to the topic at hand .
My top 10 favorite time travel movies !

Possibly the greatest time travel movie of all time .
You ca n’t deny that Michael J. Fox is one of the best comedy - drama actors of the 1980s .
Also worth mentioning are Parts II and III .
Those are fun films , but the first one stands out as the best .
Bill & Ted ’s Excellent Adventure – Two headbanger idiots with a time machine !
Just goofy , ridiculous fun .
If you do n’t like this movie , you have no sense of humor .
Do n’t watch the sequel .
The Time Traveler ’s Wife – A surprisingly good film !
I did n’t exactly want to see this , especially after discovering that Eric Bana had a leading role .
However , they used time travel superbly in this film .
I highly recommend this one to anyone with an interest in time travel stories , or anyone who likes complex love stories .
Planet of the Apes ( 1968 version ) – Powerful tale of racial politics and a warning of the human race ’s destructive nature .
While time travel is n’t a major plot point throughout the movie , there is no denying the impact it provided at the end .
Groundhog Day – A really fun Bill Murray ’s film !
A romantic comedy that uses time travel very cleverly .
Also , one of cable televisions most aired movies ever .
Seriously , go turn on your TV right now .
It ’s probably on .
Somewhere in Time – A time travel romance starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour .
Wonderful love story set in the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island , Michigan .
Christopher Reeves was such an amazing actor !
It ’s a shame he did n’t have the opportunity to make more films .
Interesting to note , a friend of my family had a bit part in this movie .
Neat !
Star Trek : First Contact – Such a good movie !
This film rivals Wrath of Khan as being the best Trek movie .
Though time travel provided the framework for this film , this movie is more about action and intrigue than time travel .
Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home – Probably the most fun Star Trek movie .
While this film lacked the typical Star Trek space battles , it made up for it with acting and time travel hijinks .
I still enjoy this movie every time I watch it .
Terminator 2 : Judgment Day – I remember thinking when I saw this movie in the theater , “ There will never be a movie made with more action than this . ”
I was obviously wrong , but the amount of action in that movie for the time was insane !
This film did a good job exploring the “ inevitable future ” aspect of time travel .
The first Terminator movie was also great , but I personally enjoy the second one more .
Time After Time – A 1979 suspense thriller starring Malcolm McDowell and David Warner .
H.G. Wells ( McDowell ) pursues Jack the Ripper ( Warner ) to the 20th Century when the serial murderer uses the Well ’s own time machine to escape his time period .
This film was directed by Nicholas Meyer , who went on to direct Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .
Good movie .
You should check it out .
Here are a few other films I really enjoy that are n’t necessarily time travel movies , but contain temporal phenomena or alternate timelines :
Frequency – A really smart film starring Dennis Quaid .
In the movie an accidental cross -time ham radio connects father and son across 30 years .
The son tries to save his father ’s life , but then must fix the consequences .
If you ’ve never seen this film , it ’s a MUST !
It ’s a Wonderful Life – My absolute favorite Christmas movie of all time .
While not about time travel specifically , it does explore an alternate timeline without Jimmy Stewart ’s character .
Scrooged – Bill Murray at his best !
This modern retelling of Charles Dickens ’ A Christmas Carol is lots of fun .
While it may feel a bit dated as it ’s 20 years old , it ’s still a nice update to this classic story .
I ’m sure some of you are thinking of other fantastic time travel movies that I left off the list .
If so , let me know in the comments .
I did consider every film on Andy ’s Anachronisms list of time travel movies .
Here are some of the films I definitely rejected from my list of favorites ..
Okay , your turn .
Tell me I ’m right .
Tell me I ’m wrong .
What are your favorites ?
Media Matters has obtained video showing a member of the Fox News production crew stage - managing a 9/12 protest crowd for a Griff Jenkins live shot :
Although this video provides a clear - cut example of Fox propaganda in action , the only thing truly shocking about it is that it wo n't wake up real journalists to the fact that just about every single thing you see on Fox is manufactured .
They are an infotainment channel for conservatives , not a real media outlet .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
VICTORIA AND ALBERT : RULERS , PARTNERS , RIVALS
By Gillian Gill
Ballantine , $ 35 , 480 pages
Reviewed by Muriel Dobbin
The title of this biography is drawn from letters and documents in which Queen Victoria and Prince Albert called themselves “ we two , ” emphasizing that theirs was a love match , and apparently it was .
Royal marriages tended to be a mixed bag when it came to compatibility because whether the couple actually liked each other was not considered as important as their obedience to the requirements of exalted position .
However , in the case of Victoria and Albert , she was by all accounts even more in love with him than he was with her , and he was “ pleased to be adored . ”
His premature death plunged her and Britain into decades of mourning that did nothing for the country or her reputation for responsibility .
Gillian Gill has written an entertaining and well - researched account of the Victorian way of life at its highest levels , although her dedication to disentangling the tortuous royal - family structures in Germany as well as England occasionally becomes wearying .
On the other hand , she offers interesting and surprising insights into Victoria ’s attitude toward pregnancy and children .
The young queen hated being pregnant , and her attitude toward her nine children might be described as dutiful at best .
The ubiquitous nurse - and - nanny system relieved the queen of most of the difficult tasks of motherhood , but she was faced with an ironic situation in that while she apparently could n’t get enough of Albert , in another era , she would have made the most of family planning .
What is most moving about the story of the marriage is that within it , according to Ms. Gill , the couple found the affection , companionship and trust that neither had known as a child .
Victoria embodied the English capacity for a steel backbone , and she needed it as heir to the throne in a household full of malice and caprice , with her formidable mother as her protagonist .
Albert had to carve out his own path , using his power as Victoria ’s husband to manipulate and maneuver through the hedge of British bureaucracy and showing the kind of diplomatic skill that kept Britain out of the American Civil War .
Yet even the queen acknowledged that on many levels , Albert was much stricter than she .
“ From the first days of her reign she had shown herself to be both respectable and responsible and yet not straitlaced or judgmental .
Her husband was all four , and became more so each year , ” Ms. Gill writes .
The “ war on sin ” that Albert waged zealously at the Court of St. James ’s was “ not wholly rational , ” according to the author .
She points out that while , strategically , Albert ’s obsession with morality met certain goals for the queen and the monarchy , tactically it spelled disaster for the prince , who was “ rash enough to set himself up at the age of twenty as moral arbiter to his adopted nation . ”
Victoria reached the English throne as a teenager and was married at 21 .
The two were indeed “ rulers , partners and rivals , ” and she idolized Albert , who , nevertheless , was deeply disappointed that his marriage to the English queen did not mean any degree of independence in running her household .
Lord Melbourne , Victoria ’s beloved mentor and prime minister , held the real power .
Poor Albert was told he could bring with him from Germany his librarian , his valet and his greyhound .
Victoria did her best to mollify her husband by bestowing such honors as granting him precedence next to her own and making him a field marshal in the British army .
“ But all these things were in her power , ” the author notes , ” and there was the rub .
Power , not protection , was what Albert sought from his wife . ”
Her Cabinet made sure Her Majesty gave away nothing that was hers .
A member of the group close to her , Charles Greville , “ a cynical man , was sure that in her heart of hearts , Victoria was not sorry her husband would remain so financially and socially dependent on her . ”
Victoria was an adoring and dutiful wife , observes Ms. Gill , when she was alone with her husband , “ But when the two emerged from the bedroom each morning , he fell into step behind her . ”
The author emphasizes that while Victoria sensed that marriage and motherhood held the key to her dynastic success , her people “ did not love her husband because he was her ideal man . ”
The queen expected fidelity , companionship , comfort and security from her husband , yet she was “ like a fat tiger , content with the cage , answering to the whip , but lashing out from time to time and daring her tamer to get careless . ”
By 42 , however , she was a widow , and no one was ever allowed to forget it , with the possible exception of John Brown , a Scottish ghillie at Balmoral who took her riding and got her attention .
After the death of her husband , Brown , a handsome and dominant figure , had enough influence over the queen — whom he persuaded to go on picnics in the Scottish Highlands — that there were mild flurries of scandal about her attachment to him .
As the author puts it , tongue in cheek , “ The Queen was never safer than when she wandered the roads … riding her pony or driving her trap with a single companion by her side , a tiny woman in a giant bonnet , a plaid shawl and a muddy tweed skirt , startlingly , deliciously , daringly ‘ alone . ’ ”
What is sad is that the “ friendly , athletic , impulsive ” Albert , who would celebrate a military victory by “ grabbing the first clothes to hand and dashing headlong to drink whisky and dance and shout around the bonfire with all the local men , ” never emerges , and evidently , that was no accident .
Ms. Gill asserts , “ No one could fill the symbolic function of the monarchy better than the Queen .
She was still the marquee attraction .
Prince Albert was merely her understudy , and these were the basic facts though neither the Queen nor the prince liked to look them in the face . ”

Krise des Konservativen
Wie ich aus Versehen ein Linker wurde
Sein Vater war CDU - Politiker , er selbst kiffte und lebte in einer Mao - WG - zum Linken aber wurde Matthias Matussek erst jetzt in der Krise .
Denn die Konservativen führen seiner Ansicht nach einen Klassenkampf von oben : Sie zertrümmern Werte , heiligen Kaltschnäuzigkeit und öde Lifestyle - Spießerei .
SANDY , Utah 
For all its struggles to reach the elite ranks of international competition , the United States soccer team has been able to rely on success against El Salvador .
The games have been trusted vehicles in taking the Americans toward World Cup qualification .
So the United States ’ 2 - 1 victory on Saturday night will be not be remembered for how the Americans came back from a deficit against the Salvadorans , but for how the Americans emerged unscathed and a step closer to South Africa in 2010 .
“ We figured this is a game we should get 3 points from , ” United States midfielder Clint Dempsey said .
Those points for Saturday ’s win gave the United States 13 in the final round of qualifying and tied them with Honduras at the top of the standings in the Concacaf region .
Honduras , which routed Trinidad and Tobago , 4 - 1 , leads the Americans on goal difference .
Mexico and Costa Rica are tied for third with 12 points after Mexico ’s 3 - 0 win in San José .
Authorities announced charges Thursday against a Mexican gang that took Tijuana - style violence to the upscale suburbs of San Diego County , kidnapping , torturing and killing well - to - do residents , even after some families paid large ransoms .
The gang , a rogue cell of the Tijuana - based Arellano Felix drug cartel , moved across the border in 2002 and posed as U.S. law enforcement , donning FBI and police uniforms and caps while snatching victims outside homes and public places , said San Diego County prosecutors .
Nine victims were killed from 2004 to 2007 , and the bodies of two of them were dissolved in chemicals at a rented house in San Diego .
Gang members were also charged with trying to murder a Chula Vista police officer in September 2005 , peppering his car with high - caliber bullets before fleeing in a car .
The gang targeted people it suspected of having links to organized crime , although some victims had no known ties , authorities said .
Prosecutors charged 17 defendants , including gang leader Jorge Rojas Lopez , who is serving a life sentence for one of the abductions .
Eight of those charged Thursday remain at large .
The others are in custody on previous charges .
“ This rogue group of individuals is responsible for a string of brutal murders and kidnappings that demonstrate the ugly reality of cross - border violence , ” said San Diego County Dist .
Atty . Bonnie M. Dumanis .
Spillover crime from Tijuana ’s gang wars is relatively small , given the scale and brutality of the violence there .
Nevertheless , the gang ’s migration to the San Diego area reinforces concern that border vigilance is no match for Mexican organized crime .
After Arellano - Felix cartel members in 2002 killed Lopez ’s brother in a gangland dispute , he moved his cell across the border to stage retaliatory attacks against anyone suspected of cartel links , according to authorities .
A series of drug rip - offs , robberies and ransom kidnappings followed .
The gang , called the Palillos -- Spanish for toothpicks -- also got involved in drug trafficking , according to authorities .
Police started getting chilling reports of criminals using tactics typically seen only on the streets of Tijuana : Men dressed in police uniforms and bullet - proof vests snatching victims in daylight and throwing them into cars before speeding off into traffic .
Bodies bearing signs of torture were dumped .
The crimes haunted residents in such suburbs as Chula Vista and Bonita , where many prominent Tijuana families had moved to escape violence only to find that criminals had followed and blended into the cookie - cutter anonymity of American suburbia .
The veteran gang prosecutor leading the case , Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Mark Amador , said the gang was the most vicious he ’s ever prosecuted .
“ I ’ve never seen a more ruthless , cold - blooded , sociopathic group , ” he said .
A break in the investigation came in June 2007 , when an FBI SWAT team raided a two - story home in Chula Vista where a Mexican businessman had been held captive for eight days .
Lopez and four others were arrested , paving the way for more victims to step forward .
The DNA analysis of the evidence , authorities said , was the largest undertaken by the San Diego Police Department , a two - year effort staffed by three full - time analysts .
The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the San Diego County Sheriff ’s Department also assisted .
Of the 17 defendants , nine are in custody ; some of them already have been convicted on other charges .
Of the eight fugitives , some are believed to have fled to Mexico .
U.S. authorities said their Mexican counterparts are assisting in the investigation .
Some of the gang members were U.S. citizens who lived in upscale homes .
They rented several other residences where they kept hostages .
Neighbors , authorities said , would see groups of young men coming and going but did n’t suspect criminal activity .
The Chula Vista case in June 2007 was typical of the murky methods used in the crimes .
The victim , Eduardo Gonzalez Tostado , a Baja California champion off - road racer , went to the home expecting to meet a woman .
Instead he was beaten , cuffed , shot with a Taser and thrown into a small room .
Family members eventually paid nearly $ 200,000 in ransom money .
At the trial , defense attorneys , citing FBI interviews , alleged that Gonzalez had smuggled drugs for the cartel .
Gonzalez , in his testimony , denied the accusation .
The Chula Vista officer attacked in 2005 was responding to an attempted abduction .
After a chase through residential neighborhoods , the suspects ’ car stopped near a shopping center and two gunmen jumped out .
One stood on each side of the car as they fired more than a dozen rounds .
The officer ducked inside his car and escaped injury .
He has left the force , citing stress from the assault , according to Amador , the prosecutor .

Today , I was looking in the refrigerator for something to drink .
I found a jug of lemonade with a piece of paper on it saying " Mom 's Lemonade , Do n't Drink ! "
I was really thirsty , so I ignored it and drank the whole jug .
My mom is about to have a colonoscopy and had filled it with laxatives .

Wells tries to keep stake in student loans
Student loans are the next economic sector to be taken by USAGov.
Inc. Today , Rep. George Miller , D - Martinez , introduces the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act , which would put the $ 100 billion - a - year guaranteed student loan program entirely in the hands of the feds .
Banks such as San Francisco 's Wells Fargo & Co. could be shut out from their long - standing involvement in the program .
There will be ( a ) resistance to what some will see as the next step in our march to socialism ; ( b ) concern that the scheduled July 2010 changeover is too soon to be absorbed by the 4,400 or so colleges affected ; and ( c ) suggestions that a private - sector component side by side with the government program would make for healthy competition , thereby enhancing the program 's overall effectiveness .
Do n't bank on any of the above to alter the bill 's trajectory .
In a statement , Wells Fargo said it believes the changes " will have unintended consequences that are not in the best interest of the students and their families . "
It did not elaborate on those consequences , including what they might mean for Wells , which has been one of the more prominent banks in the student loan business .
John Dean , counsel for the Consumer Bankers Association , said private banks are probably relieved to get out of the origination business , which , in these credit crunch days , has become more trouble than it 's worth .
Besides , fees earned handling student loans are small potatoes on most banks ' balance sheets , including Wells ' , he believes .
Bank critics think such fees have been more lucrative .
In Dean 's view , however , the contacts that banks establish with youthful borrowers via the loan program are truly worth their weight in gold .
Think future customers .
Last month , the Department of Educationchose among six finalists , including Wells Fargo , for long - term contracts to service its existing direct loans .
Unfortunately , Wells did n't make the chosen four .
However , I 'm told , the proposed government takeover of the entire guaranteed student loan program will " build on " the department 's choices .
Which leaves Wells in there with a chance .

Affordable housing : Seems like only yesterday ( it was August ) when real estate mogul Victor MacFarlane put his 20,000 - square - foot penthouse in San Francisco 's St. Regis Residences on the block for a princely $ 70 million .
Now , the real estate blog Curbed SF informs us , the price for his unfinished six - bed , six - bath home - away - from - home has been reduced to a serflike $ 49 million .
Quite a comedown for the proprietor of MacFarlane Partners , the S.F. real estate investment firm with $ 11 billion under management the last time we checked .
Almost as low as the $ 39.5 million asking price for that brick Tudor Revival in Pacific Heights once owned by the late " King of Torts , " Melvin Belli .

A few days ago , I stumbled across a handful of pictures from my college dorm room ( I considered posting them , but there are several people depicted and I do n’t post pictures of people without asking them permission and I ’m not sure how to contact them ) .
As I looked them over ( and enjoyed some memories ) , I could n’t help but look at the background of the pictures , just to see how I lived then .
What I saw was a lot of clutter .
A fridge I rarely used .
A robe I think I used once .
A big rack of rarely - watched videos .
Way more clothes than I ever needed .
Lots of little tchotchkes that just took up space .
When I was first planning for college , I had little idea what I was doing .
I read lots of “ here ’s how to get ready for college ” articles and vacuumed up the suggestions like a Hoover on overdrive .
I spent the entire summer collecting and buying things I ’d need for college .
When we finally arrived on campus , I had a pickup truck full of stuff .
It filled up my half of a tiny dorm room .
A dorm fridge .
A microwave .
A big television .
A computer tower ( actually , I did n’t get that one until I was on campus a while ) and a monitor .
A desk lamp .
A giant teapot .
A ridiculously huge shower bucket stuffed with stuff .
Clothes that overflowed my dresser .
Virtually all of it was a waste of my time and my money .
I did n’t use any of that stuff .
I had little idea what I would actually use in advance , so I just more or less bought everything that I thought I might need – and it turned out I did n’t need most of it .
If I started college all over again , I could fit everything I ’d use in a single backpack .
Here ’s what I ’d take .
A laptop with a webcam and microphone
This would take care of all of my research needs , report - writing needs , and , yes , telephone call needs .
I suppose I might also take a prepaid phone with me for uses where I did n’t have a wi- fi signal .
A small reading lamp
For studying and taking notes in dim lighting .
I ’d get a very tiny clip one that could go anywhere , powered by LEDs .
Enough clothes for about five days or so , rolled up tight Nothing fancy , just sturdy pants , shirts , and underclothes .
I can do laundry once every five days or so .
Some basic toiletries Gotta keep clean .
Notebooks and writing supplies Obviously , for note - taking purposes .
I find that taking notes longhand is the way for me to absorb complex ideas , but some people might find that just typing on their laptop might work – it depends on how you learn , which you should already know before college .
I ’d also need textbooks , of course , but I could get them when I arrive via Amazon and re-sell them at semester ’s end .
Sure , I might find that I needed some more items along the way , but would n’t it be better to find out the items that you actually need rather than buying a bunch of stuff you think you might need in advance ?
Doing that saves money .
It saves a lot of time .
It saves space .
It saves a lot of mental energy .
It gives you a very clean and open space to rest your head and figure out what comes next in your life .
The next time you read a long list of things that people say you “ need ” for college , ask yourself a simple question : do you need it , or is it just something that seems like it might be useful ?
If it merely seems like it might be useful – even if you can envision a lot of scenarios where you ’ll be using it – hold off .
Pick it up later on .
My gameplan when I send my own children off to college is similar .
I intend to send them with the minimum amount of stuff they need – basically , the stuff listed above , with variation based on the technology at that time .
If they find they actually need more items , they can either use their own savings to get them or make the case to me with regards to it .
They ’ll save time .
They ’ll save money .
They ’ll save energy .
And in a college dorm , what exactly will they lose ?

The Social Condenser project is located at the base of the Superstition Mountain Range in the Town of Superior , Arizona which was founded in 1882 and has strong ties to mining of copper , silver and gold .
The project is uniquely positioned between historic Main Street and Queen Creek .
The site consists of two parcels , the project parcel to the north and an open landscaped parcel to be developed into future outdoor dining and music pavilion , and is bisected by an access path from the upper street level and a lower wooden footbridge that spans across the creek .
The project is a renovation and expansion of an existing two - story block building and addition of an exterior dining terrace .
The lower level is developed into kitchen , mechanical and storage spaces and the upper level is designed as an open gathering space .
The south - facing wall of the upper level of the existing building is removed to expose the volume within .
The remaining form is rendered to closely match the shadow tones of the surrounding hills and acts as both backdrop and anchor for the new addition .
The project was informed by the concept of the “ public house ” .
Classically an obscured , introverted diagram , the Social Condenser conversely aims to balance concealment with exuberant exposure of the internal activities to the streetscape , the pedestrian walking path and the adjacent landscaped parcel .
The project is envisioned to be the living room of the community ; a place to congregate , socialize , view work of provincial artists and enjoy the breathtaking landscape vistas that envelop the region .
The project utilizes a reduced palette of cool - toned materials .
Expanded aluminum panels , with fine openings , sheaths the street wall and entry canopy and draws the visitor to the stair tower that subtlety rotates to orient the visitor to the adjacent parcel and the new main entry door .
The tower is wrapped in the same aluminum material and conceals an open expanse of grey glass behind it .
Upon entry , the visitor is greeted with the expansive view of the creek and identifies that the twist of the floor plan geometry now aligns the building with the axis of the wooden footbridge and the creek .
The visitor then continues the spiraling journey around the open common space , through a large operable glass wall panel out to the dining terrace prow with a sweeping view of the full extent of the creek in the foreground and Apache Leap rock formation in the distant hills .
Formally , the exterior of the building evokes movement as the new form of the project nestles into its site condition .
Clad entirely in engineered wood planking , made from recycled wood and plastic , the formidable mass of northeastern end of the new terrace is mitigated by undercutting the form and creating a hyperbolic parabola surface .
This form is counterbalanced by a parabolic surface that sweeps outward towards the southwest and is bracketed by the stair volume .

Thanh Nien -- August 10 , 2009 , was the first Orange Day organised in Vietnam –- not only to be remembered by victims of Agent Orange but to mark Vietnam 's common pain .
Those responsible for exposing Vietnamese citizens and US troops to toxic defoliants kept silent about known health implications , a review of documents finds .
US chemical companies that made Agent Orange and the government and military authorities who ordered its spraying on Vietnam knew the human health toll it could take , according to official and unofficial documents detailing the history of the deadly defoliant .
A review of the documents related to the use of Agent Orange –- a dioxin - laden herbicide -– in Vietnam , including decades - old declassified papers from the companies that manufactured it and the government and military that used it , provides compelling evidence that those in charge also concealed evidence of the devastating effects it could have on people .
A declassified letter by V.K. Rowe at Dow's Biochemical Research Library to Bioproducts Manager Ross Milholland dated June 24 , 1965 clearly states that the company knew the dioxin in their products , including Agent Orange , could hurt people .
In reference to 2,4,5 - trichlorophenol and 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzodioxin ( components of Agent Orange ) , Rowe stated :
“ This material is exceptionally toxic ; it has a tremendous potential for producing chloracne and systemic injury . ”
Rowe worried the company would suffer if word got out .
“ The whole 2,4,5 - T industry would be hard hit and I would expect restrictive legislation , either barring the material or putting very rigid controls upon it . ”
So he said the company should keep quiet about the toxicity : “ There is no reason why we can not get this problem under strict control and thereby hopefully avoid restrictive legislation ...
I trust you will be very judicious in your use of this information .
It could be quite embarrassing if it were misinterpreted or misused ...
P.S. Under no circumstances may this letter be reproduced , shown , or sent to anyone outside of Dow . ”
Dow played its cards right , never getting in serious trouble .
The spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam went on for another six years .
Dow did not return phone calls and emails requesting comment on the Agent Orange issue .
‘ Undisputed ’
In the latest case of US veterans trying to sue Dow and Monsanto for their cancers related to Agent Orange exposure , Supreme Court documents related to a petition for a Writ of Certiorari in Daniel Raymond Stephenson , et al. , petitioners , v. Dow Chemical Company , Monsanto Company , et al. , respondents , further implicate the companies in cover-ups and misinformation .
The petitioners state that the companies knew their dioxins , such as those used in Agent Orange , were harmful and lied about it while concealing information , including the fact that several factory workers had fallen sick after exposure to dioxin .
Several key facts “ remain undisputed , ” according to the document :
“ Respondents never shared the information in their sole possession about health risks attributable to dioxin ” , it said .
“ Respondents used proprietary , defective manufacturing processes that dangerously contaminated 2,4,5 - T with dioxin . ”
That is , the chemical companies could have manufactured their products without dioxin , as other companies had done , but the process was slower and more expensive , so they chose a more dangerous method .
The companies “ secretly tested their products for dioxin and hid its extreme toxicity from the military ” , according to the petitioners .
The petitioners stated that the companies had been hiding information during the ongoing court process : “ Respondents also misrepresent today 's medical understanding of the injuries caused by exposure to dioxin .
Instead of telling this Court that the NAS / IOM has found that numerous cancers have been related to exposure to dioxin - contaminated 2,4,5 - T ( ingredient in Agent Orange ) they quote a twenty - year - old Second Circuit opinion to say : ‘ Even today , . . . no . . . evidence that Agent Orange was hazardous to human health . ’ ”
The petitioners said the companies had misrepresented the health effects with “ patently false ” assertions that none of their workers had gotten sick from dioxin poisoning .
Inside job
Though numerous studies have uncontroversially demonstrated the devastating effects of dioxin exposure on humans , the companies that manufactured Agent Orange have gone out of their way to offer their own unique perspective .
Through 2004 , Dow and Monsanto funded several friendly studies by Dr Alvin L. Young to show that the exposure of US ground forces to Agent Orange should be of minimal health concern .
Young ’s schizophrenic reports go back and forth from saying that dioxins are not harmful to saying they are harmful and his largely debunked studies have drawn the scorn of prominent members of the scientific community .
“ Young is paid by the chemical companies ” , Dr. Wayne Dwernychuk , a retired senior / advisor at Hatfield Consultants , told Thanh Nien Daily .
“ I do n’t believe a word he says . ”
Hatfield Consultants is a research leader in the field of contamination from dioxin herbicides in Vietnam .
Not overly concerned
Though reports point to the fact that chemical companies like Dow and Monsanto knowingly hid evidence of dioxin - related medical problems from the government , the declassified 1990 Zumwalt Report suggests that US military experts knew that Agent Orange was harmful at the time of its use .
The report quotes a 1988 letter from Dr. James R. Clary , a former government scientist with the Chemical Weapons Branch , to Senator Tom Daschle .
Dr. Clary was involved in designing tanks that sprayed herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam , according to the report .
Clary told Daschle :
When we ( military scientists ) initiated the herbicide program in the 1960's , we were aware of the potential for damage due to dioxin contamination in the herbicide .
We were even aware that the ‘ military ’ formulation had a higher dioxin concentration than the ‘ civilian ’ version due to the lower cost and speed of manufacture .
However , because the material was to be used on the ‘ enemy ’ , none of us were overly concerned .
We never considered a scenario in which our own personnel would become contaminated with the herbicide .
And , if we had , we would have expected our own government to give assistance to veterans so contaminated .
Chemical warfare : calling a spade a spade
Supporters of the US Agent Orange campaign prefer to call it an “ herbicide program ” rather than chemical warfare .
But official documents reveal that the US Senate knew its real name .
In US Senate Congressional Records dated August 11 , 1969 , a table presented to senators showed that congress clearly classified 2,4 - D and 2,4,5 - T ( main components of Agent Orange ) in the Chemical and Biological Warfare category .
The table also includes Cacodylic Acid , a main component of Agent Blue , another chemical sprayed on Vietnam to kill plants , in the official Chemical and Biological Warfare category .
The table describes it as “ an arsenic - base compound ... heavy concentrations will cause arsenical poisoning in humans .
Widely used in Vietnam .
It is composed of 54.29 percent arsenic ” .
As Vietnam War scholar and US veteran W.D. Ehrhart put it concisely in a Thanh Nien Daily interview last week : “ It would be hard to describe Agent Orange as anything other than a chemical weapon .
Dioxin is a chemical . ”
So is arsenic .

US chemical companies concealed effects of dioxin , say advocates

Thanh Nien -- August 6 , 2009 -- A US lawyer and a French activist say chemical companies that produced Agent Orange , a toxic defoliant used by the US Army during the Vietnam War , connived to cover up its dangers .
The following are excerpts from interviews conducted with Gerson H. Smoger , a lawyer who has represented US Agent Orange victims for years , and Marie Hélène Lavallard , a member of the French - Vietnamese Friendship Association , in which they reveal how US chemical companies hid the fact that they knew how hazardous Agent Orange was .
Thanh Nien Daily :
How can these companies get away with compensating Americans but not Vietnamese ?
Smoger : I would not say that they “ got away with compensating ” , because I can assure you that the responsible chemical companies had no interest in compensating anyone .
Also , unfortunately , the chemical companies have never really compensated the vast majority of American veterans either .
While there was a settlement entered into in 1984 , the money ran out in 1994 .
Of the 2.4 million Americans who served in Vietnam , only about 60,000 ever received anything from the companies …
Given how long it takes to get cancer from the chemicals , virtually none of the veterans who got cancer have received any compensation from the companies ...
... I have reviewed literally millions of pages of documents ...
It seems that the manufacturers conspired to hide the dangers from the US government and the rest of the world .
The chemical companies knew about the dangers and held secret meetings with the purpose of conspiring to keep the knowledge of the dangers from the US government .
Lavallard :
The first thing to do is consider separately the 1984 agreement [ with US veterans ] and the 2004 - 2008 lawsuit [ filed by Vietnamese victims ] , not because they are separated by 20 years , though they are , but because they have almost nothing in common .
The settlement of 1984 was not a judgement ; on the contrary it was made to avoid a lawsuit …
Why did the parties choose a private settlement ?
One has to consider the background .
In 1980 , 1983 and 1984 , three studies were published by Dr George Roush , the medical director of Monsanto .
They asserted , especially the last two , that Agent Orange had no inconvenient effects on human health .
Of course , they were faked but that was discovered only years later .
At the time they were “ the Truth ” .
So the veterans were afraid of losing everything with the lawsuit and preferred a settlement ...
On Monsanto ’s side , they were up to the nostrils in the Times Beach scandal , a small town so contaminated by TCDD that finally the US government bought it all in February 1983 and had it scratched from the surface of the Earth .
Monsanto was guilty and was organising its defence .
It did not need the bad publicity of a lawsuit for Agent Orange .
Do not ask if it escaped the Times Beach condemnation , it did , having people destroying the necessary documents .
Not the slightest “ moral ” feeling in this settlement .
Just a cynical and clever way to pay a small sum to avoid a bigger disgrace .
The amount was ridiculous .
Once the lawyers had taken their share , the compensations for some 40,000 people ranged from US $ 256-12,800 , with an estimated mean of $ 4000 .
Even in 1984 it was not much .
For those who received their share in the last years up to 1994 it was simply alms ... the judge did not rule in favour of the American victims .
It was a private settlement , such as the American law permits .
It was not generous .
As for the Vietnamese victims , be sure the corporations do not care at all for them .
They knew their herbicides were lethal , and they got along to hide it from the US Army at a Dow - Monsanto secret meeting in 1965 .
They could have produced the herbicides with much less TCDD , or even without it , but they were only interested in making as much money as possible selling as many gallons as possible as quickly as possible .
Should the US do more to help clean up Agent Orange “ hot - spots ” in Vietnam ?
Lavallard : Easy question .
The US government requested and obtained $ 120 million from Hercules , a chemical company that manufactured herbicides for the war and moved to another place without cleaning its former plant .
Just calculate !
Whatever the “ legal ” aspect , the USA is responsible for poisoning huge parts of Vietnam .
They made the mess , they have to clean it .
I notice that this question is much easier than the question of sanitary damages .
For those , there are still arguments about proof , scientific enough or not , diseases due to sprayings or other reasons , etc .
But for the environment , the question is perfectly clear : the US wanted to destroy the forest , it succeeded .
The US wanted to [ force ] the peasants away from their rice fields , they did .
The US wanted to destroy the crops , it did , and some contaminated areas remain unsuitable and dangerous to live in .
Spread the message , carry the fight

Thanh Nien -- August 10 , 2009 --
Over the past week and especially today , the call for justice for victims of Agent Orange has been heard and seen around Vietnam and the world , through print and through radio and television .
The Vietnam Association for the Victims of Agent Orange / Dioxin ( VAVA ) and VTV4 have done valuable work to advance the cause .
All are to be congratulated , and mention must be of the role played by Thanh Nien through its informative articles published these days , giving voice to international friends of Vietnam and the Vietnamese victims .
Today via the internet with its stupendous reach , the message of Orange Day has been carried far and wide , and no one can be unaware of the tragic legacy that has been borne by hundreds of thousands of innocents by the use of chemicals in the Vietnam War , and in particular Agent Orange .
We have seen and read of the tragic stories of the victims , we have seen the horrific photographs of them and their families , we have also seen the humanitarian work being carried out within Vietnam by VAVA , the Vietnam Red Cross and international NGOs .
Our thanks should also go to the US NGOs working in Vietnam helping to remove from the soil of Vietnam massive amounts of unexploded bombs that , today , 34 years after the end of the war , are still killing and maiming innocent men , women and children .
The past ten days have been remarkable in bringing the message of international solidarity to the victims of Agent Orange from many corners of the world with the continuing call for justice .
And after August 10 ?
All of us must increase our roles and strengthen the international campaign for justice .
The companies responsible –- Monsanto , Dow , etc. -- cannot and must not escape from the horrific crimes they carried out with Agent Orange .
Until they accept their responsibility , and compensate all the victims and their families , we should campaign for an international embargo on all their products .

URUMQI , China -- Crowds of Muslim Uighurs ignored orders canceling Friday prayers and talked their way in to at least two mosques in neighborhoods hit by ethnic tensions here , as officials raised the death toll and released the first ethnic breakdown of casualties in riots Sunday .
The official toll rose to 184 from 156 , according to the official Xinhua news agency .
Xinhua reported 137 of the victims belonged to the dominant Han Chinese ethnic group , 46 of those killed were Uighur , and one was a member of the Hui ethnic group .

Dogs may be man 's best friend , but 6 - year - old Kayleigh Crimmins has proven a pretty good friend to dogs too .
In fact , last March the Chesapeake resident even started up her own nonprofit , Kids for K9s Inc. , to help keep her four - legged friends safe , including dogs with the Virginia Beach Police Department .
Garin and Kayleigh in June 2009 .
( Photo : Kids for K - 9 s )
After visiting the Chesapeake Police Department and watching some of the training exercises with the K - 9 unit there , Kayleigh learned the many dangers dogs face as part of the police department .
Kayleigh 's mom , Leomi Crimmins , recalls that later that day her daughter asked why police dogs in K - 9 units do n't also wear protective vests like the officers .
" She questioned why , and that was it , " said Leomi Crimmins .
" She was like , ' Well , I want to buy one . ' "
And she did .
Shortly after making her mind up , Kayleigh raised the $ 630 necessary to buy a ballistic vest .
She donated the vest to a police dog with the Greenbelt , Md. , police department .
" She actually went up there and she got a letter from the chief of police saying they were very thankful she is doing this , " Leomi Crimmins said .
Kayleigh kicked off the fundraising by contributing her own money .
" I sold my favorite toy , " she said .
" It was a kitchen .
I sold it for $ 90 , but the girl gave me $ 10 extra . "
She raised additional money by asking her friends to donate .
Since then , she has set her sights on a new goal .
Not one to rest on her laurels , Kayleigh is already busy raising money to buy two more vests , for police dogs in Virginia Beach and Hampton .
" She contacted us , " said Chris Watkins , an officer with the Virginia Beach K - 9 unit .
" She did all the legwork there . "
Watkins said the department is eager for the donation because the ballistic vests can be expensive , ranging in price between $ 600 to over $ 1,500 .
" There 's not a lot of K - 9 units in the area that use vests , " he added .
" They are generally pretty expensive .
It 's kind of hard to turn down stuff like that , especially now with budgets the way they are . "
The Virginia Beach K - 9 unit has 15 police dogs in its unit .
Watkins said they plan on alternating the vest between four dogs that can fit into it .
The department may have its vest soon .
Already , Kayleigh is busy trying to close in on her goal .
She recently oversaw the designs for the Kids for K - 9s T - shirts - which she sells to raise money for her organization - and last month she helped collect garage sale items for a large church fundraiser .
The proceeds also benefited her organization .
Mom Leomi said her daughter is decisive in matters relating to her organization and is as hands - on as a 6 - year - old can be .
In addition to helping put out the flyers for the church sale , Kayleigh also cleaned up the donations as they came in and helped whittle down the mission statement for the group .
" She has a great slogan , ' Protect our heroes , one vest at a time , ' " her mom said .
After she collects the money needed for the next two vests , Kayleigh will find other K - 9 units in need .
As a result of the church fundraiser , Kayleigh is purchasing three vests , one for the Virginia Beach Police Department . , another for the Newport News Sheriff 's Department and another for the Chowan County Sheriff 's Deptartment in North Carolina .
Her goal , she said , is to raise thousands and thousands of dollars for bulletproof vests .
" I want all the dogs to have bulletproof vests , " Kayleigh said .
That 's music to Watkins ' ears .
" Organizations like hers make it possible not to work on a shoestring , " he said .
" It 's nice having folks like her . "

Donations can also be made to Kids for K9s at any Navy Federal Credit Union branch .

A months - long White House review of a pair of U.S. ballistic missile defense ( BMD ) installations slated for Poland and the Czech Republic is nearing completion .
The review is expected to present a number of options ranging from pushing forward with the installations as planned to canceling them outright .
The Obama administration has yet to decide what course to follow .
Rumors are running wild in Poland and the Czech Republic that the United States has reconsidered its plan to place ballistic defense systems in their countries .
The rumors stem from a top U.S. BMD lobbying group that said this past week that the U.S. plan was all but dead .
The ultimate U.S. decision on BMD depends upon both the upcoming summit of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany on the Iranian nuclear program and Russia 's response to those talks .
If Russia does not cooperate in sanctions , but instead continues to maintain close relations with Iran , we suspect that the BMD plan will remain intact .
Either way , the BMD issue offers a good opportunity to re-examine U.S. and Western relations with Russia and how they have evolved .
Cold War vs. Post - Cold War
There has been a recurring theme in the discussions between Russia and the West over the past year : the return of the Cold War.
U.S. President Barack Obama , for example , accused Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of having one foot in the Cold War .
The Russians have in turn accused the Americans of thinking in terms of the Cold War .
Eastern Europeans have expressed fears that the Russians continue to view their relationship with Europe in terms of the Cold War .
Other Europeans have expressed concern that both Americans and Russians might drag Europe into another Cold War .
For many in the West , the more mature and stable Western - Russian relationship is what they call the " Post - Cold War world . "
In this world , the Russians no longer regard the West as an enemy , and view the other republics of the former Soviet Union ( FSU ) as independent states free to forge whatever relations they wish with the West .
Russia should welcome or at least be indifferent to such matters .
Russia instead should be concentrating on economic development while integrating lessons learned from the West into its political and social thinking .
The Russians should stop thinking in politico - military terms , the terms of the Cold War .
Instead , they should think in the new paradigm in which Russia is part of the Western economic system , albeit a backward one needing time and institution - building to become a full partner with the West .
All other thinking is a throwback to the Cold War .
This was the thinking behind the idea of resetting U.S. - Russian relations .
Hillary Clinton's " reset " button was meant to move U.S. - Russian relations away from what Washington thought of as a return to the Cold War from its preferred period , which existed between 1991 and the deterioration of U.S. - Russian relations after Ukraine 's 2004 Orange Revolution .
The United States was in a bimodal condition when it came to Russian relations : Either it was the Cold War or it was post - Cold War .
The Russians took a more jaundiced view of the post - Cold War world .
For Moscow , rather than a period of reform , the post - Cold War period was one of decay and chaos .
Old institutions had collapsed , but new institutions had not emerged .
Instead , there was the chaos of privatization , essentially a wild free - for - all during which social order collapsed .
Western institutions , including everything from banks to universities , were complicit in this collapse .
Western banks were eager to take advantage of the new pools of privately expropriated money , while Western advisers were eager to advise the Russians on how to become Westerners .
In the meantime , workers went unpaid , life expectancy and birth rates declined , and the basic institutions that had provided order under communism decayed — or worse , became complicit in the looting .
The post -Cold War world was not a happy time in Russia :
It was a catastrophic period for Russian power .
Herein lies the gulf between the West and the Russians .
The West divides the world between the Cold War and the post - Cold War world .
It clearly prefers the post - Cold War world , not so much because of the social condition of Russia , but because the post - Cold War world lacked the geopolitical challenge posed by the Soviet Union — everything from wars of national liberation to the threat of nuclear war was gone .
From the Russian point of view , the social chaos of the post - Cold War world was unbearable .
Meanwhile , the end of a Russian challenge to the West meant from the Russian point of view that Moscow was helpless in the face of Western plans for reordering the institutions and power arrangements of the region without regard to Russian interests .
As mentioned , Westerners think in term of two eras , the Cold War and the Post - Cold War era .
This distinction is institutionalized in Western expertise on Russia .
And it divides into two classes of Russia experts .
There are those who came to maturity during the Cold War in the 1970s and 1980s , whose basic framework is to think of Russia as a global threat .
Then , there are those who came to maturity in the later 1980s and 1990s .
Their view of Russia is of a failed state that can stabilize its situation for a time by subordinating itself to Western institutions and values , or continue its inexorable decline .
These two generations clash constantly .
Interestingly , the distinction is not so much ideological as generational .
The older group looks at Russian behavior with a more skeptical eye , assuming that Putin , a KGB man , has in mind the resurrection of Soviet power .
The post -Cold War generation that controlled U.S. - Russian policy during both the Clinton and Bush administrations is more interesting .
During both administrations , this generation believed in the idea that economic liberalization and political liberalization were inextricably bound together .
It believed that Russia was headed in the right direction if only Moscow did not try to reassert itself geopolitically and militarily , and if Moscow did not try to control the economy or society with excessive state power .
It saw the Russian evolution during the mid-to - late 2000s as an unfortunate and unnecessary development moving Russia away from the path that was best for it , and it sees the Cold War generation 's response to Russia 's behavior as counterproductive .
The Post - Post Cold War World The U.S. and other Westerners ' understanding of Russia is trapped in a nonproductive paradigm .
For Russia , the choice is n't between the Cold War or the Post - Cold War world .
This dichotomy denies the possibility of , if you will , a post - post - Cold War world — or to get away from excessive posts , a world in which Russia is a major regional power , with a stable if troubled economy , functional society and regional interests it must protect .
Russia cannot go back to the Cold War , which consisted of three parts .
First , there was the nuclear relationship .
Second , there was the Soviet military threat to both Europe and the Far East ; the ability to deploy large military formations throughout the Eurasian landmass .
And third , there were the wars of national liberation funded and guided by the Soviets , and designed to create powers allied with the Soviets on a global scale and to sap U.S. power in endless counterinsurgencies .
While the nuclear balance remains , by itself it is hollow .
Without other dimensions of Russian power , the threat to engage in mutual assured destruction has little meaning .
Russia 's military could re-evolve to pose a Eurasian threat ; as we have pointed out before , in Russia , the status of the economy does not historically correlate to Russian military power .
At the same time , it would take a generation of development to threaten the domination of the European peninsula — and Russia today has far fewer people and resources than the whole of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact that it rallied to that effort .
Finally , while Russia could certainly fund insurgencies , the ideological power of Marxism is gone , and in any case Russia is not a Marxist state .
Building wars of national liberation around pure finance is not as easy as it looks .
There is no road back to the Cold War .
But neither is there a road back to the post - Cold War period .
There was a period in the mid-to - late 1990s when the West could have destroyed the Russian Federation .
Instead , the West chose a combined strategy of ignoring Russia while irritating it with economic policies that were unhelpful to say the least , and military policies like Kosovo designed to drive home Russia 's impotence .
There is the old saw of not teasing a bear , but if you must , being sure to kill it .
Operating on the myth of nation - building , the West thought it could rebuild Russia in its own image .
To this day , most of the post - Cold War experts do not grasp the degree to which Russians saw their efforts as a deliberate attempt to destroy Russia and the degree to which Russians are committed never to return to that time .
It is hard to imagine anything as infuriating for the Russians as the reset button the Clinton administration 's Russia experts — who now dominate Obama 's Russia policy — presented the Russian leadership in all seriousness .
The Russians simply do not intend to return to the Post - Cold War era Western experts recall so fondly .
The resurrection of talks on the reduction of nuclear stockpiles provides an example of the post - Cold generation 's misjudgment in its response to Russia .
These START talks once were urgent matters .
They are not urgent any longer .
The threat of nuclear war is not part of the current equation .
Maintaining that semblance of parity with the United States and placing limits on the American arsenal are certainly valuable from the Russian perspective , but it is no longer a fundamental issue to them .
Some have suggested using these talks as a confidence - building measure .
But from the Russian point of view , START is a peripheral issue , and Washington 's focus on it is an indication that the United States is not prepared to take Russia 's current pressing interests seriously .
Continued lectures on human rights and economic liberalization , which fall on similarly deaf Russian ears , provide another example of the post - Cold War generation 's misjudgment in its response to Russia .
The period in which human rights and economic liberalization were centerpieces of Russian state policy is remembered — and not only by the Russian political elite — as among the worst periods of recent Russian history .
No one wants to go back there , but the Russians hear constant Western calls to return to that chaos .
The Russians ' conviction is that post - Cold War Western officials want to finish the job they began .
The critical point that post - Cold War officials frequently do n't grasp is that the Russians see them as at least as dangerous to Russian interests as the Cold War generation .
The Russian view is that neither the Cold War nor the post - Cold War is the proper paradigm .
Russia is not challenging the United States for global hegemony .
But neither is Russia prepared simply to allow the West to create an alliance of nations around Russia 's border .
Russia is the dominant power in the FSU .
Its economic strategy is to focus on the development and export of primary commodities , from natural gas to grain .
In order to do this , it wants to align primary commodity policies in the republics of the former Soviet Union , particularly those concerning energy resources .
Economic and strategic interests combine to make the status of the former Soviet republics a primary strategic interest .
This is neither a perspective from the Cold War or from the post - Cold War , but a logical Russian perspective on a new age .
While Russia 's concerns with Georgia are the noisiest , it is not the key Russian concern in its near abroad — Ukraine is .
So long as the United States is serious about including Ukraine in NATO , the United States represents a direct threat to Russian national security .
A glance at a map shows why the Russians think this .
Russia remains interested in Central Europe as well .
It is not seeking hegemony , but a neutral buffer zone between Germany in particular and the former Soviet Union , with former satellite states like Poland of crucial importance to Moscow .
It sees the potential Polish BMD installation and membership of the Baltic states in NATO as direct and unnecessary challenges to Russian national interest .
Responding to the United States
As the United States causes discomfort for the Russians , Russia will in turn cause discomfort for the United States .
The U.S. sore spot is the Middle East , and Iran in particular .
Therefore , the Russians will respond to American pressure on them where it hurts Washington the most .
The Cold Warriors do n't understand the limits of Russian power .
The post -Cold Warriors do n't understand the degree to which they are distrusted by Russia , and the logic behind that distrust .
The post -Cold Warriors confuse this distrust with a hangover from the Cold War rather than a direct Russian response to the post - Cold War policies they nurtured .
This is not an argument for the West to accommodate the Russians ; there are grave risks for the West there .
Russian intentions right now do not forecast what Russian intentions might be were Moscow secure in the FSU and had it neutralized Poland .
The logic of such things is that as problems are solved , opportunities are created .
One therefore must think forward to what might happen through Western accommodation .
At the same time , it is vital to understand that neither the Cold War model nor the post - Cold War model is sufficient to understand Russian intentions and responses right now .
We recall the feeling when the Cold War ended that a known and understandable world was gone .
The same thing is now happening to the post - Cold War experts :
The world in which they operated has dissolved .
A very different and complex world has taken its place .
Reset buttons are symbols of a return to a past the Russians reject .
START talks are from a world long passed .
The issues now revolve around Russia 's desire for a sphere of influence , and the willingness and ability of the West to block that ambition .
Somewhere between BMD in Poland and the threat posed by Iran , the West must make a strategic decision about Russia , and live with the consequences .
Monday appears to mark an important Apple App Store milestone with the introduction of a European digital music service app called Spotify Mobile that competes squarely with iTunes .
In the past Apple has barred programs from its App Store it viewed as offering features that duplicate functionality already available on the iPhone such as Google Voice .
It 's too early to say for sure whether Apple may reconsider the approval of Spotify Mobile and yank the program .
But for now , the approval has people wondering if Apple is changing its tune when it comes to its App Store approval process .
Spotify Mobile is also available for the Android OS , and is currently only available in Europe and not yet available in the U.S. .
Spotify Mobile allows you to stream music wirelessly to your iPhone from a library of music hosted with Spotify .
You can also store playlists or specific songs to your iPhone for listening to when you are not connected to the Internet .
The service offers a selection of 6 million songs and costs $ 16 per month .
It competes directly with iTunes that allows you to buy and store music to the iPhone directly from the handset .
In the past several applications have been rejected from the Apple App Store because they allegedly duplicate existing functions , so how come Spotify Mobile went through ?
Well , Spotify is n't the only app that would benefit the users though somehow duplicating iPhone functionality .
Vonage 's VoIP iPhone app got the Apple seal of approval as well last week , even though only with WiFi functionality , just like Skype for iPhone ( due to AT&T policy ) .
Real Networks is also working on a Rhapsody music service app for the iPhone .
Then , this weekend Apple also approved a Comodore 64 emulator called C64 , which MacRumors says Apple rejected initially in June for violations of the SDK agreement ( although rights were officially licensed from holders ) .
So is Apple being more relaxed over which applications get approved in the iPhone App Store ?
The answer is not likely .
Following the high - profile rejection of the official Google Voice app for iPhone , Apple landed in hot water with both user but most important with the FCC , which investigates the issue with Apple , AT&T and Google .
As a reminder , Apple told the FCC it did not reject the Google Voice app , but rather that it is just still reviewing it .
When the Google Voice rejection scandal broke , Google said that Apple actually rejected the app , but most of their official statement to the FCC is now censored .
Read Apple's , Google 's and AT&T 's responses to the FCC inquiry here .
So perhaps Apple is trying to avoid further issues with the FCC and is just letting through apps that would n't usually get approved .
Apps like Spotify Mobile and Vonage for iPhone are already getting Apple some good press and could keep the FCC off their back , until the Google Voice inquiry is closed .
But whether this trend will continue after the FCC 's look into the Google Voice rejection is over is yet to be seen .

Taken at face value it is a free , open source office suite .
This has been my starting point in the past .
LibreOffice is interesting on many levels .
You should consider downloading and investigating the software .
It is not right for everyone .
Yet it is an important [... ]
As U.S. Rep .
Tom Perriello was considering how to vote on an important piece of climate change legislation in June , the freshman congressman ’s office received at least six letters from two Charlottesville - based minority organizations voicing opposition to the measure .
The letters , as it turns out , were forgeries . [...]
The person who sent the letter has not been identified , but he or she was employed by a Washington lobbying firm called Bonner & Associates . [...]
" This was not a ‘ mistake , ’ " wrote [ Tim ] Freilich , who is also legal director of the Immigrant Advocacy Program of the Legal Aid Justice Center .
" This was a deliberately and carefully forged letter that used the logo , address and name of Creciendo Juntos without authorization .
Additionally , I understand from Ms. Hegyi that our organization was not the only Charlottesville - area organization whose reputations were used in an unauthorized manner to try to influence Congressman Perriello on this particular vote . "
After being notified of the bogus Creciendo Juntos letter , staffers in Perriello ’s office realized that the wording of the letter sounded familiar .
The staffers dug through the stacks of thousands of letters , e-mails and faxes Perriello received about the bill — the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 — and found five more forged letters , these purportedly from the Albemarle - Charlottesville branch of the NAACP . [...]
" It ’s very unfortunate that opponents of this bill would resort to deception and made - up letters , " [ Perriello press secretary Jessica Barba ] said .
" Spreading false information is not healthy for real debate in our democracy .
Congressman Perriello voted in favor of the bill because of its potential to create clean energy jobs , which is why the NAACP and many other groups supported the legislation in the first place . "
Full story here .
Once again , congratulations to Rep. Perriello for standing up for what was right for Virginians .
But we may only be scratching the surface of the deception used by opponents of clean energy reform in a failed attempt to stop the American Clean Energy and Security ( ACES ) Act .
It was already known that a group called the " Tea Party Patriots has been urging its members to lie about their residency in their calls to Congressional offices :
When you write or call , please make sure you are armed with a city name and zip code in the home state of the Senator you are calling .
They may not want to hear from you without this information .
You can decline to give further personal information .
I 've heard many other rumors of lies , forgery and deception from right - wing groups in their fight against ACES .
Today 's story only scratches the surface .
And these are the same tactics opponents are willing to use in their fight against President Obama 's entire agenda .
It 's critical that we do all we can to spread this story , because you know the mainstream media is n't going to help us .
We need to let members of Congress know they need to be vigilant for the worst kind of dirty tricks from opponents of progress .

Renault has been handed a two - year suspended ban for its involvement in fixing the result of last year 's Singapore Grand Prix , with Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds receiving bans from motorsport .
Following a meeting of the FIA 's World Motor Sport Council in Paris on Monday , the governing body ruled that the team was guilty of an offence of " unparalleled severity " after causing a deliberate crash in last year 's Singapore event .
Although the FIA deemed that the offence was worthy of exclusion from the F1 world championship , it was decided to suspend the ban for two season because Renault admitted to its guilt - and took action against the men involved in the actions - former team principal Briatore and director of engineering Pat Symonds .
A statement from the FIA said that Renault " had accepted , at the earliest practicable opportunity , that it committed the offences with which it was charged and cooperated fully with the FIA 's investigation .
It had confirmed that Mr. Briatore and Mr. Symonds were involved in the conspiracy and ensured that they left the team ;
It apologised unreservedly to the FIA and to the sport for the harm caused by its actions ;
" It committed to paying the costs incurred by the FIA in its investigation ; and Renault ( the parent company , as opposed to Renault F1 ) committed to making a significant contribution to FIA safety - related projects . "
Explaining the decision to impose a two - year suspended ban , the FIA said : " The World Motor Sport Council considers Renault F1 's breaches relating to the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to be of unparalleled severity .
" Renault F1 's breaches not only compromised the integrity of the sport but also endangered the lives of spectators , officials , other competitors and Nelson Piquet Jr. himself .
The World Motor Sport Council considers that offences of this severity merit permanent disqualification from the FIA Formula One World Championship .
" However , having regard to the points in mitigation mentioned above and in particular the steps taken by Renault F1 to identify and address the failings within its team and condemn the actions of the individuals involved , the WMSC has decided to suspend Renault F1 's disqualification until the end of the 2011 season .
The World Motor Sport Council will only activate this disqualification if Renault F1 is found guilty of a comparable breach during that time . "
The FIA has also taken tough action against Briatore and Symonds .
It has been decided that for an ' unlimited period ' the FIA will not sanction any event , championship , cup , trophy , challenge or series involving Briatore in any capacity - or grant any licence to a team or entity that is engaged with Briatore .
The statement added : " It also hereby instructs all officials present at FIA - sanctioned events not to permit Mr. Briatore access to any areas under the FIA 's jurisdiction . "
Briatore will also not be allowed to manage any drivers in F1 , with the FIA stating that it will not renew any Superlicence granted to a driver who is associated with Briatore .
At the moment Briatore manages Fernando Alonso , Mark Webber , Heikki Kovalainen , Romain Grosjean in F1 .
" In determining that such instructions should be applicable for an unlimited period , the World Motor Sport Council has had regard not only to the severity of the breach in which Mr. Briatore was complicit but also to his actions in continuing to deny his participation in the breach despite all the evidence .

Symonds faces a similar ban for a period of five years - and will not be allowed at FIA - sanctioned events .
The statement added : " In determining that such instructions should be effective for a period of five years the World Motor Sport Council has had regard : ( i ) to Mr. Symonds ' acceptance that he took part in the conspiracy ; and ( ii ) to his communication to the meeting of the World Motor Sport Council that it was to his " eternal regret and shame " that he participated in the conspiracy .

Piquet himself apologised to the FIA for his involvement in the matter , and receives no punishment after being offered immunity in exchange for providing details about the matter .
The FIA also ruled that Alonso , who testified at the hearing , was not involved in the Renault race - fix matter .
* COSATU wants Reserve Bank to be state - owned
* Bank ’s powers should be reduced
* Central bank governor shrugs off criticism
( Adds comment from central bank Governor Mboweni )
By Peroshni Govender and Alison Raymond
MIDRAND , South Africa , Sept 22 ( Reuters ) - South Africa ’s powerful COSATU trade union federation called on Tuesday for the central bank to be stripped of many of its powers and taken into state ownership .
“ The Reserve Bank is not neutral .
It is not like you can afford to have it as a bank of private citizens with money , ” COSATU Secretary - General Zwelinzima Vavi told Reuters on the sidelines of the labour group ’s annual conference .
“ If you do that you sideline the state itself and all the constituencies in society , including labour .
The Bank must be state - owned and run . ”
The South African central bank is one of very few in the world owned by private shareholders , who have the right to appoint half the board of directors , but have no say in its day - to - day operations or policy .
COSATU , with 1.9 million members , helped President Jacob Zuma come to power in April but it said at the conference that the government could not count on its unconditional support .
The labour federation condemns policies it sees as too pro-business and has gone head to head with Zuma over a series of pay strikes .
He has shown no sign of bowing to union demands .
The unions want more government spending , and an end to inflation targeting by the central bank , which they blame for sharp interest rate increases last year .
They also want a seat on the bank ’s board and for it to come under full state control .
“ We propose cutting the powers of the Reserve Bank .
There must be a refocusing and we must ensure that that focus is not just about inflation but the entire manner that the country is moving , looking at the impact of its policies on jobs , poverty , inequality , and growth of the economy , ” said Vavi .
The Reserve Bank ’s governor and deputies are appointed by the president , but it operates independently under a mandate to target inflation at between 3 and 6 percent .
Speaking later at an accountants ’ dinner , Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni shrugged off the criticism .
“ We have been able to provide monetary accommodation in these difficult times but no one is ever satisfied , ” he said , referring to COSATU ’s demand for more than the 5 percentage points in interest rate cuts made since December despite stubborn inflation .
The central bank ’s monetary policy committee ( MPC ) met earlier on Tuesday and decided to keep the repo lending rate at 7 percent , citing balanced inflation risks and signs of improvement in the local and global economy .
“ After the MPC meeting I went to the COSATU conference ( and ) I was told there was a lot of criticism , but they were friendly .
I enjoyed myself and I ’m going back tomorrow morning , ” he said .

Ah , the great question of our times .
. .
H2O , in the form of water vapor , easily attaches to methane molecules by the chlorine atom , or the sulfur released from bacteria , making the foul smell more readily attach to the nostril lining , subsequently sustaining the odor longer than in a dry climate .
In addition , warm vapors will cause any crusted mucus to soften and disengage , providing more surface area within the sinuses .
And lastly , ( if you are male ) the qualitive factor of " worse " is a perception of foreign gases - as to our own emissions , the qualitive factor is " better . "
SUNGAI SIPUT , Malaysia ( Reuters ) - Religious authorities in Malaysia postponed on Monday the caning of a Muslim woman convicted of drinking alcohol until after the holy month of Ramadan .
The planned caning of 32 - year - old mother of two Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno has drawn criticism from rights groups concerned by the rise of Islamic laws in this traditionally moderate country , even though Kartika had accepted the punishment .
Earlier on Monday it appeared she might have been freed when a court order that would have transferred her to a prison where she was to have been caned was ruled invalid by an Islamic justice official .
Kartika was released from a van that would have transported her to the prison in Pahang state in eastern mainland Malaysia where she committed the offence that she admits and for which she wanted to be punished in public .
“ The punishment has not been canceled , it was postponed because of Ramadan , ” Pahang state Executive Councillor for Religion , Missionary Work and Unity , Mohamad Sahfri Abdul Aziz , told Reuters .
Ramadan , a time of fasting and contemplation for Muslims , started on Saturday and lasts a month and Mohamad Sahfri said that the decision was taken after consultations with Malaysia ’s Attorney - General .
Kartika , who has admitted that she drank beer at a hotel in Pahang in December 2007 , said that she still accepted the sentence but wanted to be treated fairly .

“ I am shocked but I remain steadfast with my decision , ” Kartika , wearing a cream - colored , traditional long Malay dress decorated with flowers and a headscarf , told reporters after the state announced it would push ahead with the caning .
“ All I want now is to know my true situation and do not treat me like a football , ” said Kartika who had worked as a nurse in Singapore until her trial .
MAHATHIR WEIGHS IN
While caning is a common punishment under Malaysia ’s civil code , as it is in neighboring Singapore , no woman has been caned and the severity of the punishment has generated criticism that this modern majority - Muslim state was becoming more hardline .
It is also a sensitive political issue where Malays , who account for 55 percent of the 27 million population , must be Muslim .
A Malay nationalist party is the main party in the coalition that has ruled the country for 51 years , but it is battling an opposition Islamic party for their votes .
“ There is a general push toward the implementation of sharia ( Islamic ) laws , ” Osman Bakar Deputy Chief Executive of the International Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies Malaysia told Reuters .

“ It ’s too simplistic to say that the government is becoming more Islamicized to gain more votes , more Malay support . ”
The National Front coalition , led by the United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) , stumbled to its worst ever losses in national and state elections in 2008 .
In a sign of sensitivity over the issue ahead of a state by - election this month that pits the government against the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party ( PAS ) in a majority Muslim state , the government ’s minister for women withdrew a statement in which she labeled the punishment as “ harsh ” for a woman .
Former premier Mahathir Mohamad , a frequent critic of the West who ruled Malaysia for 22 years until 2003 , said there was no need for Islam or Islamic countries to apologize .
“ The news of the caning has gone all around the world , ” he said on his popular web log ( www.chedet.co.cc).
“ I do not know if this gives a good or bad image to Islam .
As a Muslim , we do not have to care too much about the view of others toward Islam when doing what the religion calls for . ”
Known for their wide variety of vibrant plumage , birds have evolved various chemical and physical mechanisms to produce these beautiful colors over millions of years .
A team of paleontologists and ornithologists led by Yale University has now discovered evidence of vivid iridescent colors in feather fossils more than 40 million years old .
The finding , published online August 26 in Biology Letters , signifies the first evidence of a preserved color - producing nanostructure in a fossilized feather .
Iridescence is the quality of changing color depending on the angle of observation , such as the rainbow of colors seen in an oil slick .
The simplest iridescent feather colors are produced by light scattering off the feather 's surface and a smooth surface of melanin pigment granules within the feather protein .
Examining feather fossils from the Messel Shale in Germany with an electron microscope , scientists have documented this smooth layer of melanin structures , called melanosomes .
" These feathers produced a black background with a metallic greenish , bluish or coppery color at certain angles — much like the colors we see in starlings and grackles today , " said Richard Prum , chair of the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Yale and one of the paper 's authors .
For more than 25 years , paleontologists have found microscopic tubular structures on fossilized feathers and hair .
These were long interpreted as bacteria that had digested the feathers at the time they were fossilized .
The team had previously discovered that these structures were in fact not bacteria but melanosomes , which then allowed them to document the original color patterns .
Following up on the new finding , they are racing to discover what additional coloration features may be found in fossil feathers .
" The discovery of ultra-structural detail in feather fossils opens up remarkable possibilities for the investigation of other features in soft - bodied fossils , like fur and even internal organs , " said Derek Briggs , Yale 's Frederick William Beinecke Professor of Geology and Geophysics , and an author of the study .
The discovery could pave the way for determining color features of other ancient birds and even dinosaurs , the team said .
" Of course , the ' Holy Grail ' in this program is reconstructing the colors of the feathered dinosaurs , " said Yale graduate student and lead author Jakob Vinther .
" We are working hard to determine if this will be possible . "
Other authors of the paper include Julia Clarke ( University of Texas at Austin ) and Gerald Mayr ( Senckenberg Research Institute , Germany ) .

Advertisement Iran has successfully test - fired some of the longest range missiles in its arsenal , state media say .
The Revolutionary Guards tested the Shahab - 3 and Sajjil rockets , which are believed to have ranges of up to 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) , reports said .
The missiles ' range could potentially permit them to reach Israel and US bases in the Gulf , analysts say .
The tests come amid heightened tension with the big international powers over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Last week , Iran disclosed it was building a second uranium enrichment plant , despite UN demands that it cease its enrichment activities .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent
These missile tests are being carried out as part of Iran 's sacred defence week , so they were probably planned some time ago .
Nevertheless the West is likely to see this as a gesture of defiance just days after the latest revelation about Iran 's nuclear programme .
Iran may not mind too much about that interpretation .
Both the Shahab - 3 and the Sajjil are capable of reaching much of the Middle East including Israel .
They make up what is probably Iran 's strongest deterrent against any possible attack by Israel or the West .
Iran is due to hold crucial talks with the five UN Security Council members plus Germany on Thursday on a wide range of security issues , including its nuclear programme .
Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said the missile tests were merely part of an annual military drill , known as Sacred Defence Week , to commemorate its war with Iraq in the 1980s .
It was not a reaction to the nuclear crisis , he added .
" Many countries have these [ displays ] and it has nothing to do with Iran 's peaceful nuclear technology , " he told a news conference .
France called on Tehran to immediately stop " these deeply destabilising activities " .
In a statement , the foreign ministry urged Iran to co-operate " by responding without delay to the demands of the international community to reach a negotiated settlement on the nuclear question " .
But Russia appealed for restraint , saying the world should not " succumb to emotions " in dealing with Iran .
" The main thing is to launch productive negotiations [ with Iran ] , " a foreign ministry source told Interfax news agency .
Gesture of defiance " An improved version of Shahab - 3 and the two - stage Sajjil , powered by solid fuel , were fired , " the Guards ' air force commander Hossein Salami was quoted as saying by the state - owned Arabic language TV channel al - Alam .
Talks herald new phase for Iran Iran 's arsenal of missiles Footage of the test - firing of the Shahab - 3 in desert terrain was broadcast by another state - owned channel , Press TV .
The Shahab - 3 ( Meteor - 3 ) is classed as a medium range ballistic missile but is the longest - range rocket Iran has successfully tested in public .
Iran says the missile , which it first tested in July 2008 , can fly some 2,000 km , although Western defence experts have put the strike range at 1,300 km ( 807 miles ) .
The surface - to - surface Sajjil is a new , two - stage missile using solid fuel , which is considered to give a more accurate delivery than liquid fuel rockets .
It has been tested by Iran twice , in November 2008 and May 2009 .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says Iran 's enemies might be most worried by the test - firing of the Sajjil missile .
It is more advanced , and multiple stage rockets offer the potential for longer ranges , he says .
The Shahab - 3 and Sajjil rockets are currently believed to be capable of reaching not only Israel and US bases in the Gulf , but also parts of Europe .
On Sunday , the medium - range Shahab - 1 and 2 missiles with a range of 300 to 700 km ( 186 to 434 miles ) were tested .
The short - range Tondar - 69 and Fateh - 110 type , with a range of up to 170 km ( 100 miles ) , were also tested .
Although the tests are likely to have been planned in advance , Iran will not be unhappy if they are seen as a gesture of defiance by the West , our correspondent adds .
Telecoms move Iran is under increasing pressure to co-operate fully over its nuclear ambitions - particularly since the revelation of a previously undisclosed uranium enrichment plant .
The Guards now own a key stake in Iran 's telecommunications President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted that the plant , near the holy city of Qom , does not breach UN regulations and says it is open for inspection by UN experts .
But leaders of the US , Britain and France accuse Tehran of keeping the plant secret in breach of UN rules .
They have raised the prospect of new , tougher sanctions against Iran if Thursday 's meeting with the so - called P5+1 ( US , UK , France , China , Russia and Germany ) yields little progress .
In a separate development , Iranian state media report that a consortium linked to the Revolutionary Guards has bought a majority share in the state telecommunications company .
The Revolutionary Guards led the government response to the street protests that followed the disputed re-election of President Ahmadinejad - himself a former guard - in June .
During the demonstrations , the authorities interrupted mobile phone networks , hindering the opposition movement .
The Revolutionary Guard was set up shortly after the revolution to defend the country 's Islamic system .
It has since become a major military , political and economic force , with close ties to the leadership .

Astronaut Koichi Wakata is returning to Earth wearing the same underpants he has worn for a month during his space station visit .
The pants are experimental and designed to be odour - free .
As crew on the shuttle Endeavour headed back to Earth , the Japanese astronaut broke the news to his colleagues about the underwear experiment .
He said : " I wore them for about a month , and my station crew members never complained for about a month , so I think the experiment went fine " .
Loading up the car for college ?
The American Psychiatric Assn. reminds us that while college can be a time of great hope and exuberance , that 's not always the case : Its 2008 American College Health Assn .
Survey found that 30 % of college students reported that at some point in the last 12 months , they had felt so depressed it was hard to function .
And 49 % reported that in the same period , they had experienced overwhelming anxiety .
Ten percent of those surveyed said they had been diagnosed or treated for depression , and 6 % reported they had seriously considered suicide .
And a study published December 2008 in the Archives of General Psychiatry found that alcohol disorders affected roughly one in five college students .
The next - most - common class of disorders were personality disorders , affecting about 17.7 % of college students .
We know from the website Active Minds , devoted to " changing the conversation about mental health on college campuses " and to providing mental - health resources to college students , that an average of 1,100 college students die by suicide each year .
Sure , there 's beer - pong and all - night partying .
But there 's crushing pressure as well , and it can take a toll on students ' mental health .
( To find a chapter , or start one on your campus , look here . )
The Los Angeles Times ' Shari Roan wrote back in September 2007 about the growing demands on college mental health services , and some of the dilemmas they face in serving troubled students on the cusp of adulthood .
Now would be a good time for parents and students alike to revisit that article .

Privately , the ISP industry , communications experts and several politicians believe that Senator Conroy might use the results of the trial as an excuse to quietly axe the plan , which was an election promise that has become deeply unpopular .
" It is looking increasingly like the minister knows his mandatory internet censorship plan is simply unworkable , but is too embarrassed to admit it , " Senator Minchin said .
But even if the results are released , telecommunications experts , including University of Sydney associate professor Bjorn Landfeldt , hold reservations about how useful they will be .
Only eight small ISPs and Optus , on a limited basis , signed up to participate in the trials and questions are being raised as to whether this will accurately reflect the real - world conditions if filtering is implemented on a mandatory basis .
Furthermore , the Government has said that it has no criteria to determine whether the trials of the scheme are a success .
It has also refused to release specific details of how the trials are being set up and conducted .
" Getting the results out would be really good for the public debate ... finally , maybe , the [ Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy ] and Senator Conroy will start to then pick up the questions from various parts of society and actually start the debate properly , " Landfeldt said .
" The big issue with the blacklist is the way the blacklist is going to be managed really , and the transparency of the process .
Right now there is no transparency . "
In December last year , this website revealed that the Government was trying to bury a high - level report , co-authored by Landfeldt last February , which concluded that the Government 's filtering policy was fundamentally flawed .
The Government released the report the day its existence was made public but decided to press on with the live trials anyway .
" It 's definitely not going to be workable to get a very significant reduction in access to [ the unwanted ] content that is available out there .
It 's fundamentally just not viable , " Landfeldt said at the time .
Soon after , a secret blacklist held by the communications regulator , the Australian Communications and Media Authority , was leaked on to the internet , revealing some of the content that may be blocked for all Australians under Senator Conroy 's scheme .
It included sexual abuse imagery and child pornography websites but also sites that are perfectly legal to view in Australia , such as anti-abortion sites , fetish sites and sites containing pro-euthanasia material such as The Peaceful Pill Handbook by Dr Philip Nitschke .
Sites added to the blacklist in error were also classified prohibited , such as one containing PG - rated photographs by Bill Henson .
Yet Senator Conroy has so far refused to enter the debate about the freedom of speech issues associated with his internet censorship plan .
Today , he continued to paint people who oppose his policy as child abuse supporters .
" Nick Minchin and the Liberal Party should explain why they do n't support using the latest technology to restrict access to child abuse content and other Refused Classification material , " Senator Conroy said this morning .
Although Telstra did not agree to be part of the Government 's internet filtering trial on live customers , a spokesman for Senator Conroy said Telstra had offered results of " an internal ISP filtering trial " for consideration .
The online activist group GetUp has been running a grassroots campaign against the filtering policy and so far has raised $ 96,000 from members to run advertisements online and on TV .
Loading
" It 's in small dollar donations that average less than $ 38 , which I think shows just how many Australians care about this issue , " said Get Up chief executive Simon Sheikh .
Sheikh said 5000 of his members had faxed a letter speaking out against the policy to their local Labor MPs or senators , while 357 members had so far requested a meeting with their local MPs to talk about the issue .
Honda unveils ' Segway - style ' unicycle that travels in any direction you want
It may look a little precarious and uncomfortable to ride , but Honda believe their new ' personal mobility ' device could one day be zipping up and down our streets .
The vehicle looks like a very modern unicycle and to ride it you simply lean your weight in the direction you want to go , whether that 's forward , backwards or even sideways .
It maintains its own balance travelling up to 3.7MPH .
The U3 - X , which was given a test - run by reporters in Japan today , was designed to be small , safe and unobtrusive enough to mingle with pedestrians or use indoors , according to Honda Motors .
Look no hands !
Honda President Takanobu
Ito displays the prototype model of a personal mobility device called the ' U3 - X ' in Tokyo
The single wheel on the U3 - X is made up of many tiny motor - controlled wheels , packed inside the bigger wheel , allowing the device to swerve in any direction .
Unfortunately Honda President Takanobu
Ito said the machine was still ' a proposal , ' and the company has no sales plans , pricing or firm ideas on where or how it will be used .
The U3 - X weighs just under 22 pounds , runs on a full charge for an hour , and has a lithium - ion battery .
It is best suited to those over 5ft .
Although Honda said the machine is meant for the elderly , it 's unclear whether they would be coordinated enough to control the device .
A slippery slope ?
Pixar film
Wall -e predicted humans would become too obese to walk in the future after relying on technology
The U3 - X can be easily carried ( left ) .
Like the Segway ( pictured with former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , right ) the Segway the U3 - X moves when you shift your weight
Honda makes the Asimo walking child - shaped robot and the U3 - X uses some of the same technology .
Last year , Honda also unveiled a gadget that can support a wearer 's bodyweight , made of mechanical frames attached to a pair of shoes .
Japanese rival Toyota Motors has shown machines that help people get around , including the Winglet , similar to the Segway , a scooter - like device that people ride standing up .
Japan is one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world , and concerns are growing about helping the elderly get around .
Apple is Ready to bet on the work they have done with GPUs in and they claim they were the first one to have this insight in Desktop and Mobile Computing .
Apple ’s support for OpenGL and new implementation of OpenCL in GPGPU computing is going to change the industry trends .
The intent is to weaken Microsoft ’s proprietary drive to make DirectX / D3D the primary API supported by GPU hardware developers such as AMD / ATI and NVIDIA and rather encourage a more Open approach , OpenCL .
Is this the Secret of Success of Apple MAC OS X and shiny gadgets like iPhone ?

Background
Apple did n’t woke - up to GPU power yesterday .
They had long lived up to the dream of offloading CPU and use GPU for complexer graphics floating point calculations , there by increasing overall performance keeping the optimal use of hardware .
OpenCL , initially developed by Apple , is analogous to the open industry standards OpenGL and OpenAL , for 3D graphics and computer audio , respectively .
OpenCL extends the power of the GPU beyond graphics ( GPGPU ) .
OpenCL is , now , managed by the non-profit consortium .
OpenCL ( Open Computing Language ) is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs , GPUs , and other processors .
OpenCL includes a language ( based on C99 ) for writing kernels ( functions that execute on OpenCL devices ) , plus APIs that are used to define and then control the platforms .
OpenCL provides parallel computing using task - based and data - based parallelism .
Apple ’s GPU support in Snow Leopard
Snow Leopard extends support for modern hardware with OpenCL , which lets any application tap into the vast gigaflops of GPU computing power previously available only to graphics applications .
OpenCL is based on the C programming language and has been proposed as an open standard .
The move toward greater utilization of available GPU resources , along with Snow Leopard ’s Grand Central Dispatch architecture helps making it easy and transparent for developers to deliver .
The effort does n’t end here .
It enables Apple to innovate in future hardware , investing in new acceleration chips of its own design and harnessing more power by including support for more of the existing GPU resources from vendors like Nvidia , ATI ( AMD ) .
Talking about OpenGL on other platforms , from the Wii to the PlayStation 3 , it ’s harnessed to extremes .
Apple ’s own iPhone / iPod touch in mobile device computing , is no less than as compared to gaming consoles .
The story no longer holds good future for Microsoft ’s established Business of “ killing open GPU standards ” and substituting them with Windows - only alternatives , will eventually evade .
Apple ’s approach to GPU
Apple realised the power of GPU way back in 1999 but applied it in proprietary Mac OS X’s Quartz Graphics hardware .
On the contrary , Microsoft did n’t get its own product with advanced , modern graphics compositing to market until Vista in 2007 .
And then failed to actually sell it to it ’s users .
On an average , approximately 20 % of people migrated to Vista from XP .
( not including forced new Vista PCs ) .
This power of GPU was not just realized for MAC .
Apple extended the concept to iPhone .
The iPhone uses an embedded “ System on a Chip ” which includes an ARM core along with with high performance , dedicated Graphics cores that Apple has fully exploited to defer interface - related processing to hardware , much like a video game system that we see in Windows world .
Currently , no one in the industry has taken full advantage of GPU on mobile devices .
That ’s why no one else has been able to match iPhone ’s graphics , yet .
Windows was stuck in the old CPU driven architecture while MAC OS moved large parts of the code behind UI and rendering to those high power GPUs initially developed for gaming .
It took 5 years or so from the mighty Microsoft to hammer its OS to adapt to this new computing paradigm and release Vista , and a better implementation in Windows 7 , around more than a decade after Apple did .
“ And exactly the same happened in mobile devices .
Apple ’s competitors were developing OS architectures initially built for menu driven UI ’s in the times when CPU was the main processing unit .
Effective use of the GPU will play an increasingly large role as devices get more mobile and as users ’ expectations increase .
Apple is ahead of the game both in conventional PCs and in mobile devices , with rivals such as Microsoft and Nokia just recently discovering the importance of focusing on the GPU to deliver the power needed to provide a rich , animated user interface . ”
“ What Apple needed to do was to downscale its OSX a bit and partner with Imagination Technologies to develop a powerful mobile optimized graphics core .
Suddenly they could run an UI that required several multiples of processing power the traditional mobile computing platforms were able to deliver .
But since iPhone used GPU to crunch the heavy parts of UI code Apple could do it .
The rest is history . ”
“ There is a long list of other things Apple did right and assets they had , but without a great ‘ inertia ’ in mobile operating systems and this shift in mobile computing platforms they would have not been able to shake the market so greatly . ”
By sharing technology between its iPhone and Mac platforms , Apple is building upon its lead in fully exploiting the latent power available in the GPU .
That ’s the exact reason why Snow Leopard is faster than previous generations OS .
Snow Leopard specifically delivers a richer , subtly more animated user interface right out of the box and provides powerful toolkits to allow third party developers to wring the most performance from the hardware available , without overloading CPU much .

Hey everyone .
I 'm the developer of the Facebook Poll Application that hosted the " Should Obama be killed ? " poll .
You can read about it here .
I 'm sure you have all sorts of assumptions about me , my application , and how this went down , but I want to start by listing a series of facts followed by an open - ended Q&A .
David Davies , Conservative MP for Monmouth and a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee , said : " It 's quite outrageous for these people to carry on living here , many of them on benefits .
The Home Secretary should have the right to either lock them up or throw them out of the country , but for that to happen requires a change in the Human Rights Act . "
Despite the revelation that there are almost one million fewer CCTV cameras in the UK than previously thought , Britain still appears to have far more watchful eyes trained on its population than other countries .
The BBC's Newsnight programme made Freedom of Information requests to almost 100 local authorities in the UK to ask how many cameras they operate .
The results of their survey are plotted on the maps below , the figures showing the number cameras per 1,000 people in each of the sample authorities .
One of the most dramatic revelations is that both the Shetland Islands Council and Corby Borough Council - among the smallest local authorities in the UK - have more CCTV cameras than the San Francisco Police Department .
West Sussex has the highest number of CCTV cameras in the sample of English counties , with 0.52 per 1,000 people .
The City of London [ borough ] has 619 cameras , but a population of only 9,000 .
This represents 68.7 cameras per 1,000 people .
The borough of Wandsworth has the highest number of CCTV cameras in London , with just under four cameras per 1,000 people .
Its total number of cameras - 1,113 - is more than the police departments of Boston [ USA ] , Johannesburg and Dublin City Council combined .

Source : Wilson breaks $ 1 million
A source on Rep. Joe Wilson 's campaign says his fundraising has broken $ 1 million -- and surpassed that of his Democratic rival , Rob Miller -- since his outburst of " You lie ! " during President Obama 's address to Congress Wednesday .
The source said Wilson 's current tally is $ 1,005,021 from 18,859 donations amid a high - profile campaign on the Drudge Report and elsewhere telling conservatives that Wilson is " under attack " for his willingness to take on Obama .
Wilson , who initially apologized for his words , is now riding a reaction that has surpassed the liberal backlash to his words : Miller has raised less than $ 900,000 , according to the Democratic fundraising site ActBlue -- though still more than enough to envigorate his challenge .
Still , Wilson 's success -- despite having been criticized by Republican leaders -- represents the power of the conservative grassroots to reward politicians who confront the White House in the sharpest terms .
CORRECTION : He may still trail Democrat Rob Miller , who broke $ 1 million yesterday .
Philip Zelikow , who was State Department counselor for Condi Rice and executive director of the 9/11 Commission , testified last week before Congress that torture was “ a collective failure and it was a mistake , ” perhaps “ a disaster . ”
After 9/11 , he recalled , “ the tough , gritty world of ‘ the field ’ worked its way into the consciousness of the nation ’s leaders .
...
The cultural divide between the world of secretive , bearded operators in the field coming from their 3 a.m. meetings at safe houses , and the world of Washington policy makers in their wood - paneled suites ” led the policy makers to become too deferential to C.I.A. operatives , and miss the fact that even they disagreed about torture .
Ali Soufan , the ex-F.B.I. agent who flatly calls torture “ ineffective , ” helped get valuable information from Abu Zubaydah , an important Al Qaeda prisoner , simply by outwitting him .
Torture , he told Congress , is designed to force the subject to submit “ through humiliation and cruelty ” and “ see the interrogator as the master who controls his pain . ”
It ’s a good description of the bullying approach Cheney and Rummy applied to the globe , and the Arab world .
But as Soufan noted , when you try to force compliance rather than elicit cooperation , it ’s prone to backfire .
The more telling news last week was the suggestion about Cheney ’s reverse - engineering the Iraq war .
Robert Windrem , a former NBC
News investigative producer , reported on The Daily Beast that in April 2003 , after the invasion of Baghdad , the U.S. arrested a top officer in Saddam ’s security force .
Even though this man was an old - fashioned P.O.W. , someone in Vice ’s orbit reportedly suggested that the interrogations were too gentle and that waterboarding might elicit information about the fantasized connection between Osama and Saddam .
In The Washington Note , a foreign policy blog , Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff at State , wrote that the “ harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002 ... was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and Al Qaeda . ”
Josh Marshall said in his blog : “ More and more the timeline is raising the question of why , if the torture was to prevent terrorist attacks , it seemed to happen mainly during the period when we were looking for what was essentially political information to justify the invasion of Iraq . ”
I used to agree with President Obama , that it was better to keep moving and focus on our myriad problems than wallow in the darkness of the past .
But now I want a full accounting .
I want to know every awful act committed in the name of self - defense and patriotism .
Even if it only makes one ambitious congresswoman pay more attention in some future briefing about some future secret technique that is “ uniquely ” designed to protect us , it will be worth it .
A designer 's decision to use size 12 and 14 models at London Fashion Week yesterday caused a behind - the - scenes row that ended in his stylist walking out .
Mark Fast , known for his sculpted mini-dresses reflecting the recent body - conscious trend , used three models of a size larger than the catwalk is used to seeing – Hayley , Laura and Gwyneth – to model his knitwear designs .
Within an hour of his show on Saturday morning , an Elle magazine journalist sent out a tweet saying Fast 's stylist had resigned over his use of the models .
Fast 's managing director , Amanda May , said she was " so happy we stuck to our guns over the casting " .
She told the Observer that stylist Daniella Agnelli had stepped in to help out .
" She was in the studio until after 2 am with Mark perfecting the show .
We are really grateful to her . "
Fast had been working with size - 12 model Hayley Morley for the LFW photography exhibition , All Walks Beyond the Catwalk .
It launched on Friday at London 's Somerset House with a party attended by Alexandra Shulman , editor of British Vogue , and prime minister 's wife Sarah Brown , who admitted she had " sneaked out " of a number 10 reception for British designers she was hosting .
The exhibition features models aged 18 to 65 , in sizes 8 to 16 , wearing outfits created by young London designers .
It aims to change the narrow vision of beauty offered by the fashion world .
The size issue is always a sore point within the industry .
The 2007 Model Health Inquiry was launched by the British Fashion Council in response to the death from starvation of several models who had been slaves to the size - zero trend .
It failed to set out any firm industry guidelines but the debate has gained momentum ; this month , plus - size model Crystal Renn launched her autobiography at a glittering Manhattan party and talked of a new vogue for women " lush and sparkly with nary a jutting collarbone in sight " .
On Friday Professor Ulrike Schmidt , chair of the Institute of Psychiatry 's eating disorders team , spoke out about the dangers of very thin models .
" We are very concerned that the lack of medical checks for models at London Fashion Week , coupled with an environment where being underweight is the norm , prevents those with eating disorders from gaining insight into their condition . "
Vogue editor Shulman wrote to top designers in June this year , asking for larger - sized clothes for the magazine 's photo shoots .
" We have now reached the point where many of the sample sizes do n't comfortably fit even the established star models , " she wrote .
Her views were backed by designers such as Roland Mouret .
" Back in the 1980s , when supermodels were several sizes larger than top models today , the clothes worked on bigger bodies . "
All Walks Beyond the Catwalk aims to change the perception of young designers towards age and weight .
Exhibition curator and fashion TV presenter Caryn Franklin said : " Working with designers early in their career to introduce this shift is crucial . "
In Fast , she may have found her first true convert .
Commentary : ' A reminder of my own prejudices '
When Hayley Morley first strode down the catwalk at Mark Fast 's fashion show , I admit I blinked .
It was a chastening reminder of my own prejudices , how much I expected to see a certain size of model on the catwalk .
Fast 's casting decision was a great one .
We do need to see more women who reflect the weight and shape of the rest of us on the catwalk .
Their presence genuinely altered my appraisal of the clothes on show , making me consider how I would look in these designs rather than viewing them purely as a reporter .
Fast has previously been criticised for producing super - short , super - tight dresses that only the super - thin would feel comfortable in .
It was interesting to be shown how wrong that is .
Fast 's casting was n't a total success though .
One side - effect of having average - sized women on the catwalk was to emphasise just how thin some of the other models were .
The other problem ?
Purely practical .
The tightness and shortness of the dresses was fine .
The lack of undergarments was not .
Morley 's modelling agency , 12 +UK , lists her chest size as 34D and that 's a bosom that needs support .
I doubt Morley would strut down to the shops without a bra – it's a shame she had to walk the catwalk without one .
Cast normal size women again , Fast , it was great .
But next time , knit them a bra as well as a dress .

Legend of Zelda
If you 've played the Legend of Zelda then you 're familiar with the aspects of the game .
If you have n't then shame on you .
Get an old Nintendo and buy the Legend of Zelda .
Or if you already own it and want to download a backup copy ;-) go to emurater.com and download an emulator ( I suggest either Nesten or Nesticle ) and then download the Legend of Zelda Rom .
Either way , enjoy my analysis of the game .
Wooden Sword Link , unless he 's having a very bad day , finds this well - hidden prize about five seconds into his quest .
The only problem with it is that it 's made out of wood .
Wood ?
I was n't aware that wood was ever used to make swords under any circumstances .
How sharp could a wooden sword be ?
Why not use a stick or a 2 X 4 ?
White Sword
The white sword is ... well ... white .
And it 's a sword .
The Magical Sword is magical .
The Wooden Sword is wooden .
The White Sword is white .
Magical Sword Link graverobs this sword late one night in the cemetery .
It 's obviously magical because it 's pictured at a 30 degree angle .
The Wooden sword and white sword that shoot phantom blades at enemies are apparently not magical at all .
Rupy I have often wondered where money comes from in video games .
It 's often found lying there on the ground or sitting on a ledge .
Sometimes when someone in a video game is killed , money appears .
Did the money belong to the deceased ?
That seems reasonable when you 're fighting , you know , a guy .
But when you get money from killing spiders and stuff , it seems a little weird .
Did the spiders just collect interest from their investment portfolio ?
Nonsense , spiders can't invest .
We think they just got some money from their grandma , just for being good .
5 Rupies
What 's less credible than a spider with one rupy ?
A spider with five rupies .
Heart Collecting these little baubles is truly a treat for our hero .
He will go anywhere to get a heart which restores one unit of life , even if he has to lose five or six to get it .
This is what is known as a " false economy . "
We think .
Heart Container Link likes getting Valentines .
Even better than that he loves coming across someone elses private valentines and stealing them .
He finds them in caves , floating perilously on rafts or in the tunnel under a tree he just burned down .
He even steals valentines from the enemies he kills at the end of each level .
What a bastard .
Fairy
This is why this game was a huge hit with boys .
You run around dancing with fairies trying to catch them .
Link sometimes goes to the fairy 's lake for tea .
She surrounds link with love and gives him energy .
Oh brother .
Bomb
In Zelda , as in real life , the lesson learned from bombs is this :
If you blow things up , you can win prizes .
Unfortunately Link 's invisible satchel is only large enough to hold eight bombs along with all his other goods .
You can pay people later on for a bigger satchel .
Link uses up his bombs quickly blowing up Dodongos and looking for heart containers .
He also blows people 's houses up accidentally .
Why someone is living inside a sealed rock remains to be seen .
Key Keys are weird .
They will open any door in Hyrule .
Any door .
But here 's the catch :
They only work once and then they disappear .
That 's how normal , non-magical keys work .
Magical Key
The magical key has a lion on it , and that 's cool .
It 's a skeleton key that works on all locks in Hyrule .
It 's magical because Link gets to keep it after unlocking a door .
This is why we play fantasy games , to escape into a world where you can do magical stuff like use the same key twice .
Magical Clock
The magical clock is great .
It freezes all the enemies on a screen so that Link can simply stand in front of them and slowly kill them .
A problem with the clock is that you 're a little more likely to get it from killing someone than you are to get the magical sword .
Another problem is that eighty percent of the time Link gets the clock , it 's from the last enemy he killed on the screen .
Boomerang
The Boomerang may look like a simple banana , but it kicks twice as much ass .
You throw it at your enemy and it temporarily paralyzes them .
" Yes , " you may be asking , " but any banana can do that .
What else can it do ? "
Simple : if you throw the boomerang , it comes back to you .
If you turn around you can catch it with your back turned .
If you run from side to side , it will track you .
There 's just no getting away from it .
It 's actually kind of annoying .
Magical Boomerang
Seemingly the only " magical " thing about this boomerang is that it goes twice as far as the regular boomerang .
I think causing paralysis on an enemy is a little more magical than tossing distance .
Perhaps it 's made magical by its blue color .
Map Link usually finds the map just lying on the floor in one of the rooms of an underworld level .
I 'm not sure if this is supposed to be a hiding place for the map or if someone just dropped it .
Compass
There is n't much to say about the compass .
It works like any regular compass .
It tells you where bad guys live by making a red spot flash on your map .
Bow The Bow is either the first or second cool weapon found by Link .
Link 's a little peeved when he finds that it does n't come with any arrows .
He figures that he 'll find them in the next level .
He 's wrong .
Arrow
By buying the arrow , link now has access to the invisible arrow merchant .
The invisible arrow merchant is a little pixie that flies around following Link and selling him arrows at the very reasonable price of one rupy each .
Even though Link is a great return customer the invisible arrow merchant will not give arrows to Link when he runs out of money no matter how much of a pickle he 's in .
Letter
The letter is by far Link 's greatest disappointment .
Link is excited to find that it is his mission to deliver this letter from the man above the waterfall to the strange silent women who reside in caves and under trees across all of Hyrule .
Perhaps when he presents one of them with this letter , they 'll have great advice for him or have a Valentine to give him .
No such luck .
It 's basically his membership card to shop at their exclusive potion boutique .
They 're like the BJ's of Hyrule .
Blue Candle
Here 's an exception to the " Blue being better than red " Rule of the Legend of Zelda .
The Blue Candle is a pretty piss poor candle .
For starters , the flame is blue .
This would lead you to believe it was magic or something .
Nothing is farther from the truth .
It 's a little worse than your average run of the mill candle .
It can only be lit once per screen .
On the plus side , it taught my generation as children that it was fun to burn down trees .
Red Candle
The Red Candle is apparently magical .
All the elements are there .
The flame is red .
You can light it more than once per screen .
That 's about it .
It 's basically just a candle .
It just seems amazing after being saddled with the blue candle for so long .
Life Potion The Life Potion restores health to Link .
Link selects the life potion and presses the ' B ' Button .
Then in just twelve short minutes after listening to a shrill piercing noise he 's fully restored .
Just enough time for Link to forget that the potion is still his selected item .
If he had a red potion he will accidentally restore the half heart damage he took since taking the last potion .
If he had a blue potion he will be trying to attack Wizzrobes with the letter .
2nd Potion
Now there 's delicious Second Potion .
Second Potion was planned as a replacement for Life Potion .
It did not fly so well with the public so after two weeks they re-released Life Potion as Life Potion Classic .
You can still get Second Potion but now it 's called New Potion .
Raft
The raft is a raft , just not a very good one .
The only thing link can do with the raft that 's worth anything is to get to Level 4 .
Link can not use the raft to get the Valentine he sees floating on another raft in the water .
For some reason it does n't work that way .
He also cannot use the raft to sail into the lakes and fire at the Zolas that constantly shell him while he 's on shore .
The raft apparently needs some sort of special dock to launch from .
If the raft was magical perhaps it could be used like a regular raft .
Stepladder
The stepladder is n't really a stepladder so much as it is a bridge .
It can get to places that the raft just would n't be able to .
However it 's always used over water .
Link does n't think too much about the logistics of it , he 's just happy to get another Valentine
Magical Sheild
The magical sheild is such a nuissance .
Link forks out hard earned rupies for the magical sheild and then finds out he 's been rooked .
It 's thirty rupies cheaper somewhere else !
The worst part about the sheild is it 's the only thing Link can permenantly loose during the game .
Like like will digest the metal of Link 's sheild leaving his skin unharmed .
Link will sometimes go for an hour or two before he even realizes that he 's lost his sheild .
Then he forgets where the cheapest store is .
Woe is him .
Power Bracelet
In case Link does n't look like he 's dudded up enough to be attending the Renfest , this particular item puts him over the top .
It looks like a leftover prop from a low budget fantasy movie from the eighties .
Either that or jewlery that muppets were wearing in Dark Crystal .
Recorder
When Link finds the recorder it apparently comes with some sort of Mel Bay Lesson booklet that he does n't get very far in .
Link plays only one six - note song every time he plays the recorder .
It is very magical indeed .
Sometimes a tunnel will appear in the sand , sometimes water will vanish from a pond , but usually a tornado will come and swallow Link up .
Perhaps
Link should n't play the recorder as much as he does .
Food
The second stupidest item in the game .
Link laughs at the thought of buying food from every merchant who tries to sell it to him .
Browsing at the top of the screen
Link sees that he does not need food to survive , only hearts and money .
Unfortunately Link meets up with a hungry oaf in Level 7 that refuses to move .
Link curses himself for not buying the food even though he has 255 rupies .
He also learns that his sword has no effect on the famished fool .
Magical Rod
The magical rod appears to be a fantastic replacement for the boomerang .
However instead of paralyzing an enemy it injures them .
The plus is that it always shoots , wheras the sword only shoots when Link is completely full of love .
Book of Magic Apparently the only thing sketched in this book from right to left is the instructions of how to make the magical rod make fire after it shoots , causing Link to injure himself more often than not .
Apparently it 's easy to use the rod until you want to burn something .
This seems to me to be a rather large manual for the magical rod .
Blue Ring
If there 's one thing that this game teaches you it 's that Blue is Stronger than Red .
Unless you 're Link .
It 's some sort of weird reward to see Link 's clothes change blue .
And when you buy the ring it takes so long to drain the money from Link 's account that Link thinks he can beat the system by travelling off the screen .
Bankers never fall for any tricks of this nature .
Red Ring
We are scarecely able to enjoy Link in his flashy red suit .
He looks like he should be in a Tim Burton movie when he 's dressed all in red .
Enjoy it while it lasts because in ten minutes
Link will be dressed back in green all Robin Hood style with only three hearts and all his preciously collected paraphernalia will be scatered across Hyrule .
Silver Arrow
The silver arrow much like the red ring is given to Link at such a late point in the game he is n't given much time to enjoy it .
The only thing Link uses the silver arrow for it to kill Gannon .
The silver arrow sounds like a one time only item , but apparently he was n't aware that the invisible arrow merchant carried them until he finds out about them in the depths of level 9 .
Triforce Link 's glee reaches a climax as he enters the room with the triforce in it .
It 's just a small part of the triforce but he hoists it up over his head like the stanley cup .
You expect him to kiss it and drink life potion from it .
After Link deafeats Gannon he has his name inscribed on each piece of the Triforce .

With a booming metro population and an increasing reliance on public transport , Toronto needs to expand the existing subway system , says Coun. Michael Thompson .
" What we do know about the city of Toronto , is growth is going to take place , " he told CTV Toronto 's Janice Golding .
" The question is , will we be able to deal with it ? "
Currently , the TTC reports about 470 million riders every year .
And that number keeps growing .
That 's why Thompson has unearthed a decades - old plan for a so - called " downtown relief line , " which would increase capacity on the subway by several thousand each day .
The downtown relief line would look something like this : imagine a broad u-shaped line anchored at Union Station , extending north to Pape on the east and Dundas West on the city 's west side .
An older study on the line calculated that the new line would increase subway capacity by 17,000 riders each hour during peak times .
The line would also shorten riding times in neighbourhoods like Riverdale , Leslieville , the Distillery , Queen West and Parkdale .
It could also ease traffic on Queen Street and elsewhere .
TTC chair Adam Giambrone recently said that the city would pony up $ 5 million on a feasibility study for the 13 - kilometre line .
Now for the bad news : the price tag for the new line could be anywhere from $ 3 to $ 6 billion dollars .
That hefty cost forced the city to abandon the idea in the 1980s .
Still , as the Transit City program begins and work gets underway to extend the Yonge - University line to Vaughan , Thompson says the city can't afford not to expand the TTC .

When Barack Obama spoke to schoolchildren at Wakefield High School in Virginia last week , he used his own experiences to make the case that all young Americans , regardless of their family ’s wealth and income – even kids who “ goofed off ” at high school , like he did – have the potential to rise to the top .
“ That ’s what young people like you are doing every day , all across America , ” he told a national audience during the televised address .
“ Young people like Jazmin Perez , from Roma , Texas .
Jazmin did n’t speak English when she first started school .
Neither of her parents had gone to college .
But she worked hard , earned good grades , and got a scholarship to Brown University – and is now in graduate school , studying public health , on her way to becoming Dr Jazmin Perez . ”
But how typical is Jazmin of Americans today ?
That ’s the question behind the Economic Mobility Project , a non-profit organisation that has been collecting data and surveying attitudes on inequality and social mobility over the past few years .
The Project is part of a coalition of organisations from across the political spectrum which , together , believe that “ the ability of American families to move up or down the income ladder within a lifetime or from one generation to the next ” is a “ unifying and core tenet of the American Dream . ”
The seductive idea that anyone can move up the income scale might mean that Americans are more tolerant of a degree of inequality that would cause much deeper unease in many other western countries .
These questions are also being considered across the Atlantic at the headquarters of the OECD – the thirty - strong club of mainly western economies – in Paris .
In a report drawing on a series of studies from Europe , the United States and Australia , the organisation ’s Anna Cristina d’Addio concluded – echoing the fears that led to the creation of the Economic Mobility Project – that the United States has an unusually rigid social system and limited possibilities for mobility .
Jazmin Perez is very much in a minority .
President Obama is no doubt aware of this research , and has made oblique references to the problems facing low - income families and neighbourhoods in speeches and interviews .
But the mobility myth is so widely believed and so deep - seated that it ’s not surprising he has n’t tried to confront the problem head on .
When the Economic Mobility Project surveyed 2100 adults and ran ten focus groups earlier this year it found that respondents overwhelmingly believe that personal attributes – “ like hard work and drive ” – are the prime determinants of how economically successful an individual can be .
A smaller majority also disagreed with the statement that “ In the United States , a child ’s chances of achieving financial success is tied to the income of his or her parent . ”
As the studies show , that statement is undoubtedly true for most children in the United States , and for a higher proportion of American children than in most comparable countries .
Among the twelve countries analysed by d’Addio in her 2007 report , Intergenerational Transmission of Disadvantage : Mobility or Immobility across Generations ? , the United States was in a group of four – with France , Italy and Britain – where family background plays the greatest role in influencing adult income .
Children born into a poor family in any of these countries had a much lower chance of breaking into a higher income group than in any of the other countries in the study .
( For historical and data - related reasons , most evidence used in these studies relates to the earnings of sons compared to their fathers . )
Britain came out worst , with around 50 per cent of a person ’s income explained by his or her parents ’ income .
In other words , Britain was halfway between a situation in which there is no statistical relationship between a son ’s income and that of his father and a situation in which his income is statistically identical to his father ’s income .
( The lower the percentage , the greater the mobility . )
Italy and the United States were n’t far behind , at around 47 per cent .
At the other end of the range were Denmark , Norway , Finland and Canada , where parental income explained less than 20 per cent of the child ’s eventual earnings .
If these figures are correct – and they ’re generally accepted as being broadly accurate – then it ’s those four countries , rather than the United States , that come closest to realising the American Dream .
Some studies have found that mobility is not only limited in the United States but has worsened in recent decades .
A report for the Future of Children project , a collaboration of the Woodrow Wilson School and the Brookings Institution , found that “ occupational mobility ” – the measure favoured by sociologists – increased during the 1970s but reverted to the levels of the 1940s –60s during the two subsequent decades .
The annual State of Working America report , published by the Economic Policy Institute , found a dramatic worsening since 1980 .
Australia , according to d’Addio , is between Denmark and Norway in the group of most mobile countries .
But her data came from a preliminary version of a paper by the ANU economist Andrew Leigh .
By the time Leigh finalised his calculations he ’d become convinced that Australia was somewhat less mobile – with somewhere between 20 and 30 per cent of an individual ’s income explained by parental income – but still in the top half of performers .
Where d’Addio used existing studies from each country as the basis of her analysis , another major study reworked the data for a number of countries in a standard form .
It concluded that mobility is lower in the United States even than in Britain , which is lower than a group of Nordic countries .
Why do some countries fare so badly on this measure ?
The OECD report offers the most comprehensive list of likely factors , but its conclusions are tentative .
This is n’t surprising , because the things that influence how children develop , how they perform at school , and what path their lives take as adults , are complex , varied and often unmeasurable .
But looking at the factors that the OECD believes contribute “ significantly ” to differences in mobility , it is n’t hard to see why the United States performs badly – and why Australia is still doing relatively well .
First , there ’s the problem of entrenched income inequality .
“ In general , ” says d’Addio in her contribution to a more recent OECD report , Growing Unequal ? , “ the countries with the most equal distributions of income at a given point in time exhibit the highest mobility across generations . ”
Among the twelve countries examined in the report , the United States has the most unequal distribution of income .
The exceptions to the rule , d’Addio continues , “ include Australia and Canada , which combine high mobility with moderately high inequality , and France which has lower mobility than would be expected from its level of inequality . ”
The warning in this data for Australia is that current – or greater – levels of inequality might begin to slow down mobility .
Equally interesting is the role of immigration in pushing up mobility .
Overall , immigrants tend to be more upwardly mobile than the broader population .
Australia ’s relatively high intake of migrants might well have helped boost our level of mobility .
Yet the United States does n’t seem to have gained the same benefits from migration , despite the fact that it too has a large program .
There , other important factors seem to have cancelled out the advantages of America ’s potentially mobile group of immigrants .
This clearly has something to do with how well migrant students perform at school .
In Australia , according to the OECD , children born elsewhere perform only a few per cent below native - born students ; in the United States , the gap is over 30 per cent .
The gap is almost as large for first - generation migrant students .
This reflects a broader problem in the United States : children whose parents have limited education do much worse than their counterparts in Australia , according to the internationally recognised PISA survey of mathematics performance among secondary students .
Some countries did better than Australia on this measure , however , and there are reasons to fear that Australia might do worse – with implications for mobility – if current trends continue .
Why ?
The problem is the growing proportion of education expenditure that comes from private sources .
Among the nations that do best on the mobility scale , private funding generally makes up less than 10 per cent of education spending .
( Canada is the odd one out , at 46 per cent . )
In the United States , a massive 66 per cent of education is privately funded ; in Australia the figure is 52 per cent – a proportion that rose significantly during the Howard years .
As d’Addio observes , this means that paying for education in the United States brings greater benefits than paying for education in most countries .
To put it another way , an underfunded public education system means that , for people who can afford it , the benefits of spending private funds on education can be considerable ; for others , the financial barrier can be too great .
In effect , a large private education sector is a form of “ streaming ” – private schools , especially the elite private schools , try to attract the most academically proficient students from middle - class households , which tends to leave less able students in the non-selective parts of the public system .
According to d’Addio , “ Early streaming of children according to ability reduces educational mobility across generations , while public provision of education ( which reduces the costs of human capital borne by parents ) increases it . ”
On early childhood education , which the OECD report singles out as an important factor in promoting mobility , Australia spends 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product compared to the OECD average of around 0.4 per cent .
Fewer than half of Australia ’s three - to - four year olds are enrolled , compared to an OECD - wide average of over two thirds .
If these trends continue we risk locking in inequality in the same way the United States has .
The other key factor identified indirectly by the OECD , and more explicitly in a new Economic Mobility Project report , is a strikingly low level of mobility among black Americans .
“ Over a generation , ” says the report , “ white children are more likely than blacks to experience upward mobility in adulthood , while black children are more likely than whites to experience downward mobility . ”
The author of the Project ’s report , New York University sociologist Patrick Sharkey , finds that growing up in a high - poverty neighbourhood “ increases the risk of experiencing downward mobility and explains a sizable portion of the black - white downward mobility gap . ”
These neighbourhoods usually suffer from other warning signs for low mobility identified in the OECD report , including a high rate of male unemployment at the time of a child ’s birth and a high rate of relationship breakdown .
( The latter is not restricted to black neighbourhoods : as Andrew Cherlin shows in his recent book , The Marriage - Go - Round , Americans have an unusually high divorce rate . )
For Barack Obama , the possibility of any significant increase in public spending on education in the United States is remote .
But the reform that ’s causing him the most difficulty at the moment – healthcare – also has implications for economic mobility .
Child birth - weight is a “ significant ” factor in explaining low mobility , and the child ’s mental health and parents ’ physical health are “ significant and large ” factors , according to the OECD .
Like any measures designed to break down the rigidity that keeps many Americans poor , improvements in health will take some time to influence overall mobility .
But a system of health insurance for all Americans would certainly have an impact in the long term .
Ironically , the remarkable rise of Barack Obama could make it harder for Americans to recognise the shaky foundations of the American Dream .
And the fact that so many people continue to believe the myth could make the problem worse .
As the American researcher Isabel Sawhill writes , “ When those who are relatively poor believe that they or their children will rise in status over time , they are less likely to complain about the status quo and more likely to accept the prevailing system . ”
Back in Australia , Andrew Leigh sees contending factors explaining the relative stability of mobility rates here over the past four decades ( although the limitations of the data mean that there might well have been a small shift either way ) .
“ On one view , ” he writes in Intergenerational Mobility in Australia , “ the absence of any significant rise in intergenerational mobility might be regarded as surprising .
Increases in health care coverage , the banning of racial discrimination , the abolition of up - front university tuition fees , and an increase in the number of university places are among the policy reforms that might have been expected to increase intergenerational mobility . ”
But there are contending pressures .
“ Rising unemployment , the abolition of federal inheritance taxes in 1979 , and rising spatial concentration of joblessness are among the factors that might have acted to reduce intergenerational mobility .
Moreover , the well - documented rise in inequality in Australia means that the distance between income quintiles was larger in the early - 2000s than in the mid-1960s . ”
The future influence of these factors , and of the increasing privatisation of education , will have a big impact on whether Australian egalitarianism heads in the same direction as the American Dream . •
Tmax Window Uncovered

Warning :
This article is still being written .
Every paragraph marked as “ TODO ” is not yet completed …
Sorry for inconvenience . :p
New !
I ’ve added translations for the presentation of Tmax Window , Tmax Office and Tmax Scoutor .
On July 7 , 2009 , South Korean software company TmaxSoft officially announced its own operating system , Tmax Window along with Tmax Office suite and Tmax Scoutor Web browser .
The company intends these products to be fully compatible alternatives to Microsoft Windows , Office and Internet Explorer in Korean environment .
While its statement looks promising , developers and experts have expressed concern with its development .
Until a few days before official announcement there was no sign of the development , and even when they released the screenshot of their OS many pointed out it seems to be heavily photoshopped .
With actual demonstration its existence became evident , but there are still many uncertainties about development approach , licensing problem ( especially with open source products ) , corporate ethics and so on .
So far as I know , this announcement did n’t find its way to non-Korean people .
This is partly due to lack of English sources : so I decided to write my own , albeit subjective , explanation and analysis in English .
So please excuse my horribly incorrect English . ;)
2009 –07–08 18:40 UTC : There is now an OSnews story about Tmax Window .
I was originally to finish this article and submit it to OSnews but it took so much …
Backgrounds and Early Mentions
TmaxSoft , incorporated in 1997 in South Korea , started its life as middleware vendor , but gradually became an enterprise software company .
Its main product includes JEUS web application server and Tibero relational database .
TODO about Timos ?
Internally there are two subsidiaries of TmaxSoft : TmaxData for database systems and TmaxCore for operating systems .
The earliest mention of Tmax Window was in 2007 , or more specifically , in 10th anniversary event :
Regarding the reason of [ TmaxSoft ’s ] operating system and database development , he [ Daeyeon Park , CTO of TmaxSoft ] emphasizes , “ No company can succeed in worldwide software market without infrastructure technologies , like operating systems or databases .
Such original technology has to be developed even if it takes decades or centuries . ”
He also revealed that the development of new OS started as early as in 2005 and to be released by October .
Then the due date was postponed to January 2009 ( in Feburary 2008 ) , April 2009 ( in November 2008 ) , and finally July 7 , 2009 ( in May 2009 ) .
“ Great Challenge ” Campaign and Controversy
TmaxSoft announced “ Great Challenge ” ( 위대한 도전 ) marketing campaign in May 14 , 2009 , with the final release date July 7 .
TODO details of Great Challenge
Controversy of Tmax Window was started long before .
There is the history of fake or failed Windows - compatible OS projects in Korea :
One person claimed that he / she is able to make Windows - compatible OS targeted to iStation V43 , which runs Linux - based embedded OS in 2006 .
He / she also attempted to raise fund for development .
In 2003 or so , there was an attempt ( named “ Mogua ” ) to make OS whose API is compatible to Windows .
Started by NetBSD hacker , Mogua was to use NetBSD kernel and implement Windows kernel interface as a module .
Even there were some source code for it , but after long flamewar and controversy , the author decided to make it proprietary and silently disappeared .
Yang Byeonggyu , the software developer famous for his BreadZip archiver , had once envisioned Windows - compatible OS .
( He said that BreadZip was a by - product of OS project . )
The project seems to be stalled .
Many criticized the campaign with various reasons , some of which was also applied to above cases :
Both Wine and ReactOS took lots of resources to achieve full Windows compatibility , and still on the way to it .
( Wine started in 1993 and ReactOS started in 1998 . )
While full - time employees can be more productive than open source developers , full Windows compatibility can be difficult to achieve because of complexity and diversity of Windows API , and even the team of full - time employee would take considerable amount of time .
If TmaxSoft used Wine or ReactOS to meet the deadline , they should release its source code in same license .
But there was an instance that TmaxSoft did n’t respect other ’s copyright .
Of course this would not be a problem if they wrote the code from scratch .
There was no sign of hardware testing .
TmaxSoft has promised full hardware compatibility , but this requires enormous testing and cooperation with hardware vendors .
“ Great Challenge ” is a kind of nationality marketing , which is heavily criticized theme throughout Korean society several times .
( See the instance of Hwang Woo Suk controversy and 2007 film D - War . )
TmaxSoft was to be listed in KOSDAQ , Korean equivalent to NASDAQ by 2010 , and there was a rumor that TmaxSoft would be a victim of hostile M&A activity ( in May 2009 ) ; therefore such announcement could boost up the stock price , no matter it ’s fake .
TmaxSoft officialy denied the latter .
Further controversy is caused by fake - looking screenshot uploaded in official Tmax Window blog .
One person compiled an excellent analysis of these photos ( in Korean , and along with photos of course ) .
In this photo , the start menu is below the explorer window .
Folder list of sidebar and main window does n’t match ( e.g. where is “ HNC ” folder ? ) and the volume of C drive is named WinXP .
The taskbar remains empty despite the explorer window .
There are tons of such inconsistencies in other photos not covered here , but anyway you have idea now .
The official blog changed the photo soon but received the criticism as well .
Account of Actual Developer
There is a supposed account of actual developer of Tmax Window ( referred as Tmax OS below ) , as preserved by Nulltech .
Nulltech blog did n’t provide the source of this account , but Nulltech was quite certain about the accuracy of it .
I am one of developers of Tmax OS .
Frankly our OS is not that much .
Basically the kernel is a Unix - like system supporting POSIX standards ( said that written from scratch , as far as I know it refers much of BSD and Linux source code ) .
Several kernel module and driver is also ported from Linux or BSD .
Window manager is not a X server , but its own .
The problem lies on Windows binary driver compatibility : we have had hard time because there was a request that Windows binary driver compatibility is required 2 – 3 months before the release .
What ’s going on ?
The initial plan was to use Linux driver and only to make compatible to [ Windows ] API like GDI .
However about 3 months before the release , Daeyeon Park ordered to make compatible with Windows binary driver and now we make it compatible to Windows kernel API …
I agree on the importance of Windows compatibility , but I cannot understand that such important thing is decided just 3 months before the release .
Since the original design did n’t consider Windows compatibility , the new code is written as like rugs and many came from ReactOS project .
( Moreover ReactOS is GPL licensed . )
I think the core members do n’t have any idea about OS development .
Daeyeon Park has excellent business and technological background ; but the project managers do n’t .
Of course Windows compatibility should affect the initial design of operating system , should n’t it ?
We are now building the perfect OS with UIs of Mac OS X , portability of Linux and compatibility with Windows .
Even worse , the majority of developers are masters in their twenties , hired as a military exemption of research personnel .
Experienced programmer cannot cope with this situation and leaves the company within months , and even exempted people leaves the company after one and half a year .
July 7 , 2009 Announcement
The official announcement was on July 7 , 2009 , in Grand Intercontinental Seoul .
This was also the TmaxDay 2009 , and entirely dedicated to Tmax Window , Office and Scoutor .
The event took place in Grand Ballroom capable for 1,800 persons .
But there were at least estimated 2,500 – 3,000 persons came to the event , so remaining people was watching big screen in the front of ballroom .
Separate outdoor event was also scheduled but canceled due to rain .
The event lasted from 1:30 PM to 6:00 PM ( local time ) , but its registration started at 12:15 PM .
I managed to register at 12:40 PM because of lots of people : I heard that there were already 200 –500 persons at the beginning of registration .
Actual presentation and demonstration started at about 2:30 PM and ended at about 4:30 PM ; the congratulatory performance preceded and followed the presentation .
This announcement also mentioned the final product name , Tmax Window9 in the first time .
They explained that the number 9 means the year 2009 .
( Hmm … Are they going to call it Tmax Window10 in next year ? )
Tmax Window
Tmax Window was the first “ big thing ” of the announcement .
See the presentation slides .
Daeyeon Park presented introductory presentation before the actual presentation , but it was nothing special except giving business plans and claims only .

TODO transcript
According to presentation , Window is a microkernel - based desktop operating system , with specialized compatibility layer and subsystem for compatibility with major operating systems —
Microsoft Windows ( with no mention of version ) and Linux .
Its user experience is modeled after Microsoft Windows due to its user friendliness , and microkernel is chosen for its high stability .
( The presenter however also said that they are going to make another distinct user experience by the end of this year . )
It also comes with Tmax Tibero database engine ( for default data store of applications ) and several utility programs ( including media player featured in the demonstration ) .
The demonstration showed Tmax Window running Microsoft Word 2003 , Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 , its own media player and Starcraft .
Word 2003 ran flawlessly but its splash screen was broken ( failing to render copyright texts ) .
IE suffered from major graphic glitches including several vertical lines , but the application itself did work .
Media player played promotional video of Girls ’ Generation , but the audio and video desynchronized frequently .
Starcraft took 1 + minutes for loading , and the presenter said the gameplay is not working yet ( thus game replay was demonstrated ) , but its graphics did not show any problem .
There were many speculations about Tmax Window , but with the demonstration it became clear that Tmax Window exists and works to some extent .
Some says the entire demonstration might be fake , but there are several demonstration videos for press release which show various aspects of Tmax Window .
Tmax Office
Tmax Office was the second “ big thing ” of the announcement , and demonstrated together with Tmax Scoutor discussed below .
See the presentation slides .

Before talking about the compatibility I ’m going to explain briefly about the structure of typical office suite .
( Slide displayed , showing the relation among external documents , import / export filters , document models and user interactions )
Those majored at computer software might see this diagram often .
There are various document formats in office suite , so there is a filter component which extracts or stores information from / to the document formats .
And there is a document model which can represent every features of such document formats , so this handles all [ the storage and conversion ] .
Also there are a editing component for typing texts or drawing shapes and a rendering component for display the content of document , here denoted as keyboard and mouse shape .
Aside from four major components there are supplementary components — so - called “ engine ” — which is quite similar to OpenOffice.org ’s one since we started from it .
According to presentation , Office is an office suite consists of ProWord ( word processor ) , ProCel ( spreadsheet ) , ProPoint ( presentation ) and ProMail ( e- mail and PIMS ) .
They are designed to be compatible with Microsoft Word , Excel , Powerpoint and Outlook respectively , and able to read and write both ISO / IEC 26300 OpenDocument format ( major implementation being OpenOffice.org ) and ISO / IEC DIS 29500 Office Open XML format ( major implementation being Microsoft Office 2007 and later ) .
The presenter indirectly hinted that the product is based on OpenOffice.org , saying that they “ started the development from it ” and “ had replaced document models and added more filter services [ to it ] ” ( slide # 9 ) .
Its appearance is quite similar to OpenOffice.org and there are some ( though inconclusive ) evidences confirming OO.o origin , including infamous GPL. txt in the directory .
They have developed comprehensive conversion filter between OpenDocument and Office Open XML , which even covers the document feature supported by one format but not by another .
The slide also mentioned a rendering core optimized for multiple core or processor .
He demonstrated file format compatibility with Microsoft Office , by opening the file in MS Office , opening and editing same file in Tmax Office , and opening the file in MS Office again to show the edit .
This procedure worked fairly well , except for minor conversion errors such as slight geometry changes .
ProMail is not demonstrated if I recall correctly , and much notably , Tmax Office and Scoutor was not demonstrated in Tmax Window but in Microsoft Windows XP .
This may suggest the current implementation quality of Tmax Window .
Tmax Scoutor
Tmax Scoutor was the third , and last “ big thing ” of the announcement .
See the presentation slides .

As mentioned earlier , the support of Microsoft specific features such Javascript and DOM API is needed for the domestic [ Korean ]
Web environment so we added every needed features to our browser engine .
It provides DOM , Browser Object Model and Javascript APIs exposing such object [ model ]s .
( Names such as JavascriptCore , WebCore and Webkit can be seen on the slide . )

First let ’s view [ Acid3 test page ] with Internet Explorer .
( Launches Internet Explorer 8 ) Okay , it failed with 12 [ out of 100 ] points and …
Shall we wait more ?
… Yes it scored 20 .
Then let ’s view same page [ with Scoutor ] .
( Launches Tmax Scoutor , and scores 98 out of 100 ) Oh …
Let ’s try once more .
( Screen reloaded , in this time scores 99 out of 100 ) Ha , we made it to 99 points .
( Applause )
Well it complies well with Web standard as you saw , then let ’s see portal sites , like …
Naver .
Let ’s view Naver with it .
( Launches Naver )
Search ranking is n’t shown , by the way .
Then …
Let ’s sign in and check the e-mail .
( Screen reloaded )
There is a new mail , let ’s check it .
( Mail screen shown )
As you see there is no problem with web mail .
And …
It looks like dinner engagement , ( Click ) and there is a link to Youtube .
Let ’s see what video is it .
( Click , and video is played )
Now the video is playing .
You see Flash - based video is played with Adobe Flash plugin .
Let ’s check other letter .
( Click )
It is a teaser and , ( Click , and video is played ) this media player is written for Tmax Window .
So it is able to play Flash [ FLV ] format — de facto standard in Web—using Adobe Flash player , and WMV format or so using own player .
Next …
I think you are friendly to games such as ones by portal sites , using Web browser .
Simple games can be enjoyed with Flash within the browser , but it makes the game too simple to catch the interest .
So in Korea downloading game program and launching it with ActiveX plugin is popular .
So let ’s launch the game in the portal site .
( Nate Game is displayed ) I remind that she [ after the computer ] is typing e-mail addresses , but do not send e-mail to them : it is made just for testing .
Uh …
There are so many games , since in the earlier press conference it is pointed out that Go - Stop is not appropriate for all ages we exclude such ones , so let ’s choose a board game appropriate for every family .
Well … Let ’s launch Spot the Difference .
For me it is a game of rolling eyes and seeking for differences .
( Click , and new non -browser window pops up )
It runs immediately and runs well .
Could you join the game ?
( Joins the game , screen changes )
Okay , since we are in the demonstration we ’ll stop the game here .
… Yes please stop the game .
Next , let ’s view banking website which shows huge differences between IE and non-IE browsers .
Especially a website with [ SSL ] certificates .
First let ’s see how the non-IE browsers are … discriminated .
The second popular Web browser in the world is [ Mozilla ] Firefox , by Mozilla [ Foundation ] .
Let ’s launch it .
( Try to see IBK website , but the alert says “ Netscape 6.0 is not supported ” )
Note that we are not to blame developers of specific bank website , as it is chosen randomly .
Then let ’s view same website in Scoutor .
( The same website shown very well )
The message saying unsupported browser disappeared and it is shown well .
Let ’s sign in .
( ActiveX - flavored certificate selecting window pops up )
Wait a minute .
This certificate selecting window is implemented with ActiveX , so ActiveX support is required just to display this window , and browsers without the support does n’t display this one .
Let ’s type the certificate password in .
( Window disappeared , the bank account list appears )
Eh , the balance is only 100 won , it was originally much but it seems all drawn .
It may be the sabotage for payment increase … but anyway it ’s time to close it as more demonstration will be privacy infringement .
This ends the demonstration of [ Tmax ] Office and Scoutor . ( Applause )
According to presentation , Scoutor is an almost - standard - conforming Web browser with Microsoft Internet Explorer compatibility in the mind .
Internet Explorer compatibilty was crucial , because many Korean websites are designed for IE only , thus the adoption of Web standards and accessability practices is slow .
Its core is supposedly based on Webkit , but major rewriting allowed it to support / replicate JScript , ActiveX controls and non-standard behaviors of IE .
In the end of demonstration , they presented real - time Acid3 test .
It scored 98 or 99 out of 100 , ( I think ) passed smoothness criterion , and rendered the page correctly except for failing to hide X at right - top corner ( Web font support is required for this ) .
The presenter explained that slightly lower score is the result of IE compatibility , and thus acceptable .
Analysis
There are many gaps between the facts about Tmax Window ( and so on ) , but after July 7 announcement many new facts are made available , so we can now attempt to analyze these facts .
Tmax Window
Tmax Window is based on its own microkernel .
While slides on microkernel , praising its stability , is technologically correct , the presenter ( maybe intentionally ? ) missed the fact that good microkernel is difficult to build , mainly because of inter-process communication ( IPC ) overhead and complexity of components .
( I ’m not going to criticize microkernel here , but to note that building good microkernel is as hard as building good monolithic kernel . )
They even made misleading statements that all other operating systems use traditional ( monolithic ) kernel thus inferior : while Linux kernel is clearly monolithic and Windows NT kernel has arguably monolithic architecture ( thus called “ hybrid ” ) , these kernels have various features which was initially believed to be possible only in microkernel — for example modern kernels including Linux , Mac OS X ( XNU kernel ) and Windows NT can plug kernel modules in runtime via means of loadable kernel module ( LKM ) .
Tanenbaum - Torvalds debate would be much comprehensive in this subject .
Regarding the compatibility , the entire OS design seems reasonable in this aspect if it is really implemented .
TODO Developers suspect that many potions of compatibility layer and subsystem come from Wine and ReactOS , even if they have the original architecture .
The account of actual developer above supports this .
The role of Tibero DBMS in Tmax Window is vague .
The slide says it is hard to meet various requirements of data management in applications , so OS - wide database system like Tibero is essential .
Full featured DBMS in OS is not a new idea : for instance , Windows CE 5 bundles SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition .
But is Tibero appropriate for it ?
It ’d be like embedding Oracle and forcing applications make use of it .
TODO
Tmax Office
Tmax Office is reportedly based on OpenOffice.org .
TODO
The presentation focused at the compatibility of Tmax Office , but did n’t say anything about unique features .
TODO
Tmax Scoutor
Tmax Scoutor is , as the presenter puts it , based on Webkit rendering engine .
While Webkit source code is small , clean and extensible , IE compatibility and Web standard conformance cannot be achieved together .
( For example , if some website rely on incorrect CSS box model of IE this has to be replicated , but it is also a clear violation of CSS standard . )
So at the best , they may have altered quirks mode to resemble IE ’s one .
They also may just have used different rendering engines for different websites .
This approach is already used in many browsers , including Lunascape supporting Trident , Gecko and Webkit .
But this possibility is rather low , since they have to bundle Trident ( aka MSHTML ) to do this and it would be copyright violation .
It is still uncertain that IE - specific website is indeed rendered by Webkit .
Relation with Open Source
Tmax Window , Office and Scoutor can present huge threat to free and open source software community in general .
Tmax Office is basically an OpenOffice.org with excellent document converter , and Tmax Scoutor is basically an Webkit engine with IE compatibility fixes .
Both OpenOffice.org and Webkit is LGPL licensed , and the license has to be retained after the modification and distribution .
( If they used so - called permissive licenses this could not be a problem , but the credit is required anyway . )
Another important thing is that , they should not claim the open source technology as original technology of themselves .
( Original technology , in Korea , is also a part of Hwang Woo Suk controversy . )
For example they claim the superior Web standard support in Tmax Scoutor , but it is by Webkit team and not by TmaxSoft !
Even if they release the source code , they have to attribute to the original authors accordingly or they are unethical .
Corporate Ethics
The presenters including Daeyeon Park CTO are blamed for justifying the disregard of the rights of developers .

Seungho Han , a blogger known for hoogle blog and a TmaxSoft research worker , tweeted about Tmax Window :
@CharlesJRhee
It ’s not a public beta — it ’s like a public gamma .
07–07 05:38 AM
( In reply to “ Is Tmax Window beta going to be tested publicly ?
07–07 05:35 AM
” ) Many says “ there are only weekdays , no weekends in TmaxSoft ” , but I recall that Apple also did so when it ’s designing iPod .
From today Tmax Window development team is given the vacation for a week …
07–08 04:xx PM ?
@golbin
I ’ve told it many times …
There are hundreds of Tmax Window developers but only a few of them have researched OSes .
Imagine that Allblog [ @golbin ’s company ] lost all experienced developers like you , and must make it from scratch …
07–08 04:xx PM ?
@ CharlesJRhee
I do n’t know about divorced one but ones fell in a faint or going home late are easy to found .
But they were happy for their dream and even disliked weekday - weekend things to be mentioned .
07–08 04:xx PM ?
@golbin
I ’m going to take a picture [ of the office ] …
Originally two researchers used one room , but for debugging and communication purpose every small rooms are merged into one big room and researchers worked there for months . :) 07–08 04:xx PM ?
@ CharlesJRhee
Upon my honor I surly say that kernel was in the investment and development 3 years before when I joined , and the kernel team was the first of [ Tmax ] Window teams .
07–08 04:xx PM ?
@channyun
You ’re right .
I think it is wrong that he ’s proud of divorce due to development ; but my junior moved to some game company told me that the new company is worse .
Anyway divorce is depressing .
I do n’t know who he / she is .
07–08 04:xx PM ?
( In reply to “ @hoogle You did n’t understand .
That is not a problem of him , but a structural problem of the company which makes the employee divorced by hard work .
07–08 04:xx PM ? ” )
I also missed the wedding on June 20 , because my teammate ( and thus I ) were on a business trip to Japan .
It ’s unfortunate but I did n’t complain the company and my wife understood me as well .
The loss due to trip is later paid from the company .
07–08 04:xx PM ?
@pHealth
For today I want to tell everything I know for curious .
07–08 05:xx PM ?
Conclusion
I always like diversity .
But as a long time Windows , Linux and Mac OS X user , I do agree on necessity of OS compatibility , and Tmax Window and other products seem to have such potential .
Though it is unfortunate that these products would be proprietary again , resulting diversity itself helps .
But I also worry about the stance of TmaxSoft .
They still rely on the nationality marketing and unfair press releases , and seem to justify disregarding the rights of developers .
It is also in doubt that they give back to the free and open source community .
Not to mention current implementation quality of Tmax Window .
In the other words Tmax Window has too many hurdles to jump over and it just passed one hurdle .
So will it succeed ?
Who knows ?
I ’d like to thank to Seo Sanghyeon and Park Shinjo for numerous suggestions to this article .
Additional Resources
Several social networking websites have a dedicated tag for Tmax Window , including Twitter and Me2day .
There are lots of demonstration videos in Youtube .
TmaxSoft released slides used in the July 7 , 2009 representation : Tmax Window ( PDF , 7MB ) , Tmax Office ( PDF , 1.8MB ) and Tmax Scoutor ( PDF , 2MB ) , and respectively translated in Engilsh above .
They also gave press release in English .

Update ( March 19 2010 ) : this article was updated for LLVM 2.6 thanks to a great patch by John Harrison .
He rocks !
I ’ve always been interested in compilers and languages , but interest only gets you so far .
A lot of the concepts of compiler design can easily go way over most programmers ’ heads , even the intelligent ones .
Needless to say , I ’ve tried , without much success , to write a small toy language / compiler before .
I ’d usually get caught up at the semantic parsing stage .
And again , needless to say , this post is mostly inspired by my latest attempt , though this one has been much more successful ( so far ) .
Fortunately over the last few years I ’ve been involved in some projects that helped give me perspective and experience on what ’s really involved in building a compiler .
The other thing I ’ve been lucky to have in my corner this time is the help of LLVM , a tool which I ’m hardly qualified to talk too much about , but it ’s been quite handy in implementing most of the business end ( read : complex aspects ) of my toy compiler .
So Why Are You Reading This ?
Maybe you want to see what I ’ve been doing with my time .
It ’s more likely , however , that you ’re probably interested in compilers and languages as I am , and have probably been hitting similar roadblocks .
You ’ve probably wanted to try this but never found the resources , or did but could n’t quite follow .
The goal of this article is to provide such a resource and explain in a relatively step by step manner how to create the most basic - but - functional compiler from start to “ finish ” .
I wo n’t be covering much theory , so if you have n’t brushed up on your BNF grammars , AST data structures and the basic compiler pipeline , I suggest you do so .
That said , I plan on keeping this as simple as possible .
The goal , of course , is to make this an easy - to - understand introductory resource for people interested but not experienced with compilers .
What You Will End Up With
If you follow this article , you should end up with a language that can define functions , call functions , define variables , assign data to variables and perform basic math operations .
It will support two basic types , doubles and integers .
Some of the functionality is unimplemented , so you can have the satisfaction of actually implementing some of this stuff yourself and get the hang of writing a compiler with a little help .
Let ’s Get Some Questions
Out of the Way
1 . What languages do I need to know ?
The tools we ’ll be using are C/ C++ based .
LLVM is specifically C++ and our toy language will follow suit since there are some niceties of OOP and the STL ( C++’s stdlib ) that make for fewer lines of code .
In addition to C , both Lex and Bison have their own syntax which may seem daunting at first , but I ’ll try to explain as much as possible .
The grammar we ’re dealing with is actually very tiny ( ~100 LOC ) , so it should be feasible .
2 . Is this really complicated ?
Yes and no .
There is plenty of stuff going on here and it might seem scary at first , but honestly , this is about as simple as it gets .
We will also use a lot of tools to abstract the layers of complexity and make it manageable .
3 . How long will it take ?
What we will be building took me about 3 days of toying with , but I have a few failed attempts under my belt and those do have impact on my comprehension .
Of course , this will be a “ follow me ” kind of deal , so it should be much shorter for you .
To understand completely everything might take a little longer , but you should be able to run through all of this stuff ( and hopefully understand a good amount of it ) in an afternoon .
So , if you ’re ready , let ’s get started .
The Basic Compiler Recipe
Although you should already pretty much know this , a compiler is really a grouping of three to four components ( there are some more sub- components ) where data is fed from one to the next in a pipeline fashion .
We will be using a different tool to help us build out each of these components .
Here is a diagram of each step and the tool we will use :
You ’ll notice the linker step is greyed out .
Our toy language wo n’t be supporting compile time linking ( plus most languages do n’t do compile time linking anymore anyway ) .
To do our lexing we will be using the open source tool Lex , mostly available these days as Flex .
Lexing usually goes hand in hand with semantic parsing , which we ’ll be performing with the help of Yacc , better known as Bison .
Finally , once semantic parsing is done we can walk over our AST and generate our “ bytecode ” , or machine code .
For this , we ’ll be using LLVM , which technically generates intermediate bytecode , but we will be using LLVM ’s JIT ( Just In Time ) compilation to execute this bytecode on our machine .
To summarize , the steps are as follows :
Lexical Analysis with Flex : Split input data into a set of tokens ( identifiers , keywords , numbers , brackets , braces , etc. ) Semantic Parsing with Bison : Generate an AST while parsing the tokens .
Bison will do most of the legwork here , we just need to define our AST .
Assembly with LLVM :
This is where we walk over our AST and generate byte / machine code for each node .
As crazy as it sounds , this is probably the easiest step .
Before moving too far along , you should probably consider installing Flex , Bison and LLVM , if you have n’t already .
We ’re going to need them pretty soon .
Defining Our Grammar
Our grammar is naturally the most central part of our language .
From our grammar we inherently allow or disallow functionality .
For our toy compiler , we will be using a standard C - like syntax because it ’s familiar and simple to parse .
The canonical example of our toy language will be the following code :
int do_math ( int a ) { int x = a * 5 + 3 } do_math ( 10 )
Looks simple enough .
We can see it ’s typed the same way C is , but there are no semicolons separating statements .
You ’ll also notice there is no “ return ” statement in our grammar ; this is something you can implement on your own .
There ’s also no mechanism to print any results or anything .
We will verify the correctness of our programs by inspecting the very pretty instruction listing that LLVM can print of the bytecode we ’ve compiled , but more on that later .
Step 1 . Lexical Analysis with Flex
This is the simplest step .
Given our grammar , we need to break down our input into a list of known tokens .
As mentioned before , our grammar has very basic tokens : identifiers , numbers ( integers and floats ) , the mathematical operators , parentheses and braces .
Our lex file “ tokens.l ” , which has a somewhat specialized grammar , is simply defined as :
Listing of tokens.l :
%{ #include < string > # include " node.h " #include " parser.hpp " # define SAVE_TOKEN yylval.string = new std:: string( yytext , yyleng ) # define TOKEN ( t ) ( yylval .token = t ) extern " C " int yywrap ( ) { } %} % % [ \t
] ; [ a - zA - Z_ ] [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] * SAVE_TOKEN ; return TIDENTIFIER ; [ 0 - 9 ] +. [ 0 - 9 ] * SAVE_TOKEN ; return TDOUBLE ; [ 0 - 9 ] +
SAVE_TOKEN ; return TINTEGER ; " = " return TOKEN ( TEQUAL ) ; " == " return TOKEN ( TCEQ ) ; " != " return TOKEN ( TCNE ) ; " < " return TOKEN ( TCLT ) ; " < = " return TOKEN ( TCLE ) ; " > " return TOKEN ( TCGT ) ; " >= " return TOKEN ( TCGE ) ; " ( " return TOKEN ( TLPAREN ) ; " ) " return TOKEN ( TRPAREN ) ; " { " return TOKEN ( TLBRACE ) ; " } " return TOKEN ( TRBRACE ) ; " . " return TOKEN ( TDOT ) ; " , " return TOKEN ( TCOMMA ) ; " + " return TOKEN ( TPLUS ) ; " - " return TOKEN ( TMINUS ) ; " * " return TOKEN ( TMUL ) ; " / " return TOKEN ( TDIV ) ; . printf ( " Unknown token ! n " ) ; yyterminate ( ) ; %%
The first section declares some specialized C code .
We use a “ SAVE_TOKEN ” macro to keep the text of identifiers and numbers somewhere safe ( instead of just the token itself ) , since Bison wo n’t have access to our ‘ yytext ’ variable .
The first token tells us to skip all whitespace .
You ’ll also notice that we have some equality comparison tokens and such .
Those are unimplemented for now , feel free to support them in your toy compiler !
So all we ’re doing here is defining the tokens and their symbolic names .
These symbols ( TIDENTIFIER , etc. ) will become “ terminal symbols ” in our grammar .
We ’re just returning them , but we ’ve never defined them .
Where are they defined ?
Why , in the bison grammar , of course .
The parser.hpp file we ’ve included will be generated by bison , and all the tokens inside it will be generated and available for use .
We run Flex on this tokens .l file to generate our “ tokens.cpp ” file , which will be compiled alongside our parser and provide the yylex ( ) function that recognizes all of these tokens .
We will run this command later though , because we need to generate that header file from bison first !
Step 2 . Semantic Parsing with Bison
This is the challenging part of our mission .
Generating an accurate , unambiguous grammar is not simple and takes a little bit of practice .
Fortunately , our grammar is both simple and , for your benefit , mostly completed .
Before we get into implementing our grammar , though , we need to talk design for a bit .
Designing the AST
The end product of semantic parsing is an AST .
As we will see , Bison is quite elegantly optimized to generate AST ’s ; it ’s really only a matter of plugging our nodes into the grammar .
The same way a string such as “ int x ” represents our language in text form , our AST is what represents our language in memory ( before it is assembled ) .
As such , we need to build up the data structures we will be using before we have the chance of plugging them into our grammar file .
This process is pretty straightforward because we are basically creating a structure for every semantic that can be expressed by our language .
Method calls , method declarations , variable declarations , references , these are all candidates for AST nodes .
A complete diagram of the nodes in our language is as follows :
The C++ that represents the above specifications is :
Listing of node.h :
# include < iostream > # include < vector > # include < llvm / Value.h > class CodeGenContext ; class NStatement ; class NExpression ; class NVariableDeclaration ; typedef std::vector < NStatement *> StatementList ; typedef std::vector < NExpression *> ExpressionList ; typedef std::vector<NVariableDeclaration *>
VariableList ; class Node { public : virtual ~ Node ( ) {} virtual llvm : : Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) { } } ; class NExpression : public Node { } ; class NStatement : public Node { } ; class NInteger : public NExpression { public : long long value ; NInteger ( long long value ) : value ( value ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NDouble : public NExpression { public : double value ; NDouble ( double value ) : value ( value ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NIdentifier : public NExpression { public : std::string name ; NIdentifier ( const std::string& name ) : name ( name ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NMethodCall : public NExpression { public : const NIdentifier& id ; ExpressionList arguments ; NMethodCall ( const NIdentifier& id , ExpressionList& arguments ) : id ( id ) , arguments ( arguments ) { } NMethodCall ( const NIdentifier& id ) : id ( id ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NBinaryOperator : public NExpression { public : int op ; NExpression & lhs ; NExpression & rhs ; NBinaryOperator ( NExpression& lhs , int op , NExpression& rhs ) : lhs ( lhs ) , rhs ( rhs ) , op ( op ) { } virtual llvm : : Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NAssignment : public NExpression { public : NIdentifier & lhs ; NExpression& rhs ; NAssignment ( NIdentifier & lhs , NExpression& rhs ) : lhs ( lhs ) , rhs ( rhs ) { } virtual llvm : : Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NBlock : public NExpression { public : StatementList statements ; NBlock ( ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NExpressionStatement : public NStatement { public : NExpression& expression ; NExpressionStatement ( NExpression& expression ) : expression ( expression ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NVariableDeclaration : public NStatement { public : const NIdentifier & type ; NIdentifier& id ; NExpression * assignmentExpr ; NVariableDeclaration ( const NIdentifier & type , NIdentifier & id ) : type( type ) , id ( id ) { } NVariableDeclaration ( const NIdentifier & type , NIdentifier & id , NExpression * assignmentExpr ) : type( type ) , id ( id ) , assignmentExpr( assignmentExpr ) { } virtual llvm :: Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ; class NFunctionDeclaration : public NStatement { public : const NIdentifier & type ; const NIdentifier& id ; VariableList arguments ; NBlock& block ; NFunctionDeclaration ( const NIdentifier & type , const NIdentifier& id , const VariableList& arguments , NBlock& block ) : type( type ) , id ( id ) , arguments ( arguments ) , block ( block ) { } virtual llvm : : Value* codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) ; } ;
Again , fairly straightforward .
We ’re not using any getters or setters here , just public data members ; there ’s really no need for data hiding .
Ignore the codeGen method for now .
It will come in handy later , when we want to export our AST as LLVM bytecode .
Back to Bison
Moo .
I mean , whatever Bison say .
Here ’s a short tangent :
Anyway , here comes the most complex part and by the same token , the hardest to explain .
It ’s not technically complicated , but I ’d have to spend a while discussing the details of Bison ’s syntax , so let ’s take a lot of it for granted right now .
Realize this , though : we ’ll be declaring the makeup of each of our valid statements and expressions ( the ones representing the nodes we ’ve defined above ) using terminal and non-terminal symbols , basically like a BNF grammar .
The syntax is also similar :
if_stmt : IF '( ' condition ' ) ' block { /* do stuff when this rule is encountered */ } | IF ' ( ' condition ' ) ' { ... } ;
The above would define an if statement ( if we supported it ) .
The real difference is that with each grammar comes a set of actions ( inside the braces ) which are executed after it is recognized .
This is done recursively over the symbols in leaf - to - root order , where each non terminal is eventually merged into one big tree .
The “ $ $ ” symbol you will be seeing represents the current root node of each leaf .
Furthermore , “ $ 1 ” represents the leaf for the 1st symbol in the rule .
In the above example , the “ $ $ ” we assigned from our “ condition ” rule would be available as “ $ 3 ” in our “ if_stmt ” rule .
It might start becoming clear how our AST ties into this .
We will basically be assigning a node to “ $ $ ” at each of our rules which will eventually be merged into our final AST .
If not , do n’t worry .
The Bison part of our toy language is again , the most complex portion of our language .
It might take a while to sink in .
Besides , you have n’t even seen the code yet , so , here it is :
Listing of parser.y :
%{ #include " node. h " NBlock * programBlock ; /* the top level root node of our final AST */ extern int yylex ( ) ; void yyerror ( const char * s ) { printf ( " ERROR : %sn " , s ) ; } %} /*
Represents the many different ways we can access our data */ %union { Node * node ; NBlock * block ; NExpression * expr ; NStatement * stmt ; NIdentifier *ident ; NVariableDeclaration * var_decl ; std::vector<NVariableDeclaration *> * varvec ; std::vector< NExpression *>
* exprvec ; std :: string * string ; int token ; } /* Define our terminal symbols ( tokens ) .
This should match our tokens .l lex file .
We also define the node type they represent .
*/ % token < string >
TIDENTIFIER TINTEGER TDOUBLE % token < token > TCEQ TCNE TCLT TCLE TCGT TCGE TEQUAL % token < token > TLPAREN TRPAREN TLBRACE TRBRACE TCOMMA TDOT % token < token >
TPLUS TMINUS TMUL TDIV /*
Define the type of node our nonterminal symbols represent .
The types refer to the %union declaration above .
Ex : when we call an ident ( defined by union type ident ) we are really calling an ( NIdentifier * ) .
It makes the compiler happy .
*/ % type < ident > ident % type < expr > numeric expr % type < varvec > func_decl_args % type < exprvec > call_args % type < block > program stmts block % type < stmt > stmt var_decl func_decl % type < token > comparison /* Operator precedence for mathematical operators */ % left TPLUS TMINUS % left TMUL TDIV % start program % % program : stmts { programBlock = $ 1 ; } ; stmts : stmt { $ $ = new NBlock ( ) ; $ $-> statements.push_back ( $ < stmt > 1 ) ; } | stmts stmt { $ 1->statements.push_back ( $ < stmt > 2 ) ; } ; stmt : var_decl | func_decl | expr { $ $ = new NExpressionStatement ( * $ 1 ) ; } ; block : TLBRACE stmts TRBRACE { $ $ = $ 2 ; } | TLBRACE TRBRACE { $ $ = new NBlock ( ) ; } ; var_decl : ident ident { $ $ = new NVariableDeclaration ( * $ 1 , *$ 2 ) ; } | ident ident TEQUAL expr { $ $ = new NVariableDeclaration ( * $ 1 , *$ 2 , $ 4 ) ; } ; func_decl : ident ident TLPAREN func_decl_args TRPAREN block { $ $ = new NFunctionDeclaration ( * $ 1 , *$ 2 , * $ 4 , * $ 6 ) ; delete $ 4 ; } ; func_decl_args : /* blank*/ { $ $ = new VariableList ( ) ; } | var_decl { $ $ = new VariableList ( ) ; $ $ -> push_back ( $ < var_decl > 1 ) ; } | func_decl_args TCOMMA var_decl { $ 1-> push_back ( $ < var_decl > 3 ) ; } ; ident : TIDENTIFIER { $ $ = new NIdentifier ( * $ 1 ) ; delete $ 1 ; } ; numeric : TINTEGER { $ $ = new NInteger ( atol ( $ 1-> c_str ( ) ) ) ; delete $ 1 ; } | TDOUBLE { $ $ = new NDouble ( atof ( $ 1-> c_str ( ) ) ) ; delete $ 1 ; } ; expr : ident TEQUAL expr { $ $ = new NAssignment ( * $ < ident > 1 , * $ 3 ) ; } | ident TLPAREN call_args TRPAREN { $ $ = new NMethodCall ( * $ 1 , * $ 3 ) ; delete $ 3 ; } | ident { $ < ident > $ = $ 1 ; } | numeric | expr comparison expr { $ $ = new NBinary Operator ( * $ 1 , $ 2 , * $ 3 ) ; } | TLPAREN expr TRPAREN { $ $ = $ 2 ; } ; call_args : /* blank*/ { $ $ = new ExpressionList ( ) ; } | expr { $ $ = new ExpressionList ( ) ; $ $ -> push_back ( $ 1 ) ; } | call_args TCOMMA expr { $ 1-> push_back ( $ 3 ) ; } ; comparison : TCEQ | TCNE | TCLT | TCLE | TCGT | TCGE | TPLUS | TMINUS | TMUL | TDIV ; %%
Generating Our Code
So we have our “ tokens.l ” file for Flex and our “ parser.y ” file for Bison .
To generate our C++ source files from these definition files we need to pass them through the tools .
Note that Bison will also be creating a “ parser.hpp ” header file for Flex ; it does this because of the –d switch , which separates our token declarations from the source so we can include and use those tokens elsewhere .
The following commands should create our parser.cpp , parser.hpp and tokens.cpp source files .
$ bison -d - o parser.cpp parser.y $ lex -o tokens.cpp tokens.l
If everything went well we should now have 2 out of 3 parts of our compiler .
If you want to test this , create a short main function in a main.cpp file :
Listing of main.cpp :
#include < iostream > # include " node.h " extern NBlock * programBlock ; extern int yyparse ( ) ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { yyparse ( ) ; std::cout << programBlock << std::endl ; return 0 ; }
You can then compile your source files :
$ g++ -o parser parser.cpp tokens.cpp main.cpp
You will need to have installed LLVM by now for the llvm : : Value reference in “ node.h ” .
If you do n't want to go that far just yet , you can comment out the codeGen ( ) methods in node.h to test just your lexer / parser combo .
If all goes well you should now have a “ parser ” binary that takes source in stdin and prints out a hopefully nonzero address representing the root node of our AST in memory .
Step 3 . Assembling the AST with LLVM
The next step in a compiler is to naturally take this AST and turn it into machine code .
This means converting each semantic node into the equivalent machine instruction .
LLVM makes this very easy for us , because it abstracts the actual instructions to something that is similar to an AST .
This means all we ’re really doing is translating from one AST to another .
You can imagine that this process will involve us walking over our AST from our root node , and for each node we emit bytecode .
This is where the codeGen method that we defined for our nodes comes in handy .
For example , when we visit an NBlock node ( semantically representing a collection of statements ) , we call codeGen on each statement in the list .
It looks like this :
Value * NBlock::codeGen( CodeGenContext& context ) { StatementList :: const_iterator it ; Value * last = NULL ; for ( it = statements . begin ( ) ; it != statements.end ( ) ; it ++ ) { std::cout << " Generating code for " << typeid(** it) .name ( ) << std::endl ; last = (**it).codeGen(context ) ; } std::cout << " Creating block " << std::endl ; return last ; }
We implement this method for all of our nodes , then call it as we go down the tree , implicitly walking us through our entire AST .
We keep a new CodeGenContext class around to tell us where to emit our bytecode .
A Big Caveat About LLVM
One of the downsides of LLVM is that it ’s really hard to find useful documentation .
Their online tutorial and other such docs are wildly out of date , and there ’s barely any information for the C++ API unless you really dig for it .
If you installed LLVM on your own , check the ‘ docs ’ as it has “ more ” up to date documentation .
I ’ve found the best way to learn LLVM is by example .
There are some quick examples of programmatically generating bytecode in the ‘ examples ’ directory of the LLVM archive as well , and there ’s also the LLVM live demo site which can emit C++ API code for a C program as input .
This is a great way to find out what instructions something like “ int x = 5 ; ” will emit .
I used the demo tool to implement most of the nodes .
Without further ado , I ’ll be listing both the codegen.h and codegen.cpp files below .
Listing of codegen.h :

There is certainly a great deal to take in here , however this is the part where you should start exploring on your own .
I only have a couple of notes :
We use a “ stack ” of blocks in our CodeGenContext class to keep the last entered block ( because instructions are added to blocks )
We also use this stack to keep a symbol table of the local variables in each block .
Our toy program only knows about variables in its own scope .
To support the idea of “ global ” contexts you ’d need to search upwards through each block in our stack until you found a match to the symbol ( rather than simply searching the top symbol table ) .
Before entering a block we should push the block and when leaving it we should pop it .
The rest of the details are all related to LLVM , and again , I ’m hardly an expert on that subject .
But at this point , we have all of the code we need to compile our toy language and watch it run .
Building Our Toy Language
We have the code , but how to we build it ?
LLVM can be complicated to link , fortunately if you installed LLVM you also got an llvm - config binary which returns all of the compiler / linker flags you need .
We also need to update our main.cpp file from earlier to actually compile and run our code , this time :
Listing of main.cpp :
# include < iostream > # include " codegen.h " # include " node.h " using namespace std ; extern int yyparse ( ) ; extern NBlock * programBlock ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { yyparse ( ) ; std::cout << programBlock << std::endl ; CodeGenContext context ; context.generateCode(*programBlock ) ; context.runCode ( ) ; return 0 ; }
Now all we need to do is compile :
g++ -o parser `llvm - config -- libs core jit native -- cxxflags -- ldflags` *.cpp
You can also grab this Makefile to make things easier :
Listing of Makefile :
Running Our Toy Language
Hopefully everything compiled properly .
At this point you should have your parser binary that spits out code .
Play with it .
Remember our canonical example ?
Let ’s see what our program does .
$ echo ' int do_math ( int a ) { int x = a * 5 + 3 } do_math ( 10 ) ' | ./ parser 0x100a00f10

Code was run .
Is n’t that pretty cool ?
I ’ll admit it ’s probably less satisfying to get something running when you just copy paste from a how to guide , but getting this running should still be interesting for you .
Plus , and this is the best part , this is n’t the end of the guide , it ’s just the beginning , because this is the part where you start tacking on crazy features to this lexer , parser and assembler to create a language that you can call your own .
You have all the building blocks , and you should have a basic idea of how to continue on .
The code , by the way , is available on Github here .
I avoided saying this because the code was not the point of the article , but rather going over the code in detail was .
If you ’re just going to grab the code it sort of defeats the purpose of writing your own compiler .
I realize this is a huge article , and there are probably mistakes , so if you run into problems , feel free to send me an email and I ’ll make adjustments .
If you want to share some info , feel free to do that as well .
Miliband criticises kidnapped journalist for ignoring ' very strong advice ' against travel in Afghanistan
David Miliband yesterday criticised kidnapped journalist Stephen Farrell for ignoring ' very strong advice ' not to travel to the Afghan region where he was seized by militants .
The Foreign Secretary was instrumental in approving the special forces raid which freed Mr Farrell but left Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi and paratrooper John Harrison dead .
But yesterday he acknowledged the concerns of those who have questioned the decision to free Mr Farrell when he had apparently courted danger .
Courageous : Corporal John Harrison ( left ) was killed in the SAS - led operation to rescue British journalist Stephen Farrell ( right ) , which was launched after officials received intelligence that he was about to be moved into Pakistan 's tribal areas
He said : ' He was obviously on the one hand very brave and on the other hand he went against very strong advice that it was extremely dangerous to be in that area . '
Admitting that the rescue operation came with grave risks , the Foreign Secretary moved to insist that he only approved the mission after military advice .
‘ This was an operation that only took place because we thought there was no better alternative and it only took place after very considered military judgment that it was a mission with the possibility of success . ’
His words come after Downing Street on Thursday made clear that Gordon Brown had only rubber stamped the raid .
Mr Miliband rejected calls for an inquiry .
‘ I do n't think an inquiry is needed , all the right procedures were followed , of course we look at all the lessons that are to be learned and that is a process that goes on .
David Miliband said Farrell had ignored ' very strong advice ' against travelling to the area of Afghanistan .
Right , Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi who was killed
‘ But I do n't think we should be talking about inquiries now , we had incredibly brave British people risking their lives to rescue a British citizen and tragically his journalist accompanying was lost and one of our people was lost . ’
Today it was confirmed by the New York Times that Mr Farrell had been reunited with his family .
He was flown out of Kabul to an undisclosed location .
The paper would not confirm reports suggesting he returned to Britain but a spokesman said : ' He is with his family at the moment and we are trying to give them some privacy . '
He did receive support from former hostage Terry Waite .
Grief : A friend holds a photograph of Afghan translator Sultan Munadi yesterday
Mr Waite , 70 , was held hostage by terrorists in Beirut for nearly five years .
During a visit to a homeless charity in Coventry , West Mids , Terry also blasted the Army commanders who ordered the raid accusing them of being ' gung - ho ' .
He said : ' I have to say that we would be the poorer without journalists who are willing to cover what is happening in those places .
' I knew the risks I was taking .
Nobody has ever heard me complain .
I did n't like it , but I knew that if I was captured or lost my life it was my responsibility to understand the risks involved . '
IN HIS OWN WORDS
This is an edited version of Stephen Farrell 's account of his kidnap and rescue in the New York Times .
On Friday we heard reports of an explosion in a Taliban - controlled area near Kunduz .
We went to the hospital , which was crowded with patients , doctors , journalists and Red Cross officials .
On Saturday we drove south until we reached the turn - off .
I checked with Sultan and the driver to see if they felt safe going there , and they said it seemed all right .
We began interviewing an Afghan .
There was no sign of hostility from the crowd .
Mr Farrell ( left ) and his interpreter Mr Munadi ( right ) interview and film a wounded man in a hospital in Kunduz on the day before they were captured
As we were carrying our gear to the car , villagers shouted ' Taliban ' and scattered .
Our driver fled , with the keys .
Sultan and I fled a shorter distance , stopped and got caught .
Neither of us was subjected to any beatings , torture or ill - treatment over the next four days .
On the third night , just before 3 am , there were loud explosions in nearby fields .
We , and the Taliban , took this as an attempt to free us .
They fled with us , racing across open fields in the dark until they found another refuge .
On the fourth night there were multiple engine noises , rotors , and then gunshots and explosions .
The Taliban snatched up their rocket - propelled grenades and ran from the room .
We ran to the door .
We could see nothing more than a few feet in front of us .
There were bullets flying through the air .
Sultan carried straight on .
He raised his hands and shouted : ' Journalist , journalist . '
There was a burst of gunfire and he went down .
I screamed : ' British hostage , British hostage . '
It later emerged that one of the rescue party was also dead , mortally wounded during the raid .
His blood - soaked helmet was in front of me throughout the flight home .
I thanked everyone who was still alive to thank .
It was n't , and never will be , enough .
Last week at CITCON Europe Steve Freeman organised a session on mock objects focusing on the original ideas and what mock objects should be used for .
Freeman started by disagreeing with the established view of mock objects as isolators for unit testing , advising developers to use mocks for object design and specifying responsibilities .
According to Freeman , the original Mock object idea came out of the Roles , Responsibilities and Collaborations object design school ( Rebecca Wirfs - Brock ) .
When applying TDD to design and develop such objects , we need to specify and test responsibilities of objects , and externally visible object state is n’t part of that .
Verifying that an object matches its responsibilities requires that we “ fire an event and see that the appropriate messages have been sent to its collaborators ” .
According to Freeman , interfaces are n’t enough to specify objects because “ an interface tells you what methods you can call , not when and how to call them .
it does n’t specify the contract - this is where mocks come in . ”
Freeman advises using mocks as a design tool , not primarily to isolate dependencies : “ To prove that this works we need a thingy but we do n’t have that thingy yet , so we define it with a mock .
Work your way through the slice of a system until you get to something external ” .
Instead of mocking out external dependencies , Freeman suggests that “ you should only mock what you own ” .
Answering a question about the practice of mocking out database access , he said that once the system boundary is reached , developers should define the external interface in terms of their domain , providing a concrete implementation of that interface that speaks to the external system .
This way the code inside a system is isolated from external dependencies and the concrete implementation should be covered by integration tests .
This idea comes from Alistair Cockburn ’s Ports and Adapters architecture ( also called Hexagonal Architecture ) , where the domain we work on is in the middle and ports help it communicate with the external world .
Adapters for individual ports implement the responsibility for a particular external system integration .
“ Test adapters with the real thing ” , suggested Freeman .
In domain - driven - design this corresponds to specifying a repository for objects in the context in which we work , and then providing an implementation for that repository interface that talks to a specific database or a queueing system .
Speaking about different guidelines on when to use mocks , Freeman suggested a rule of thumb “ we mock when the service changes the external world ; we stub when it does n’t change the external world - stub queries and mock actions ” .
However he said that teams should not be enforcing rigid rules .
As some of particularly bad ideas he ’s seen and experienced with mocks , Freeman said that one of the biggest mistakes was to try to mock out standard java libraries .
On a controversial topic of mocking concrete classes , Freeman said that it is generally a bad idea because that means that “ you care about a dependency between objects enough to mock it but you have n’t made that relationship explicit in code ” .
If there is no interface defining the relationship between two classes then people wo n’t know which of the methods of the concrete class actually participate in the relationship .
An interface suggests a role , and a class might have lots of other methods there .
If the interface is n’t there then the relationship is just implicit , which will make it hard to understand and maintain these objects later .
“ Creating an interface also forces you to find a name for it so you might discover other things that were n’t obvious ” , said Freeman .
Freeman also suggested locking down all dependencies in unit tests ( eg making them final ) , which forces developers to clear up where the dependencies are and how they are used .
Freeman ’s upcoming book Growing Object Oriented Software , Guided by Tests covers this topic in more detail .
Albert Hofmann , the discoverer of LSD , lambasted the countercultural movement for marginalizing a chemical that he asserted had potential benefits as an invaluable supplement to psychotherapy and spiritual practices such as meditation .
“ This joy at having fathered LSD was tarnished after more than ten years of uninterrupted scientific research and medicinal use when LSD was swept up in the huge wave of an inebriant mania that began to spread over the Western world , above all the United States , at the end of the 1950s , ” Hofmann groused in his 1979 memoir LSD : My Problem Child .
For just that reason , Hofmann was jubilant in the months before his death last year , at the age of 102 , when he learned that the first scientific research on LSD in decades was just beginning in his native Switzerland .
“ He was very happy that , as he said , ‘ a long wish finally became true , ’ ” remarks Peter Gasser , the physician leading the clinical trial .
“ He said that the substance must be in the hands of medical doctors again . ”
The preliminary study picks up where investigators left off .
It explores the possible therapeutic effects of the drug on the intense anxiety experienced by patients with life - threatening disease , such as cancer .
A number of the hundreds of studies conducted on lysergic acid diethylamide - 25 from the 1940s into the 1970s ( many of poor quality by contemporary standards ) delved into the personal insights the drug supplied that enabled patients to reconcile themselves with their own mortality .
In recent years some researchers have studied psilocybin ( the active ingredient in “ magic mushrooms ” ) and MDMA ( Ecstasy ) , among others , as possible treatments for this “ existential anxiety , ” but not LSD .
Gasser , head of the Swiss Medical Society for Psycholytic Therapy , which he joined after his own therapist - administered LSD experience , has only recently begun to discuss his research , revealing the challenges of studying psychedelics .
The $ 190,000 study approved by Swiss medical authorities , was almost entirely funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , a U.S. nonprofit that sponsors research toward the goal of making psychedelics and marijuana into prescription drugs .
Begun in 2008 , the study intends to treat 12 patients ( eight who will receive LSD and four a placebo ) .
Finding eligible candidates has been difficult — after 18 months only five patients had been recruited , and just four had gone through the trial ’s regimen of a pair of all - day sessions .
“ Because LSD is not a usual treatment , an oncologist will not recommend it to a patient , ” Gasser laments .
The patients who received the drug found the experience aided them emotionally , and none experienced panic reactions or other untoward events .
One patient , Udo Schulz , told the German weekly Der Spiegel that the therapy with LSD helped him overcome anxious feelings after being diagnosed with stomach cancer , and the experience with the drug aided his reentry into the workplace .
The trials follow a strict protocol — “ all LSD treatment sessions will begin at 11 a.m. ” — and the researchers are scrupulous about avoiding mistakes that , at times , occurred during older psychedelic trials , when investigators would leave subjects alone during a drug session .
Both Gasser and a female co-therapist are present throughout the eight - hour sessions that take place in quiet , darkened rooms , with emergency medical equipment close at hand .
Before receiving LSD , subjects have to undergo psychological testing and preliminary psychotherapy sessions .
Another group is also pursuing LSD research .
The British - based Beckley Foundation is funding and collaborating on a 12 - person pilot study at the University of California , Berkeley , that is assessing how the drug may foster creativity and what changes in neural activity go along with altered conscious experience induced by the chemical .
Whether LSD will one day become the drug of choice for psychedelic psychotherapy remains in question because there may be better solutions .
“ We chose psilocybin over LSD because it is gentler and generally less intense , ” says Charles S. Grob , a professor of psychiatry at the University of California , Los Angeles , who conducted a trial to test psilocybin ’s effects on anxiety in terminal cancer patients .
Moreover , “ it is associated with fewer panic reactions and less chance of paranoia and , most important , over the past half a century psilocybin has attracted far less negative publicity and carries far less cultural baggage than LSD . ”
Others assert the importance of comparative pharmacology — how does LSD differ from psilocybin ? — because of the extended period of research quiescence .
Just because many types of so - called SSRI antidepressants exist , “ it does n’t mean that they are all identical , ” observes Roland Griffiths , a Johns Hopkins University researcher who conducts trials with psilocybin .
In any case , on the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock music festival , psychoactive substances that represented the apotheosis of the counterculture lifestyle are no longer just hippie elixirs .

This article was originally printed with the title , " Return of a Problem Child . "
A bill of nearly £ 1,600 for an " executive Christmas dinner " held by the BBC 's creative director Alan Yentob was among the claims in the latest list of expenses published by the broadcaster .
Former BBC former drama chief Jane Tranter , who quit as the BBC head of fiction last year to take up a new US role with the corporation 's commercial arm , BBC Worldwide , claimed more than £ 3,000 for flowers over a three - year period , most of them as gifts for BBC stars .
The new figures follow the publication last month of more than £ 360,000 - worth of expense claims made by 13 members of the BBC 's executive board .
The latest statistics relate to the BBC 's 30 most senior managers outside of the board , including the controllers of all its TV and radio stations , and other senior executives .
Unlike the publication of MPs ' expenses , the data was not heavily redacted and shone further light into the internal – and occasionally unlikely – workings of the BBC .
Some of the more eye - catching claims included :
• Creative director Alan Yentob claimed £ 1,579.63 for an " executive Christmas dinner " for 27 people in 2006 .
• £ 4,589 claimed by Michael Carrington , controller of CBeebies , for travel to a conference in New York .
• Over £ 800 of Molton Brown gift sets and toiletries claimed by BBC1 controller Jay Hunt , along with a £ 94.50 " silver bangle with charm " , a £ 59.95 biscuit jar , and £ 48.95 for two pairs of cashmere socks bought as a " gift for a leading supplier " .
• The BBC 's director of archive content and former BBC2 controller Roly Keating claimed more than £ 1,000 for champagne and chocolates .
• A £ 1,233 dinner held by BBC Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer to celebrate the 35th anniversary of BBC Radio 4 panel show , Just A Minute
Elsewhere in the figures published yesterday , it was revealed how entertainment executive Jonathan Beazley claimed £ 6.99 for a Doctor Who action figure , and BBC3 controller Danny Cohen claimed £ 26.97 for a box set of the first series of Skins , the teen drama he commissioned when he was head of rival channel , E4 .
BBC News channel controller Kevin Bakhurst spent several hundred pounds trying to persuade talent to change channels and join the BBC .
" Job talks - try to persuade to join BBC News . "
Another , for £ 78.19 , went on " contacts / gathering information " about the BBC 's rival , Rupert Murdoch 's Sky .
The BBC 's chief operating officer , Caroline Thomson , said the corporation was delivering a " step change in the information we disclose to the public , and we believe this will make us one of the most transparent and open public service organisations in Britain " .
All of the expenses claims related to a three - year period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March this year .
Thomson said : " Later in the year we will formalise our processes in this area and routinely publish large amounts of information relating to the pay and expenses of our top executives .
We will also give details of the amount of money the BBC pays for onscreen presenters and artists .
" The public will then be able to see how the BBC performs against its commitment to reduce the amount of money the organisation spends on top talent , which currently stands at approximately 2 % of the licence fee . "
The protesters said they were " blasé " about dumping the manure
Climate change protesters have dumped a pile of horse manure at the home of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson in a protest about vehicle emissions .
Six women stood by the dung in the drive of his home in Chipping Norton , Oxfordshire , with a sign that read : " This is what you 're landing us in . "
The protesters from direct action group Climate Rush said they were being as " blasé as him " about emissions .
Clarkson made no comment and Thames Valley Police said no - one was arrested .
Horse - drawn cart
Police were called to the presenter 's home at about 1145 BST after reports that a group of women dressed as suffragettes , three camera crews and a few members of the press were in the grounds of his house .
A wheel barrow load of manure from a horse - drawn cart was dumped in Clarkson 's driveway .
Protester Deborah Grayson said : " Just as he 's ever so blasé about his CO2 and how much he 's contributing to climate change emissions , we 're a little bit blasé about our horse manure . "
Sgt Mark Smith , from Thames Valley Police , said the women , camera crews and press had left the property by the time the officers arrived .
He said no complaints had been lodged against the protesters .
It is not known if Clarkson was home at the time of the protest .
LOS ANGELES 
In a professional skateboarding career that has spanned nearly 20 years , Danny Way has performed many first feats , like launching over the Great Wall of China in 2005 by using a mega ramp , an outsize creation he brought to the X Games a year earlier to create the sport ’s newest and most thrilling spectacle .
Although he will be part of the broadcasting crew at the Staples Center when the X Games begin Thursday , providing commentary on his creation , the skateboard Big Air competition , Way wants to make one thing clear about his career : he is not done .
“ I ’m not taking the position at X Games because I ’m trying to retire or slow , ” said Way , 35 , who in November set a Guinness world speed record on a skateboard when he was towed by a car at 74.5 miles per hour on a lonely stretch of blacktop in the California desert .
“ My whole motivation with creating this event was getting it to a point where it could stand on its own , without me having to be out there putting the show on every time , ” he said about Big Air , an event he has won three times .
GRAND RAPIDS --
Put on a big , international art event downtown , attach a big monetary prize to it , and you 're sure to attract all kinds of artists , even a 20 - year - old college kid known for a zombie walk , pillow fight and electronic music festival .
This morning , Grand Rapids Community College student Rob Bliss -- the mastermind behind many popular community events in downtown Grand Rapids -- announced he is one of 1,262 competitors in ArtPrize , a competition running Sept. 23 through Oct. 10 in Grand Rapids with prizes totalling $ 449,000 .
The 20 - year - old is planning to release 100,000 paper airplanes from the rooftops of downtown buildings at 1 p.m. Sept. 27 as part of ArtPrize , he was to announce officially this morning at a news conference in Rosa Parks Circle .
Bliss is calling his event " The 100,000 Paper Planes and Melodies Over Monroe Project . "
" I was really inspired by ArtPrize , " he said .
" I remember sitting and hearing about what ( ArtPrize creator ) Rick DeVos was announcing and thought , ' Oh my gosh , this is amazing .
These people are pushing what 's possible in Grand Rapids .
They 're trying their best to accomplish that .
And if this is their best , what is my best , and how can I push myself to do something great ? ' "
Exactly 100,000 paper airplanes in the seven colors of a traditional rainbow will be released in a ballpark wavelike fashion from rooftops of several buildings along Monroe Avenue .
Bliss is asking individuals of all ages to whistle , sing or use an instrument of any kind to perform , in unison , Sigur Ros ' " Olsen Olsen . "
The indie band 's tune is Bliss ' all - time favorite .
" It 's just a very triumphant , beautiful melody .
It 's just massive , and it 's perfect for this event , " he said .
He is hoping local educators attend with their student choirs , marching bands and orchestras to perform the song , while thousands of paper airplanes float from the sky in a moment of musical and aesthetic beauty .
The Grand Rapids Community Foundation is funding the rain - or - shine event .
Grand Rapids - based Creo Productions will film the event in a documentary style to be aired within Bliss ' venue space at the Old Federal Building , 155 N. Division Ave .
He anticipates at least 5,000 will participate " to come together in this once - in - a - lifetime event that 's really going to be something truly beautiful and astounding ... that has never been done before and probably never will be done again .
" It 's really the most massive undertaking .
I 've been working on this for half a year .
I would do anything for this event , " he added .
Bliss said four assistants from each rooftop will fling king - sized sheets of paper airplanes into the air every five minutes for a half hour .
He is counting on volunteers and participants to help clean up .
He figures children will want to keep them as souvenirs .
Some details need to be worked out , such as closing Monroe Avenue NW , but Bliss said most aspects have been approved .
He said he was able to keep his entry and identity a secret by registering under a pseudonym .
" Anyone can change their name and call themselves whatever they want on the Web site , " Bliss said .
" Most people are trying to get attention and not be secretive . "
He also does n't plan to use his contingent of Facebook and other social media followers to his advantage by sending out announcements to vote for his event .
" I 'm not going to be trying super hard in a cheesy manner for people to vote for me , " Bliss said .
" If people like it , they 'll vote for it , and that 's what matters .
" The work will speak for itself . "

John Piper is doubtless one of today ’s most respected evangelical leaders .
He is a scholar and preaches like a scholar , but with a broad appeal .
That is not an easy combination .
To say Piper is a Calvinist is an understatement .
I am not a Calvinist , but I often profit from the lessons of John Piper .
One always comes away challenged .
In this video clip Piper takes on versions that do not allow the reader to know all the words of a text .
Many read to get the idea and never learn the details .
This can be misleading .
I think preachers who never grapple with textual problems and leave their hearers in the dark do them a great disservice .
Piper is discussing John 4:44 - 45 .
Here is how it reads in the NASB :
44 For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
45 So when
He came to Galilee , the Galileans received Him , having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they themselves also went to the feast .
Here is the NIV rendering of the same text :
44 ( Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country . )
45 When he arrived in Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him .
They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast , for they also had been there .
Listen and think .
Chelsea and Manchester United set the tone for the battle at the top of the Premier League in a Community Shield encounter liberally sprinkled with spice and confrontation .
The traditional quartet will jostle at the sharp end of the table - but can anyone break up the cartel of the so - called " Big Four " ?
Can Liverpool end a 20 - year wait to bring the title back to Anfield ?
Who will emerge from the pack ?
Who will consolidate ?
Who will be condemned to a season fighting for survival ?
It will all unfold once the top - flight campaign commences next Saturday .
Time to polish off the crystal ball and study the prospects of those hoping to make an impact in the Premier League in 2009 / 2010 .
ARSENAL
Arsene Wenger heard the first strains of discontent from the previously unquestioning Arsenal support last season after four years without a trophy .
Is potential now simply a cover for under- achievement at the Emirates ?
For all that , there is still no - one better to guide Arsenal 's fortunes - although a meaningful title pursuit and at least one piece of silverware is required .
Wenger has done superb business to take the best part of £ 40 m off Manchester City for Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure , although £ 10 m recruit from Ajax Thomas Vermaelen will be expected to toughen up a defence regarded as having a soft centre .
Andriy Arshavin 's genius was underscored last season , while Robin van Persie is a glorious talent when fit .
Big season for Theo Walcott - with the incentive of a World Cup at its conclusion .
If Wenger can add a midfield enforcer ( surely the return of Patrick Vieira came from the realms of romance rather than realism ) then Arsenal may last the pace better than last season .
Will be attractive and dangerous - but the cups remains their best bet .
Not title winners .
Verdict : Fourth .
ASTON VILLA
Big season for Villa and boss Martin O'Neill .
Sixth place was not exactly a disappointment last time out , but they faded spectacularly late in the season and made no serious impact in the cups , the tame Uefa Cup exit causing particular consternation .
O'Neill has stuck to his tried and trusted policy of investing mainly in English talent , with Stewart Downing arriving from Middlesbrough as the highly - experienced and influential Gareth Barry moves to Manchester City .
Fabian Delph comes from Leeds United with rave reviews but no Premier League pedigree - so he is one for the future as opposed to one to make immediate impact .
Expect the usual O'Neill template of pace , power and width , with Ashley Young the jewel in Villa 's crown .
O'Neill will also surely have addressed the reasons why Villa fell off the cliff after threatening the Champions League places .
Dangerous on their day , especially away from home , but I expect more of the same in terms of league placings with more emphasis on success in the cups .
Verdict : Top Six .
BIRMINGHAM CITY
Birmingham City were functional as opposed to spectacular in winning promotion last season , but that will matter not one jot to their experienced manager Alex McLeish .
The means justified the end .
Now the real battle begins and Birmingham have been busy working the markets .
Joe Hart is a sound signing on loan from Manchester City in goal , but Barry Ferguson never cut it in the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers in his prime , so it takes a leap of faith to imagine he will do it now - although it is one McLeish is happy to take for a player he knows well .
James McFadden has top - flight experience in attack , but the real wild card is club record signing Christian Benitez , who arrived from Mexican side Santos Laguna for a fee that could rise to £ 9 m .
Unknown quantity and much will depend on how he adapts , especially with a chequered injury history .
Roger Johnson , a £ 5 m buy from Cardiff , was a good performer in the Championship and he is another whose development in the Premier League is key to Birmingham 's hopes .
May just have enough to stay up .
VERDICT : Season of struggle .
BLACKBURN ROVERS
Sam Allardyce negotiated a route to Premier League survival for Blackburn last season , and expect them to nestle comfortably in and around mid-table this time , despite the loss of Roque Santa Cruz to Blackburn .
Allardyce 's tactical approach may be an acquired taste for some - it was certainly not acquired in Newcastle - but he fashioned a system to suit Blackburn .
El - Hadji Diouf , Benni McCarthy and Jason Roberts should give them a threat up front , while Ryan Nelsen and Christopher Samba will operate within the no-frills defensive framework Allardyce demands .
VERDICT : Mid-table comfort .
BOLTON WANDERERS
Gary Megson fights a permanent - and mostly losing - battle for the affection of Bolton fans , but he kept them up last season and will have high hopes of repeating the feat .
Sean Davis will provide experience in central midfield , while keeping hold of the coveted Gary Cahill is a coup for Megson .
He will now have assistance from new boy Zat Knight .
Kevin Davies will be his usual physical self up front , and it is highly unlikely many Bolton games will have the purists purring , but the thick - skinned and combative Megson will be supremely disinterested in that small matter .
Whether Bolton fans like him or not , I expect Megson to retain their Premier League status once more .
VERDICT : Tough but survivors .
BURNLEY
Fantastic story and the return of one of football 's great old clubs will add real romance to the Premier League - but how will they fare ?
In Owen Coyle Burnley have one of the best young managers in the game and it is a tribute to both him and everyone at the club that Celtic 's attentions were deflected as Turf Moor basked in the after - glow of promotion .
Coyle is a disciple of the passing game , but realism suggests he will tailor this style for the top flight and bank on Steven Fletcher , a £ 3 m buy from Hibs , to bring goals south of the border .
Wade Elliott is already being tipped as a Premier League star of the future , while all men of a certain age will keep an eye on how 37 - year - old Graham Alexander copes with the Premier League .
Expect some great occasions at Turf Moor this season - and nothing more than a gut feeling tells me tee - totaller Coyle may just celebrate survival .
VERDICT : Staying up but only just .
CHELSEA
Carlo Ancelotti is the latest manager through Stamford Bridge 's revolving door and needs to make a fast start as the legacy of Guus Hiddink 's masterly spell in charge remains fresh in the memories .
If Chelsea 's players respond to Ancelotti's urgings and the big players - John Terry , Frank Lampard , Didier Drogba and Michael Essien - stay fit , then they will be serious contenders for every competition .
Chelsea 's attempts at big- spending have been thwarted by Real Madrid , but Yuri Zhirkov is a gifted left - sided player and Daniel Sturridge was a real talent in the making at Manchester City .
Miserly in defence , versatile in midfield and powerful in attack , Chelsea also possess the concrete - clad mental strength needed to last the whole course .
If Ancelotti makes the transition from Serie A and AC Milan to the Premier League , Chelsea will be the team to finish above to win the title .
VERDICT : Second .
EVERTON
The FA Cup final and fifth place in the Premier League was a superb return for an Everton squad ravaged by serious injuries down the spine of the team - Phil Jagielka , Mikel Arteta and Yakubu - and built without the aid of a huge budget .
The motivational and organisational skills of manager David Moyes and the resilience of his squad must not be under - estimated , but financial circumstances make it almost impossible to forecast a similar league finish this term .
Chairman Bill Kenwright has been unable to bring major investment to Everton , while close rivals Villa , Spurs and particularly Manchester City have splashed out .
It leaves Moyes to perform a trick which gets more difficult with every passing season .
Everton 's determination to keep Joleon Lescott away from Manchester City shows they still have ambition , but without the money to fuel that ambition it is hard to see another fifth place this season .
VERDICT : Top Ten .
FULHAM
Roy Hodgson used all his years of expertise to take Fulham to seventh and a place in the Europa League last season - a superb effort and one that made him a candidate for Manager of the Year .
Hodgson built an attractive side on sound defensive principles and they are especially formidable at home .
He will hope to keep central defender Brede Hangeland beyond August , while Danny Murphy 's experience and tactical awareness keeps things ticking over in midfield .
With Hodgson in charge Fulham can expect more of the same this season .
VERDICT : Mid-table security .
HULL CITY
Phil Brown 's feat in keeping Hull City in the Premier League last season should have been heralded as a miracle - but some of the lustre of the achievement was lost because of an astonishing collapse that brought only one win in their last 21 league games .
Brown was heavily criticised for his infamous half - time team talk on the turf at Manchester City , and even his celebratory survival sing - song at the KC when Hull lost to Manchester United but stayed up was used as a stick to beat him .
It will be even tougher this time ( surely there cannot be another miracle start ? ) and Brown has had trouble tempting his top transfer targets to Hull City , with Michael Owen , Habib Beye , Bobby Zamora and Fraizer Campbell all going elsewhere .
Defender Michael
Turner is admired by many top clubs , so it will be an even bigger test of Brown 's managerial abilities this time around .
He may at least be able to call on £ 5 m signing Jimmy Bullard at some point this season as he recovers from another serious knee injury .
Great support that graced the Premier League last season , but a very long road ahead , I fear .
VERDICT : Relegation .
LIVERPOOL
Hopes have never been higher that the title will be reclaimed after a 20 - year barren spell - but was last season the great missed opportunity or the primer for the Premier League crown ?
Liverpool lost only two league games last season and still finished second .
It was too many home draws that did for them and they cannot afford a similar failing this season .
Glen Johnson is a sound , if expensive , recruit at right - back , but it is in question whether the gifted but fragile Alberto Aquilani can make Liverpool 's midfield tick over in the manner of Xabi Alonso , now a part of the Real Madrid re-fit .
Liverpool 's title hopes rest on manager Rafael Benitez refusing to become distracted by Manchester United , as he did so pointlessly last season , and on the well - being of Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres .
If this world - class pair stay fit and play in the manner that propelled Liverpool so beautifully through the last three months of last season , then all the optimism and expectation is justified , despite a stuttering pre-season .
VERDICT : Champions .
MANCHESTER CITY
The great unpredictables - even when they are backed by the biggest transfer fund in British football .
Such finance brings pressure and Manchester City and manager Mark Hughes need to make a fast start .
Make no mistake , they are a better squad than last season but they will be judged on how swiftly Hughes marshalls those new recruits .
Gareth Barry is an excellent common sense signing , while Carlos Tevez will provide attacking verve and industry .
Kolo
Toule is a steady performer , but question marks remain over the expensive Roque Santa Cruz ( fitness ) and Emmanuel Adebayor ( consistency . )
Stephen Ireland is as influential as any of the big - money buys - an outstanding midfielder - and do not expect Craig Bellamy to accept his time is up as he fights for a place with Robinho , Tevez , Santa Cruz and Adebayor .
The big worry is central defence , which is why Everton 's Joleon Lescott was pursued with such vigour .
How Hughes strengthens in that area will be crucial - but still an unknown quantity .
VERDICT : Europa League places and cup contenders
MANCHESTER UNITED
Old Trafford is now a Cristiano Ronaldo - free zone - but where there is Wayne Rooney there is hope and Sir Alex Ferguson will have a glint in his eye as sets his sights on a fourth successive Premier League and passing Liverpool 's record of 18 titles .
Ferguson must find a way of compensating for Ronaldo 's departure , but not many predicted signing Michael Owen from Newcastle United would be part of his solution .
This could yet prove a master - stroke and he will provide competition for Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov , while Antonio Valencia has already shown his promise in pre-season .
Rooney carries so many of United 's hopes on all fronts this season , but he has the ability and confidence to cope .
But how will the elder statesman Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes fit in ?
Will Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic stay fit ?
Will Ben Foster finally succeed Edwin van der Sar in goal ?
The biggest question of all is how the old master will shape his side without Ronaldo .
How Ferguson does it will decide the destiny of their season .
It is the most hazardous of occupations to predict United will not win the title , but a quartet of Premier League triumphs may just be beyond them .
VERDICT : Third .
PORTSMOUTH
Not huge amounts of good news here .
Glen Johnson and Peter Crouch gone , more departures possibly in the offing and all pre-season plans shrouded in the uncertainty of a protracted takeover .
Throw in the bad publicity of David Nugent and Marc Wilson being fined two weeks ' wages after a " serious breach of club discipline " on a trip to Portugal and you get the idea .
Optimism is in short supply .
The Harry Redknapp era , when players like Crouch and Jermain Defoe were arriving and the FA Cup was being paraded , seems an age away and the highly - respected Paul Hart faces a huge task to stop the slide .
Pompey simply have to hang on to keeper David James and the creative force of Croatia 's Niko Kranjcar in midfield otherwise this season will be a long haul , probably into the Championship .
VERDICT : Relegation .
STOKE CITY
To visit the Britannia last season was to sample Premier League life in the raw - something that also applied to Stoke City 's opponents .
Noisy , atmospheric , exhilirating and the main reason Tony Pulis 's side stayed in the division .
Stoke , backed by feverish fans , made it a harrowing afternoon for many Premier League sides , although there was more to them than Rory Delap 's much - publicised long throws .
Pulis built a side in his own image and likeness .
Hard - working , honest , uncompromising , and it was a winning formula for survival .
The Britannia may not be such a culture shock this season , but I still back Stoke and Pulis to have enough about them to maintain their Premier League staus .
VERDICT : Staying up again .
SUNDERLAND
Just survived last season , but a shrewd choice of manager in Steve Bruce and a big transfer budget that he will manipulate wisely means they can look forward to better times this season .
Bruce has excelled in the past in the transfer market , utilising contacts abroad while scouring for talent at home .
He may be a Newcastle United fan , but Sunderland are in safe hands .
Darren
Bent has been derided for his time at Spurs , but he scores goals and is a wise acquisition , while former Marseille captain Lorik Cana will add ( and this is putting it politely ) steel in midfield .
Fraizer Campell is a promising talent , and if either he or Bent forms a partnership with Kenwyne Jones then Sunderland could be in business .
VERDICT : Top ten .
TOTTENHAM
Harry Redknapp 's shrewd manouevres in the transfer market and the use of the forces he inherited meant good progress was made by Spurs last season - now there will be expectations that he will build on that platform .
No close season is complete without hectic transfer activity down the Lane , and the addition of Kyle Naughton to Spurs ' array of right - backs is a shrewd move .
He was widely regarded as the most promising young defender outside the Premier League when he was at Sheffield United .
Luka Modric will again be the brains of the operation while we can expect to see Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe reunited once more in attack after their brief partnership at Portsmouth .
But what of Robbie Keane ?
Surely the happy wanderer will not find himself surplus again ?
Central defence is a worry , not because Spurs lack quality but because they lack good health .
Ledley King , Jonathan Woodgate and Michael Dawson are all troubled by injuries , hence the outlay of £ 8 m on Sebastien Bassong from Newcastle United .
Spurs have talent but will they have the consistency ?
If they do , expect further improvement .
VERDICT : Top six and potential cup winners .
WEST HAM UNITED
Gianfranco Zola made a promising start at West Ham last season - no surprise there given his pedigree , style and personal dignity .
He has footballing principles that appeal to the Upton Park psyche and with the astute Steve Clarke at his side , expect West Ham to settle comfortably towards the middle of the Premier League .
Nothing in the way of serious big - money signings in the new frugal era , but plenty of quality sprinkled around Zola 's squad in the shape of keeper Robert Green , Scott Parker , Mark Noble , Jack Collison and others .
Young players have been secured on long - term contracts while all at West Ham will hope the outstanding Dean Ashton can finally rid himself of injury .
VERDICT : Middle of the road with cup ambitions .
WIGAN ATHLETIC
Steve Bruce 's departure was a blow to Wigan , but chairman Dave Whelan has attracted someone regarded as one of the brightest and most imaginative managerial talents in the game in Roberto Martinez .
Martinez is unproven at Premier League level , but his Swansea City side won rave reviews for their cultured approach and it will be intriguing to see if the Spaniard can transport this to the top flight .
He suffered a grievous loss when Antonio Valencia went to Manchester United , but he has placed his trust in two of his Swansea City old boys in the shape of striker Jason Scotland and gifted midfield man Jordi Gomez .
James McCarthy was regarded as a major prospect in Scotland with Hamilton while Wigan fought off interest from old boss Bruce at Sunderland to sign Honduras midfield man Hendry Thomas .
Wigan will aim for survival again - and if Martinez achieves this he can regard it as a job well down .
VERDICT : Lower reaches but staying up .
WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS
Just like Burnley , another great old name returns to the Premier League and we should welcome them with open arms .
Mick McCarthy 's wise leadership and experience will be a huge help this season - as will the passionate Molineux crowd , although there will be times when they have to stick by their side in adversity .
McCarthy will hope Kevin Doyle 's £ 6.5 m arrival from Reading as partner to the prolific Sylvain Ebanks - Blake will give Wolves the firepower to keep them up .
Andrew Surman 's ability to make the leap from Southampton to the Premier League will also have an influence while Michael Kightly is another they will lean on .
McCarthy is realism personified and he knows survival is the aim as they return to the elite - anything else will be a plus .
VERDICT : Fighting Birmingham for final relegation place .

So che ci sono modi migliori per combattere l'insonnia , ma ieri sera ho letto il libro di Rutelli .
Ve lo riassumo , così se siete delegati alla Convenzione del Pd fate bella figura .
Inizia dicendo che lui da due anni non ha « responsabilità » ( insomma zero poltrone ) e quindi bisogna « dar corso a una svolta » .
Poi dice che Nanni Moretti non capisce una mazza di politica e Travaglio è un ballista , comunque si vedranno in tribunale .
Aggiunge che lui è più povero adesso di quando ha iniziato a fare politica , Di Pietro il contrario , e chi vuol capire capisca .
A proposito : quei pulciari dei
Ds quando sono entrati nel Pd si sono tenuti il loro « sensazionale » patrimonio immobiliare , mentre la Margherita ha dato al Pd il suo contratto d'affitto della sede « molto conveniente , nei piani più alti dove c'era il Collegio Nazareno » .
Poi : la sinistra è una cosa del secolo scorso , adesso occorrono « soluzioni nuove a cui dare nomi nuovi » .
Gianfranco Fini è « un' autentica opportunità » , però era pur sempre amico di Le Pen e di Saddam Hussein e girava con « impermeabile da investigatore » , quindi è più affidabile lui .
Nel 2008 ha perso le elezioni a Roma , ma non voleva neanche candidarsi , lo hanno tirato per le orecchie e lui ci è cascato .
A proposito : quando in tivù vedete Gentiloni , ricordatevi che l'ha creato lui .
Va avanti dicendo che oggi la politica è come un iPhone , e quindi lui ci mette l'AppStore , noi gli mandiamo le applicazioni da scaricare .
Nel frattempo ci sono tre pilastri : il servizio civile obbligatorio di sei mesi , delle trasmissioni televisive dedicate a storie di successo italiane tipo quella dell ' inventore delle
Winx e la liberalizzazione degli affitti .
Alla fine dice che bisogna fare un « governo del presidente » adesso che per il bipolarismo se ne riparla nel 2013 , con « alleanze di nuovo conio » , lui è pronto .
Il risvolto di copertina assicura che questo libro è « l' apertura di una battaglia delle idee » .

The Swedish article said Israeli soldiers had taken organs from dead prisoners A Palestinian minister and an Israeli Arab member of parliament have stoked a row over allegations that Israel has taken organs from dead Palestinians .
Issa Qaraqae said Israel was hiding the bodies of dead Palestinian prisoners to disguise evidence of organ trafficking .
Israeli Arab MP Mohammed Barakeh said he would believe the organ - removal claims unless Israel disproved them .
Israel has angrily denied the allegations , first made in a Swedish newspaper , calling them " outrageous " .
Mr Qaraqae said Israel was " hiding the bodies of Palestinian martyrs to remove the proof of their crimes , including organ trafficking " .
He was speaking at a meeting in the West Bank city of Nablus to demand the return of the bodies of Palestinians killed by the Israeli army .
At the same meeting , Mr Barakeh , chairman of the Hadash party in the Israeli Knesset , said it was the right of Palestinians to ask " what Israel 's reasons are for keeping the bodies of martyrs " .
" Have the bodies been mutilated ?
My answer is yes , barring proof to the contrary .
Have their organs been stolen ?
My answer is yes , barring proof to the contrary , " he said .
' Outrageous ' claim Mr Barakeh later told Israel 's Yediot Ahronot newspaper : " Seeing as there is no worse way to punish a man and his family than with his death , the question is why Israel continues to hold the bodies . "
Mr Netanyahu said the claims were reminiscent of medieval ' blood libels '
" The burden of proof falls on Israel , and as long as it refuses to say what the status of the bodies is or return them , it is hiding something awful , " he said .
The organ harvesting story was first published in August in Aftonbladet , Sweden 's biggest - selling daily newspaper .
It claimed that in incidents dating back as far as 1992 , Israeli soldiers snatched Palestinian youths and returned their dismembered bodies a few days later .
Donald Bostrom , the author of the article , told Israel Radio he did not know whether allegations made by Palestinians in the 1990s were true , but he said that they should be investigated .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged the Swedish government to condemn the article , saying the accusations were " outrageous " .
Mr Netanyahu compared the claims to medieval " blood libels " , which alleged that Jews used the blood of Christian babies during religious ceremonies .
But Sweden 's foreign minister Carl Bildt has said he would not condemn the article because freedom of expression is part of the Swedish constitution .

Many of our readers may remember West Indies cricket team as this mighty force which was unstoppable in any form cricket in the 70s and 80s .
At one point in time WI had a win percentage of more than 80 % in One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) .
Today when Pakistan beat India , a statistical landmark was reached for Pakistan which happened after a wait of 35 years .
Pakistan ’s win percentage ( 55.65 % ) in ODIs is now better than that of West Indies ( 55.52 % ) .
The last time Pakistan had a better win % than West Indies was in 1974 , when both countries had played only 3 and 2 ODIs respectively .
Pakistan has now played 705 ODIs and West Indies 619 .
Therefore it took Pakistan 702 ODIs and 35 years to finally get ahead of West Indies in all time ODI Win Percentages .
While all kinds of statistics can be thrown out there to prove one team is better than others , I believe that Win percentage of a team taken all over its ODI history is the best way to judge a team ’s all - time cricketing prowess .
Following are win percentages of major cricket playing countries in ODIs with Pakistan surpassing West Indies for the first time since 1974 .

Princeton's CU Boulder 's Paul Ohm writes about Netflix 's insane new plan to release millions of customers ' personal information — ZIP code , gender , year of birth — as a sequel to its Netflix Challenge .
Latanya Sweeney 's famous study on de-anonymizing data has shown that date ( not just year ) of birth , gender and ZIP are sufficient to personally identify 87 % of Americans .
In other words , Netflix is about to put the behavioral data about viewing choices for millions of Americans into the public domain , despite its legal duty to keep this information private .
Because of this , if it releases the data , Netflix might be breaking the law .
The Video Privacy Protection Act ( VPPA ) , 18 USC 2710 prohibits a " video tape service provider " ( a broadly defined term ) from revealing " personally identifiable information " about its customers .
Aggrieved customers can sue providers under the VPPA and courts can order " not less than $ 2500 " in damages for each violation .
If somebody brings a class action lawsuit under this statute , Netflix might face millions of dollars in damages .
Additionally , the FTC might also decide to fine Netflix for violating its privacy policy as an unfair business practice .
Either a lawsuit under the VPPA or an FTC investigation would turn , in large part , on one sentence in Netflix 's privacy policy : " We may also disclose and otherwise use , on an anonymous basis , movie ratings , consumption habits , commentary , reviews and other non-personal information about customers . "
If sued or investigated , Netflix will surely argue that its acts are immunized by the policy , because the data is disclosed " on an anonymous basis . "
While this argument might have carried the day in 2006 , before Narayanan and Shmatikov conducted their study , the argument is much weaker in 2009 , now that Netflix has many reasons to know better , including in part , my paper and the publicity surrounding it .
A weak argument is made even weaker if Netflix includes the kind of data–ZIP code , age , and gender –that we have known for over a decade fails to anonymize .
Throughout the current housing crisis , most of the negative economic data has been clumped into one large group .
That is , housing has been a nationwide problem and job losses have impacted virtually every state .
Yet there is a coming crisis that has its targets on very specific states .
In fact , many states will not even feel the repercussions of this new economic problem .
The issue is that of strategic defaults .
Most Americans have not heard of this term but they will know this intimately like they learned about subprime loans or interest only loans .
A strategic default occurs when a homeowner stops paying their mortgage even though they are still financially able to do so .
A recent study shows why this problem will impact mega- housing bubble states like California more than other states .
You will also find that many people that walkaway from these products have stellar credit scores .
So why would someone strategically decide to leave their mortgage ?
The reasons are many but first let us look at the distribution of late Alt - A loans in the country :
Now why focus on Alt - A loans ?
Under this category of loans we will find most Interest Only and option ARM products .
These are loans most at risk for a strategic default .
In many cases for example option ARM loans were given to people with good credit but simply did not have the income to back up the purchase of a home .
In these situations you would see a family with good credit and a household income of $ 100,000 taking on a $ 700,000 mortgage in California .
With a teaser payment , the family could pull this off .
But when the recast of the payment occurs the family will default especially given the crash in housing values in California .
Let us examine a few reasons why and how people strategically default .
A recent study may surprise you .
This study examined 24 million credit files and gives us a good view of the overall situation :
“ The number of strategic defaults is far beyond most industry estimates — 588,000 nationwide during 2008 , more than double the total in 2007 .
They represented 18 % of all serious delinquencies that extended for more than 60 days in last year ’s fourth quarter . ”
This number is enormous and we can expect this number to rise .
Why ?
Many of the interest only and option ARM products will start hitting recast dates in 2010 to 2012 that will severely impact borrower ’s monthly payment .
Many of these loans are far below the current loan modification program caps of being underwater at a ratio of 125 percent or higher .
In some case , some of these loans have 150 to 200 percent LTV ratios .
That is , someone might have a $ 600,000 mortgage on a home worth $ 300,000 .
“ Strategic defaulters often go straight from perfect payment histories to no mortgage payments at all .
This is in stark contrast with most financially distressed borrowers , who try to keep paying on their mortgage even after they ’ve fallen behind on other accounts . ”
This is probably one of those shocking statistics .
How can someone with a perfect credit history go from on time borrower to a strategic default ?
The answer is simple .
For the average American their housing payment , either rent or mortgage , is the biggest line item on their budget .
Increase that payment by 50 , 60 , or even 70 percent and you have a default waiting to happen .
Housing makes up 34 percent of consumer expenditures :
In areas like California however , this category is much bigger .
That is why this issue of strategic defaults is more concentrated to states like California and Florida that have the bulk of these Alt - A loans .
588,000 may sound high but it will only get higher in the next few years .
“ Strategic defaults are heavily concentrated in negative - equity markets where home values zoomed during the boom and have cratered since 2006 .
In California last year , the number of strategic defaults was 68 times higher than it was in 2005 .
In Florida it was 46 times higher .
In most other parts of the country , defaults were about nine times higher in 2008 than in 2005 . ”
It is rather clear how unequal this will impact the U.S.
The strategic default seems to be an issue of housing bubble states .
And you can put yourself in the shoes of someone who bought a home at the peak .
Say you and your spouse bought a home in a bubble market for $ 500,000 .
Deep down , both of you felt that housing would never go down .
This view was widespread .
You saw for nearly 5 years homes appreciate by 10 , 15 , and 20 percent per year .
At the very worst , you would be able to sell your home for $ 600,000 or $ 700,000 in a few years when your loan recast .
Well your home is now worth $ 250,000 .
It may never regain that peak value .
Your payment will jump from $ 1,500 to $ 3,000 .
You can rent a similar place for $ 1,300 .
What do you do ?
Many are simply electing to walkaway .
In a state like California with 12.2 percent unemployment this decision might be made also by necessity .
Sure , they can make the payment but how much of their budget is it eating up ?
“ Homeowners with large mortgage balances generally are more likely to pull the plug than those with lower balances .
Similarly , people with credit ratings in the two highest categories measured by VantageScore — a joint scoring venture created by Experian and the two other national credit bureaus , Equifax and TransUnion — are far more likely to default strategically than people in lower score categories . ”
Now this is simply more fuel to believe that those who strategically default will occur unequally in states like California and Florida .
These states saw the biggest housing bubbles and also took on most of these exotic mortgages .
If you do n’t believe this ?
Just take a look at this article :
$ 30 billion home loan time bomb set for 2010
“ ( SF Chronicle ) Thousands of Bay Area homes have a ticking time bomb embedded in their mortgage .
The homes were purchased with loans known as option ARMs , short for adjustable rate mortgages .
Next year , many option ARM payments will begin to readjust , slamming borrowers with dramatically higher monthly mortgage bills .
Analysts say that could unleash the next big wave of foreclosures – and home - loan data show that the risky loans were heavily used in the Bay Area .
From 2004 to 2008 , “ one in five people who took out a mortgage loan ( for both purchases and refinancing ) in the San Francisco metropolitan region ( San Francisco , Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin and San Mateo counties ) got an option ARM , ” said Bob Visini , senior director of marketing in San Francisco at First American CoreLogic , a mortgage research firm .
“ That ’s more than twice the national average .
“ People think option ARMs ( will be ) a national crisis , ” he said .
“ That ’s not really true .
It ’s just in higher - cost areas like California where you see their prevalence . ”
And here is an example of an area that depended on decent credit scores to dish out toxic mortgages like option ARMs .
Now you might be asking why are so many loans gathered in certain areas ?
Well these areas had a collective bubble psychology where people had very little qualms taking out $ 500,000 or $ 600,000 mortgages :
“ First American shows more than 54,000 option ARMs issued here with a value of about $ 30.9 billion .
Fitch shows more than 47,000 option ARMs here with a value of about $ 28 billion .
Both say their data underestimate the totals .
Why are so many option ARMs clustered here ?
“ In markets where home prices were going up rapidly , more and more borrowers needed a product like this to afford something , ” said Alla Sirotic , senior director at Fitch Ratings .
Option ARMs were designed for savvy real estate investors and people whose income fluctuates , such as those paid on commission .
Instead , the loans became a tool for regular people to “ stretch ” to buy homes that were beyond their means . ”
I tend to disagree that borrowers “ needed ” a special mortgage to afford housing .
This is like saying people needed cows during tulip mania to buy tulips .
These products were merely creations of the housing bubble .
They only serve a purpose in a rapid rising housing market .
They gave the biggest incentives to mortgage brokers and Wall Street .
These loans are a mess .
Take a look at an example that highlights all of the above :
“ Joey Amacker of Newark , who works as an account manager for a catering company , refinanced his home with an option ARM for $ 624,000 so he could pull out money to build an addition .
The friend who sold him the loan assured him that an option ARM was a safe and affordable product , he said .
Amacker said he initially made only the minimum monthly payment of $ 1,800 , which covered part of his interest and none of the principal .
The amount he owed grew to $ 660,000 by November 2008 , according to loan documents …
Between the negative amortization and his missed payment and penalties , Amacker ’s total debt has ballooned to $ 725,000 , while the house is probably worth about $ 500,000 , he said .
“ I feel so ashamed of how I could have gotten myself in such a bad situation , ” he said .
Like Amacker , most option ARM borrowers owe much more than their homes are worth , so they can not refinance their way out of trouble . ”
This is a perfect example of the environment for strategic defaults .
The borrower took out a $ 624,000 mortgage that had a minimum payment of $ 1,800 .
The payment reflects a mortgage of $ 200,000 and not $ 624,000 .
However , with negative amortization the loan is now at $ 725,000 on a home that is probably worth $ 500,000 .
The payment will likely be higher than $ 4,000 once recast hits .
Take a wild guess what will happen then ?
Strategic defaults will be a major problem in 2010 but only for states in major bubbles .
California and Florida need to gear up for this because it will be happening .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates blasted The Associated Press , saying their transmission of a photo showing a mortally wounded Marine was ' appalling . '
Gates : AP decision ' appalling '
Defense Secretary Robert Gates is objecting “ in the strongest terms ” to an Associated Press decision to transmit a photograph showing a mortally wounded 21 - year - old Marine in his final moments of life , calling the decision “ appalling ” and a breach of “ common decency . ”
The AP reported that the Marine ’s father had asked – in an interview and in a follow - up phone call — that the image , taken by an embedded photographer , not be published .

The AP reported in a story that it decided to make the image public anyway because it “ conveys the grimness of war and the sacrifice of young men and women fighting it . ”
The photo shows Lance Cpl. Joshua M. Bernard of New Portland , Maine , who was struck by a rocket - propelled grenade in a Taliban ambush Aug. 14 in Helmand province of southern Afghanistan , according to The AP .
Gates wrote to Thomas Curley , AP ’s president and chief executive officer .
“ Out of respect for his family ’s wishes , I ask you in the strongest of terms to reconsider your decision .
I do not make this request lightly .
In one of my first public statements as Secretary of Defense , I stated that the media should not be treated as the enemy , and made it a point to thank journalists for revealing problems that need to be fixed – as was the case with Walter Reed . "
“ I cannot imagine the pain and suffering Lance Corporal Bernard ’s death has caused his family .
Why your organization would purposefully defy the family ’s wishes knowing full well that it will lead to yet more anguish is beyond me .
Your lack of compassion and common sense in choosing to put this image of their maimed and stricken child on the front page of multiple American newspapers is appalling .
The issue here is not law , policy or constitutional right – but judgment and common decency . ”
The four - paragraph letter concluded , “ Sincerely , ” then had Gates ’ signature .
The photo , first transmitted Thursday morning and repeated Friday morning , carries the warning , “ EDS NOTE : GRAPHIC CONTENT . ”
The caption says : “ In this photo taken Friday , Aug. 14 , 2009 , Lance Cpl. Joshua Bernard is tended to by fellow U.S. Marines after being hit by a rocket propelled grenade during a firefight against the Taliban in the village of Dahaneh in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan .
Bernard was transported by helicopter to Camp Leatherneck where he later died of his wounds . ”
Gates ’ letter was sent Thursday , after he talked to Curley by phone at about 3:30 p.m. Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell said Gates told Curley : “ I am asking you to reconsider your decision to publish this graphic photograph of Lance Corporal Bernard .
I am begging you to defer to the wishes of the family .
This will cause them great pain . ”
Curley was “ very polite and willing to listen , ” and send he would reconvene his editorial team and reconsider , Morrell said .
Within the hour , Curley called Morrell and said the editors had reconvened but had ultimately come to the same conclusion .
Gates “ was greatly disappointed they had not done the right thing , ” Morrell said .
The Buffalo News ran the photo on page 4 , and the The ( Wheeling , W.Va . )
Intelligencer ran an editorial defending its decision to run the photo .
Some newspapers – including the Arizona Republic , The Washington Times and the Orlando Sentinel – ran other photos from the series .
Several newspaper websites – including the Akron Beacon - Journal and the St. Petersburg Times – used the photo online .
Morrell said Gates wanted the information about his conversations released “ so everyone would know how strongly he felt about the issue . ”
The Associated Press reported in a story about deliberations about that photo that “ after a period of reflection , ” the news service decided “ to make public an image that conveys the grimness of war and the sacrifice of young men and women fighting it .
“ The image shows fellow Marines helping Bernard after he suffered severe leg injuries .
He was evacuated to a field hospital where he died on the operating table , ” AP said .
“ The picture was taken by Associated Press photographer Julie Jacobson , who accompanied Marines on the patrol and was in the midst of the ambush during which Bernard was wounded .
… ‘ AP journalists document world events every day .
Afghanistan is no exception .
We feel it is our journalistic duty to show the reality of the war there , however unpleasant and brutal that sometimes is , ’ said Santiago Lyon , the director of photography for AP .
“ He said Bernard 's death shows ‘ his sacrifice for his country .
Our story and photos report on him and his last hours respectfully and in accordance with military regulations surrounding journalists embedded with U.S. forces . ’ ”
The AP reported that it “ waited until after Bernard 's burial in Madison , Maine , on Aug. 24 to distribute its story and the pictures . ”
“ An AP reporter met with his parents , allowing them to see the images , ” the article says .
“ Bernard 's father after seeing the image of his mortally wounded son said he opposed its publication , saying it was disrespectful to his son's memory .
John Bernard reiterated his viewpoint in a telephone call to the AP on Wednesday .
‘ We understand Mr. Bernard 's anguish .
We believe this image is part of the history of this war .
The story and photos are in themselves a respectful treatment and recognition of sacrifice , ’ said AP senior managing editor John Daniszewski .
“ Thursday afternoon , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called AP President Tom Curley asking that the news organization respect the wishes of Bernard 's father and not publish the photo .
Curley and AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said they understood this was a painful issue for Bernard 's family and that they were sure that factor was being considered by the editors deciding whether or not to publish the photo , just as it had been for the AP editors who decided to distribute it . ”
The image was part of a package of stories and photos released for publication after midnight Friday .
The project , called “ AP Impact – Afghan – Death of a Marine , ” carried a dateline of Dahaneh , Afghanistan , and was written by Alfred de Montesquiou and Julie Jacobson :
“ The U.S. patrol had a tip that Taliban fighters were lying in ambush in a pomegranate grove , and a Marine trained his weapon on the trees .
Seconds later , a salvo of gunfire and rocket - propelled grenades poured out , and a grenade hit Lance Cpl. Joshua ‘ Bernie ’ Bernard .
The Marine was about to become the next fatality in the deadliest month of the deadliest year of the Afghan war . ”
The news service also moved extensive journal entries AP photographer Julie Jacobson wrote while in Afghanistan .
AP said in an advisory : “ From the reporting of Alfred de Montesquiou , the photos and written journal kept by Julie Jacobson , and the TV images of cameraman Ken Teh , the AP has compiled ‘ Death of a Marine , ’ a 1,700 word narrative of the clash , offering vivid insights into how the battle was fought , and into Bernard 's character and background .
It also includes an interview with his father , an ex-Marine , who three weeks earlier had written letters complaining that the military 's rules of engagement are exposing the troops in Afghanistan to undue risk . ”
The only way forward for new writers is digital publishing , says game and novel writer Michael Stackpole .
If you want to write for a living , learn to love this post - paper age .

Stackpole gave a seminar titled , " Writing in the post - paper era , " at the Origins Game Fair in Columbus , OH a week ago .
His feelings on the subject were made clear immediately when he pointed out that he was the first author to make short stories available through the iPhone App Store .
Stackpole is convinced that both established and fledgling authors need to embrace new content delivery methods or fade into irrelevance .
In fact , he offered evidence that digital publishing will not only be necessary for authors , but that it will work in their favor .
From Stackpole 's perspective as an established author ( more than three dozen published novels , eight of them Star Wars novels ) , digital publishing offers more control and direct , reliable payments .
Selling stories directly though his website generates a payment before the buyer has even finished downloading the story , and the profit margin on even a short story is far higher than on a paper novel .
By comparison , the lag time on payments for sales of a hard copy novel is six to nine months , and even then he pretty much has to take the publisher 's word for it that the accounting is accurate .

A lot of writers are worried about online piracy , but Stackpole dismissed those concerns .
" People downloading my stories from the big torrent sites were never going to buy them anyway .
It 's no money out of my pocket . "
He even admitted to downloading some of his own books from bittorrent sites if he did n't already have a digital copy , saying it was far easier than scanning it in himself .
Writers still trying to break into the publishing world have an unprecedented chance to start their own websites , build an audience and create a market for their work without relying on major publishers at all , said Stackpole .
Posting short fiction or even a serialized novel on a website wo n't cause problems if a writer tries to sign a publishing deal at a later date because mainstream publishers do n't see digital publishing as a serious threat .
Rather than simply changing the method of delivering stories to readers , Stackpole believes digital formats will change the nature of the stories themselves .
At the very least , authors should tailor their work to these new mediums .
He cited what he referred to as " the commuter market , " people who read two chapters per day on their half hour train ride to work .
It 's an ideal market for fiction broken into 2,500 word chapters , and could presage a resurgence of serial fiction .
" It 's kind of like a return to the Penny Dreadfuls , " he said .
" But the readers today are more sophisticated , so we as writers need to put more work into it . "
It was interesting to hear the formulaic way Stackpole approaches writing .
He described how the method of writing old pulp stories could easily be adapted for modern audiences by eliminating certain ubiquitous but unecessary subplots and adding a bit of character development .
A serial detective story should be , " 70 percent case , 30 percent soap opera , " with a little more soap in a later story to satisfy readers interested in a character 's developing personal life .

Even amidst all this embracing of change , Stackpole reassured his audience that digital formats were not sounding the death knell for paper books .
" Cars did not kill off horses .
Digital publishing will not kill off books .
It _will_ change the way they are written and retailed . "
If nothing else , it 's nice to hear an optimistic note among all the doom and gloom about genre fiction these days .
Okay , I ’ll be the first to admit that the details are sketchy on this one .
But , on the Vision Motor Corp. website there is a cool little hotrod that caught my eye .
This little hotrod is called the Vision Cheetah .
Now , what makes the Vision Cheetah so special ?
According to their website , “ Vision is also in prototype development of the Cheetah , which is intended to be the world ’s first hydrogen fuel cell / plug - in electric - powered supercar , featuring : zero emissions , accelerating 0 to 60 MPH faster than production Ferraris , Lamborghinis , Porsches and the battery powered Tesla . ”
Now , I ’ve pointed out a few hydrogen fuel cell plug - in hybrid vehicles in the past such as the Ford Flexible Series Edge and the VW Space Up Blue , but these are no speed burners .
Recently I had talked about the Buckeye Bullet 2 and the Jesse James Streamliner , which are both speed burners , but are not street legal and are not plug - in hybrids .
The Vision Cheetah is unique in that when the production model comes out it will be classified as a zero emission supercar with 0 – 60 mph acceleration of around 2.9 seconds .
The Vision Cheetah will also contain 10,000 psi carbon composite hydrogen tanks with an estimated range of 350+ miles .
The Cheetah has a curb weight of 2,640 lbs , puts out 1,350 lbs - ft. of torque and an estimated 425 horsepower .
This only proves that you do n’t have to give up power and speed to go zero emissions .
You do n’t have to give up range , either .
All you have to give up is the notion that fossil fuels are the future .
And then you ’ll be free to think beyond the gasoline internal combustion engine box this world has been inside for 100 years .

Bao Xishun , the world 's tallest man , measures 2.36 m ( 7ft 9in ) Taller people live better lives , according to US researchers .
More than 454,000 adults aged 18 and over were asked by phone for their height and evaluate their lives .
Overall , taller individuals judged their lives more favourably and were more likely to report positive emotions such as enjoyment and happiness .
Reporting to the journal Economics and Human Biology , they conclude that this is because the taller people also had higher incomes and education .
Ladder
The researchers used the Cantril " self - measuring striving scale " which asks you to imagine a ladder with rungs numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top .
The 10th rung represents the " best possible life for you " and the bottom is the " worst possible life for you " .
Participants were asked to report on which rung of the ladder they thought they stood on at the present time .
Surprisingly people who say that their lives are the ' best possible ' are slightly shorter on average
Angus Deaton
Princeton University
Men who were above average height 5ft 10in ( 177.8 cm ) reported that they were standing higher on the ladder than men who were below average height .
They had an average ladder score of 6.55 compared to the shorter men who scored 6.41 .
Women scored higher overall than men on the ladder scale and there was less difference between the taller and shorter women .
Taller women above the average height of 5ft 4in ( 162.6 cm ) scored 6.64 compared to a score of 6.55 for the shorter women .
But one of the lead researchers , Angus Deaton from Princeton University , said : " Surprisingly people who say that their lives are the ' best possible ' are slightly shorter on average than those who are a step or two below .
" Perhaps the 8 % of people who think their lives cannot be improved are different in other respects . "
Positive emotions
The study also looked at people 's emotions .
Taller men and women were more likely to report enjoyment and happiness , and less likely to report pain and sadness .
The people who are happiest are not the very tallest - there is a threshold of height tolerance
Dr Colin Gill
Chartered psychologist
Taller men , although not taller women , also worry less .
But sadness and anger were more likely to be experienced .
The authors say their findings cannot be attributed to different demographics or ethnicity , but are almost entirely explained by the positive association between height and both income and education , both of which are positively linked to better lives .
' Height matters ' Chartered psychologist Dr Colin Gill said : " There 's no direct correlation between income and happiness - surveys going back years show that .
" But there does appear to be a correlation between height and happiness and height and income .
" If you look at this study , the people who are happiest are not the very tallest .
" There is a threshold of height tolerance - at about 6ft 5in ( 195.6 cm ) to 6ft 6in ( 198.1 cm ) .
" It is about as tall as people think is normal , beyond that you are odd and life becomes very difficult .
" Height does matter , it 's always mattered for a very obvious reason - when you are born you are shorter than the people who look after you and have authority over you .
" And that power relationship never reverses . "

UPDATE : 7:00 EASTERN
Noted Alaskan blogger and radio host Shannyn Moore just said on MSNBC that unconfirmed reports indicate Palin is under a criminal probe .
Here 's the clip -- runs 3:17 .
HOLY SHIT
*
ALSO
John Weaver , John McCain 's campaign manager from the 2000 campaign and his first campaign manager from the 2008 campaign , just said :
" We 've seen a lot of nutty behavior from governors and Republican leaders in the last three months , but this one is at the top of that . "

► Palin cited three reasons for her resignation :
She could n't bear to govern while those " wasteful " Washington dollars are foisted upon her .
The crushing scrutiny of the national media , comparing herself to a basketball player passing the ball because of the oppressive " full court press " .
A recent photoshop cartoon that poked fun of her symbiotic political relationship with a local wingnut radio jock , superimposing his image over her son ’s face .
She took that not as a critique of the hate - radio nut , but rather as an attack on her son .
What horse shit .
THIS is the cartoon .
► Here is Palin 's flipped out attack :
Recently we learned of a malicious desecration of a photo of the Governor and baby Trig that has become an iconic representation of a mother 's love for a special needs child .
The mere idea of someone doctoring the photo of a special needs baby is appalling .
To learn that two Alaskans did it is absolutely sickening .
Linda Kellen Biegel , the official Democrat Party blogger for Alaska , should be ashamed of herself and the Democratic National Committee should be ashamed for promoting this website and encouraging this atrocious behavior .
Babies and children are off limits .
It is past time to restore decency in politics and real tolerance for all Americans .
The Obama Administration sets the moral compass for its party .
We ask that special needs children be loved , respected and accepted and that this type of degeneracy be condemned .
► And here is blogger Celtic Diva's , response :
" It 's called ' Baby Burke ' because it 's Eddie Burke ( a talker on KBYR who is a fervent Palin backer ) ... basically his probable second - biggest fantasy about the Governor . "
" So , connecting the dots for you ( Governor Palin ) ... WE'RE MAKING FUN OF EDDIE BURKE !!!!!! "
Her speech was made at a super rapid pace , almost like an old FEDEX commercial .
I suspect she wanted to unlock the talking points from her head , before they died of loneliness .
As a result , she babbled on , repeated various talking points over and over , along with numerous well worn platitudes , in her patented gibberish syntax ( as seen in the following actual quote ) :
" Really , we have to put first things , first .
And , first things first , as Governor ... "
► She used her kids as props and invoked God a bunch of times .
Oh , brother .
► She ended by mocking climate change .
Wingnut , global warming denier to the bitter end .
BUT WAIT !
THERE'S MORE !
► Yup , yup .
This is a real unretouched photo of Governor Goofball bending over to touch her toes , and ALSO , to show off some boob - age .
This is exactly how Golda Meir and Ann Richards got their start .
What ’s next -- a photo of her licking a dripping wet popsicle ?
Dream Ticket : Palin / Geraldo ‘ 12
UPDATE : 4:45 EASTERN
At the end , Palin screwed up a quote she attributed to General MacArthur :
" take the words of General MacArthur , he said , ' We 're not retreating , we 're just advancing in a different direction . ' "
Ummm , if you simply checked teh google you would have discovered that Douglas MacArthur NEVER said that .
Rather , it was said by a different general -- Oliver Smith .
UPDATE : 5:00 EASTERN
I just received a note from a top MSNBC political producer saying , Palin told her backer , mega GOP powerbroker , Fred Malek , off the record , that she 's not running in 2012 ( I imagine this was one of Andrea Mitchell 's sources ) .
Stick a fork in her , she 's done .
When the going gets tough ....
I 'm just speculating , here , but I wonder if Romney 's private investigators uncovered a doozy of a skeleton , in her closet .
P.S. THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR MICHAEL JACKSON !

A Great Moment in Our History
by Andrew P. Napolitano by Andrew P. Napolitano Recently by Andrew P. Napolitano : Liberty and Safety
Keynote speech at the Ohio Rally for State Sovereignty , August 1 , 2009
Let me set down a couple of fervent beliefs that animate everything I do and everything I say .
I believe that God created heaven and earth and every single individual on the planet .
I believe that the God who gave us life gave us liberty and that freedom is our birthright .
I believe that the States created the federal government and not the other way around .
And that the power that the States gave to the Federal Government  they can take back .
When we were colonists , and the King and the Parliament needed money from us , and they always seemed to need money , they devised ingenious ways to tax us .
One of them was called the Stamp Act .
The Parliament decreed that every piece of paper that the Colonists had in their homes ; every book , every document , every deed , every lease , every pamphlet , every poster to be nailed to a tree had to have the Kings stamp on it .
You think going to a Post Office is bad ?
You had to go to a British Government office and buy a stamp with the Kings picture .
Question .
How did the King know that his picture was on every piece of paper in your house ?
The Parliament enacted a hateful piece of legislation called the Writs of Assistance Act which let the kings soldiers write their own search warrants , and bang down any door they chose to look for the stamps or anything else that they were looking for .
It was the last straw .
We fought a revolution .
We won the revolution .
We wrote the Constitution .
The constitution doesnt grant power , it keeps the government off our backs .
When they were debating the Constitution in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia , there were two great arguments  one by the Jefferson and Madison crowd and one by the Adams and Hamilton crowd .
Jefferson argued , though he wasnt physically there in Philly , as he did in the Declaration of Independence that our rights are ours by virtue of our humanity .
That as God is perfectly free , and we are created in his image and likeness , we too are perfectly free .
The big government crowd  yes they had them even in those days  argued that you cant have freedom without government , and that government gives us our rights , and therefore , that government can take them away .
This is not an academic argument .
Jefferson and the natural law argument prevailed because the Constitution was written to keep the government from interfering with our natural rights .
And so , your right to think as you wish , to say what you think , to publish what you say , to travel where you want , to worship as you see fit , to keep and bear arms to defend yourself against a tyranny .
And , after the right to life , the greatest and most uniquely American of rights  and I say this in front of the seat of the government  is the right to be left alone .
We wrote a Constitution to ensure that the government would never interfere with these rights .
Think about it  if rights come from the government , then the government , by ordinary legislation , or presidential decree can take them away .
But if the rights come from our humanity , then unless we violate someone elses natural rights , the government cannot take our rights away .
This is not just a democrat , upper case D , or a republican , upper case R , problem .
It s a problem with government today .
Theres a republican version of big government just as assaultive to our liberties as the democrat version of big government .
We fought a revolution because British soldiers could knock on our doors and demand that we house them , and demand that we turn over property to them because they could write their own search warrants .
In the Patriot Act , the most hateful piece of legislation since the Alien and Sedition Acts , a republican congress and a republican president authorized federal agents to do the unthinkable  to write their own search warrants .
And the republican administration didnt even let members of the House of Representatives read the Patriot Act before they voted on it .
Why should the government be able to spy on us ?
We should be able to spy on them !
When some judge is rationalizing away our liberty , or some congressman is plotting to take away your freedom or your tax dollars , we should know what they do every minute that they do it .
I was speaking to a group of congressman from a neighboring state 
I wont tell you which state it was , but they dont play football there  and they came up to me and said  this is the first time we have heard that the Patriot Act allows federal agents to write their own search warrants .
Remember , in the Constitution , we put in the 4th Amendment , the right to be left alone , to make sure that if the government had a target , no matter how guilty the target , no matter how widespread is the belief in the guilt of the target , no matter how dangerous is the target , the government has to go through a neutral judge with a search warrant before it can get to that target .
These members of Congress said , we didnt know that the Patriot Act allowed the government to bypass the courts and write any search warrant they wanted .
Then I asked them a question I knew the answer to already  did you read the Patriot Act before you voted on it ?
The answer  no .
What were you voting on ?
A summary we received .
Let me guess who wrote the summary  some lawyers in the justice department , right ?
Of course .
Would you hire anybody to run your business that committed you to a violation of the very reason you re in business if they didnt even read the document by which they were making that commitment ?
Of course not .
The camera is the new gun .
Theres nothing that government dislikes more than the light of day , and cameras recording what the government is doing , whether its on a street corner , or in there , or in Washington D.C. , we have the right to know everything that they do and why they do it , and when they do it , and how they are taking our freedoms .
I have another one of my basic core beliefs .
The individual has an immortal soul .
Every individual is greater than any government .
Your government is based on fear and force .
You dont have to take my word on it .
The 2nd president on the United States , John Adams , said  Of course the government is based on fear . 
And the first president , George Washington , said  Government is not reason , it is force . 
I think they knew what they were talking about .
Now fast - forward to modern times .
Whenever the government wants something , it scares us .
During the civil war , Lincoln tried civilians in this state where no battles occurred , by military tribunal .
After he died the Supreme Court invalidated everything the military tribunals did .
During the first world war , the Wilson administration locked up 2000 people called anarchists  same thing as enemy combatants .
No trial , no charge , just jail for the duration of the war .
In World War II , FDR locked up 150,000 Japanese Americans , people born in the United States , who got no trial and had no charges , and when the war was over were given $ 25 and told to go home .
Today we have federal agents .
You know I get in arguments with my friends at Fox News , and one of them , I dont have to tell you who it is , but is truly the most irascible person there .
And he said to me , you know you have a problem with Guantanamo Bay , and you have a problem with the Patriot Act , what will you do if I get sent to Guantanamo Bay , will you visit me ?
And I say , Bill  no , because theyll probably keep me there as well .
Government likes to say that its taking an oath to uphold the Constitution .
In the years that I was on the bench , it seemed that every time government lawyers were in my courtroom , if the government was prosecuting someone who was legitimately guilty or whether it was a mistake , or whether somebody was suing the government because government contractors or government doctors , or government workers made a mistake  the government doesnt come in to the courtroom to enforce the constitution , it comes into the courtroom to evade and avoid it .
That , ladies and gentlemen , must be stopped .
This is a great moment in our history .
A crowd of this magnitude on a beautiful day , in the boiling sun , in the most middle - American of great middle - American states comes together not because the president is a democrat , not because his predecessor was a republican , not because a war is just or unjust , not because the Fed is stealing or printing  you re here because you believe in human freedom .
It is the essence of our existence that we should be free .
But remember this : the government hates freedom .
It is an obstacle to every one of their designs .
Whenever they write laws , whenever they take your tax dollars , whenever they regulate your private behavior , whenever they tell you how to spend your money , whenever they tell you what medicines to take , whenever they tell you what food to eat , whenever they tell you with whom you may or must associate , they are taking away your freedom and they love to get away with it .
And they can not get away with it any longer .
In the long history of the world , very few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its maximum hour of danger .
This is that moment and you are that generation !
Now is the time to defend our freedoms .
Jefferson was no saint but he was the greatest of our American presidents .
He believed that the individual was greater than the state .
He believed that the states were greater than the federal government .
And when he wrote that our rights come from our creator , and that our rights are inalienable , he forever wed the notion of natural rights to the American experience and the American experiment .
We must be vigilant about every right that the government wants to take away from us .
Youve heard the president say , present president and his predecessor , my first job is to keep you safe . 
Hes wrong !
His first job is to keep us free .
It is his only job to keep us free .
Shortly before he died , Jefferson lamented , that in his view of the world it was the natural order of things for government to grow and freedom to be diminished ; how ardently he wish that that wouldnt happen .
And in order to prevent it from happening he had a very simple remedy ,  When the people fear the government , that is tyranny .
When the government fears the people , that is liberty !

MySpace users create their own profiles online Sentencing will take place this week in the first federal cyber bullying case in the US which was brought to trial after a teenage girl took her own life .
Lori Drew , 50 , pretended to be a boy on the MySpace website to befriend Megan Meier , who hanged herself after the virtual friendship ended .
A California judge postponed sentencing until 2 July to review testimony from two witnesses .
Ms Drew 's landmark case concerning internet law made worldwide headlines .
Megan , a neighbour of Ms Drew 's in St Louis , Missouri , and a former friend of her daughter , took her own life in October 2006 .
The court was told that Megan killed herself after receiving several cruel messages from a fictitious 16 - year - old boy named Josh Evans .
One post said the world would be better off without her .
Prosecutors said that Ms Drew and several others created the fake online page on MySpace , the social networking site , to find out what Megan was saying about her daughter after they had fallen out .
" Bad law " Ms Drew was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , which is normally used against computer hackers .
Prosecutors were unable to find any existing laws within the state of Missouri under which she could be tried .
They had alleged that Ms Drew had violated MySpace 's terms of service by using false information to set up an account so she and others could " harass , abuse or harm " Megan Meier .
Drew 's trial was the first legal case in the US relating to cyber - bullying
The case was tried in California where MySpace is headquartered .
Last November a jury found Ms Drew guilty of three minor counts of violating MySpace 's terms of use , but cleared her of the more serious charges that carried a maximum of 20 years in jail .
" There is a saying in the law that hard cases make bad law and that compelling facts lead courts and prosecutors to pursue cases that are ill advised and that 's what we have seen right here with this case , " said Andrew Grossman , who is a senior legal analyst with the Heritage Foundation , a conservative public policy research institute .
" What happened to Megan is truly a tragedy and no one wishes to downplay that .
Ms Drew did n't do anything that was against the law .
She did some things that were unkind , that were rude and not becoming of an adult but not against the law .
" The messages she sent were not criminal had she said them face to face or on the phone .
She did not threaten harm or violence .
The prosecutors have twisted the law and that should concern everyone who uses the internet , " Mr Grossman told BBC News .
" Serious crime "
In the aftermath of the Megan Meier case a number of states and communities drew up cyber bullying laws .
This includes Megan 's home state of Missouri where it is now a crime punishable by a fine of up to $ 500 ( £ 300 ) or 90 days in jail , to harass someone over the internet .
Efforts are also underway to pass a federal law .
California Congresswoman Linda Sanchez is behind the Megan Meier Cyber bullying Prevention
Act which has been referred to a judiciary committee for legal review .
A recent study said over 40 % of children have been bullied online
This law aims to make it a crime punishable by a fine or up to two years of prison to communicate online with " the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person . "
" We need to make new laws in response to these new crimes .
Sexting and textual harassment are only a couple of new tactics used by bullies who do n't think they 'll get caught because there are no bystanders in cyberspace , " said Ms Sanchez in an email to the BBC .
" What they need to know is that cyber bullying is a serious crime , and is no less harmful than in - person threats , stalking , and harassment .
" If federal law recognises this new form of bullying , police and prosecutors will be better equipped and educated to deal with this problem .
Prosecutors , more importantly , will then have the ability to punish this behaviour in court , " said Ms Sanchez .
Some legal experts worry about a law that specifically targets online behaviour .
" These types of matters are better decided in sober moments where they are not driven by a single set of facts , " said Professor John Palfrey of the Berkman Centre for Internet & Society at Harvard University .
" One of the big questions we have to grapple with is whether or not bullying done online makes us feel any differently than bullying in the old fashioned way .
If it does n't then its not clear we need a new law in this context .
" Generally speaking it's a bad idea to make cyber specific laws .
We do n't need a cyber law for stealing , we have a law for theft .
We do n't need a cyber law for fraud , we have basic laws for that .
And the question now should be do we want to outlaw bullying and not just cyber bullying ? " questioned Professor Palfrey .
" Devastating "
The US National Crime Prevention Council in a report last year found that 43 % of teens are exposed to cyber bullying in one form or another yet only one in 10 kids told their parents .
" Cyber bullying can have such a devastating effect on our young people from depression to falling grades and low self esteem .
This case shows however that cyber bullying is not something that just young people commit but we as adults can also be at fault , " said the council 's Michelle Boykin .
" The issue of how you deal with cyber bullying from a legislative perspective is a tough one and we are glad people are looking at the issue seriously . "
Cati said she was a victim of cyber - bullying for nearly three years Cyber bullying was just one of the topics covered by the Internet Safety Technical Task Force , a group of 29 internet businesses , non-profit organisations , academics and technology companies .
The body was set up by the Attorneys General and chaired by Professor Palfrey .
He told the BBC he believed this is an " extremely important case " and that " one of the challenges with cyber bullying is that there has been a sharp increase over the years .
The big question on the data is whether there is actually an increase of bullying across the board .
" The difference with cyber bullying over regular bullying is that its recorded and it's not just someone saying something on the playground . "
Support website 15 year old Catherine ' Cati ' Grant was a victim of cyber bullying from the age of twelve .
The cause she said was a misunderstanding with a friend who accused Cati of stealing something .
" She sent me mean messages on MySpace and blamed me for things I did n't do .
After a while I got really sad and worried about what people thought of me . "
In the end Cati said the bullying stopped when the other girl went to the school principal .
He told her to stay away from Cati or " suffer the consequences . "
That experience , coupled with the death of Megan Meier , prompted Cati to take action .
She set up a website for teens to get help , support and advice and is planning a tour across America to raise awareness about internet safety and join one million teens together against cyber bullying .
" Megan 's death was one of the reasons I set up my website .
It was just so shocking and upsetting and I want to do what I can to prevent cyber bullying in general and help teenagers who feel they have no where to turn to , " Ms Grant told BBC News .

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Sunday that the H1N1 ( swine ) flu vaccine will be available in the U.S. earlier than previously anticipated , the Wall Street Journal reports .
“ We are on track to have an ample supply rolling out by mid-October , but we may have some early vaccine as early as the first full week in October .
And we plan to get the vaccine rolling out the door as fast as it hits the production line , ” Sebelius said ( Davis , 9/13 ) . Â
As soon as the vaccine is available , Sebelius said that it will be sent to designated locales around the country , adding , “ Every state has a plan saying these are the sites to get the vaccine as quickly as possible into people ’s arms .
That ’s where the distribution will go , ” the Associated Press reports ( 9/13 ) .
She said the earliest available doses will be used for high - priority groups , including health care workers , VOA News reports ( 9/13 ) .
On Friday , officials announced that “ U.S. studies found a 15 - microgram dose of vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur produced a protective immune response in 96 percent of adults aged 18 to 64 and in 56 percent of adults aged 65 and older , ” the Washington Post reports .
Anthony Fauci , who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said , “ This is very good news .
If you needed two doses , that would be a major strain on vaccine supplies nationally and globally ” ( Stein , 9/11 ) .
According to the Los Angeles Times , Fauci also said “ no significant adverse events whatsoever ” have been indicated in any of the trials , adding , “ We ’re seeing the kinds of things you would expect , swelling and redness at the injection site that is not clinically significant .
There are no red flags on safety in any of these trials ” ( Maugh , 9/12 ) .
Dow Jones / Wall Street Journal reports on Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute ’s assertion that it will be able to sell an H1N1 vaccine at a fraction of the cost of those made by Western drug companies .
Serum ’s vaccine “ is undergoing animal testing now , is expected to enter human trials within a month ” ( Gupta , 9/14 ) .
G7 Vows To Help Developing Countries , Reaches Agreement With Mexico On Vaccine Priority Groups
Health care workers , pregnant women and people living with high - risk health conditions will receive priority status in H1N1 vaccine efforts , according to an agreement reached on Friday by the G7 and Mexico , the Associated Press reports .
The meeting focused on handling the H1N1 epidemic in the Northern hemisphere .
Canada , Japan , Germany , France , Italy , Britain and the U.S. â€ ” as well as the European Union at the meeting “ unanimously agreed ” to help developing nations combat the virus ( Brand , 9/12 ) .
The Wall Street Journal examines how H1N1 is affecting health care workers in Argentina ( Moffett , 9/14 ) . Â
WHO Updates Death Toll , Releases Statement On School Closures
On Friday , the WHO said the H1N1 death toll has reached at least 3,205 people , Agence France - Presse reports .
“ Most of the deaths occurred in the Americas region , where 2,467 fatalities have been reported to the U.N. health agency .
The Asia -Pacific region recorded 527 deaths , followed by Europe where at least 125 people have succumbed to the infection .
The death toll in the Middle East reached 51 while the number of deaths in Africa climbed to 35 , said the WHO in an update posted on its website ” ( 9/12 ) .
Reuters reports that in a statement released on Friday , the WHO said “ [ c] losing schools at the start of an H1N1 flu outbreak can greatly slow its spread and buy time to build up drug stocks . ”
In order to have any effect on slowing the spread of H1N1 , the closures would have to be made , “ ideally before 1 percent of the population falls ill , ” according to the statement ( Nebehay , 9/11 ) . Â
The Canadian Press reports that the statement “ neither encouraged or discouraged use of this measure ” and said the agency “ could not offer advice on the issue that would be useful in all settings , saying national and local authorities are best situated to make these kinds of calls ” ( Branswell , 9/12 ) .
Sharing a bed may not be conducive for sleep Couples should consider sleeping apart for the good of their health and relationship , say experts .
Sleep specialist Dr Neil Stanley told the British Science Festival how bed sharing can cause rows over snoring and duvet - hogging and robs precious sleep .
One study found that , on average , couples suffered 50 % more sleep disturbances if they shared a bed .
Dr Stanley , who sleeps separately from his wife , points out that historically we were never meant to share our beds .
He said the modern tradition of the marital bed only began with the industrial revolution , when people moving to overcrowded towns and cities found themselves short of living space .
If you 've been sleeping together and you both sleep perfectly well , then do n't change , but do n't be afraid to do something different
Dr Neil Stanley Read your comments
Before the Victorian era it was not uncommon for married couples to sleep apart .
In ancient Rome , the marital bed was a place for sexual congress but not for sleeping .
Dr Stanley , who set up one of Britain 's leading sleep laboratories at the University of Surrey , said the people of today should consider doing the same .
" It 's about what makes you happy .
If you 've been sleeping together and you both sleep perfectly well , then do n't change , but do n't be afraid to do something different .
" We all know what it 's like to have a cuddle and then say ' I 'm going to sleep now ' and go to the opposite side of the bed .
So why not just toddle off down the landing ? "
Tossing and turning
He said poor sleep was linked to depression , heart disease , strokes , lung disorders , traffic and industrial accidents , and divorce , yet sleep was largely ignored as an important aspect of health .
Dr Robert Meadows , a sociologist at the University of Surrey , said : " People actually feel that they sleep better when they are with a partner but the evidence suggests otherwise . "
He carried out a study to compare how well couples slept when they shared a bed versus sleeping separately .
Based on 40 couples , he found that when couples share a bed and one of them moves in his or her sleep , there is a 50 % chance that their slumbering partner will be disturbed as a result .
Despite this , couples are reluctant to sleep apart , with only 8 % of those in their 40s and 50s sleeping in separate rooms , the British Science Festival heard .

Being a food manufacturer is tricky these days .
These companies need to use the cheapest possible ingredients to maintain their profit margins , but what they put into the product goes under intense scrutiny by today ’s health - conscious consumers .
Problem is , healthy ingredients are expensive .
Taboo ingredients , such as partially hydrogenated oils and saturated fats , are cheap .
So how does the manufacturer handle these tricky situations ?
They pass the tricks onto the consumer , of course !
So every time we shop , we have to be vigilant about what we ’re getting , because there ’s always someone trying to pull one over on us .
That ’s why I compiled a list of tricks that most companies play on us :
Trick # 1 : “ 0 grams ” of Unhealthy Ingredients
The trick : Foods are labeled as containing “ 0g trans fat ” or “ 0g saturated fat ” per serving .
Unfortunately , “ 0 ” does not mean 0 .
It actually means “ up to 0.5 ” grams per serving .
So if you consume two servings of some “ 0g trans fats ” snacks , you could be ingesting up to 1g of trans fats .
( And no one eats just one or two servings … )
Heck , even the words “ fat free ” on the label allow up to 0.5g fat per serving .
How to spot it : Foods that are actually healthy do n’t need to bother claiming “ 0g trans fats . ”
So if you see a bag of chips with a big “ 0g trans fats ” badge right on front , they are probably pulling this trick .
Worst offender : Frito Lay snacks , such as Cheetos .
Frito
Lay takes pride in the fact that they were the first major food company to remove trans fats from their snack chips , and I applaud them for taking the initiative , but it does n’t mean their snacks are healthy .
What to do : Skip past the Nutrition Facts label and peruse the ingredients .
If the ingredients list contains any type of hydrogenated oils , partially hydrogenated soybean oil for instance , then the product contains trans fats , no matter how big the “ 0g trans fats ” badge is .
Trick # 2 : Combining Healthy Ingredients
The trick :
In order to have a healthy - sounding ingredient first on the ingredients list , the producer combines a bunch of healthy ingredients into their own special mix or blend , and then lists that as the first ingredient .
If this was not done , the small amounts of separate ingredients would be listed towards the end of the list , while something evil like “ sugar ” would be the first or second ingredient .
Usually there is no reason to do this … unless , of course , they are trying to trick you .
How to spot it : Look at the ingredient list and see if the first ingredient sounds anything like “ special protein blend ” or “ proprietary blend ” or “ whole grain mix . ”
It ’s pretty easy to spot !
Worst offender : Kashi granola bars , where the first ingredient is “ Kashi Seven Whole Grains & Sesame® Blend . ”
In this case , the product is a pretty healthy choice , but it ’s a perfect example of how they could push certain ingredients well down the list .
Plenty of other healthy and unhealthy bars use this tactic , too .
Just about every protein bar will list a “ proprietary protein blend ” first .
What to do : Read the whole ingredients list .
If you scan past that blend , you ’ll probably see something less enticing as the ‘ second ’ ingredient .
( I say ‘ second ’ ingredient because it ’s probably the tenth word in the list ! )
It just depends what all is included on the rest of the ingredients list .
Kashi uses organic brown rice syrup , but the majority of other brands will list high fructose corn syrup and possibly a partially hydrogenated oil .
Trick # 3 : Splitting Sugars
The trick :
This is the reverse of the combining healthy ingredients strategy listed above .
The producer does not want the word “ sugar ” at the beginning of the ingredients list , so they split the total sugar content into multiple types of sugar , allowing them to list the sugars towards the end of the list .
This way they stick with their large amount of sugar to keep the product tasting good , and they have the product appearing healthier at the same time .
How to spot it : Just scan through the ingredients list and look for different types of sugar .
If you see sugar , brown sugar , dextrose , corn syrup , and / or corn syrup solids listed separately , you found a trickster .
Worst offender : Most sweet , colorful cereals , such as Froot Loops .
Froot Loops actually lists sugar as the first ingredient , but still lists sugar , corn syrup , and dextrose afterward .
( Yep , “ sugar ” is actually listed twice . )
What to do : Again , dissect the ingredients list .
If you see a bunch of different sugars listed , chances are there is way too much sugar in the product , so move on .
Also , if you look at the grams of sugar per serving ( on the nutrition facts section , ) that will shed some light on the situation .
Trick # 4 : Sugar That Is n’t Sugar
The trick : Maltodextrin is a very sweet carbohydrate that is virtually equivalent to regular table sugar , but it does n’t need to be listed as sugar in the nutrition facts label .
It looks and tastes like sugar , and it ’s an astounding 105 on the Glycemic Index , which makes it even faster to enter the bloodstream than sugar !
But yet it does n’t count as “ sugar ” on the nutrition facts .
( Table sugar , or sucrose , which gets such a bad rap , is merely a 64 on the Glycemic Index ! )
How to spot it : Look for products that claim to use only complex carbohydrates , or ones that claim to be “ sugar free . ”
Then on the Nutrition Facts label the sugar will be very low , but total carbs will be high .
Worst offender : Hammer Nutrition , who evangelizes how their products with their complex carbs are the only way to go , and if you eat simple sugars , you are going to ride slow and get fat .
Hammer ’s products , such as Heed , have maltodextrin as the first ingredient .
But when you look at the Nutrition Facts , you ’ll see 2g sugar , but a whole 25g carbs .
What to do :
If you ’re buying a sports drink or energy bar , you want something with sugar , so I ’m not saying you should avoid this .
But look at similar products and compare ingredients before buying anything based on some fancy sales tactics .
Hammer ’s maltodextrin - based products are just fine , and I think they taste great , but they ’re filled with sugar like anything else .
If you do n’t believe me , just look at the Powerbar Endurance sports drink – maltodextrin is the first ingredient !
Trick # 5 : Enriched Wheat Flour
The trick : “ Enriched wheat flour ” is used on the ingredients list instead of “ enriched white flour ” because some consumers just want to see the word “ wheat ” on there .
Sounds healthy , right ?
Certainly much better than white flour ?
Nope , it ’s actually the same .
Since white flour comes from wheat , it can be called wheat flour .
How to spot it :
If the supposed “ wheat ” or “ multi- grain ” product is plain white , you can bet that it is made with simple white flour .
Worst offender : Nearly all big bread companies .
What to do :
You need to look for “ 100 % whole wheat flour ” on the list to actually get a quality whole grain product .
Also , when it comes to bread , a high - quality whole wheat bread is going to be brown and heavy .
It will be expensive as well ; expect to pay $ 3 - 4 per loaf ( more for boutique brands . )
The best thing to do , though , is to bake your own bread at home !
That allows you to make your own flour from whole grains while avoiding artificial crap and preservatives that would find their way into the healthiest store - bought breads .
And if you have the time and culinary skills , try making a loaf of sprouted grain bread !
Trick # 6 : Just a Dash of Healthy Ingredients .
The trick : Lots of bags and boxes mention how there are neat herbs , vitamins , minerals , etc. in the food inside .
But to mention that , the company need only add a tiny amount of said ingredient to the product .
How to spot it : Just look on the ingredient list – chances are that ingredient that is actually healthy is listed last .
This could be that the food is in a lightweight powdered form , or it could be that there is virtually none in there .
Worst offender : Steaz green tea soda , which is more like soda with a tiny bit of green tea powder added in to give it a healthy name .
Sure , Steaz tastes pretty good , but all the sugar far outweighs the health benefits of the green tea .
What to do : Validate all manufacturer claims by looking at the ingredients list and seeing how close to the front the healthy ingredients are listed .
And if you want healthy ingredients , do n’t bother looking at soda !
Trick # 7 : Unreal Serving Sizes .
The trick : Wanting to keep fat and calories low on a “ per serving ” basis , companies list serving sizes as ridiculously low amounts .
You might see something like , “ just 100 calories and 1g fat per serving ! ”
Yeah , well , one of those servings is about three bite - size cookies .
Plan to eat at least three servings at once .
How to spot it : Look at the nutrition facts and see exactly what the serving size is .
It might be “ 3 chips ” or something like that .
Worst offender :
All cookies and chips that come in small servings , but specifically the Oreos 100 calorie packs .
What to do :
Think about how many cookies you are likely to eat in one sitting and determine the actual number of servings you will consume based on that .
Then you can calculate total calories and fat for your preferred serving size .
The food probably wo n’t seem low calorie any more !
Trick # 8 : “ All Natural ” Foods
The trick : Since a “ natural ” food sounds healthier , manufacturers are slapping the term “ natural ” on their packaging to make you think the product is healthy .
Unfortunately , “ natural ” is not a strictly regulated term like “ organic . ”
Virtually anything can be labeled as “ natural . ”
Heck , even flavors made in a laboratory can be called natural flavors if they are based on a substance found in nature !
How to spot it : Usually these products proclaim “ ALL NATURAL ” in big letters on the front of the label .
The long version is more like , “ Eat our natural potato chips since they ’re made from potatoes that were grown in the dirt , and that dirt was there on its own , so it ’s natural ! ”
Worst offender : Stauffer ’s All Natural Animal Crackers .
While the “ all natural ” version may be marginally healthier than the regular version , what makes sugar and invert syrup natural ?
If processed sugar and syrup are natural , then HFCS must be as healthy as eating corn on the cob !
[ Note the sarcasm . ]
What to do : Use common sense .
If the product is called natural , but it does n’t look like anything you see growing on a farm , it ’s not likely to be natural .
Trick # 9 : “ Low Calorie ” and “ Reduced Fat ” Foods
The trick : Products get labeled “ low calorie ” or “ reduced fat ” to resonate with consumers as a low fat food .
These are tricky terms because it only means “ lower calories than the typical , high - calorie version of the product . ”
It ’s still going to be much higher in calories than a carrot !
So if you see a food labeled “ low calorie , ” there ’s a good chance the producer also has an original or older version of the product .
How to spot it :
No matter what the packaging says , read the actual nutrition facts label and you ’ll see the true number of calories and fat per serving .
Chances are it will still be relatively high ( or the serving size will be very small . )
Worst offender : The Ruffles potato chips pictured above .
I do believe the “ 25 % less fat than regular Ruffles Potato Chips ” claim , but look at the rest of the bag .
They have the nerve to put wording on there like “ Smart Choices Made Easy ” and “ Heart Healthy Oil . ”
Is that supposed to mean that potato chips are good for your heart ?!
Ha !
Honorable mentions include all the varieties of reduced fat potato chips .
Reduced fat chips are n’t low in fat compared to fruits and vegetables , just slightly lower in fat than regular chips .
What to do :
It ’s simple – avoid chips and snack crackers .
They are all high in calories and not filling at all , so have some good fruit instead .
Trick # 10 : Confusing Names , Synonyms , and / or Acronyms on the Label .
The trick :
If a certain substance becomes regarded as unhealthy or faces bad publicity , manufacturers wo n’t want it listed on their ingredients list .
Instead of switching to a healthier ingredient , they just disguise the name to throw you off track .
How to spot it :
You actually have to analyze the ingredient list and make sure you know what each ingredient is .
Worst offender :
There are so many good examples , I ca n’t narrow it down to one .
So here are a few …
“ Splenda ” was big until certain people got the idea that artificial sweeteners were bad .
So it was still used , but listed as “ sucralose ” on the label .
A lot of people hear “ MSG is bad for you ” but if they saw “ Monosodium glutamate ” on a label , would they notice ?
I got tricked with a drink called Press Cocktail Soda .
Instead of listing “ high fructose corn syrup ” on the list , they put “ 42 HFCS ” on there , which is just a different form of HFCS .
Since the ingredients were written in white on a shiny silver skinny can , I totally missed it .
Even Gatorade did this .
They used “ glucose - fructose syrup ” on the label back when I was just a newbie in the sports drink world .
Trusting Gatorade , I thought that fancy terminology meant I was getting some high - tech , nutritious formula !
Eventually they had to tell the truth , which is why you now see “ high fructose corn syrup ” on the label .
What to do : Study up on your terminology so you can figure this out on the fly .
It ’s like how detectives need to be able to think like criminals in order to solve a crime .
You need to think like a greedy food corporation and figure out the best disguises for unhealthy ingredients .
But once you know the tricks , it ’s very unlikely that you ’ll be fooled by any unscrupulous manufacturers and their claims !

Obama administration rejects aid to California
State government preparing massive cuts
By Dan Conway
18 June 2009
The Obama administration has rejected any immediate aid to the state of California .
State officials went to Washington over the weekend to request emergency loans to address California ’s looming budget and financial crisis .
“ We ’re not expecting any help from the federal government , ” the California state treasurer ’s office stated after the meeting .
“ At this point , we ’re on our own . ”
The state faces a $ 24 billion budget gap , and the state controller said California faces a “ complete financial meltdown ” as soon as July 28 .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , along with White House economists Lawrence Summers and Christina Romer , insisted that the state take measures of its own to address its fiscal crisis .
“ A lot of the burden , ” Geithner said earlier in congressional testimony , “ is going to be on them to lay out a path that gets their deficits down to the point where they ’re going to be able to fund themselves comfortably . ”
In taking this position , the administration is giving its full support to a series of crushing austerity measures proposed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state ’s Democratic Party .
The state government is responding to the financial crisis by destroying what little remains of the social safety net upon which millions of people depend .
The Obama administration wants California to serve as a precedent for other states , many of which are facing looming budget deficits .
An article in the Washington Post noted , “ Federal officials are worried that a bailout of California would set off a cascade of demands from other states . ”
Similarly , cuts in California will set off a cascade of cuts throughout the country .
While California Democrats and Republicans have yet to agree on the exact cuts that will be implemented , it is clear that few state - sponsored social programs of any kind will remain unaffected .
Spending cuts proposed by Schwarzenegger include eliminating the state welfare program , which serves 1.3 million people ; shutting down the Healthy Families Program , which provides subsidized medical , dental and vision coverage to hundreds of thousands of poor children ; eliminating the Cal Grant aid program for college students ; cutting education spending by $ 5.6 billion ; forcing local governments to loan the state $ 1.9 billion , even as all of these local governments face fiscal crises of their own ; and closing down 220 state parks .
These cuts will come with tens of thousands of layoffs .
The governor proposed reducing the state workforce by 5,000 employees last month , along with an additional 1,800 correctional officers .
However , a report by the University of California Los Angeles Anderson School of Business projects that the number of state employees who will lose their jobs throughout 2010 and early 2011 will exceed 60,000 .
This amounts to half of 1 percent of the state ’s entire working population , and approximately 12 percent of the state workforce including college and university employees .
It does not include pre-college public school employees , more than 50,000 of whom are set to lose their jobs by next September .
These workers , along with their counterparts in the private sector , will face the prospect of an insolvent state unemployment insurance fund .
The fund is currently running a $ 17.8 billion deficit and is only able to maintain payments via an interest - free loan from Washington that must be repaid in 2011 .
These cuts and layoffs will add to a rash of austerity measures passed last February in response to the then $ 42 billion budget deficit .
( See “ California legislature passes massive austerity budget ” )
The earlier measures already implemented included a $ 1.3 billion cut to the state ’s Supplemental Security Income to elderly and disabled residents ; a $ 226.7 million cut to mental health services ; mandatory unpaid furlough days for state workers amounting to a 5 percent reduction in pay ; and a cut of $ 8.6 billion to public education , resulting in more than 50,000 teachers and school employees receiving “ pink slips ” last February .
The majority of these teachers will not be returning to their schools next September .
The latest round of austerity measures was set to be voted on Monday , with Schwarzenegger threatening to allow the state to come to a “ grinding halt ” should his initially proposed measures not be passed .
State Democrats , who helped the governor craft last February ’s budget and also agree in principal with the current measures , nevertheless attempted to water down some of the more outrageous proposals in the hope of curbing rising social discontent .
The Democrats ’ plan offsets reductions in spending cuts mainly through regressive tax increases .
The Democrats ’ proposal stops the state park closure by levying an additional $ 15 onto the vehicle license fee .
It also would stop the $ 1.9 billion forced borrowing from local governments by cutting foster care programs or increasing health insurance contributions from state workers .
Other measures being proposed by the Democrats include an additional tax on Internet - based sales , a $ 363 million cut to mass transit funding , and a $ 315 million cut to school bus programs .
All factions of the political establishment in California are agreed on one thing : the working class will be forced to pay for the economic crisis .

Former ALP minister and powerbroker Graham Richardson says the mystery tape at the centre of a Sydney businessman 's murder does not implicate Labor ministers in corruption .
Michael McGurk was gunned down in front of his son outside his home at Cremorne on Sydney 's north shore last week .
Before his death he claimed he was in possession of a tape which allegedly implicates New South Wales Labor politicians in corruption .
But Mr Richardson told Channel
Nine he has heard the tape and the key part which apparently exposes the Labor figures is inaudible .
He also says Mr McGurk told him it implicates bureaucrats - not politicians .
Mr Richardson says the tape contains a conversation between Mr McGurk and property developer Ron Medich - who is one of Mr Richardson 's clients - and he played it to him at a meeting this year .
" The critical part , where there was supposed to be allegations of bribery was completely inaudible , " he said .
" There was nothing on the tape that you could understand , neither content nor names . "
Mr Richardson says Mr McGurk was allegedly trying to blackmail Mr Medich for $ 8 million and the matter was referred to police three months ago .
" McGurk never even alleged that there was a politician named on this tape , that 's why I 'm so surprised by the allegations of the last few days , " he said .
" He wanted money from Ron Medich and lots of it - millions of dollars .
" About three months ago roughly I gave the police a statement about that meeting . "
Mr McGurk allegedly told people his home and office were recently burgled , and he believed the motive was to get the tape - which showed that some businessmen he was dealing with were paying some ministers in the New South Wales Government .
Sydney entrepreneur Jim Byrnes last week said Mr McGurk was afraid for his life because the explosive allegations could bring down the Government .
" It 's a pretty well established fact that there was supposed to be a tape recording of a lengthy conversation that he had with a person who he is currently in dispute with , and that tape recording related to supposed financial payments to very senior politicians within the state , " he said .
" Had that tape seen the light of day you might be seeing a chain [ effect ] .
You might be seeing two or three politicians no longer being politicians .
" A former NSW politician and powerbroker had reviewed the tape and as I understand it was dynamite .
" The fact of the matter was when I was told of this , my response was that it should be handed over to the Crime Commission and ... copies of it should be provided to all of the major networks and newspapers .
" Not for the purpose of exploiting the politicians ' naivety and stupidity , but more for the fact of his own personal protection so that the tape was n't buried or lost . "
Mr Byrnes said there could have been a long list of people who may have wanted Mr McGurk killed .
A report in the March 23 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine ( a journal from JAMA / Archives ) indicates that in the United States from 1994 to 2004 , the average blood levels of vitamin D seem to have decreased .
In the past , the most important health conditions linked to vitamin D deficiency were poor bone mineral content in adults and rickets in children .
The report indicates those problems were treated by fortifying food with vitamin D. Lately , the lack of vitamin D has been linked to heart disease , cancer , infections , and poor health in general .
Data indicates that to reach optimum health , levels of 30 to 40 nanograms per milliliter may be considered necessary .
The authors say , “ Vitamin D supplementation appears to mitigate the incidence and adverse outcomes of these diseases and may reduce all - cause mortality . ”
Still , the present recommendations for supplement levels concentrate mostly on gaining bone health , with 200 international units per day from birth to age fifty , 400 international units per day from age fifty one to seventy and 600 international units from age seventy one and up .
Moreover , less outdoor activities and campaigns urging to reduce sun exposure have lead to vitamin D deficiency , given that sunlight exposure is an important determinant of vitamin D in humans .
Adit A. Ginde , M.D. , M.P.H. , University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine , Aurora , and his team did a comparative study on levels of serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 [ OH ] D , a measurement of the amount of vitamin D in the blood ) collected from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) between 1988 and 1994 , and those collected during NHANES between 2001 and 2004 .
Full records of the participants were available ( 18,883 in the first survey and 13,369 in the second survey ) .
The authors write : “ Overall , the mean [ average ] serum 25 ( OH ) D level in the U.S. population was 30 nanograms per milliliter during the 1988 - 1994 collection and decreased to 24 nanograms per milliliter during the 2001 - 2004 collection . ”
Between the two periods , the incidence of levels below 10 nanograms per milliliter increased from 2 percent to 6 percent .
Fewer individuals had levels reaching 30 nanograms per mililiter or higher ( 45 percent compared to 23 percent ) .
Throughout both surveys , racial and ethnic variations remained : the prevalence of 25 ( OH ) D levels of less than 10 nanograms per milliliter increased from 9 to 29 percent and levels of more than 30 nonograms per milliliter or higher decreased from 12 to 3 percent , for non-Hispanic blacks .
“ These findings have important implications for health disparities and public health , ” the researchers write .
“ We found that the mean serum 25 ( OH ) D level in the U.S. population dropped by 6 nanograms per milliliter from the 1988 - 1994 to the 2001 - 2004 data collections .
This drop was associated with an overall increase in vitamin D insufficiency to nearly three of every four adolescent and adult Americans . ”
The authors conclude : “ Current recommendations for dosage of vitamin D supplements are inadequate to address this growing epidemic of vitamin D insufficiency .
Increased intake of vitamin D ( 1,000 international units per day or more ) – particularly during the winter months and at higher latitudes – and judicious sun exposure would improve vitamin D status and likely improve the overall health of the U.S. population .
Large randomized controlled trials of these higher doses of vitamin D supplementation are needed to evaluate their effect on general health and mortality . ”

Constitution primer
The US Constitution is one of our most remarkable inventions of all time .
A lot of people in other countries think so too .
It is a robust self - correcting legal OS .
But it was written in an arcane code long ago .
To make any sense from it you need some help .
This lively graphic novel adaptation of the Constitution is by far the best aid I ’ve found to deciphering its code .
It is the comic book version , but rather than dumbing it down , it smartens it up .
The graphic novel goes through the Constitution article by article , and explains what each bit means , why it is there , and how it came to be .
Like the Bible , the Constitution does n’t say what you thought it did .
I was surprised what was not there as well as what was .
I learned tons from this annotation , despite studying it in high school .
It renewed my respect for it , and in a way , also makes clear its limitation .
I feel I can be a slightly better citizen .
Best of all , this book does all that with pictures , which makes it a page - turner .
Recently my brother - in - law , who is an immigrant , had a lot of questions about the Constitution .
I handed him this book and he came back very informed .
I gave it to my son who would normally have nothing to do with such boring material .
But it ’s a comic !
You ’ve always wanted to read it , and should .
Here ’s the perfect excuse and ideal method .
If you want the unadorned , raw version , get a pocket version .
This sturdy shirt - pocket - sized one contains both the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence .
I have a few friends who pack this pocket version in their travel bags .
Good conversation starter .

Senator Mike Enzi , Republican member of Baucus ' " bipartisan " team , celebrating his ability to delay and block reform of America 's healthcare system :
This time , Enzi responded .
" If I had n't been involved in this process as long as I have and to the depth as I have , you would already have national health care , " he said .
" Someone has to be at the table asking questions , " Enzi said , showing a flash of passion .
He later quoted a favorite saying : " If you 're not at the table , you 're on the menu . "
" It 's not where I get them to compromise , it 's what I get them to leave out , " Enzi said .

And by a wide margin -- three out of four of Enzi 's campaign dollars since 2003 have come from corporate contributions .
You do n't even have to know the names of the parties at this point .
You can predict how a Senator will vote on any particular bill by checking who has paid them what .
I 'm not sure how the true character of our Senate can be made any more clear .
A software glitch in an optical - scan voting system added nearly 5,000 ballots to the tally of a South Dakota election this week .
The error was discovered only after the election results were called , according to the Rapid City Journal .
The problem occurred when officials combined tallies from optical - scan machines in three precincts in Rapid City in Pennington County .
The tabulation software used to combine the totals added 4,875 phantom ballots to the count .
The system indicated 10,488 ballots were cast when , in reality , only 5,613 ballots existed , indicating that the glitch was n't simply a matter of doubling the votes .
Oddly , no one caught the problem during the initial count .
City election officials had n't bothered to keep a manual tally of the number of ballots cast as voters handed them in and they were scanned into the machines – a procedure designed to catch exactly such a discrepancy .
It was only after someone began to question the high voter turnout for the small election , that officials went back to count the ballots .
" By the time we discovered it and realized the right totals , everyone was at home and in bed , " the county auditor said .
The incumbent in a city council race who appeared to win the race went to bed believing he'd received just 49.96 percent of the vote , which was more than his opponents received but short of the 50 percent plus 1 vote he needed to avoid a runoff election .
A recount found that he actually received 51.8 percent of the votes .
Pennington County uses Auto - Mark machines and tabulation software from Election Systems and Software .
The machines are a hybrid touch - screen and optical scan system .
Voters place a full - size paper ballot into the machine , which is displayed on a touch - screen machine .
They make their choices on the touch - screen , and the machine prints their selections to the ballot and returns it .
The ballot is scanned and tabulated in another machine .
No one in the county election office was available to speak about the issue when Threat Level called .

While Australians might think we speak standard English , newly arrived migrants often struggle with the unusual colloquialisms that make up our everyday speech .
To overcome that language barrier , an Adelaide TAFE teacher has designed a website so people learning Australian English can translate some of the sayings they hear .
" No worries " , " I reckon " , " that 'd be right " , " flat out " and " give it a crack " are just a few of the phrases that leave some new migrants mystified .
The website 's creator , Keturah de Klerk , says learning these Australian phrases is crucial for new migrants to feel part of society , and even to hold down their job .
Ms de Klerk , who teaches English at Adelaide TAFE , says it 's not " coming the raw prawn " or other " bonza " cliched slang that confuses most new migrants to Australia .
She says the words she found the hardest to translate were often the ones in most common usage .
For example , the phrase " I 'm stuffed " has at least three different meanings - " I 'm tired , " " I'm in trouble " or " I 'm full " .
" It 's simple things , like last week I had some great news for my students .
I said , ' guess what ? ' and they did n't know how to answer me , " she said .
" [ And there are others , such as ] ' can you give us a hand ' and ' take your time doing this ' .
" Not to mention just irony and sarcasm , and giving a statement as a question like ' how good is this weather ' - they think that they have to provide an answer . "
And she says Australians have a habit of shortening words , which can confuse new migrants .
" Mozzies , sunnies , chewies , I 'm defo - all these sorts of things , " she said .
Ms de Klerk found students were constantly coming to her for advice on words they had never heard before arriving in Australia , even though they had learnt basic English .
" They would bring in their little tourist book with the lists of all the idioms and slang , but [ it was always ] the colourful stuff - " crikey " , " sheila " and all that sort of thing , which is great but not overly helpful for them , " she said .
' What 's ta ? '
Kavita Anil Gourd , who moved to Australia from India nine months ago , says it has taken time for her to get used to Australian vernacular .
" It is very hard for me because some words like ' hang on ' and ' I reckon ' I never understand , " she said .
" Now I understand a little bit what the meaning of ' no worries ' , 'hang on ' and everything . "
Parvati Bhattarai , who came to Australia from Bhutan , says before doing the course she was constantly confused by Australian colloquialisms .
" They speak English but it is quite different from our tongue and our way of talking , and the most important thing for us is to learn the slang word and to understand the jokes , " she said .
" When I get on the bus and the bus driver say ' ta ' .
Ta sound in my country has a very different meaning , " said Kae Kwon from Korea .
" I tried to get on and he said ' ta ' .
What 's ' ta ' ? "
And it 's not just a matter of understanding casual conversation ;
Ms De Klerk says she knows of some migrants who have lost their jobs because of basic communication barriers .
" We have students who we get qualified and who have the English level to get the job , but ... can't hold onto it because the boss sees them as not getting along socially with everyone , which ... has a high level of importance in Australia , " she said .
" Students were having that problem maintaining their job because they were not feeling comfortable to be social with Australian people at work . "
The Aussie slang classes are now spreading around the country , with other TAFEs introducing similar courses .
Ms de Klerk simply hopes her classes and the e-phrase website help new migrants make sense of Australian sayings that most of us take for granted .

As the US speeds the transfer of detainees in its custody , many appear headed into a notoriously violent system .
Inmates at Abu Ghraib rioted Thursday and Friday .
Baghdad and Baquba , Iraq
In a room thick with heat and sweat , light from a small window falls on rows of squatting prisoners and plastic bags of belongings hung from nails on every inch of the wall .
The guard explains that 74 men live in this room , which is roughly 10 by 20 feet .
A further 85 are usually in the corridor , he adds , while 12 are kept next to the toilet .
This is Hibhib prison on the outskirts of Baquba , the dusty , volatile capital of Diyala Province roughly 40 miles from Baghdad .
It is just one of the prisons in the province where detainees and US forces allege overcrowding , lengthy pretrial detention , and torture used to extract confessions .
While the conditions here may be more severe than elsewhere in the country , Iraq 's national detention system as a whole has been harshly criticized by Western human rights organizations .
A December 2008 report by the New York - based watchdog Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) went as far as to assert a " disturbing continuity " with Saddam Hussein - era detention .
A committee set up by the Iraqi government in June is investigating abuses .
But a lack of accountability and political will , say human rights workers , are serious impediments to reversing the culture of abuse cultivated under Mr. Hussein .
Lt. Col. Shaun Reed , commander of a Baquba - based US infantry unit , often runs up against that culture .
He says it 's hard to change prison workers accustomed to brutality .
" What I consider humane treatment of prisoners , is not what they would consider humane treatment , " says Reed , whose work with Iraqi security forces has exposed him to Iraqi prison conditions .
" If you ask Iraqis what they think � it 's completely different . "
The issue has taken on new urgency as the US dials back its presence in Iraq , accelerating the release and transfer of Iraqi prisoners in its custody .
Most of the prisoners deemed unlikely to reoffend have been released already , which means a higher proportion of the 8,947 remaining as of early September are likely to go to jail , according to Capt .
Brad Kimberly , a US media relations officer .
In the first nine months of this year , more than 5,000 detainees were released , with nearly 1,200 transferred to Iraqi custody , according to Kimberly and other US officers interviewed for this article .
At the current release rate of 750 per month , an additional 1,400 detainees are expected to go to Iraqi jails before the US transfer is completed � probably in August 2010 .
After the exposure of abuses at Abu Ghraib , American officers are eager to point out measures to ensure proper treatment of Iraqi prisoners .
But now it is essential that they take equal care to prevent the transfer of prisoners to a system where there is a substantial risk of torture or mistreatment � an action that violates international law , says HRW researcher Samer Muscati , who travels often to the region .
" In our research over the last couple of years ... we heard credible allegations of torture and mistreatment during initial detention by Iraqi forces , " wrote Mr. Muscati in an e-mail .
" So it will be incumbent on the US to verify conditions in Iraqi facilities that receive such transfers through regular inspections of those facilities by impartial and independent observers . "
Laundry day at Camp Cropper
US officers are endeavoring to do just that , they say .
Every prisoner in US custody awaiting release or transfer to the Iraqi prison system comes through the US - run Camp Cropper detainee facility near Baghdad .
It was laundry day when the Monitor visited recently , and the yellow uniforms were drying in the sun , as detainees played games or sat on gaudy prayer rugs reading the Koran together .
US officers here are eager to offer tours in which they point out the abundant space , art and computer classes , and Ping - Pong and football for the detainees .
" I know the right way and the wrong way to do things , " says Col. John Huey , the commander responsible for the Americans ' three Iraqi internment facilities at camps Cropper , Bucca , and Taji , who has worked with detainees in Iraq since 2003 .
" After Abu Ghraib there were 240 recommendations on detainee treatment . "
But he pointed out the US involvement in Iraqi affairs is " dwindling , " adding , " our responsibility ends when we transfer [ detainees ] to the government of Iraq . "
In an effort to minimize the risk of human rights abuses , says Huey , the detainees are transferred only to nine prisons run by the Ministry of Justice .
Those run by the Interior and Defense Ministries are worse , he said .
However , US soldiers in Diyala were transferring detainees to an Interior Ministry prison when the Monitor was present , and said that this was normal practice .
The Iraqi Correctional Service , whose officers are being trained in a US - run program , operate in Ministry of Justice prisons .
Interior Ministry prisons are run by Iraqi police , according to Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki 's former security adviser Mouaffak al - Rubaie , and accommodate detainees who are awaiting trial .
Ministry of Justice prisons are meant to accommodate prisoners who have been convicted and are serving a sentence .
While the US does n't charge Iraqi detainees , as of early August 1,644 in its custody had either been convicted or were pending hearings or trials in Iraqi courts .
Conflicting reports from prison inspections
Baghdad 's Rusafa prison , which is run by the Ministry of Justice , is the primary recipient of US detainees , says Huey .
" We have inspected and continue to inspect [ it ] . "
His inspection teams , he adds , " go to prisons and inspect and assist them , and they are improving .
We feel very confident about the nine facilities . "
But that does n't jibe with early findings of the Iraqi government committee set up in June � an eight - member group formed after the assassination of prisoner - rights crusader Harith al - Obeidi , deputy chairman of parliament 's human rights committee .
An Iraqi military spokesman told the Associated Press in mid-July that the panel had visited three detention facilities in Baghdad , and that most of the abuse uncovered so far took place in the Rusafa prison .
An Interior Ministry official who was inspecting Diyala prisons told the Monitor that the ministry " sent a committee to visit Rusafa , and it is not good .
It is the same as the jails in Diyala Province , the same breaches of human rights . "
" Yes , there is violence " in Diyala jails , the official confirmed , on condition of anonymity .
" There are violent punishments , they hang them from their arms , beat them with sticks and [ punch them ] , kicking , [ using ] electricity , stubbing out cigarettes on the skin . "
He described a practice , also detailed by former prisoners , in which prisoners are forced to drink water and then prevented from urinating by a method too unpleasant to be described here .
A senior police officer in Diyala , in a separate interview , described similar treatment of his two brothers , who were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of being Al Qaeda members .
They were taken to the Major Crimes Unit , the main prison in Diyala , run by the Interior Ministry .
One was ill , and was beaten and died , he says .
" I found him in the morgue .
I saw his body , with cigarette burns on it . "
There were also marks from beatings , he confirmed .
" They released my other brother because my older brother died and they got scared .
He [ the one who was released ] had been tortured .
He could not walk . "
While it is difficult to confirm individual statements , the governor of Diyala Province , Abdel Nasr al - Mehdawi , acknowledged in a June interview that there were problems of overcrowding and torture in prisons .
He had set up a committee to deal with the problems , he said in June , but they have thus far made little progress .
The anonymous official , meanwhile , says he is part of a separate , ongoing Interior Ministry drive to inspect and improve prisons and was chosen because he was jailed for 20 years under the Saddam regime .
" There are breaches of human rights , " he says , " not enough medication , not enough space ... there are innocents in prison without warrants . "
" In my opinion , " he added , " it is the same as the prisons under the Saddam regime . "
Courts allow confessions made under duress
Most prisoners in Iraq are held for lengthy pretrial detention , and trials often rely on confessions " likely to have been extracted under abuse , " says Muscati , based on HRW interviews with approximately three dozen detainees � published in the December 2008 HRW report , The Quality of Justice .
Departing from international standards , Iraqi criminal law allows evidence extracted under duress to be presented in court , provided that it is consistent with other material evidence in the case , says Hania Mufti , the former chief of the UN's Human Rights Office in Baghdad before leaving in August 2008 .
" A lot of them are scared to go " to Iraqi prisons , says Sgt 1st Class Penny Barber , a US military detainee specialist working in Diyala .
" [ The detainees ] say , ' They are going to beat us , torture us , we might not make it home , ' " she adds .
Recently , she says , she handled a prisoner who knew Iraqi police held a warrant for his arrest , " and he was very scared .
He asked for our help , but there was nothing we could do " because the US is required to transfer all detainees for whom the Iraqi police have arrest warrants .
" These prisons � if you walked in there , you would vomit , " says Col .
Burt Thompson , commander of the 1 - 25 infantry division in Diyala , who visits local prisons as part of a ongoing partnership with local security forces .
" There is no air conditioning ... water is in a trough , there is not a whole heck of a lot of food , there is no hope . "
He visited a prison called Khamees , near Baquba , at the end of last year , and called it a " hell - hole . "
" I could not believe human beings were living like this , " he says .
He has never witnessed torture in an Iraqi prison , though he says he believes that it takes place .
Activists call for independent commission
Iraq 's Ministry of Human Rights [ MOHR ] has documented many cases of prison abuse , but that has done little to reverse the problem , says Ms. Mufti , the former UN human rights chief in Baghdad who also served as director of HRW 's Baghdad office from 2003 to 2006 .
As part of the government , MOHR is " under considerable political pressure to divulge as little as possible and to be mindful not to cross certain red lines , " she says in an e-mail from Amman , Jordan .
In 2008 , for example , MOHR prepared a report on detainee abuse .
Although a press conference was held to discuss its findings and some copies were distributed selectively and confidentially to individuals , government pressure stopped its publication , says Mufti .
" The work of MOHR tends to be rather secretive , particularly when one inquires as to what happens to the torture cases they have documented , " Mufti writes .
" Up until last August when I left Iraq , the ministry 's line was that these cases are referred to a committee within the PM 's office , and from there directives are issued to relevant ministries to take action .
If you try to find out more about this committee , its members , its powers and remit , you would come up against a dead end .
Same goes for other committees that have been set up , including ad hoc investigative committees charged with addressing specific incidents . "
Some have proposed scrapping MOHR and establishing an independent national human rights commission , as provided for under the Iraqi Constitution .
But however secret MOHR is , one thing is clear : letting the problem fester could lead to deteriorating security , says 1st Lt. Michael Horab , assistant operations officer at Camp Cropper .
" If you put detainees back into a crowded , brutal environment , " he says , " then you 're taking guys who might have been mildly against the government of Iraq and making them worse . "
Police Department
A grand jury in Manhattan has voted not to indict a New York City police officer who fatally shot another officer , who was armed and off duty at the time , on an East Harlem street in May , according to Robert M. Morgenthau , the Manhattan district attorney .
The officer , Andrew P. Dunton , who has been on administrative duty since the May 28 shooting , killed Officer Omar J. Edwards , firing six shots on a rainy night .
Neither officer was in uniform ; Officer Dunton was working a plainclothes assignment , and Officer Edwards had just finished a shift .
Officer Dunton testified before the secret panel last week , and the grand jurors have since delivered a “ no true bill , ” meaning Officer Dunton , 30 , will not face criminal charges for the shooting , Mr. Morgenthau said in a statement .
The officer may still face an internal Police Department review that could lead to disciplinary measures .
The shooting of Officer Edwards , who was black , by Officer Dunton , who is white , prompted concern by some public officials and community activists over race relations and stereotypes within the police force .
Several elected officials called upon the Police Department to explore procedures that could help prevent so - called friendly fire and to examine the impact race has on officers ’ decision - making .
After Officer Edwards , 25 , who was assigned to the Housing Bureau ’s Impact Response Team , left work around 10:30 p.m. , he encountered a man trying to break into his car on Second Avenue , near 124th Street , the authorities have said .
A scuffle ensued , and after the man slipped from Officer Edwards ’s grasp , the rookie officer gave chase with his Smith & Wesson 9 - millimeter pistol in hand , the police have said .
Three police officers in an unmarked car , one of them Officer Dunton , saw the men running , and they hopped out of their vehicle , the police have said .
With his gun drawn and crouching behind a door of the car , Officer Dunton ordered Officer Edwards to stop and drop his weapon , the police have said .
As Officer Edwards turned , his pistol was pointing in the direction of Officer Dunton , who then fired , according to the police ’s preliminary account of the events .
Witnesses gave different accounts of whether Officer Edwards ever identified himself as a police officer .
Officer Dunton and responding units did not realize that Officer Edwards was a member of the force until they cut his shirt open as he lay handcuffed and bloodied on the pavement .
Only then did they see a Police Academy T - shirt and find his police shield in a pocket , the police have said .
After decades of pursuing lock - 'em - up policies , states are scrambling to reduce their prison populations in the face of tight budgets , making fundamental changes to their criminal justice systems as they try to save money .
Some states are revising mandatory - sentencing laws that locked up nonviolent offenders ; others are recalculating the way prison time is counted .
California , with the nation ’s second - largest prison system , is considering perhaps the most dramatic proposal -- releasing 40,000 inmates to save money and comply with a court ruling that found the state ’s prisons overcrowded .
Colorado will accelerate parole for nearly one - sixth of its prison population .
Kentucky has already granted early release to more than 3,000 inmates .
Oregon has temporarily nullified a voter initiative calling for stiffer sentences for some crimes , and has increased by 10 % the time inmates get off their sentences for good behavior .

The flurry of activity has led to an unusual phenomenon -- bureaucrats and politicians expressing relief at the tight times .
“ The budget has actually helped us , ” said Russ Marlan , a spokesman for the Corrections Department in Michigan , which increased its parole board by 50 % this year to speed up releases .
“ When you ’re not having budget troubles , that ’s when we implemented many of these lengthy drug sentences and zero - tolerance policies [ that ] really did n’t work , ” he said .
Though prison budgets grew steadily over the last 20 years , a recent survey found that 26 states cut their corrections budgets this year .
The reductions range from the small - scale -- such as putting in energy - efficient lightbulbs -- to sweeping changes like the early releases .
“ States are saying , ‘ We ca n’t build our way to public safety , especially when budgets are tight , ’ ” said Adam Gelb , head of the Pew Center on the States ’ Public Safety Performance Project .
“ For the most part , state leaders are not holding their noses and making these changes just to balance their budgets .
They ’re beginning to realize that research - based strategies can lead to less crime at far less cost than prison . ”

Many states have expanded credit for good behavior .
Others have made legal tweaks , such as raising the minimum amount of damage required for a property crime to be a felony .
Some , like New York , have overhauled long - criticized mandatory sentencing laws that sent nonviolent , first - time drug offenders to state prison .
These efforts , however , have already run into resistance .
In Ohio , a bill to quintuple the time inmates can earn for good behavior stalled in the state Senate over objections from prosecutors and some Republicans .
The bill ’s sponsor , GOP state Sen. Bill Seitz , said that even Democrats in the state House were wary of helping out .
“ They conjure up images of possible Willie Horton ad campaigns , ” said Seitz , referring to the notorious ad that accused 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis of letting a rapist out of prison prematurely .
Advertisement
Still , Seitz has vowed to try to get his bill passed this fall .
He says that a raft of mandatory - sentencing laws left state prisons dangerously overcrowded .
“ We are putting 10 pounds in a 5 - pound bag . ”
Corrections has become the second - fastest - growing item in state budgets , second only to Medicaid .
And , unlike Medicaid and many other programs , states pay for prisons with almost no help from Washington .
In Colorado , 9 % of the state budget goes to corrections .
More taxpayer dollars go to house its 23,000 prisoners than to educate the 220,000 students at Colorado ’s public universities , noted Evan Dreyer , a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter Jr .
The state has gone through severe cuts already this year -- it lopped 10.5 % off of its budget in June .
Ritter later cut an additional $ 320 million and counted on saving $ 44 million over two years by letting 2,600 ex-cons end their probation early and having the parole board consider earlier parole for 3,500 inmates .

A nonpartisan commission recommended the moves in December , and Dreyer noted that inmates eligible for faster parole were already nearing release .
“ These are people who are getting out of prison anyway within six months , ” he said .
The parole board has started considering whom to let out , but Republicans have attacked the plan as too risky .
“ It ’s inevitable these people will commit crimes , ” said state Senate Minority Leader Josh Penry , who hopes to challenge Ritter in next year ’s governor ’s race .
In Oregon , legislators closed a $ 78 - million shortfall in the public safety budget this summer by delaying the implementation of a measure that increases sentences for certain drug and property crimes .
They also raised the credit that inmates get for good behavior from 20 % of their sentence to 30 % , starting next year .

“ We needed to save some money , at least in the short term , ” said state Rep. Jeff Barker , a former police lieutenant .
“ It was n’t easy . ”
Indeed , anti-crime activists are preparing a ballot measure to reverse the changes .
In Kentucky , the budget has been pressed for some time , but it was a finding that the state had the fastest - growing prison population in the country that spurred Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear and the Legislature to act .
The state recalculated the time that convicts who have violated their parole must serve in prison .
If convicts have not committed new crimes and violated only a technical term of their parole ( failing a drug test , for example ) , they are credited for time they spent on parole out of prison before the violation .
Jennifer Brislin , a spokeswoman for the state ’s Justice and Public Safety Cabinet , said officials decided that offenders who do not commit new crimes while on probation deserve some reward .
“ That should be worth as much as sitting on the state ’s dime , behind a fence , ” she said .

State Atty .
Gen. Jack Conway sued to overturn the thousands of early releases , arguing that a retroactive change to sentences is illegal and risky .
The case was heard before the Kentucky Supreme Court in August .
“ To go back retroactively as a budget - saving measure and . . . release violent offenders is , to me , irresponsible , ” Conway said .
Still , Conway said that he too was concerned about the prison population , and that he wanted to bring it down by targeting nonviolent offenders for early release and expanding drug courts .
“ If we ’re going to deal with the issue , ” he said , “ we have to be smart about it . ”

Silver birches are perhaps the most recogniseable of the woodland trees .
It 's a pioneer species which is often found in new areas of woodland .
They grow quick and have several bush craft uses - namely their bark but you can also tap a birch tree in the spring for a fresh sugary drink .
Birch polypore ( Piptoporus betulinus ) is a bracket fungus found often on ( here 's a surprise here ! ) birch or oak trees .
It is quite destructive - parasitic even - and you 'll often find it on already fallen trees or in dying groves of birch trees .
During my morning walk today we found several groves of dying birches - most of which had snapped in half and come tumbling down .
There 's nothing you can do about this , it 's nature clearing the woods for a stronger species .
The fungus starts out budding like a ball , but soon folds over to make a distinctive , smooth rim around the pore surface .
Taking bracket fungus really is n't going to harm the tree or the spore - though you should only ever take what you need .
Its uses go back centuries as a firestarter * , but it can also be used for sharpening razors ( as a strop ) or as we 've said , as a plaster !
* 5,300 years ago ( approx ) a guy named by the researchers as Otzi was murdered in the alps .
Preserved perfectly , among his possessions was powdered birch poly pore which was used in fire lighting
UPDATE : Governor Sanford has been found !
Except he was n't hiking on the Appalachian Trail .
Instead , he was in Argentina .
Perhaps the Appalachian Trail secretly winds its way down to Argentina ?

We 're not suggesting that the formerly missing Governor of South Carolina specifically ditched his family and security detail to go hiking on Naked Hiking Day .
It 's just that one of the days he hit the trail also happened to be the aforementioned holiday .
Until late yesterday , no one would say publicly where he was .
Poof .
He just disappeared .
The story started to resemble a John Grisham novel .
A southern conservative governor and very vocal critic of a popular liberal president eluded his security detail and completely disappeared with his last known whereabouts -- before he ( or someone ) turned off his cell phones -- somewhere outside of Atlanta .
Staff was silent .
Some were talking about succession plans .
The First Lady though said she was n't concerned .
" He was writing something and wanted some space to get away from the kids , " she said .
But many wondered aloud how this traditional , family - loving , Republican governor of a southern state could miss Fathers Day .
After all he 's got four children !
Was something sinister in the air ?
Then it took a Farrelly brothers screenplay type of twist .
Sanford had not disappeared .
According to his spokesman , he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail .
Coincidentally , on Naked Hiking Day .
It 's a big tradition .
Many hikers celebrate the summer solstice by hiking au naturel .
It just so happened the solstice occurred on Fathers Day -- one of the days Sanford was hiking .
Late last night his spokesman , Joel Sawyer expressed remorse for not divulging details earlier .
" The governor is hiking along the Appalachian Trail , " Sawyer said .
" I apologize for taking so long to send this update , and was waiting to see if a more definitive idea of what part of the Trail he was on before we did so . "
If he did participate in the summer solstice celebration ( which we acknowledge is not likely ) , he could get into some real trouble .
Rangers and police warn that people caught outdoors in the altogether could be charged with indecent exposure .
Managers of the Appalachian Trail , where the tradition is sometimes observed by those trekking from Georgia to Maine , also discourage nudity .
" It 's just rude , " said Brian King , spokesman for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry , W.Va .
" People are out there hiking with their kids and families , and there are Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts . "
When will Sanford re-emerge ?
His spokesman gave no details .
" We knew he would be difficult to reach , and that he would be checking in infrequently .
Given the media attention this has generated , we 'll obviously update you once we have some more specifics to pass along , " Sawyer said .
" He ’s an avid outdoorsman , " Sawyer added .
" Nobody ’s ever accused our governor of being conventional . "

Why are all the best poems sad ?
— Your father
That ’s a good question , though I ’m sure not everybody feels that the best poems are sad ; they think that the best poems are the erotic ones by the 14th - century Indian poet Kabir .
But seriously , people tend to think that the best poems are the ones they can understand and identify with , and it ’s not difficult at all to understand and identify with sadness , so it ’s true :
A lot of people think that the best poems out there are the sad ones .
I think that ’s because many societies often encourage overlook feelings of sadness or pain .
Something bad happens , and we are pushed to move on , look to the future and not to the past .
That ’s not necessarily bad ; it ’s society ’s job to mold each member into a productive contributor in the present , and we are n’t very productive when we ’re sad .
But a poet ’s job is to capture emotion , be it humor , eroticism , or grief , and grief often seems the most poignant because we never look at grief as intimately as a good poem does .
And maybe someone does n’t want to look at grief .
Maybe someone thinks that life is too damn depressing as it is and they do n’t need a poem to tell them that .
But poets draw the reader in with lyrical devices and concise language , so that when a person sees a short poem called “ Saint Monday , ” she ’d probably read it because she just had a horrible Monday herself and she might think that the poem will make her cast Mondays in a whole different light .
Saint Monday
Without a raincoat I can not go out looking for work so I sit in the kitchen looking at old snapshots :
She thinks , “ Yeah , that ’s pretty good .
I remember moments when I did that , ” so she continues to the next stanza .
the dead at parties or at the beach , you nude at three reading the New York Times !
Love , it is winter :
It started off sad , but she is compelled by the rhythms and the concise language , and she ’s so surprised by this precocious child !
She reads on .
the summer broke us .
I might find work before next Sunday so we can take a stroll with money in cold weather .
( Alan Dugan )
Then she realizes how truly sad that poem is , how much it resonates in these days of humid summer and dire finances .
But instead of being dispirited , the poem lifts her up .
Sad poems shake us up in a way that makes us more attuned to life , its unfairness and challenges , its beauty and preciousness .
If you ’re wondering ( and I know you are ) why only the best poems are sad , but not necessarily the best movies , scores , or novels , I would have to say that that ’s your personal choice , but if I needed a better response than that ( and I know I do ) I would say that poems are processed temporally , as are films , music , and other forms of the literary and performance arts , but they are so much more concise .
You read a sad poem , and almost instantaneously you feel its sadness in your gut .
You perhaps nod your head or mutter a heart - felt “ Aw . ”
The heart is a muscle , and if our muscles grow bigger after we break them down , then the heart also grows bigger with each heartbreak — the heart grows bigger every time we read a poem that opens us up to another facet of sadness .
Often it hurts , but we know that it ’s good for us , just like we know that leg lifts or five - mile runs are good for us , but they hurt , too , and as we get older , they really hurt .
Poets are like personal trainers , but nobody pays most poets for the exercises they design , and when we say , “ You are not using ‘ The Waste Land ’ to optimize your growth , ” people think we ’re crazy .

" I am an invisible man .
No , I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe ; nor am I one of your Hollywood - movie ectoplasms .
I am a man of substance , of flesh and bone , fiber and liquids — and I might even be said to possess a mind .
I am invisible , understand , simply because people refuse to see me .
Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows , it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard , distorting glass .
When they approach me they see only my surroundings , themselves , or figments of their imagination — indeed , everything and anything except me . "
SAN FRANCISCO , Aug. 21 - Edward Vazquez Jr. , 6 , has numerous educational tools at his disposal .
He learns math from flashcards and the alphabet from a popular electronic gadget called the LeapPad .
But when it comes to instruction , the family 's personal computer sits dormant .
" He has a lot of toys for learning -- not the computer , " said his father , Edward Vazquez , 28 , a waiter in San Francisco .
One reason , Mr. Vazquez said , is " you do n't see a lot of that software . "
That statement would have been unthinkable a few years ago .
In 2000 , sales of educational software for home computers reached $ 498 million , and it was conventional wisdom among investors and educators that learning programs for PC 's would be a booming growth market .
Yet in less than five years , that entire market has come undone .
By 2004 , sales of educational software -- a category that includes programs teaching math , reading and other subjects as well as reference works like encyclopedias -- had plummeted to $ 152 million , according to the NPD Group , a market research concern .
