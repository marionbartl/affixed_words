A new programme from the world 's largest single buyer of condoms could boost rubber tapping and reduce deforestation , says Conor Foley from Green Futures , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Brazil 's reputation as a " sexy country " dates back to the seminal work of Gilberto Freyre , who wrote a rather idealised account of how its sensuous and promiscuous past had produced a beautiful inter-racial population .
Although the country 's shocking levels of contemporary inequality and violence cruelly mock his central thesis of a ' racial democracy ' , the ' sexy Brazil ' image lives on .
It 's there in Rio 's famous carnival , in the beautiful bodies in bikini - floss that adorn its beaches and , more darkly , as home to one of the world 's largest prostitution and sex trafficking industries .
But Brazil has also developed a highly effective anti-HIV / AIDS campaign , which is widely credited with having prevented the type of epidemic that has devastated other developing countries .
It 's succeeded despite the wrath of the Catholic Church , of the previous US Administration – which made health funding conditional on countries signing ' morality pledges ' – and of the big drug companies , whose patents Brazil has flouted to bring down the cost of antiretroviral drugs .
In the face of such criticism , Brazilian officials refused to change their approach , arguing that a key part of their success has been because they deal in an accepting , open way with high - risk groups .
The Director of its national AIDS programme famously rejected the US Government 's restrictions as " theological , fundamentalist and Shiite " .
The Brazilian Government is the largest single buyer of condoms in the world , importing around a billion of them every year .
These are promoted using high profile advertisements and a variety of outlets targeted to reach at - risk groups .
Most recently , the Government has started to include condoms in the basic basket of goods that it distributes for free to low income families as part of its strategy to combat hunger .
This serves a double purpose , since there is a clear link between family planning and poverty reduction .
When the Pope visited Brazil two years ago , President Lula took the opportunity to speak out strongly in favour of sex education and proper provision of contraception for teenagers .
In 2008 , the Government announced the start of a new programme to produce condoms using environmentally sustainable rubber , which will curb its dependence on imported contraceptives , provide jobs for local people and help preserve the world 's largest rainforest .
It opened a new factory , located in the northwestern Acre state , which will produce 100 million condoms a year .
The latex comes from the Chico Mendes Reserve , named after the celebrated conservationist and rubber tapper who was killed by ranchers in 1988 .
Tapping rubber has long been a traditional way of life for many in the Amazon .
It is sustainable because it does not kill the trees , but the rubber is more expensive than oil - based synthetic products , which have driven down prices and put rubber - tappers out of business .
By contrast , the condom project is both environmentally and economically sustainable .
It will provide an income to around 550 families and reduce the incentives for deforestation .
The Government says the condoms are the only ones in the world made of latex harvested from a tropical forest .
Similar schemes are also being developed to produce and market handbags and purses from sustainable rubber .
Treetap , for example , has patented a latex , which it sells under its own brand name , certifying that its goods are produced from natural rubber on a fair trade basis .
The company has placed rainforest preservation at the centre of its business plan , and works closely with the Rubber Tappers Association which Mendes founded .
' Sexy Brazil ' is an already established brand , and if the Government 's sustainable condoms project proves successful domestically , then they could become a product for export .
After all , who could refuse a longer - lasting Brazilian orgasm ?

WASHINGTON  With tensions over Iran ’s nuclear ambitions hitting new levels , the United States is mounting a diplomatic full - court press in the Middle East , sending four top diplomats , including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , to confer with Arab and Israeli leaders .
The envoys ’ visits to Israel , Lebanon , Syria , Jordan , Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Qatar were planned separately in recent weeks , but they now have a common purpose , administration officials said : to reassure Iran ’s neighbors that the United States will stand firm against Tehran , and to enlist other countries in a global effort to put pressure on the Iranian authorities .
Mrs. Clinton will play a central part in the effort , leaving Saturday for Qatar and Saudi Arabia , where she will meet with the Saudi leader , King Abdullah .
Officials said she was expected to press the Saudis to reassure China that Saudi Arabia would offset any disruption in oil shipments that could occur if Beijing were to back new United Nations sanctions against Iran .
China , which has major investments in Iran ’s oil and gas industry , has been the main holdout in the American - led effort to impose tougher sanctions against Iran through the United Nations Security Council .
[ Note : I 'll be appearing on David Sirota 's radio show Tuesday at 8:35 am PST to discuss Beck and his attacks on progressives . ]
It 's been pretty interesting watching Glenn Beck ratchet up the eliminationist rhetoric in his attacks on progressives in the past couple of months .
The storyline , as you may have gathered , is that the " progressive movement " is the root of all evil in American politics , a " cancer " and a " virus " and a " parasite " that has " infected " both parties .
Beck has been doing a lot of fake " history " reporting when it comes to these attacks -- indeed , it tells you everything you need to know that he considers Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson as the presidential wellsprings of this Great Evil .
Well , as we observed some time back , there 's a great deal of real history that Beck has to omit from his narrative in order to make these claims stick -- particularly the reality that progressive politics created the great American middle class consumer society that he and other right - wingers take for granted now , not to mention the conditions for average Americans before the arrival of progressive politics .
But one of the most interesting omissions from Beck 's parade of progressive evils is one of the real achievements of progressive politics in the past half - century -- namely , the advancement of civil rights for minorities , beginning with the civil - rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s .
These movements ended Jim Crow and made life better for millions of nonwhites , and created a more just and civil society along the way .
And you know , civil rights was a progressive cause .
It still is .
The opposition ?
It has always -- ALWAYS -- been conservatives .
Yet all the time Beck has been bashing progressives , he has simultaneously been hosting shows with audiences of black conservatives wherein they sit around and complain about how mean liberals are to them for being conservative and Beck gets to ask dumb white - guy questions like : " Why not identify yourself as Americans ? "
Even more to the point , in both of these shows , Beck has glowingly quoted Martin Luther King -- who was , you know , a leader in the progressive movement .
So here 's our question for Glenn Beck :
If the progressive movement , as you claim , has been so relentlessly evil and has consistently taken America down the wrong path , what about civil rights ?
Was Martin Luther King secretly evil too ?
Should we return to pre-progressive policies -- you know , the " separate but equal " status quo of Jim Crow and segregation ?
Indeed , your hatred of the " progressive movement " and its effects on American life raise a whole host of similar questions about your views on civil rights .
And we 're just wondering .

Nialler9 is a great example of a blog with an international readership that promotes an otherwise largely undocumented local music scene .
It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that if sites like this shutter , musicians from Ireland will get less exposure and be much worse off .
In a way this should come as no surprise as here in the states ASCAP and BMI have gone as far as asking that iTunes and other music stores pay performance royalties for the 30 second preview clips consumers play to entice them to purchase a full track .
If you can ask for performance royalties for that than in theory anything is open game .
In the grand tradition of self - defeating ideas like DRM , lawsuits against music fans and anachronistic pricing models comes the latest idea from the music biz : collecting royalties from music blogs .
The Irish Music Rights Organisation ( IMRO ) has approached 3 music blogs , including Nialler9 , to request the annual payment of hundreds of pounds to cover performance royalties .
There 's a good write up over at the Guardian .
Like many mp3 blogs , Nialler9 posts mp3s with permission from copyright holders looking to promote gigs and full album downloads .
But according to a Q&A between IMRO and nialler9 this does n't matter :
--
Nialler9 : If tracks are provided to bloggers with permission and are cleared for promo from bands , labels are these covered by this or are these outside the licence ?
IMRO : According to IMRO , if an artist , composer or publisher has registered with IMRO ( or PRS in the UK / ASCAP in the US ) , then the MCPSI - IMRO ( LOEL ) licence must be obtained .
Furthermore , if a composer , artist or publisher has done this , then they do not have the right to give full permission to allow their own track to be downloaded on a site .
--
But the silliest part of the exchange comes later :
--
Nialler9 : Is it because Nialler9.com is hosted in Ireland or does it matter if a server is registered here or not ?
IMRO : It does n’t matter .
If the site is made available in Ireland then a licence is required .
--
Will Pitchfork now need to pay up or stop posting mp3s by all Irish bands that signed up with IMRO ?
Or is IMRO proposing that Ireland erect the equivalent of the great firewall of China to keep all the music blogs out ?

Aftermath of 9/11 : Study Shows Firefighters ' Breathing Problems Never Went Away Study finds rescue workers at Sept. 11 had lung problems seven years later .
April 7 , 2010  --
More than seven years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , rescue workers still had trouble breathing after they inhaled from the cloud of dust that enveloped southern Manhattan , a new study concludes .
Doctors conducted a seven - year study of members of the New York City Fire Department who responded to the World Trade Center attacks between Sept. 11 and Sept. 24 , 2001 .
The researchers were able to include 91 percent of the responding workers -- a total of 10,870 firefighters and 1,911 EMS workers .
By 2008 , the rescuers who had significant declines in lung function a year after the attack had still not recovered , and the recorded drop in lung function was about 12 times the rate seen in normal aging .
The research was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine .
" Exposed people want to have answers .
Not just for themselves but for entire group , " said Dr. David Prezant , senior author of the study and Chief Medical Officer of the Office of Medical Affairs , for the New York City Fire Department ( FDNY ) .
" I was at 9/11 and was exposed myself . "
Prezant teamed up with doctors from New York University , Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , among others , to track the workers exposed during the 9/11 attacks .
He said the partnership between the fire department , management and doctors in New York gave the study advantages over other research that has tried to assess health problems caused Sept. 11 , attacks .
" Every worker in our study is a proven exposed worker , " said Prezant .
Fire departments often use the same lung - function test from Prezant 's study in physicals firefighters need to pass to stay on the job -- so unlike many other studies on the topic , these researchers had access to lung - function tests given to firefighters before 9/11 to compare to the tests after the attack .
Prezant also did n't have to recruit for study subjects from the general public , which might have skewed the results .
Major Study on Breathing Problems of 9/11 First Responders
" Our study is not influenced by selecting the most ill or least ill , " said Prezant .
Overall , the study showed the proportion of firefighters with below - normal lung function went from 3 percent before the attacks to 18 percent after .
Eight years later that number stabilized at 13 percent .
" We take these answers and immediately translate them into monitoring and treatment initiatives , " said Prezant .
Doctors , politicians and lawyers have all looked to previous studies as a call , not only for better treatment , but better prevention too .
" The 9/11 terrorist attack resulted in an unprecedented environmental disaster .
The urgency of the search and rescue efforts led to first responders not being diligent in protecting themselves from the dust cloud by wearing properly fitted respiratory protection , such as disposable NIOSH N95 masks , " said Dr. James Sublett of the American College of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology .
" An emphasis on worker protection would have likely ameliorated the type of permanent lung damage demonstrated in this follow - up of the firemen and EMS workers , " said Sublett , who is section Chief of Pediatric Allergy at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky .
Lung specialists who reviewed the study said the damage to the rescue workers at Sept. 11 exceeds the usual smoke damage from fires .
" The decrease is much greater than that observed with historical smoke and dust exposure and appeared to permanently reduce lung function , " said Dr. Mark Gladwin , chief of Pulmonary , Allergy and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
" There was an expectation that this would improve in the overall cohort , but this did not happen . "
However , doctors pointed out that the study did have a silver lining .
Although the firefighters and EMTs did not recover during the study period , they did n't get worse after the first year .
" While recovery does not appear to have occurred to any significant degree , the good news is that after the original damage to lung function the rate of lung function loss returned to the normal range , " said Dr. Neil Schachter , the medical director at the Respiratory Care Department at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City .
" The event had not caused an accelerating loss of lung function , as has been the case with some exposures , " he said .

Confession and repentance are not among the Christian virtues practised by the pope .
He has apologised for the rape of children by Catholic priests in Ireland ; but this is one of the few paedophilia scandals now shaking the church in which neither he nor members of his inner circle were involved .
He condemned the Irish bishops ' " grave errors of judgment " and " failures of leadership " , but of his own grave errors and failures – in Munich , Wisconsin and California – he says not a word , except to dismiss the issue as " petty gossip " .
His response to this scandal reminds you of the origins of the verb to pontificate .
Shut out of his closed , self - regulated world , the victims of sacerdotal rape could only rage in frustration .
Until now .
Over the weekend , the authors Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens announced that they 've asked lawyers to prepare a case against the pope .
Recently , in the Guardian , Geoffrey Robertson , the barrister they are consulting , explained that senior churchmen who protected paedophile priests , swore their victims to secrecy and allowed the perpetrators to continue working with children , committed the offence of aiding and abetting sex with minors .
Practised on a large scale , this becomes a crime against humanity recognised by the international criminal court .
This is the general Vatican policy over which the then Cardinal Ratzinger is accused of presiding .
When Benedict comes to the UK in September he could , if Dawkins and Hitchens get their warrant , be arrested .
At last we are waking up to what international law means .
For the first time in modern history the underlying assumption of political life – that those who exercise power over us will not be judged by the same legal and moral norms as common citizens – is beginning to crack .
International law is the belated reply to one of the oldest surviving aphorisms in the English language .
There are half a dozen versions , but the best known is this : " They hang the man and flog the woman / That steals the goose from off the common /
But let the greater villain loose /
That steals the common from the goose . "
This is the way we thought it would remain .
The powerful were licensed by our expectations to carry on committing great crimes , while their subjects were punished for lesser offences .
No longer .
Picture the pope awaiting trial in a British prison , and you begin to grasp the implications of the radical idea that has never yet been applied : equality before the law .
At the same time as Dawkins and Hitchens laid out their case , the barrister Polly Higgins challenged our perceptions of what legal equality means .
Last Friday she launched a campaign to have a fifth crime against peace recognised by the international criminal court .
The crime is ecocide : the destruction of the natural world .
The laws of most nations protect property fiercely , the individual capriciously , and society scarcely at all .
A single murder is prosecuted ; mass murder is the legitimate business of states .
Only when these acts are given names – genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes , crimes of aggression – do we begin to understand their moral significance .
The same applies to nature .
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 criminalises anyone who " intentionally picks " a single flower from a protected plant .
But you can grub up as many as you like as long as it's " an incidental result of a lawful operation " .
Pick a buttonhole and you could find yourself in the dock .
Plough out the whole habitat and the law can't touch you .
Higgins gives some examples of ecocide : the tar sands mining in Alberta , the Pacific garbage patch , the pollution of the Niger Delta by oil companies .
She points out that ecocide is rarely a crime of intent , but in most cases an incidental consequence of other policies .
Company directors or politicians could be prosecuted individually , but instead of being fined they would be charged for the restoration of the natural systems they 've damaged .
The purpose of criminalising ecocide is to raise the costs of trashing the planet to the point at which it ceases to be worthwhile .
This is the obvious outcome of a wider understanding of legal equality : why should private property be protected while the common wealth of humanity is not ?
International law as currently applied is often described as victors ' justice : the only people who get prosecuted are those who lose the wars they fight with powerful states .
It 's not even that .
Last week we learned that about 50 suspected war criminals or human rights abusers are living in Britain .
Among them are alleged torturers who worked for Saddam Hussein 's government , one of Robert Mugabe 's henchman , a member of Sudan 's Janjaweed militia and a gruesome collection of Afghan warlords .
But the police have been given no budget to investigate them and the Crown Prosecution Service has no resources with which to pursue them .
So , while shoplifters are sent down , alleged mass murderers walk freely among us .
So much for the prime minister 's promises .
A month ago , after Tzipi Livni , the former Israeli foreign minister , cancelled her visit to Britain for fear of being arrested under a warrant obtained by human rights campaigners , Gordon Brown wrote an article for the Telegraph in which he proposed to stop private prosecutions for crimes against humanity .
Brown maintained that the warrant was supported by only " the slightest of evidence " , and that those seeking Livni 's arrest had " set out only to grab headlines " .
But the evidence for the crimes against humanity to which Livni has been linked – laid out in the Goldstone report and elsewhere – is massive , detailed and hard to dispute .
Brown went on to make another statement that was plainly false : " Britain will always honour its commitment to international justice .
The police here remain ready to investigate cases ; the Crown Prosecution Service to bring them ; the courts to hear them . "
His government has rebuffed calls to set up a specialist war crimes unit and failed to produce a dedicated penny for the prosecution of war crimes suspects .
Then he explained his real purpose in seeking to prevent private actions .
People like Livni , he said , represent " countries and interests with which the UK must engage if we are not only to defend our national interest but maintain and extend an influence for good across the globe " .
Britain , in other words , will not investigate or prosecute its allies .
His article demonstrated the opposite of what he set out to show : that if there is a case for prosecuting foreign dignitaries visiting this country , the authorities will take care of it .
Without private actions of the kind that Dawkins and Hitchens hope to launch , equality before the law remains an empty threat .
Brown 's desperate wriggling over the Livni case suggests that governments are beginning to grasp the shocking implications of what they have signed up to .
It 's time we did the same .
There 's a promise implicit in international law : the end of the age of exceptions .

Hipsters are dead .
Long ( ? ) live Fauxhemians .
A full 34 % of you people picked " Fauxhemian " in our five - way poll yesterday , totally pissing coke - tainted piss on the runner - up slur , " Doucheoisie , " which scored 23 % .
At long last , our halfhearted search for a slur to replace the tired " hipster " has come to a fruitful conclusion .
Thanks to you , the blackhearted Gawker commentariat .
Everyone give yourself an irony - infested pat on the back .
How are we to use this new slur ?
A few examples :
On the subway : " Stop stepping on my shoes , you fey Fauxhemian bitch . "
At the nightclub : " Dude , the whole place is full of Fauxhemians .
I mean the girls are hot , but whatever . "
Self - referentially : " No way .
You 're a Fauxhemian , Fauxhemian . "
In the New York Times : " A new term has been coined : ' Fauxhemian . '
The year is 2013 , and this is the New York Times Style section . "
In any situation : " Whatever , Fauxhemian . "
Today is a great day .

The following video is the best illustration I have ever seen of how chimpanzees hunt together in coordinated fashion , with different individuals having different roles .
It combines both on - the - ground video and overhead infrared to illustrate just how this group of chimpanzees manages a successful hunt of colobus monkeys .
Incredible footage !
( If it does n’t play , try going directly to the You Tube clip . )
Christophe Boesch has spear - headed the research to document hunting roles among chimpanzees .
He published on cooperative hunting in a 1994 Animal Behaviour article ( pdf ) and discussed hunting roles , meat sharing , and learning more specifically in a 2002 Human Nature article ( pdf ) .
Craig Stanford is another researcher who has focused on hunting by chimpanzees .
He has written this online essay , The Predatory Behavior and Ecology of Wild Chimpanzees , which is an excellent overview of what we know about chimpanzee predatory behavior .
John Mitani has also published on why male chimpanzees hunt and share meat ; in 2002 John also provided an overview about recent developments in the study of wild chimpanzee behavior .
I posted more video on chimpanzee behavior , including hunting , just this week – so check that out for more footage .
For what chimpanzee hunting means about our own evolution , we have two contrasting views – hunters vs. being hunted .
Craig Stanford has a 2001 popular book The Hunting Ape : Meat Eating and the Origins of Human Behavior .
That book should be tempered by the more recent Man the Hunted : Primates , Predation and Human Evolution .
Ellie Goulding is one lucky girl , she seems to be receiving one amazing remix of her work after another .
This time the good stuff comes from a Philidelphia based duo comprised of Chiddy ( emcee ) and Xaphoon Jones ( DJ / producer ) who gloriously combine elements of indie and electronica with some hard - hitting rap .
Chiddy Bang are currently following up from their debut album with their new effort entitled “ Air Swell ” .
The lead track from the album is a remix of Ellie Goulding ’s “ Under The Sheets ” .
It is a fantastic song , whilst also being aÂ real departure from some of the other Ellie Goulding remixes I have posted up on here previously .
Enjoy .

I am but Muslim lite , a non-conformist believer who will not be told what and how by sanctimonious religious sentinels for whom religion is a long list of rules to be obeyed by bovine followers .
Readers know I am often critical of Muslim people and nations .
Bad things that happen to us cannot all be attributed to " Islamophobia " , a nebulous and imprecise concept that , like anti-Semitism , can be used to besmirch and sully and silence criticism .
But this week even I , even I , can see that for the British establishment Muslims are contemptible creatures , devalued humans .
As I prayed before starting this column I felt tears stinging my eyes and my face was burning as if I had been slapped many times over .
Do they expect me to turn the other cheek ?
Millions of other Muslims must have felt what I did .
And some may well go on to do things they should n't .
Their acts will intensify anti-Muslim prejudices and will be used to justify injustice .
The cycle is vicious and unrelenting .
Once again at weddings and birthday parties , in quiet , tranquil mosques , at dinner tables across the land , including those of millionaire Muslims , I am hearing murmurs of trepidation and disquiet – voices kept low , sometimes vanishing into whispers , just in case ; you never know if they will break down the door .
These people are , like myself , well incorporated into the nation 's busy life .
Some own restaurants and businesses , others work in the City or law firms and chambers .
At one gathering a frightfully posh , Muslim public school boy ( aged 14 ) , an excellent cricketer , said in his jagged , breaking voice : " I will never live in this country after finishing my education .
They hate us .
They 'll put us all in prison .
Nothing we do is OK .
Do you think I am wrong Mrs Yasmin ? "
No I do n't , though his hot young blood makes him intemperate .
Where do I start ?
Well , with the PM who takes himself to the moral high ground at every opportunity , to orate and berate as he did when called in by the placid Chilcot panel .
The son of a preacher man , John Ebenezer Brown , Gordon has the manse gene .
Unlike the shape - shifter Blair , he is authentically himself , driven by embedded values , and I admire that .
But , like his predecessor , he is shockingly indifferent to the agony of the people most affected by the Iraq war , a war Brown still says was " the right " thing to do for the " right reasons " .
His only regret ?
They should have thought a bit more about what to do next after they had defeated Saddam and pulled down his statues .
Not a word about the countless Iraqis killed when we bombed indiscriminately in civilian areas , no word of sorrow , however hollow or feigned , about the dead children or those now born in that blighted land with two heads and other grotesque abnormalities .
John Simpson 's recent BBC report described the rising number of such births in Fallujah , picked for the cruelest collective punishment by America .
Are they not children , Mr Brown ?
You still cry for your own baby , who died so young .
For Muslims , that only confirms native Iraqis are grains of sand to those who executed the imperial war .
Martinique intellectual and liberationist Aimee Cesaire wrote : " Colonisation works to de-civilise the coloniser , to brutalise him ... to degrade him . "
We saw how with Brown , whose empathy is withheld from Iraqis , Muslim victims tortured with the connivance of our secret services and perhaps from all citizens who pray to Allah .
Meanwhile at Isleworth Crown Court , Judge John Denniss is industriously sentencing demonstrators who gathered near the Israeli embassy to rail against that state 's attack on Gaza , one of the worst acts of state terrorism in recent history .
Our government said nothing then , and were therefore complicit .
Protesters came from all backgrounds but the vast majority of those arrested were young Muslim men .
Dozens are being sent down for insignificant acts of bravado .
Some were about to go to university , to train as dentists and the like .
Their homes were raided , families cowed and terrified .
Joanna Gilmore , an academic expert on public demonstrations , says never before have such disproportionate sentences been handed out , not even with the volatile anti-globalisation protests .
Denniss intends his punishments to be a deterrent .
To deter us from what ?
Having the temerity to believe we live in a democracy and are free to march ?
And then the crypto- fascist , Aryan Geert Wilders , is invited into the Lords by UKIP and crossbench peers to show his vile anti-Islam film in the name of freedom of expression .
Freedom my arse .
It is just another entertaining episode of Muslim - baiting .
I dare the same peers to now invite David Irving , the Holocaust denier , to share his thoughts freely in the Lords , and get Omar Bakri over from the Lebanon with films of himself making fiery speeches on what to do with infidels .
Again Muslims are made to understand that different standards apply to others .
We are on trial , always , and always must expect to lose .
I am here accusing the most powerful in government , parliament and the judiciary , not those individual MPs , peers and judges who try to do the right thing .
To them we are immensely grateful , and to the extraordinary lawyers , activists , journalists , artists , writers and ordinary Britons fighting ceaselessly for our liberties .
We just witnessed Helena Kennedy in court passionately defending Cossor Ali , accused of providing active support to her convicted terrorist husband .
The jury , scrupulously fair , bless them , acquitted the young woman .
Muslims involved in crime and violent Islamicism must be tried and punished .
But their acts do not give lawmakers and law keepers of this land licence to strip the rest of us of our humanity and inviolable democratic entitlements .
The Government Accountability Office Punk ’d Energy Star recently by submitting fake products and companies for certification .
The Environmental Protection Agency ’s arbiters of efficiency standards rubber - stamped 15 out of 20 bogus products and a handful of fake firms became Energy Star Partners .
Here are three of our favorite fabrications .
1. Tropical Thunder Appliances
To perform this investigation , the Government Accountability Office ’s ( GAO ) March 26 , 2010 , report states that it “ used four bogus manufacturing firms and fictitious individuals to apply for Energy Star partnership … ”
Dummy websites emblazoned with Energy Star Partnerships remain online for each of the four front companies — Cool Rapport ( HVAC equipment ) , Futurizon Solar Innovations ( lighting ) , Spartan Digital Electronics , and Tropical Thunder Appliances .
2. The Feather - Duster Fly - Strip Air Freshener
Ostensibly an indoor air purifier , this item is actually a standard space heater spangled in strips of flypaper , with a feather duster perched up top .
The product was submitted without a standard safety file number from the Underwriters ’ Laboratories .
Plus , the product ’s website did not include a disclaimer required for Energy Star certification .
Last but not least , the garish photo submitted with the product ’s application portrays what is clearly a feather duster rigged to space heater .
Nevertheless , these obstacles proved surmountable — the product was approved in 11 days and became listed on the Energy Star website …
3. The Gasoline - Powered Alarm Clock
On the application for Energy Star certification , this product ’s description stated that “ the item is the size of a small generator and is powered by gasoline . ”
The GAO never devised an image of this piece of nonexistent indoor power equipment , which would presumably make enough noise to temporarily wake consumers before carbon monoxide fumes sent them back to sleep for good .
The dimensions are listed as 18 inches tall , 15 inches wide and 10 inches in depth .
“ Gas - powered clock radio is sleek , durable , easy on your electric bill , and surprisingly quiet , ” the product ’s marketing description states .
Boris Johnson tonight begged Britons to stick with his coronavirus plan as he warned that a ' more costly ' second full lockdown cannot be ruled out .
At a No10 press conference ( pictured main ) with Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance , the PM said it was too early to judge whether the Rule of Six and pubs curfew introduced over the past fortnight were working .
And he said that letting the virus ' take its course ' risked overwhelming the NHS and many more deaths .
But in a nod to rising anxiety about the consequences of restrictions , Mr Johnson said he intended to update the public more ' regularly ' in the coming weeks .
He said the country was at a ' critical moment ' as cases continue to rise ( pictured top right ) and deaths ( bottom right ) are now following suit along with the numbers of people being admitted to hospital .
Presenting data that splits the country clearly into the worst - and least - affected areas ( pictured inset , a map showing areas with the highest infection rates in the darkest shades ) , the picture painted by officials confirms that the North West , North East and West Midlands are bearing the brunt of England 's second wave so far , but Sir Patrick Vallance warned it would be ' wrong ' to believe it was n't a national problem .
The lines outside the burger and pizza joints dotting the “ Boardwalk ” at Kandahar Air Base remain defiantly long , despite recent reports that it may be shut down .
The air base in southern Afghanistan is NATO ’s largest in the country and the main landing spot of the US troop surge .
Its entertainment district – a square kilometer of fast food franchises , cafes , electronic stories , basketball courts , the occasional live rock concert , and a Thai massage parlor until it was shut down by authorities – serves some 25,000 military personnel and contractors on the outskirts of Kandahar .
“ I think it ’ll bring down morale , ” says Sgt. Michael Masterton , a US soldier on leave from one of the frontline bases in Kandahar ’s hinterland as he bites into a cheeseburger and fries at the Mamma Mia Pizzeria , an outpost of Italiana and red-and - white - checked tablecloths .
“ For those of us who come down from the FOBs [ forward operating bases ] it gives us something to do . ”
“ Are people back home really upset over us being able to have a burger ? ” asks Col.
Don Groves , head of operations at Kandahar Airport , shaking his head in disbelief .
“ Do they really consider that we have it easy in this war zone ?
Essential goods ?
The Boardwalk came under scrutiny last year , when the top US commander in Afghanistan , the famously spartan Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , dispatched a team here to investigate if it was essential for maintaining troop morale or if it was hampering shipments of fighting supplies such as Humvees and M - 4 rifles .
The need for war materiel is set to grow in coming months , with some 5,000 additional troops and support staff due to arrive this summer to help carry out a major military campaign in Kandahar Province .
“ This is a warzone , not an amusement park , ” wrote Command Sgt. Maj .
Michael Hall on a NATO blog posting in February .
“ Supplying nonessential luxuries to big bases like Bagram and Kandahar makes it harder to get essential items to combat outposts and forward operating bases , where troops who are in the fight each day need resupply with ammunition , food and water . ”
Fast food joints at risk include Burger King , Pizza Hut , and Dairy Queen , although burgers and such will still be available at military canteens .
Not just burgers
The Boardwalk ’s nightly patrons and workers , however , see additional benefits of the entertainment center .
With troops from so many countries , the Boardwalk is “ a gathering place where you get to meet people from other nationalities , ” says Donna Perry , a Canadian contractor who enjoys watching hockey games in the evening as she munches on pizza .
When it comes to food , though , she admits , there ’s little cross-cultural experimentation .
At the Canadian doughnut franchise where she works , Tim Horton ’s , British soldiers overwhelmingly opt for the Toffee Coffee while the French flock to the French Vanilla flavorings , she says .
The Boardwalk offers a taste of local culture , too .
Small shops , which will not be closed , sell Afghan memorabilia such as “ war carpets ” woven with fighter - jet and Kalashnikov patterns .
“ Business is good .
The Boardwalk ’s a very nice place , ” says Wali Jan , a salesman at the Afghan Toys and Gift Shop .
An Indian employee at the metal container doubling as a Burger King temporarily stops taking orders when told the place might shut down .
“ I came all the way from India for this job , ” he says , disconsolate .
“ I have no idea what I would do if the order came to shut us down . ”
With its scent of greasy fries and burger meat , the Boardwalk may serve another vital purpose : covering up , when the winds are right , the smell of the nearby “ Poo Pond ” half a mile away where the base ’s human waste is disposed .
“ The smell , you become used to it quite quickly , ” says one British soldier who did not want to give his name .
According to the Guinness Book of Records , the Cassowaries are the world ’s most dangerous birds , capable of dealing fatal blows .
They are very unpredictable , aggressive creatures , especially if wounded or cornered .
The Cassowary lives in the rain forests of Australia and New Guinea and are actually pretty shy animals if undisturbed , but if you get to close and it thinks you ’re a threat you could receive a bone - breaking kick or get sliced by its dagger - like sharp claws .
During WWII , soldiers stationed in New Guinea were warned to stay away from these birds , but some of them still became victims .
The Cassowary is also one of the most difficult animals to keep in the Zoo because of the frequent injuries suffered by Zoo keepers that look after them .
I like a bird that can take care of itself , but , unfortunately , this does n’t seem to help it very much against human cruelty and it is on the endangered species list , along with so many others …
My father died , in the city of his birth , New York , at 3:50 EST this afternoon .
Though the financial constraints of his youth made college infeasible , he accomplished the near - impossible , becoming an architect licensed in 40 states .
Much of his work was commercial , for a series of shoe store chains and department stores .
There was a time in the 1970 ’s when nearly all of the Baskin - Robbins outlets in the country had been built to his design , and under his direction .
Through much of my youth and my early adult life , it was almost impossible to be anywhere in this country and not be a short drive to one of “ his ” stores .
My Dad was predeceased last year by my mother , Marie , his wife of nearly 60 years .
He died peacefully after a long fight against the complications that ensued after successful colon surgery last September at the New York Presbyterian - Weill Cornell Medical Center .
My sister Jenna and I were at his side , and I was reading him his favorite James Thurber short stories , as he left us .
I ca n’t say enough about Dr. Jeff Milsom and his team at the hospital , and all of those physicians and nurses and staffers in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit who looked after my Dad all this time , and kept him in their hearts .
And I feel the same way about all of you who have expressed your best wishes and prayers to him , and to me , and to our family .
My Dad was my biggest booster .
A day after I was hired by CNN in the summer of 1981 as a two - week vacation relief sports reporter , I traveled by train to my childhood hometown , and walked from the station towards my folks ’ house .
I was stopped half a dozen times before I got to my Dad ’s office by people congratulating me on my impending television debut .
There was , of course , only one way they could have known .
My Dad , the press agent .
Of course it was he and my Mom who took me to my first Yankees games ( even though my father nursed a delightful grudge against the team for trading away his favorite players , Steve Souchock and Snuffy Stirnweiss – in 1948 and 1950 ) .
But as my interest in the sport began to take the shape of a dreamt - of career , it was my Dad also sacrificed family vacations so we could buy ever more tickets to Yankee games .
When we could afford both games and vacations , four times those vacations were to Spring Training .
He was my inspiration , and will always remain so .
His bravery these last six months cannot be measured .
He is as much my hero now , as he was when I was five years old .

An Israeli man has been imprisoned for 10 years for tricking women into sexual acts by claiming his semen was holy and had healing powers .
Nissim Aharon , a former employee at the Israeli defence ministry , was convicted of rape , sodomy , indecent acts and aggravated fraudulent acquisition .
Women paid him large sums of money , believing he was a holy rabbi who could heal body and soul , the court said .
Judges called his actions " monstrous " , exploiting " women young and old " .
The sentence was the result of a plea bargain , and was handed down at Petah Tikvah district court .
Under it , Aharon will also have to pay 100,000 Israeli shekels ( $ 26,866 ) to each of five women who filed the complaint against him .
' Holy fluid ' Aharon , who was arrested last August , " over many years presented himself as a righteous man , as a saint with healing powers , who exploited the naivity of women and teenage girls , while carrying out appalling sexual acts and obtaining large sums of money by fraud , " the Israeli Justice Ministry said in a statement .
He would claim to be a rabbi , and impersonate figures in authority who would then refer women and teenage girls to himself , the ministry said .
" He would give these people different explanations : among others , that a holy scent comes from him , and that his semen is a holy fluid , which by contact could heal body and soul , " the statement said .
He would also claim that his " holiness " could be passed to those who touched him physically , cleansing their bodies , it said .
Aharon also pretended that he worked in posts in the security establishment , including for the Israeli intelligence services Mossad and Shin Bet , the ministry said .
" His behaviour is despicable and even monstrous , " the judges said .
" There are no words to describe the ugliness of his actions ...
The sexual offences are severe and numerous .
" His sexual appetite could not be satisfied .
There were no means that he would not use in order to exploit women young and old , " the judges said .

Steve Jobs has dubbed Google 's " do n't be evil " mantra " bullshit . "
Or at least " a load of crap . "
According to multiple reports , Jobs unloaded on Google last week during an Apple " town hall " meeting at the company 's One Infinite Loop headquarters .
As originally reported by Wired , the Apple cult leader attacked his former Mountain View ally for its recent entry into the phone - selling business , before landing an unprompted blow on Google 's much - discussed " do n't be evil " corporate motto .
" We did not enter the search business , " Jobs said in reference to Google .
" They entered the phone business .
Make no mistake : they want to kill the iPhone .
We wo n’t let them . "
According to Wired , an Apple employee then popped up with a completely unrelated question , but Jobs was n't done with Google .
" I want to go back to that other question first and say one more thing , " he said .
" This ' Do n’t be evil ' mantra :
It ’s bullshit . ”
But other reports insist Jobs did n't actually say " It 's bullshit . "
According to the Apple - obsessed Daring Fireball blog , he said : " ' Do n't be evil ' is a load of crap . "
Until sometime last year , Apple and Google were chums .
Google chief Eric Schmidt spent three years on Apple 's board .
Google was installed as the default search engine on the Mac and the iPhone .
And according to some , the two tech giants even had a unwritten agreement not to poach each other 's employees .
But in August , Apple announced Schmidt 's departure from its board , with Steve Jobs saying that Schmidt 's effectiveness would be " significantly diminished " now that Google is offering its own mobile operating system , Android , and building its own netbook operating system , Chrome OS .
The two also sparred over Google Voice - Mountain View 's new - age telephony app - as Apple refused to let it onto the iPhone , and according to a recent report from Business Week , Apple has now gone so far as to have discussed a search tie - up with former arch-rival Microsoft , a deal that would see Google removed as the Jesus Phone 's search default .
After hearing Steve Jobs ' anti-Google diatribe at last week 's town hall - held in the wake of Apple 's iPad announcement - you can't help but wonder if these Redmond talks were sparked by Google 's Nexus One phone , introduced on January 5 .
Google says it did n't design the phone 's hardware - HTC did - but the Nexus One carries the Google brand and Google is selling the thing from its very own online store .
A week before Jobs ' town hall rant , Schmidt was asked during Mountain View 's quarterly earnings call about Google 's relationship with Apple .
As you might expect , he played down the rift between the two companies .
" I , as a former board member , have a special spot for Apple in my heart - but I will tell you Apple is a very well - run company , " he said .
" They have a lot of very good stuff coming .
We have a couple of very good partnerships with them and we also compete with them in a couple of areas .
My guess is that is a pretty stable situation for awhile . " ®
Bootnote
During last week 's town hall , Jobs also took a swipe at Adobe Flash - still absent from the iPhone and apparently absent from the iPad as well .
" They are lazy , " Jobs allegedly said of Adobe .
" They have all this potential to do interesting things , but they just refuse to do it ... Apple does not support Flash because it is so buggy ...
" Whenever a Mac crashes more often than not it ’s because of Flash .
No one will be using Flash ... The world is moving to HTML5 . "
You could be hearing Isaac Asimov and Douglas Adams in a whole new way , if you happen to be in New York on March 5 .
The Pinchbottom Burlesque is organizing " Naked Girls Reading Science Fiction . "
( NSFW pic below the fold . )
The event takes place at " the plush and decadent upstairs lounge at Madame X in Greenwich Village , " and costs $ 25 .
Among the readers is Nasty Canasta , who has been known to dress up as a naughty version of both the fourth and tenth Doctors from Doctor Who .
( We we wrote about the Pinchbottom Burlesque previously — link includes NSFW pics . )
Tor.com attended one of their previous events , devoted to banned books , and wrote :
The effect on the crowd , mostly couples , was intoxicating .
During the erotic readings , there were hoots and hollers .
When Jo Boobs read a shockingly explicit passage from 1748 's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure , involving two women holding a third 's legs wide apart for the pleasure of a young man , the catcalls came loud and fast .
But during the non-erotic readings , the audience fell into rapt attention .
Gal Friday 's staccato , deadpan reading of American Psycho was an electric thrill of watching a broken mind at work .
But the performance of the night belonged to Sapphire Jones , who read the Death of Snowden scene from Catch - 22 .
Standing tall and straight as a lamppost , with light inflection and perfect rhythm , Sapphire evoked the bleak sorrow of Yossarian 's inability to save , or even comfort , the dying Snowden beyond feebly repeating " There , there .
There , there . "
That she was tall , trim , and not wearing a stitch of clothing meant very little by the end of her reading , compared to the stark beauty of Joseph Heller 's devastating prose .

The event is an offshoot of Naked Girls Reading , a series started in Chicago and featured on various TV shows .
Besides Asimov and Adams , they say featured authors will include Aldous Huxley and H.G. Wells — but here 's hoping they include some female authors too , since it 's a bit odd to have naked women reading only works by men .
( I 'd like to nominate Octavia Butler 's Kindred , and maybe some Le Guin . )

With the permission of his parents , Peter conducted a video - game shopping survey around Sydney 's CBD on behalf of The Sun-Herald .
He visited six retailers , picked out games with an MA 15 + classification , then strolled up to the counter .
Five out of six shops handed him graphic games involving murder , mass shootings , stabbings , drug dealing , sexual violence and child abductions .
The results of our investigation outraged family lobby groups , who say not enough is being done to crack down on the practice .
'' Our biggest concern with the proposed R18 + rating is children are going to get their hands on these products regardless and there 's nothing parents can do about it , no matter how responsible they are , '' says Barbara Biggins , chief executive of the Australian Council on Children and the Media .
'' The shops are being derelict in their duties .
If the respective state governments do n't come down hard on this , what message does it send ?
What 's the point if the enforcement end of the spectrum is n't working . ''
Interactive Games and Entertainment Association chief executive Ron Curry agrees that obligations must be fulfilled at the point of sale - '' and , more widely , that everybody is educated about the rating system in place ' ' .
Mr Curry said if an R18 + rating - for adults only - was introduced , there would be ' 'less confusion . ''
The absence of the rating has seen 74 video games banned in Australia since 1995 .
'' If you 'd told me you 'd been into six specialist games shops and they 'd sold the games , I 'd be very surprised , '' Mr Curry says .
'' When it comes to mass merchants , there can be a high turnover of staff [ and ] employee moves between departments , and there is potentially a lack of continuity in terms of education and knowledge of what the classifications actually mean .
That said , there is no excuse . ''
Peter says he has mates his age who play the same restricted games he bought .
'' Games like these are becoming more and more lifelike , '' he says .
'' If you play this sort of stuff regularly , the violence , the killing , the drugs and everything , I guess it just becomes normal . ''
Research suggests exposure to violent games makes people more aggressive , less caring children - regardless of their age , sex or culture .
A review of 130 studies on the subject - covering more than 130,000 young gamers worldwide - found exposure to violent video games was a causal risk factor for increased aggressive thoughts and behaviour and decreased empathy .
Lead researcher Craig Anderson , from the Centre for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University , says such effects are neither huge nor trivial .
'' If you have a child with no other risk factors for aggression and violence , and if you allow them to suddenly start playing video games five hours to 10 hours a week , they 're not going to become a school shooter , '' he says . '' [ But ] it 's a risk factor that 's easy for an individual parent to deal with - at least , easier than changing most other known risk factors for aggression and violence , such as poverty or one 's genetic structure . ''
NSW Attorney - General John Hatzistergos has warned retailers that selling restricted games to minors is a criminal offence .
Those caught selling MA15 + computer games to someone under the age of 15 face fines up to $ 5500 for sole traders and $ 11,000 if trading as a company .
Selling RC ( Refused Classification ) games to minors carries a maximum of two years ' jail or $ 16,500 fine for sole traders , or a $ 33,000 fine for a corporation .

" The government takes breaches of classification compliance laws seriously and has given police full authority to enforce laws dealing with this offence , '' a spokeswoman for the Attorney - General says .
'' Members of the public who witness retailers selling restricted games to minors are encouraged to report this criminal activity to police .
A national review of computer game classification laws is currently in progress and work is also under way to develop proposals to improve compliance by retailers . "

The Episcopal Church confirmed its first openly lesbian bishop on Wednesday , six years after its first openly gay bishop took office .
" I am profoundly grateful for the many people ... who have given their prayers , love , and support during this time of discernment , " Bishop - elect Mary Douglas Glasspool said after learning she'd won support from the majority of her church 's standing committees and diocesan bishops .
" I am also aware that not everyone rejoices in this election and consent , " she continued , " and will work , pray , and continue to extend my own hands and heart to bridge those gaps , and strengthen the bonds of affection among all people , in the Name of Jesus Christ . "
Glasspool , 56 , was elected bishop of the Episcopal Church 's Los Angeles diocese in December .
Before taking office , she needed to win the consent of a majority of the church 's standing committees and diocesan bishops .
The Episcopal diocese of Los Angeles released an informal tally Wednesday showing that Glasspool had received consents from 63 of the Episcopal Church 's 110 standing committees , seven more than necessary .
Glasspool 's ordination and consecration as bishop is slated for May 15 .
Glasspool will be the first woman to lead the Episcopal Church in Los Angeles .
" [ T ] he standing committees and bishops have demonstrated through their consents that the Episcopal Church , by canon , creates no barrier for ministry on the basis of gender and sexual orientation , among other factors , " said Jon Bruno , Los Angeles ' current Episcopal bishop .
The Episcopal Church emphasized Wednesday that Glasspool , like its first openly gay bishop - Gene Robinson of the diocese of New Hampshire - is in a committed long - term relationship .
Robinson 's election unleashed a major controversy within the church , which claims 2 million American members .
Dozens of parishes and a handful of dioceses have broken away from the Episcopal church in protest since then .
Some have reorganized under more conservative African provinces of the Anglican Communion .
The daughter of an Episcopal priest , Glasspool was ordained in 1982 .
The Episcopal Church serves as the North American province of the Anglican Communion , the world 's third - biggest Christian body .

The university experience has been enriching , exciting , and energizing , Carlson said .
But now , the teenager is experiencing an adult - style face - off , a real - world blip in the rocket - like trajectory of his academic career .
The university has balked at his request to go to South Africa , even after his mother , Jessica Offir , offered to pay her own way as a chaperone .
“ He grasps really complicated subjects and applies them , ’’ said Carl Schlichting , the professor who taught that course .
“ It ’s a skill that most of us learn , and he ’s just got it very early in life . ’’
Carlson does not play video games , does not listen to pop music , plays classical piano , and is fond of cribbage and chess .
When he took an introductory biology course as an unofficial student at age 9 , he got an A on the tests .
“ Ask a 13 - year - old if they want to hang out with me , and the answer is a definitive no , ’’ he said .
“ He ’s undergoing puberty right now , and kids in school have been through that already , ’’ said Tobias Landberg , a doctoral student and mentor .
“ But socially he fits in very well , probably better than he would in middle school . ’’
If not 18 , Carlson looks older than his age .
But at 5 - feet - 8 and only 112 pounds , with braces and owl - rimmed glasses on a long and slender face , Carlson does not resemble the typical UConn student .
He bears an uncanny resemblance to Harry Potter .
He has also butted heads with the university over its refusal to let him accompany a science class on a field trip to South Africa this summer .
The issue has thrust him into the national spotlight .
Carlson , who is as assertive as he is articulate , is enrolled in the honors program at UConn , where he has been taking classes since he was 9 .
He socializes with “ green ’ ’- conscious students at Eco House , commutes from home , and has plotted a determined path toward a doctorate in environmental science and a law degree .
“ I have the emotional maturity and composure of an 18 - year - old , ’’ Carlson said , twirling a strand of hair from his tousled auburn mop .
“ I do n’t have that much common ground with people my age . ’’
Carlson , who had been nervous about the test , probably could have spared himself the anxiety .
The Coventry resident carries a 3.9 grade - point average , is excelling in a double major , and is described in superlatives by his professors and academic advisers .
STORRS , Conn . — Colin Carlson , a gangly University of Connecticut sophomore , hustled across a campus lobby to greet a friend with loud high - fives and a broad , beaming grin .
Carlson had just scored 100 on a midterm exam on the evolution of green plants .
He was ecstatic to the point of giddiness .
“ If it ’s too risky for me to go to South Africa , then it ’s too risky for anyone to go to South Africa , ’’ said Carlson .
Carlson said the barrier smacks of age discrimination , the university is n’t commenting , and the youth ’s lawyer is comparing the confrontation with high - profile cases from the civil - rights era .
“ This makes me feel how the first black students must have felt after being integrated into the University of Alabama , ’’ said Carlson ’s lawyer , Michael Agranoff .
Carlson , as a result , said he feels diminished and disrespected .
The family has filed a complaint with the university ’s Office of Diversity and Equity .
“ My entire academics and everything about me can be overturned by a two - digit number , ’’ Carlson said with a sigh .
Still , he is pressing ahead with the optimism one would expect from a 13 - year - old .
And he and his mother are laying alternative plans for a different field trip to Africa .
“ The university is n’t able to comment on issues involving pending litigation or claims , ’’ said Michael Kirk , the UConn spokesman .
However , he added , “ the safety of the students is really our first concern . ’’
Offir , a widow with a doctorate in social psychology , believes the case reflects a social prejudice against dramatically accelerated education for unusually gifted students .
Her son , who began taking university courses after the fourth grade , ranks in the top .01 percent in intelligence , Offir said .
“ Some kids do n’t crawl ; they just get up and walk , ’’ said Offir , who cut short a question that sought to compare Carlson with his 13 - year - old “ peers . ’’
“ We prefer the term ‘ age - cohort . ’
They ’re not his peers , academically or socially , ’’ Offir said .
“ Public schools , no matter how good the institution , would n’t be able to accommodate his abilities . ’’
Carlson and another 13 - year - old are the youngest students in the University of Connecticut system , Kirk said .
Nationwide , he also is an extreme rarity , said Bill McClintick , former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling .
“ I think most of us in the profession would not recommend this for most kids unless they ’re very special , ’’ said McClintick , who is director of college counseling at Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania .
“ I think they have to have some exceptional academic ability that simply outpaces what ’s available in their local school system . ’’
Carlson ’s ability to live at home and the support he receives from his mother improve his chances for a successful college experience , McClintick said .
So far , Carlson said , he feels accepted by students at the university , particularly those who share his passion for the environment .
And he does not spend any time wondering what he is missing in the world of his age - cohorts .
“ You could I say I could be missing out on certain activities , ’’ Carlson said , “ but you could also say that about every college student who drinks or has unprotected sex . ’’
To Carlson , life these days is one big research laboratory filled with endless and captivating possibility .
And , unlike many undergraduates , he is not distracted by issues of romance .
There is no girlfriend , Carlson said with a smile , but there is “ a work in progress . ’’
Offir , however , said she is confident that the age difference is enough to keep her son focused on his studies — for now .
In any event , she added : “ Colin has good taste in girls .
I ’m not worried . ’’

First discovered by a German astronomer 180 years ago , it is the first close - up image of an eclipse beyond the solar system to be captured on camera by scientists .
Astronomers at the University of St Andrews , who collaborated in the international study , describe the find as a ‘ terrifying image ... like something from a Tolkien book ’ .
St Andrews physicists Ettore Pedretti and Nathalie Thureau are members of an international team led by Brian Kloppenborg at the University of Denver .
The group combined the light of four telescopes more than 300 metres apart to capture a magnified image of the giant star undergoing a ‘ stellar eclipse ’ .
The star , Epsilon Aurigae , is the fifth brightest star in the constellation Auriga , which is known as ‘ the charioteer ’ .
Every 27 years Epsilon Aurigae becomes two to three times dimmer , with the dimmed light lasting about two years .
The phenomenon was first observed in 1821 by the German astronomer Johann Fritsch .
Using an instrument created at the University of Michigan , astronomers have for the first time imaged a peculiar binary star eclipse that happens once every 27 years .
The resulting image , roughly 140 times sharper than those provided by the Hubble Space Telescope , provides new insights into the distant stellar system , even though the effect of the eclipse is so big that the star almost disappears from view .
Dr Pedretti said , " From the image , we can confirm that the eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae is caused by a thin disc of opaque dust trailed by a massive and unseen companion .
Like David , tiny particles of dust are able to kill the light of this ‘ Goliath ’ star .
“ It resembles an image from a book by J.R.R. Tolkien .
It is like seeing the vessel of the sun , guided by the Maya Arien , being swallowed by the dragon Smaug and plunging Middle Earth in a second - age of darkness .
It is a terrifying image " .
The innovative light - combining technique used to view the star is called optical interferometry .
Dr Pedretti built the infrared camera used to take superfast ‘ snapshots ' of the combined light of four telescopes .
It has to be very fast in order to ' freeze ' the image against the turbulent atmosphere .
Dr Thureau was responsible for the design of some critical optics that combine the light from the four telescopes .
She commented , " With this image we have solved an 180 year old mystery .
Astronomers have been puzzled for more than a century about this star and we took two pictures that may finally solve the mystery .
In fact we will continue to capture images since the eclipse lasts about two years . ”
Dr Pedretti and Dr Thureau aim to form the first group in Scotland which will build instruments for optical and infrared interferometry , exploting their high - resolution images .
" Our aim is to exploit existing interferometers around the world in order to take detailed pictures of distant and interesting astronomical objects that are not achievable even with the largest single telescopes , " explained Dr Pedretti .
The research , which involved the Universities of St Andrews , Denver , Georgia State and Michigan , is published in this week 's issue of Nature .

IN 1968  when Alice Waters had just graduated from Berkeley , when Paula Wolfert was studying couscous in Tangier , when Diana Kennedy was writing recipes after years of research in Mexico  another young woman , this one from the Irish Midlands , went to work at a peculiar new restaurant on the southern coast of County Cork .
“ I had heard that there was a farmer ’s wife running a restaurant in her house , serving Irish food and writing the menu every day depending on what was in the garden , ” said the woman , Darina O’Connell Allen .
“ You ca n’t imagine how revolutionary all of that was at the time . ”
None of these women knew it , but they would all pursue the same radical culinary goals : to break the stranglehold of French haute cuisine in the English - speaking world ; to cook seasonal food , grown sustainably ; to cook with respect for traditional home cooks and simple , excellent dishes .
“ It had to happen , the return to cooking , ” said Myrtle Allen , the “ farmer ’s wife ” who took on Ms. Allen at Ballymaloe House and later became her mother - in - law .
“ People do n’t just throw away an entire food culture after centuries . ”
For Immediate Release
WASHINGTON – Libertarian Party ( LP ) Chairman William Redpath issued the following statement today in response to President Barack Obama ’s State of the Union address :
“ Tonight ’s speech was a reminder that , for decades , the policies of Republicans and Democrats alike have failed .
Libertarians are asking people to take matters into their own hands .
Instead of just complaining , we ’re encouraging ordinary Americans to step up and run for Congress on the Libertarian Party ballot line .
“ I can say exactly the same thing about President Obama ’s speech tonight that I said about George W. Bush ’s State of the Union speech in January 2008 : ‘ Tonight ’s State of the Union address went much as expected .
Instead of calling for a more limited role of the federal government in American society , the President laid out plans that would only increase the government ’s intervention into the realm of economics , health care , education and foreign policy . ’
“ I am weary of the President ’s unspoken premise that only government–indeed , only the federal government–can accomplish good in our society .
“ President Obama seems to be totally blind to the concept that government can cause problems rather than solve them .
His speech was filled with ‘ More ’ : more handouts , more spending , more programs , more bailouts , more regulations .
We Libertarians want less government , not more .
“ Not to be outmatched by the Democrats , the Republican Party conveyed its lack of seriousness in addressing this nation ’s government spending problems by having Bob McDonnell , Virginia Governor for eleven ( 11 ) days , deliver its rebuttal to the President .
If they were really serious about addressing the dire fiscal circumstances of this nation , they would have had Paul Ryan , a six - term congressman from Wisconsin , who has proposed the most serious plan of anyone in the two older parties to keep us from going off a fiscal cliff .
“ Last week , Alan Auerbach , Professor of Economics and Law at UC Berkeley and US government fiscal policy expert , said that the Democratic and Republican parties are in a ‘ death embrace ’ with their government spending .
The only political party that is rationally and forthrightly addressing the need to cut government spending and end our culture of ever expanding entitlements is the Libertarian Party .
“ As Americans lose hope in Obama , we Libertarians are warning voters against running back to the Republicans who got us into such big messes in the first place .
Republicans started the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Republicans made the false intellectual case for bailing out banks and car companies .
Republicans argued that deficits do n’t matter .
Republicans gave us the giant Medicare expansion bill .
“ The President ’s suggestion of a ‘ spending freeze ’ was especially ludicrous and insulting to the intelligence of Americans .
The amounts involved are minuscule , and Congress wo n’t accept them anyway .
Will Obama sign the spending bills that ignore his ‘ freeze ’ ?
You bet he will .
Instead , the President should demand across - the - board cuts in all areas , including entitlements .
“ The President talked a lot about jobs .
Unfortunately , the policies he supports are responsible for most of the unemployment we see today .
High taxes , minimum wage laws , hiring regulations , firing regulations , mandatory unemployment benefits , and other government interference make it much more difficult for businesses to hire and keep employees .
As expected , the President ’s prescription is to increase the dosage of this government poison .
“ While our nation is declining dangerously right now , a turnaround could be straightforward and simple with steps like these : 1 . Bring our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan ; 2 . Stop rewarding failed companies with bailouts ; 3 . Cut taxes and spending and let the free market work .
“ Finally , on the matter of political rhetoric , I call upon the two older parties to stop spoon feeding politics to the American people as if we are a bunch of overgrown children .
These are difficult times that call for more than rhetorical flourish or positioning a group of diverse people around a politician .
Older party politicians need to be specific about their proposed policies , as Libertarians are .
“ And , I know I ’m probably just wasting electrons , but ca n’t we go back to the days in which the President sent a copy of his speech to Congress and left it at that .
The speech last night took 1/7000th of an entire year .
I think the vast majority of the American people would agree that we have better ways to spend our time . ”
William Redpath has served as the Chairman of the Libertarian Party since 2006 .

The LP is America ’s third - largest political party , founded in 1971 .

The Worlds of Power ...
" Come with me children !
Into literature ! "
... are not a series of novels about fighting Time Barons by somebody named K. Alexander Lexington - Pierce !
No , they are a series of books produced in the early 1990s by a man named Seth Godin who wanted to lure children away from video games and into literature by turning some of the Nintendo Entertainment System 's best cartridges into stirring epic narrative .
Sure , you 've played " Bases Loaded " and " Blaster Master . "
But have you read the novels ?
For each book , Godin would first play the corresponding game and would then arrange a 40 - page story bible about the game , cobbling together game vocabulary , story logic , and noting down key narrative events .
Then he would turn around and farm out this work to his stable of writers , the most prolific of whom was a man named Peter Lerangis who would only take about four weeks to put together a working draft .
There were 10 Worlds of Power novels : 1. Blaster Master2 . Metal Gear3 .
Ninja Gaiden4 .
Castlevania II : Simon's Quest5 . Wizards & Warriors6 .
Bionic Commando7 . Infiltrator8 .
Before Shadowgate9 .
Bases Loaded10 .
Mega Man 2
The books were all published by Scholastic ( book clubs !
Harry Potter ! ) under the pseudonym " F.X. Nine , " so that they would be next to " Nintendo " on the shelves .
I 've only ever read " Metal Gear . "
All I remember about it is that Solid Snake does n't smoke or use guns .
He collects weapons mainly so that nobody else can use them , like a teacher taking toys away from bad children .
The climax is him beating up 60 guys one by one in a dark room .
Here 's a bunch of videos of guy reading the entirety of Mega Man 2 ( the novel ) beside an enchanted fireside .
And here 's the audio track of this performance in case you 'd rather listen " on the go . "
From a pretty good article about the " Worlds of Power " books over at " 1up.com " : " Adapting these games from the TV screen to the printed page provided several narrative and logistical challenges .
These challenges ranged from explaining exactly how an energy capsule replenished the hero's health to dealing with death and violence in games where characters blasted , zapped , or blew up their foes . "
" The most challenging title for Lerangis to write was also the first in the series : Blaster Master .
Citing the game 's lack of a strong middle plot , he had to invent many details to flesh out the story and connect the game 's beginning and ending .
His work did not pass unnoticed .
In the PlayStation sequel Blaster Master : Blasting Again , Lerangis ' novel is used for backstory .
The character Eve was a creation of the novel and did not appear in the original NES game .
This makes Blaster Master the only title in the Worlds of Power series that has been accepted as official canon .
( Lerangis only discovered the " canonization " of his work upon being contacted for this feature , but found it to be " quite an honor ! " )
" The Worlds of Power books were immodestly successful , selling into the millions .
Which provokes the question : how come there are n't more novelizations of video games , or novelizations of other aspects of daily life in general ?
Why are adaptations only vertical , terminating at " film " ?
Adaptations should be a circle , where everyone has a chance to profit off of some damn idea that people like for no discernible reason .
Novels are much cheaper and easier to produce than films and video games : you would think the market would be flooded with knock - off novelizations of everything from " Mario Party " to " Half - Life " to " a good Snickers bar .
" Things to novelize : 1 ) .
American Idol and other reality games .
There are many opportunities here for narrative structure .
People 's entire lives could become Horatio Alger stories .
Or , instead , the final episode could be turned into a Ulysses - style stream of consciousness jaunt through television , fame , and song .
Worlds of Idols ? 2 ) .
Famous YouTube Videos .
Do people own the rights to their own public shame and misfortune ?
If not , then there are some lucky novelists out there who ought to cash in .
You 've already got your climax : the three minute clip of whatever - the - fuck .
The trick is to build to that climax , and then build PAST it .3 ) .
Coffee shops , restaurants , and bars .
Just start writing the shit down that people say !
And then sell it , later , to the people in that same bar or coffee shop .
People want their own lives to be dramatic and important .
Add motivation .
Add torrid secrets and strange love affairs .
Starbucks would love to carry " Starbucks " the novel .
The last ten pages could be a job application . 4 ) .
The news .
People have been adapting this one for years , but not EVERY FOUR WEEKS .
That 's a really fast fucking turnaround .
Would n't you want to buy the novel of last month 's news -- this month ?
Is n't that how you would prefer to consume your information about how the world is changing and why ? 5 ) .
Clothing , hammers , and other dry goods .
The best way to sell something is to make it real .
The only way to make something real is to give it a story .
Do you want to buy the granola that you know literally nothing about , or do you want to buy the granola with its own novel ?
Do n't you want to buy the granola that has suffered and triumphed ?
Really , the Worlds of Power books only worked because back then kids were n't allowed to have video games in school , so reading some cheap novel about them was as close as you could get .
Then there were those kids who did their book reports about Worlds of Power books and who then grew up to run companies and draft domestic policy while the rest of us were weeping about poor Charlotte and trying to figure out why God is such an asshole .
Although , if you think about it , " Infinite Jest " is kind of like " Tetris " the novel .
And " Charlotte 's Web " is very similar to " Metroid . "
Maybe Charlotte 's
Web just needs a new cover and a new title .
Rebranding , is what they call it .
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - U.S. Hispanics and Democratic lawmakers furious over Arizona ’s harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants expect huge weekend rallies across the United States , piling pressure on President Barack Obama to overhaul immigration laws in this election year .
People hold signs as they protest against Senate Bill 1070 outside the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix , Arizona April 25 , 2010 .

Protest organizers said on Wednesday outrage over the Arizona law -- which seeks to drive illegal immigrants out of the state bordering Mexico -- has galvanized Latinos and would translate into a higher turnout for May Day rallies in more than 70 U.S. cities .
“ The marches and demonstrations are going to be far more massive than they otherwise would have been , ” said Juan Jose Gutierrez , a Los Angeles rally organizer who runs an immigration assistance company .
The backlash began on Friday after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed into law a measure that requires state and local police to determine a person ’s immigration status if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” they are undocumented .
Critics say it is unconstitutional and opens the door to racial profiling .
Republican backers of the law say it is needed to curb crime in the desert state , which is a key corridor for drug and migrant smugglers from Mexico .
A Rasmussen Reports poll on Wednesday found that almost two - thirds -- 64 percent -- of voters in the state favored the measure .
The crowds on the streets , from Los Angeles to New York , could be the biggest since 2006 , when hundreds of thousands of marchers urged former President George W. Bush to overhaul of federal immigration laws .
He tried , but failed in Congress .
“ With what ’s going on in Arizona we see renewed energy for folks to fight for immigration reform , ” said Marissa Graciosa , of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement , an organizer of rallies and vigils on Friday and Saturday .
In Washington , a diverse group of more than two dozen lawmakers -- Hispanics , blacks , Asians , whites -- held a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday to denounce the Arizona law as a violation of civil rights .
“ What Arizona has done is that it has galvanized , united , fortified , focused our immigration movement , ” Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez declared at the news conference .
MEXICAN TAXI BOYCOTT
The Arizona law has catapulted the immigration issue back to the front and center of U.S. politics in this congressional election year , and ratcheted up pressure on Obama to keep a pledge to Hispanics to pass comprehensive immigration reform .
“ It is going to allow us to ultimately say -- when all is said and done -- that this was the clear pivotal moment , ” said Gutierrez , who is head of the congressional Hispanic caucus ’ immigration task force .
U.S. Senate Majority leader Harry Reid , who faces a tough re-election battle in Nevada where Latinos helped clinch victory for Obama in 2008 , said on Wednesday he would work to pass energy legislation before tackling immigration reform , although both are seen as election - year long shots .
Passing an overhaul offering a path to citizenship for many of the 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the United States would consolidate support for Democrats among Hispanics , the country ’s largest minority , but would run the risk of energizing Republican opposition to Democratic lawmakers in swing states and districts .
Arizona ’s bold move reverberated well beyond its borders , sparking calls for economic boycotts and celebrity interventions .
Colombian - born pop star Shakira said she will travel to Phoenix on Thursday to help campaign against the new law , and would meet with Mayor Phil Gordon , police and Latino families .
She sought a meeting with Governor Brewer but was turned down , her publicist said .
Adding to calls to shun the state , Saint Paul , Minnesota , Mayor Chris Coleman on Wednesday banned publicly funded travel to Arizona .
The state law set a “ dangerous example to the rest of the country , ” he said , by creating a culture that made racial profiling acceptable .
The National Conference of State Legislatures said similar state immigration enforcement laws may be proposed in Georgia and Texas in coming months , following a summer recess .
In Mexico , where the government has warned its citizens living in or traveling to Arizona that they could be harassed , taxi drivers organized their own peculiar boycott .
“ We do n’t give service to gringos from Arizona , ” was the phrase some Mexico City taxi drivers painted in white on their rear windows .
The Mean Girls star had arrived in India to film an expose of child labour and trafficking of women which was later broadcast on BBC3 , but she provoked a row when she claimed to have personally rescued 40 children .
Artist Michel Gagne 's stunning Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet will be coming to consoles , thanks to developer Fuelcell Games and Microsoft 's Xbox Live Arcade service .
Why is this important ?
Because this game looks amazing .

The confirmation of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet 's platform likely wo n't come as much of surprise to those who have closely followed the game 's development .
Gagne , Fuelcell and Microsoft have been hashing out this arrangement for the better part of a year .
As someone who was thoroughly impressed by the game 's 2009 trailer , I can't wait to get my hands on it .

Unfortunately , we do n't know when that 's going to be just yet .
Until such time as Fuelcell or Microsoft puts a date on this , we 'll just watch Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet footage again and again — and play Limbo , the other extremely attractive and equally gloomy Xbox Live Arcade 2D adventure .

You may have heard that there is an 86 per cent chance that in a mere million years or so Gliese 710 will drift close enough to the solar system to perturb the Oort cloud and perhaps send a rain of comets down into the inner solar system .
Also , you have probably heard that there are hints of a certain periodicity in mass extinction events , perhaps linked to the solar system moving through the denser parts of the galactic disk , increasing the probability of similar close encounters .
So , the big bad is coming … sometime .
It might just be a stray asteroid that ’s in the wrong place at the wrong time and have little to do with what ’s happening outside the solar system .
In any case , we need to stay calm and carry on – and maybe print the following handy survival tips on a fridge magnet .
Immediate action : Fund sky surveys .
The Spaceguard Survey is underway aiming to identify near Earth objects down to the size of 140 meters .
At present the survey might be finished in ten or fifteen years and it completely missed two small objects which are thought to have hit Earth in 2002 with impact energies approaching half a kiloton .
Uh , anyone think we could be doing more in this space ?
Medium term action ( 0 – 10 years ) : Evacuate the area
The 2010 National Academy of Science ( NAS ) report uses the strange term civil defence , but really it just means run for your life ( i.e. evacuate the anticipated impact site ) .
City destroyers in the 140 meter plus range may only hit Earth every 30,000 years or so , but it does n’t hurt to be ready .
Mass extinction objects in the ten kilometer range may only come every 65 million years or so .
If it ’s one of these … bummer .
Long - term action ( 10 years plus ) : Call Roger Ramjet
If we do have around 10 years notice , there ’s maybe enough time to launch some of the nifty technology solutions we have at least developed on paper .
Gravity tugs and mirror bees and various other deflection devices are recommended to deflect objects threatening to pass through a gravitational keyhole and shift onto a collision course next time around .
If the object is already on collision course , no - one ’s ruling out ‘ instantaneous force ’ ( IF ) options , which are either crashing something into it ( ‘ kinetic impact ’ ) or just nuking it – although the NAS report notes a 500 % uncertainty about the possible trajectory change resulting from an IF .
Ideally , a ‘ full deflection campaign ’ involves an IF primary deflection followed by subsequent shepherding of one or more fragments onto a safer trajectory via your preferred deflection device .
And look , if it does all goes bad at least the next order of intelligent Earthlings might dig up all these fridge magnets with mysterious symbols printed on them and be able to figure out where we went wrong .
My money is on the birds .

I am not surprised
I think we are being unfair to this Abbott ‘ no surprises ’ Government .
I am not surprised .

The Government had removed this proposed clause during the Bill ’s Parliamentary readings , but then replaced it with a different amendment which will indeed allow the Secretary of State for Business to block any site which “ the court is satisfied has been , is being or is likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright " .
IF YOU want to keep Sarah Palin in the style to which she 's become accustomed , her private jet " must be a Lear 60 or larger " , she 'll need a whole fleet of SUVs to ferry her around town , and at least three luxury hotel rooms will be required to accommodate all those suitcases full of designer clobber .
The former governor of Alaska will also want an endless supply of bottled water with " bendable " straws , a security detail to prevent the great unwashed bothering her for autographs , and a cast - iron guarantee that she will not get asked any complicated questions that have not been shown to her in advance .
Once you 've gone to those lengths , and found tens of thousands of dollars to cover her considerable speaking fee , you may then find that your role in organising Mrs Palin 's appearance becomes the subject of a criminal investigation .
California 's attorney general yesterday announced an inquiry into one of the state 's public universities , amid allegations that its staff attempted to illegally destroy documents related to a $ 500 - a- head fundraising dinner at which Mrs Palin was scheduled to appear .
California State University , Stanislaus , is accused of covering up the circumstances under which the former Republican vice - presidential candidate agreed to travel south from Alaska to headline its 50th anniversary celebration at the end of June .
Last month , Leland Yee , a Democratic senator from San Francisco , used public disclosure laws to demand that the government - funded college publish documents revealing what Mrs Palin will be paid for the gig .
Her usual fee is believed to be some $ 100,000 .
The university initially refused his request , on a variety of grounds ; then , just as an appeal against that decision was about to be heard , the documents were discovered by a group of left - leaning students .
They had allegedly been left in a pile of paperwork due for disposal .
Some of the crucial documents were already shredded , possibly illegally .
But Mrs Palin 's five - page " contract addendum " was still in one piece .
That document , written by her agents at the Washington Speakers Bureau , was unveiled by the students at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon .

Dr. Scott S. Reuben , a former member of Pfizer Inc. ’s speakers ’ bureau accused last year of perpetrating one of the biggest research frauds in medical history , was charged today in a federal court in Boston with falsifying medical research studies .
Reuben , formerly chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield , Mass . , faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz accused Reuben of accepting a $ 75,000 grant from Pfizer to research the effectiveness of pain medication Celebrex for a 2005 study in which no patients were actually enrolled .
Prosecutors allege that Reuben made up the data , which he subsequently published in the medical journal " Anesthesia & Analgesia . "
The data supported the conclusion that Celebrex was effective in helping post - operative patients who had received a particular type of knee surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament .
" Anesthesia & Analgesia " later had to retract 10 papers written by Reuben , and medical experts at the time said at least 21 journal articles by the anesthesiologist appeared to be fabricated .
Reuben ’s studies had been considered pioneering at the time they were published .
His data had supported the use of two of Pfizer ’s major products — Celebrex and Lyrica — in combination to treat certain types of post - operative pain .
Pfizer said it had supported five of Reuben ’s research initiatives .
Pfizer , which declined at the time to reveal how much it paid Reuben over the years to be part of its speakers ’ bureau , said the company played no part in the fraud .
Last March , Reuben was dismissed from his position at Baystate Medical Center after an audit revealed he had been inventing data for as many as 13 years .
Oh how wonderful the lives of our comic book heroes must be .
They get to fly , have awesome adventures in space and wear colorful tights without anyone laughing at them .
But in ( fictional ) reality , the seemingly joyous and wondrous existence of many beloved characters is underlined with tragedies the likes of which we ca n’t even imagine .
As it turns out , it ’s not a perpetual coke party in the life of …
5 ) Cyclops
Why his life seems awesome :
As the leader of the X - men , Cyclops gets to command a team of demigods in spectacular fights against their enemies while shooting colorful death out of his eyes .
That and bone Jean Grey – and you KNOW she has to get freaky with that telekinesis bit of hers .
Why it ’s not : Cyclops is basically colorblind .
When he does n’t have that protective headgear on , Cyclops has to keep his eyes closed .
Otherwise he risks turning the local nursery into a smoldering pile of sorrow with his laser vision .
The only way he is able to see is through a special pair of goggles , which in almost every incarnation of “ X - men ” are of a red tint .
This logically means Cyclops can only see the world in a constant shade of red , which is actually worse than regular colorblindness .
Of course colorblind people can still lead exciting lives full of sex and gratuitous violence , but for someone in Cyclops ’ position the ability to discern between colors seems somehow necessary .
For piloting the X - men plane for example , or even recognizing the enemy .
Besides that , Cyclops will never truly enjoy a movie , a clear blue sky or the calming sight of a beautiful winter landscape .
To him the entire world is constantly bathed in blood .
4 ) The Flash
Why his life seems awesome :
It ’s not always you get to be called the Fastest Man Alive without some asshole taking a shot at your prowess in bed .
The Flash ’s magnificent speed further allows him to hang out with the Justice League and witness more wonders on a daily basis than all of humanity ever will in a thousand years .
Why it ’s not :
The Flash is , mentally , an ancient man .
In order for Flash ’s super speed to make even a tiny iota of sense , his mind must be as fast as his body , otherwise he would splat himself like a particularly disturbing inkblot on the nearest wall .
Not only his brain , but also all of his other senses , meaning that while in sonic mode the world virtually stands still from the Flash ’s perspective … but his mind keeps going normally .
By this , The Flash ’s psyche must have incredibly aged from all the time he spent speeding .
His 10 second sprint from our POV may seem like an hour to his super - accelerated mind .
To extrapolate from that : a day would seem like a month , a week like a decade , a year like eternity .
And with his super fast sense , can you imagine what it would feel like if Flash was ever stabbed while not being able to move ?
The knife would seemingly take years slowly edging itself inside his body , causing pain and suffering which would give Satan a boner .
3 ) Superman
Why his life seems awesome : Because he is Superman , that ’s why .
Not only does he have every super power imaginable , he is the only person in existence cool enough to be patriotic with that “ Truth , Justice and Apple Pie ” bit .
It ’s not easy being more or less a God , but Sups pulls it off nicely .
Why it ’s not : Sups is more or less a God .
From what we can gather about him , Superman is near immortal , invulnerable , balls strong , and with his speed and that global hearing we saw in “ Superman Returns ” it ’s safe to say he is virtually omnipresent .
But , he is a God who has to live along humans without reigning over them from a diamond palace in the sky .
It ’s like a human being trying to “ belong ” to a herd of swine , only much worse , because compared to Superman humanity comes off less significant than termites .
It must be so freaking lonely for him all alone up there at the top .
He is the God of Earth who will never belong and who will never have a real connection with humans because he is so much better than us .
We would n’t be surprised if Superman is constantly controlling himself to not enslave humanity .
We know we would .
Especially with the blue balls he must have .
Oh right – seeing as Superman can level the entire northern hemisphere by sneezing , do you know what would happen to Lois Lane or anyone else if he just … “ let go ” in bed ?
A giant crater where their bed used to be .
The man probably will never get his rocks off unless he tries to bone The Moon .
2 ) Wolverine
Why his life seems awesome : With Logan ’s adamantium skeleton , healing factor and claws , he will never suffer a broken bone or a scar , and will always have a handy - dandy can opener on himself , no matter what .
Why it ’s not :
Take a look at Wolverine .
He looks , what , 30 - 40 ?
Probably depends on the artist , but yeah , something like that .
He certainly is n’t a young chipper anymore , meaning that despite his regeneration power , Logan is aging .
Very slowly .
Further meaning that he will get to enjoy the wonders of crippling old age roughly 10 times longer than nature intended .
The act of aging is programmed into our DNA , causing tissue and cell degeneration until we croak .
Logan ’s power keeps that process slow but it evidently cannot halt it completely .
Thanks to that , Logan will be “ 80 ” for a few decades , with his power getting weaker and weaker , allowing for torn muscles and broken hips but still keeping his wrinkly , bony body alive , like some overzealous and deeply disturbing life - support aparatus .
By the end of it , this proud warrior will be begging for death after the 17th year of being “ 100 ” and pissing his pants for the 3rd time that day .
1 ) Green Lantern
Why his life seems awesome : Green Lantern ’s power ring can do anything .
Need an interstellar rocket ?
Wham , ready .
Translation from Seti -Alpha - 3 - ish to Armenian ?
Nothing simpler .
Hell , with the right amount of concentration and will power , Green Lantern ’s bling could create an Uwe Boll movie that does n’t suck … probably .
Why it ’s not :
It ’s a pretty safe bet that Green Lantern is utterly addicted to his ring .
From what Dr Wikipedia teaches us , the heroes of the GL comic book were all humans like us who one day got invited to the Green Lantern corps ( probably as token homo - sapiens due to Affirmative Action ) .
So in an instant these people went from regular Joe Blow to Shaper of Reality .
How could anyone return to normality after tasting Godhood ?
They can ’t , that ’s how .
Once you go green there is no possibility of living as a regular person again .
That would be like taking an Ethiopian orphan , giving it the best medical care in the word , feeding it and placing it with a loving family … and after a week sending it back to Africa .
Do you see ?
No one would be able to go through that without turning insane .
A depowered Green Lantern would have to start doing everything for himself , like make physical effort , take the bus to work , and if he wanted to order an Armenian hooker he would better have a dictionary ready .
Plus , once you have learned about all those vast and rich alien worlds out there , how could you ever care about the mundane bullshit of typical human life ?
If a human Green Lantern ever lost his power ring he would hang himself on the doorknob faster than you could utter : “ So , how are you planning to make a living now ?

A few years ago , I came across the word ' Ximenean ' in an esoteric discussion on a crossword forum .
A clue was being scoffed at for being devoid of this quality .
Having never read a book about cryptics or known anyone who could explain that , I was awestruck .
( There is something about the word ' Ximenean ' that has that effect . )
A frantic search online followed , which led to my introduction to the art and precision that lies behind cryptic crosswords .
If this is the first time you 're hearing the word ' Ximenean ' , I hope to make the experience less nerve - racking for you :)
Read on …
Origin of the word ' Ximenean '
The word comes from ' Ximenes ' , the pseudonym of compiler Derrick Somerset Macnutt who set crosswords for The Observer from 1939 until his death in 1971 .
Ximenes is regarded the finest compiler ever , and is often called the " father of the modern cryptic crossword " .
Ximenes ' repute is not just for his puzzles , but for the standards he laid down for creating good crosswords .
His principles of crossword composition were gradually recognized and adopted as a kind of model for setting by other daily puzzles too .
So when people say that a clue , crossword grid or setter is Ximenean , they mean that the clue / grid / setter abides by the standards set by Ximenes .
Likewise , an unXimenean ( or non-Ximenean ) clue / grid is one that violates Ximenes ' principles .
An overview of Ximenean principles
The essence of Ximenes ' canons is to be fair to the solver at all times .
His guidelines cover various aspects of crossword design – from making and populating the grid , to writing scrupulously fair clues .
Some of the important clue - writing standards are :
Appropriate indicators for all clue types
No indirect anagrams
No misleading connectors or punctuation
Unambiguous , unique answer to every clue
For a full understanding of Ximenean standards , I 'll refer you directly to the master himself .

If you did n’t think your flat - panel TV could display colors properly , get ready for this .
Sharp is unveiling a new technology that allows its upcoming TVs to display a trillion colors .
The quad - pixel technology sounds simple .
It takes the traditional “ red green blue ” color pixels used to form images on a screen and then adds a new one : yellow .
With these quad pixels , and with new light - emitting diode backlighting , Sharp TVs can display far more colors than existing TVs .
These new TVs will ship in three series this spring in 52 inch , 60 inch and 68 inch sizes .
The rollout is fast for a technology that Sharp has n’t revealed before .
Six women walked up on staged to pull curtains off the TV sets , which do indeed look brilliant when they ’re showing flowers on the screen .
Belatedly , Sharp is adding Netflix movie streaming service and other movie services to its web - connected TVs .
And it is adding social networking as well .
For instance , consumers can now tweet on TV too through Twitter for Sharp .

:
Demand statistics for international scheduled air traffic showed continuing improvement in January ( see red line in graph ) .
Compared to the previous year , January passenger demand was up 6.4 % .
Against this improving demand , a 1.2 % increase in passenger capacity in January pushed load factors to 75.9 % ( up from the 72.2 % recorded for January 2009 ) .
For international passenger demand :
* Asia Pacific carriers experienced a 6.5 % increase in demand compared to the previous year .
* Carriers in North America and Europe saw demand increase by 2.1 % and 3.1 % respectively .
* Middle Eastern carriers grew throughout the recession .
Growth accelerated to 23.6 % in January .
* Latin American carriers saw demand increase by 11 % in January on the back of a strong regional economy .
* African carriers recorded a 6.3 % improvement in January , assisted by robust regional economic activity .
International cargo demand showed a 28.3 % improvement with only a 3.7 % increase in capacity ( see green line in graph above ) .
This pushed the cargo load factor to 49.6 % which is a step - change from the 40.1 % recorded in January 2009 .
Sure enough , in the News Corporation ’s planning discussions about the local New York section , the talk has been less about what The Journal would gain than about “ killing The New York Times , ” according to several people with direct knowledge of the preparations , who asked for anonymity to discuss what are supposed to be secret matters .
“ It ’s not an economic decision , ” one of them said .
“ These guys could conceivably siphon off 10 , 20 percent of the local retail ads The Times gets , ” said a former executive of Dow Jones , the News Corporation unit that includes The Journal .
“ It ’s not enough to kill The Times , but in this environment , every little bit hurts . ”
Scott Heekin- Canedy , president and general manager of The Times , said that The Journal ’s plan “ presents a little bit of short - term pressure ” on Times ad sales , but not a long - term threat .
Audrey Siegel , president of TargetCast tcm , a Manhattan media agency , said that The Times was unlikely to lose a significant part of its advertising , but it might be forced to offer discounts and other incentives .
“ For advertisers who want to experiment with this , the money ’s got to come from some place else , and the fair game is The Times , local radio and cable , ” she said .
Several major retailers declined to comment on The Journal ’s New York section , but Mary Ellen Keating , a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble , said : “ We would wait to see how this or any other new media vehicle performs , then see how and if it fits our needs . ”
The News Corporation has not disputed reports that it is investing $ 15 million a year in the New York section , with an editorial staff of about 35 people to start , out of a newsroom of more than 750 people .
Some of those staff members will be new hires , but others are being transferred from other Journal departments .
Several of the hires , including the editor of the section , John Seeley , worked at The New York Sun , a broadsheet Mr. Murdoch admired , which closed in 2008 .
The Monster can drop his rookie tag for good .
Leafs goalie Jonas “ The Monster ” Gustavsson can celebrate a good job in his rookie season with the signing of a new , two - year deal Thursday .
The deal is believed to be worth about $ 1.35 million per season .
Gustavsson and the Leafs ended their regular season last Saturday , and the Leafs wasted little time in locking him up after he posted a 16 - 14 - 9 record with a 2.82 GAA and .904 save percentage .
“ We are extremely pleased to have signed Jonas to a new two - year deal , ” Leafs general manager Brian Burke said in a statement .
“ He made very good progress as the season went along and we are really looking forward to seeing him reach his full potential with us . ”
Gustavsson finished the season with a run of seven straight wins , and his overall performance was a testament to a season in which he underwent two surgeries to repair an abnormal heart beat , and missed time with a groin injury .
“ That ’s why I signed here , I like it here and I like the situation the team is in , ” Gustavsson , who was eligible for free agency this summer , said earlier this week as the Leafs cleaned out their lockers .
Gustavsson was chosen the Toronto nominee for the Bill Masterton Trophy , which annually recognizes perseverance , sportsmanship , and dedication to hockey .
The Leafs are also believed to be in negotiations with winger Nik Kulemin , who had a breakout season this past year .
I am unsure if it is still true , but at one point , Tucson had the more nukes aimed at it than any other place on Earth .

The reason for this absurd number of bombs is , of course , Davis - Monthan AFB , which is the mothball yard for the Air Force .
There are more serviceable aircraft parked there than there are combat aircraft in any of the worlds Air Forces , including the remainder of the US Air Force so the Russians had it on the Make Damn Good and Sure That These Fuckers Are Dead list .
But it wouldnt really work out that way .
No , what would happen today , should we go at it with the Russians , is that they would ALL miss , land on the wrong side of the Santa Ritas , and blow Sonora all to hell and gone .

Hubble confirms cosmic acceleration with weak lensing [ heic1005 ]
25 March 2010
Mass distribution in the COSMOS field .

A group of astronomers [ 1 ] , led by Tim Schrabback of the Leiden Observatory , conducted an intensive study of over 446 000 galaxies within the COSMOS field , the result of the largest survey ever conducted with Hubble .
In making the COSMOS survey , Hubble photographed 575 slightly overlapping views of the same part of the Universe using the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) onboard Hubble .
It took nearly 1000 hours of observations .
In addition to the Hubble data , researchers used redshift [ 2 ] data from ground - based telescopes to assign distances to 194 000 of the galaxies surveyed ( out to a redshift of 5 ) .
" The sheer number of galaxies included in this type of analysis is unprecedented , but more important is the wealth of information we could obtain about the invisible structures in the Universe from this exceptional dataset , " says co-author Patrick Simon from Edinburgh University .
In particular , the astronomers could " weigh " the large - scale matter distribution in space over large distances .
To do this , they made use of the fact that this information is encoded in the distorted shapes of distant galaxies , a phenomenon referred to as weak gravitational lensing [ 3 ] .
Using complex algorithms , the team led by Schrabback has improved the standard method and obtained galaxy shape measurements to an unprecedented precision .
The results of the study will be published in an upcoming issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics .
The meticulousness and scale of this study enables an independent confirmation that the expansion of the Universe is accelerated by an additional , mysterious component named dark energy .
A handful of other such independent confirmations exist .
Scientists need to know how the formation of clumps of matter evolved in the history of the Universe to determine how the gravitational force , which holds matter together , and dark energy , which pulls it apart by accelerating the expansion of the Universe , have affected them .
" Dark energy affects our measurements for two reasons .
First , when it is present , galaxy clusters grow more slowly , and secondly , it changes the way the Universe expands , leading to more distant - and more efficiently lensed - galaxies .
Our analysis is sensitive to both effects , " says co-author Benjamin Joachimi from the University of Bonn .
" Our study also provides an additional confirmation for Einstein 's theory of general relativity , which predicts how the lensing signal depends on redshift , " adds co-investigator Martin Kilbinger from the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris and the Excellence Cluster Universe .
The large number of galaxies included in this study , along with information on their redshifts is leading to a clearer map of how , exactly , part of the Universe is laid out ; it helps us see its galactic inhabitants and how they are distributed .
" With more accurate information about the distances to the galaxies , we can measure the distribution of the matter between them and us more accurately , " notes co-investigator Jan Hartlap from the University of Bonn .
" Before , most of the studies were done in 2D , like taking a chest X -ray .
Our study is more like a 3D reconstruction of the skeleton from a CT scan .
On top of that , we are able to watch the skeleton of dark matter mature from the Universe 's youth to the present , " comments William High from Harvard University , another co-author .
The astronomers specifically chose the COSMOS survey because it is thought to be a representative sample of the Universe .
With thorough studies such as the one led by Schrabback , astronomers will one day be able to apply their technique to wider areas of the sky , forming a clearer picture of what is truly out there .

In astronomy , the redshift denotes the fraction by which the lines in the spectrum of an object are shifted towards longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the Universe .
The observed redshift of a remote galaxy provides an estimate of its distance .
In this study the researchers used redshift information computed by the COSMOS team ( http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2009ApJ...690.1236I) using data from the SUBARU , CFHT , UKIRT , Spitzer , GALEX , NOAO , VLT , and Keck telescopes .

Weak gravitational lensing :
The phenomenon of gravitational lensing is the warping of spacetime by the gravitational field of a concentration of matter , such as a galaxy cluster .
When light rays from distant background galaxies pass this matter concentration , their path is bent and the galaxy images are distorted .
In the case of weak lensing , these distortions are small , and must be measured statistically .
This analysis provides a direct estimate for the strength of the gravitational field , and therefore the mass of the matter concentration .
When determining precise shapes of galaxies , astronomers have to deal with three main factors : the intrinsic shape of the galaxy ( which is unknown ) , the gravitational lensing effect they want to measure , and systematic effects caused by the telescope and camera , as well as the atmosphere , in case of ground - based observations .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s food safety agency has used partial evidence to approve genetically modified crops , including a GM potato developed by BASF , and should overhaul its methods , a French environment minister said .
France has previously invoked environmental risks to suspend cultivation of Monsanto ’s MON 810 maize , which was the only GM crop approved for growing in the European Union prior to this week ’s approval of BASF ’s Amflora potato .
Chantal Jouanno , a junior minister in the French government , said the European Food Safety Agency ( EFSA ) , whose opinions are used by the EU ’s executive , had ignored the environmental effects of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
“ We do not recognize their expertise because we consider that their opinions are incomplete , ” she told French daily Le Parisien in an interview published on Friday .
“ They are only interested in the sanitary consequences of GMOs , without taking into account their long - term environmental impact , ” she said , citing potential contamination of soil and adverse effects on other species .
France has asked a national biotechnology committee , the HCB , to give its opinion on the Amflora potato , after already consulting the body last year on MON 810 maize after taking issue with a favorable opinion from EFSA on renewing the European license for growing the crop .
To resolve longstanding divisions between member countries over GM crop approvals , the European Commission also said this week it may propose letting each country decide whether to authorize the cultivation of GM crops on its soil .
France ’s farm minister told Reuters last month he was opposed to any national decision - making on GM crops , calling for harmonized EU rules .

Try :: Tiny should n't become a core module in Perl 5 , because it works around a series of infelicities of implementation .
If Perl 5 were to address this problem , someone would have to rethink several well - established , fundamental design and implementation and language decisions .
Someone would have to test them , not just with all of the core tests , but with all of the CPAN .
Someone would have to document the changes and hope that the updated documentation would eventually make its way into new books on Perl 5 as well as all of the example code on the Internet .
Someone would have to update existing code , especially on the CPAN , to take advantage of the new features .
This is all possible .
It 's happened before .
Code people care about gets maintained , and if new features are useful in that code , people will update it to take advantage of new features .
Similarly , features removed from a language or library get removed from programs when they update to new versions of that language or library .
None of this is new and none of this is surprising .
The real problem in the case of exceptions and scope exit semantics in Perl 5 is that the initial design did n't anticipate the possible edge cases which make the feature ( occasionally ) unreliable .
You can design all of the formal semantics of a language as much as you want .
You can spend ten years writing a specification .
You can prove the initial implementation with formal methods .
Yet as soon as users start doing things you did n't expect , you 'll run into cases the specification and design and intent do n't cover , and then you have a difficult question .
If someone changed the way scope handling and exit and call stack unwinding worked in Perl 5 , such that exceptions could never get lost and lexical destruction always occurred in a predictable order and return values propagated to the appropriate places , Try : : Tiny would be unnecessary ...
... and someone ( probably that same someone ) would have to provide a compatibility mechanism for all of the existing code which relies on specific details — documented and otherwise — of scope handling and leave semantics and destruction ordering as it exists in Perl 5.12 right now , to give people time to migrate to the new system and to notify them that the old system is deprecated and to find design and implementation infelicities in the new system .
If reading that paragraph wearies you , imagine how much more doing all of that would be .
Granted , fixing scope handling and destruction ordering and leave semantics is as big a task in Perl 5 ( or any language ) as anything else .
It 's doable , from the technical side .
Yet how much sixteen year old code needs to change to achieve it , and how many assumptions in the billions of lines of code written in the past sixteen years need to change to make it work ?
Worse yet , this is n't a Moose situation , where an obvious improvement is available to anyone with a CPAN client and a few minutes to read a tutorial .
I do n't mean to dishearten anyone .
The edge cases for which Try :: Tiny exists are rare , and you can write Perl 5 code for years without encountering them .
It 's an easy module to use and it shields you from most of the damage .
Even so , fixing bugs the right way — making them impossible to encounter — is not always easy .
You do n't often get a fresh start in software , but sometimes that 's exactly what you need .

Photo Gallery Aldrich declares for NBA
Videos Videos : Aldrich to go pro Kansas center Cole Aldrich spoke with media about his intentions to enter the 2010 NBA draft Monday , March 29 , 2010 at Allen Fieldhouse .
Walt Aldrich was watching highlights of his son ’s news conference Monday afternoon in his home in Bloomington , Minn. , when his beeper went off .
The volunteer firefighter responded to a call that turned out to be a false alarm .
“ Someone hit a gas line with their weed wacker , ” Walt Aldrich , father of Kansas University junior center Cole Aldrich , explained .
He hurried back home to resume reviewing the big news of the day — Cole Aldrich ’s declaring for the 2010 NBA Draft in a 3:30 p.m. media gathering in Allen Fieldhouse .
“ He loves college and the team , ( but ) I think he has a feeling he ’s ready .
It ’s time to be paid for having fun , ” Walt Aldrich said .
Cole will be paid a bundle of money — in fact , he ’s ticketed to be an instant millionaire — after being tapped in the first round of the June draft .
The money should help in various ways .
“ Cole has talked a lot about this being a tough year .
I do n’t think the public or media would possibly know what his family members have gone through this year , ” KU coach Bill Self said in applauding the 6 - foot - 11 , 250 - pounder ’s decision to turn pro .
“ I think it was a very , very easy decision and one that needed to be made . ”
Walt Aldrich has not had a steady paycheck the past four years .
He has worked part - time jobs off and on — including jobs in Topeka and Kansas City — following a slowdown in the economy , specifically the sheet - metal construction business .
Walt ’s wife , Kathy , also had been out of work the past school year .
“ Our ‘ rainy - day fund ’ was getting pretty thin , ” said Walt , indicating that was n’t the reason Cole turned pro .
Walt ’s happy to report he recently obtained a full - time janitorial position with benefits at a plant that makes balloons , while his wife has contracted a pair of embroidering jobs .
“ When we talked , we told him , ‘ It ’s your life , kid .
You are an adult .
Do n’t worry about us .
We ’ve always made it and always will , ’ ” Walt said .
“ It ’s just time .
He ’s almost 7 - foot , can shoot and blocks a lot of shots .
You ’d think some team could use somebody like him . ”
Various NBA
Draft sites list Aldrich as a certain lottery ( top 14 ) pick .
“ I ’m hoping to go really high , ” said Cole Aldrich , who said he now is in the market for an agent as he enters the draft with no looking back .
“ I ’ll take the individual workouts ( for NBA teams ) from here on out until the draft and make sure I put myself in the best position to help whatever team I go to be successful . ”
Self — he said he has known since last April that Aldrich would be turning pro after three seasons — said it ’s “ almost irrelevant ” where Aldrich is selected .
“ We all know he ’s going to go pretty high ... whether he goes No. 5 or 14 , I think so much of it would be dependent on what other bigs are in the draft , ” Self said .
“ Regardless of where he ’s projected , in his particular situation , I think it ’s the right move now for him to go ahead and enter .
I ’d strongly discourage him from coming back .
I think he ’s paid his dues here , and it ’s time for him to move forward into another chapter .
He ’s made a lot of sacrifices — and his family has — for him to come back ( for junior year ) in a time where he did n’t have to .
We ’re all very proud of him . ”
Aldrich , who recently was named college basketball ’s academic player of the year , said his goal is to graduate in May of 2011 .
“ It ’d be cool to walk down the hill in May with Tyrel ( Reed ) , Conner ( Teahan ) , ( Chase ) Buford , and Brady ( Morningstar ) is probably going to get there sometime , ” joked Aldrich , who will be about 16 hours shy of his degree after this semester .
“ It ’s going to be a busy summer .
It ’s going to be a busy spring .
I ’m going to work hard on the basketball court , and if I have time , work hard in the classroom . ”
He fought back tears at a news conference attended by teammates , coaches , administrators and his girlfriend .
“ I do n’t want to get choked up or anything , but the last three years have been pretty special .
A lot of highs and a few lows this summer with my grandma ( who died after bout with cancer ) , ” Aldrich said .
“ But it ’s a special time , I think , for me and my family .
I have talked to them extensively .
We went through somewhat of the same process last year figuring out what I wanted to do , whether I wanted to come back and have another great year or go from one great chapter to hopefully starting another great chapter in life . ”
Aldrich — who finished his KU career four blocks shy of Greg Ostertag ’s school - record total of 258 — said he wished the team were still playing .
“ We were all upset that it had to end so short , ” said Aldrich , who was part of KU ’s national title team in 2008 .
“ Being a part of a team that went and played all six games and then playing three games last year , we had high goals .
But those goals are going to be there again .
And I hope the team next year is going to be there again .
I ’m really going to support those guys . ”
Perhaps as a member of his hometown Minnesota Timberwolves ?
“ I think it ’d be special , just being a kid from Minnesota all my life .
I do n’t know how realistic it ’d be .
If it ’s the best situation for me as a player , it ’d be great .

With the United States and much of Europe buried in public debt , many wonder how world governments will solve their impending budgetary crises .
The economics profession has split into two camps : those who promote more spending ; and their opponents , the " deficit hawks . "
The spenders have been the more vocal , largely due to their dominance in mainstream academia .
Keynesian economists , like Paul Krugman , argue that growing debt will not be a problem given that large government debts are not unprecedented .
For example , Krugman argues that the United States ran large debts during the Second World War and was able to pay them off after the war ended .
This Princeton professor and Nobel laureate also argues that , because the United States is one of many countries piling up debt , its public debt is justifiable and tenable .
Paul Krugman conveniently leaves out , or fails to apply , some key details .
Regarding the Second World War , he notes that the debt was paid off largely because of a cut in government spending .
He fails to account for the fact that the most dangerous factors behind the current debt are " unfunded liabilities " — the future costs of welfare and social - insurance programs .
As for those other countries building debt , they are also looking at political uncertainty and almost - certain economic collapse . [ 1 ]
Most onlookers have been able to see past these elementary flaws and realize the potential danger of growing public debt .
Dismissing the Keynesian argument , however , leaves the layman with few other accessible explanations .
For most , the biggest threat seems to be an increase in taxes .
Although worrisome , high taxes should be the least of one 's worries .
The worst to come is sovereign default , a scenario which the mainstream has declared unrealistic .
Fortunately , the Austrian School 's Garet Garrett chronicled the threat of accumulated public debt in The Bubble That Broke the World .
Unfortunately , Garrett is the bearer of bad news .
The current fiscal situation is not unprecedented .
High public and private debt has been the bane of large governments for the entirety of written history .
It is what Ludwig von Mises described as the " crisis of interventionism . "
Intervention aims at confiscating the " surplus " of one part of the population and at giving it to the other part .
Once this surplus is exhausted by total confiscation , a further continuation of this policy is impossible . [ 2 ]
Put in simpler terms , the crisis of interventionism is summed up by the adage , " the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people 's money . " [ 3 ]
While Mises laid down the theoretical foundations for the argument against big government and socialism , Garet Garrett provided the empirical evidence .
In 1931 , amidst a global economic crisis , Garrett published The Bubble That Broke the World .
This relatively short book , largely forgotten today , provides one of the best and clearest arguments against the accumulation of public debt , and applies Mises 's theory of the crisis of interventionism to the crisis in Central Europe during the Great Depression .
Garet Garrett 's Lesson Restated
Garet Garrett remains an unsung hero of liberalism . [ 4 ]
Although he is probably best known for his novels , [ 5 ] he was also a great economist .
He worked to discredit the New Deal [ 6 ] and Franklin Roosevelt , [ 7 ] while crusading for small government . [ 8 ]
The Bubble That Broke the World remains one of his most important works on economics and the Great Depression .
Garrett placed the blame for the worldwide economic collapse of the 1930s on the Federal Reserve System 's program of extending credit to bail out its European friends .
He branded the entire process a Ponzi scheme .
Garrett described the bubble as a product of three factors :
First , the idea that the panacea for debt is credit . …
The burden of Europe 's private debt to [ the United States ] now is greater than the burden of her war debt ; and the war debt , with arrears of interest , is greater than it was the day the peace was signed . … [ 9 ]
Second , a social and political doctrine , now widely accepted , beginning with the premise that people are entitled to certain betterments of life .
If they cannot immediately afford them , that is , if out of their own resources these betterments cannot be provided , nevertheless people are entitled to them , and credit must provide them . …
Third , the argument that prosperity is a product of credit , whereas from the beginning of economic thought it had been supposed that prosperity was from the increase and exchange of wealth , and credit was its product . [ 10 ]
The late 1920s and early 1930s was a period of fear throughout Europe .
Currencies were losing value , governments were building debt , and animosity was again quickly spreading between governments .
European central banks were having issues remaining solvent while still providing liquidity to their governments .
As a result , they often looked to the New York Fed and a host of private banks in the United States for credit to provide this liquidity .
Ultimately , the solvency of the Bank of England and the Reichsbank depended entirely on the solvency of the US Federal Reserve System .
The Fed could only remain solvent as long as the Europeans repaid their debts , and by 1930 it was becoming obvious that these countries were borrowing far more than they could afford to repay .
" The cost of social - insurance and welfare programs can increase with general price inflation .
Government cannot print its way out of a debt that adjusts itself to the rise in the supply of money . "
Germany was the weakest link .
Her government , scrambling for funds to pay for war reparations and social programs , borrowed copiously from English and American creditors .
Unsurprisingly , the Germans began to borrow to pay for debts owed to the same creditors .
Garet Garrett described this as a method by which Americans were repaying themselves for debts owed by others .
The long - run consequence was even greater German debt .
The principal losers were the American creditors who had lent far too much credit to the Europeans .
The overall consequences were easy to predict .
As European central banks became insolvent , they began to default on their debts , catalyzing the collapse of the giant pyramid of credit funded largely through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
The lesson of The Bubble That Broke the World is not the eventual collapse , per se .
Although Garrett does argue that an accumulation of debt will end in insolvency , his focus is on the accumulation of debt itself .
Garrett 's lesson is that government expenditure funded through debt and credit expansion creates an addiction to credit .
Credit is considered a panacea , and is used to keep government programs afloat .
Building debt , fueled by addiction , leads to ruin .
Credit can serve as a panacea for debt only as long as there is credit available to borrow .
When the source of credit has been depleted , and governments find it impossible to repay their bloated accounts , the house of cards collapses .
This is what occurred in the early 1930s , and it is what will occur in the present day .
The Lesson Reapplied
Although crises of interventionism have occurred between the 1930s and the present — including in Argentina and Zimbabwe — the majority of First World citizens remain distant from the concept .
Apart from those few veterans of the Great Depression , the majority have lived in an era of abundant resources and unparalleled wealth .
Despite the reoccurring booms and busts , there have been few serious periods of general poverty in the United States , nor in most of Western Europe .
Garet Garrett 's The Bubble That Broke the World was forgotten soon after it was published .
Even Murray Rothbard 's America 's Great Depression , which in many ways brought Garet Garrett 's insights out from obscurity , remains unheeded .
But the era of growing bureaucracy , of the welfare / warfare state , and of illusionary wealth cannot last forever .
Today , we are witnessing the symptoms of an impending " crisis of interventionism . "
Garrett 's lesson is as relevant and valuable as ever .
The West has undermined its own security by allowing its governments to quickly grow beyond the fiscal means of their people .
The United States and Western Europe have built up a mountain of debt .
Deficit spending as a countercyclical fiscal policy is the least of the world 's worries .
The collapse of today 's credit - based Ponzi scheme is mainly due to the multitude of social - insurance programs that are becoming far too costly to sustain .
In other words , the crumbling keystone is not short - term expenditure but long - term debt .
Given the political unpopularity of cutting these untenable programs , it is unlikely that governments will purposefully reverse their growth . [ 11 ]
There is a fast - growing addiction to credit .
Western governments can be compared to drug addicts .
While a drug addict can overdose , however , the government can remain high as long as credit continues to be supplied at an exponentially rising rate .
But , as with any addict , the day the supply cuts short is the day that marks the beginning of a severe depression .
$ 15 $ 12 " There is only one long - term solution , and that is the reduction of government . "
But wait , if government can just print money , would it not be able to pay off its debt , even if at the expense of everybody else ?
This is why unfunded liabilities are so important .
The cost of these social - insurance and welfare programs can increase with general price inflation .
Government cannot print its way out of a debt that adjusts itself to the rise in the supply of money .
There is only one long - term solution , and that is the reduction of government .
Large government is unsustainable .
For better or for worse , as Garet Garrett beautifully explains in The Bubble That Broke the World , the market corrects itself .
The lengthening of the period of interventionism only increases the painfulness of the inevitable reallocation of resources .
The world already has the Great Depression as a warning .
But governments and the bureaucrats who run them have decided to ignore the lesson .
The new crisis of interventionism is fast approaching , and the market will not wait for governments to realize their errors .
RELIEF was the initial reaction in Chile to what seemed relatively limited damage given the scale of the earthquake that shook the centre and south of the country in the early hours of Saturday February 27th .
That picture has been replaced gradually by dismay as the full extent of the cost begins to emerge .
By Sunday evening , the number of confirmed deaths had reached over 700 and is still likely to rise , according to President Michelle Bachelet .
This is still a low toll , however , for a quake of 8.8 magnitude , one of the largest in the world since 1900 .
Felt throughout almost all the country , the quake hit most strongly in six central regions , from the capital , Santiago , and the nearby port of Valparaiso in central Chile to the city of Temuco in the Araucanía region of the south .
These parts of the country are home to about 60 % of Chile 's 17 m inhabitants and account for around 70 % its GDP .
An estimated 1.5 m homes are thought to have been damaged and around a third may have to be demolished .
The greatest damage and loss of life , however , appears to have been caused not by the earthquake itself but by a subsequent tidal wave that washed over fishing towns on the coast of south - central Chile .
In one such town , Constitución , rescue workers found over 300 bodies on Sunday .
Much of the only town in the Juan Fernández archipelago in the Pacific Ocean , which belongs to Chile and is best - known as the place where Robinson Crusoe was marooned , was also destroyed .
Chile has developed an efficient disaster - response system to cope with what Ms Bachelet has described as “ a history plagued with natural disasters ” .
However , looters , particularly in the southern city of Concepción and other nearby towns , have dented the image of a country swinging into action to relieve its suffering people .
Though some looters may have merely been in search of scarce food and water others were out for what they could take .
As a result , on Sunday , the government imposed a curfew in some of the worst - affected areas .
The earthquake struck just as the Chilean economy was beginning to recover after an estimated contraction of 0.9 % in 2009 .
The after - effects will hamper the exports that drive the country 's growth .
Copper , Chile 's biggest earner abroad , is produced mainly in the north of the country which was unscathed .
But damage to ports further south may hamper shipments of forestry products , including wood pulp , while exports of fruit , now at the height of the harvest season in the southern hemisphere , will face delays as a result of damage to the main roads of central Chile .
Despite the earthquake 's likely impact on growth in the first and , possibly , the second quarter , it may actually provide a boost for the economy in the medium term as the government spends heavily to repair the damage .
This is welcome news for the country 's president - elect , Sebastián Piñera , who is set to take office on March 11th and was voted in on an ambitious promise of average economic growth of 6 % annually over his four - year term .
Until assessment of the damage is complete , it is hard to estimate the cost of reconstruction .
Eqecat , an American catastrophe - management company , has suggested that it could total as much as $ 30 billion , equivalent to 20 % of Chile 's GDP in 2009 .
Part of the cost can readily be financed out of the public purse , drawing on savings accumulated while copper price boomed between 2005 and 2008 .
However , Mr Piñera , who has indentified increased private investment as one of the most important components of higher growth , has indicated that the government will not do all the work .
He expects Chilean companies to play an important role in the reconstruction through a “ Lift Chile ” plan , which he outlined on Sunday .
This may well include a revival of a public - works - concession scheme that Chile successfully launched in the mid-1990s precisely to build many of the motorways that were damaged by Saturday 's earthquake .
The growing clerical sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church are proof that the Devil is at work inside the Vatican , according to the Holy See 's chief exorcist .
Father Gabriele Amorth said the Pope " fully believes in liberation from evil , because the Devil lodges in the Vatican .
Naturally it is difficult to find proof , but you can see the consequences " .
Fr Amorth ( 85 ) has been the Vatican 's chief exorcist for 25 years and says he has dealt with 70,000 cases of demonic possession .
He said the " consequences " included internal Vatican power struggles as well as " cardinals who do not believe in Jesus , bishops who are linked to the demon .
When one speaks of ' the smoke of Satan ' in the holy rooms , it is all true .
Including these latest stories of violence and paedophilia " .
The scandals included those involving the Irish , German and Dutch churches .
Possessed
Fr Amorth , who recently published ' Memoirs of an Exorcist ' -- a book of interviews with the Vatican journalist Marco Tosatti -- said the attempt on the life of Pope John Paul II in 1981 had been the work of the Devil , as had an incident last Christmas when a mentally ill woman threw herself at the Pope at the start of Midnight Mass , pulling him to the ground .
He is on record as saying that Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin were both possessed by the Devil .
Father Jose Antonio Fortea Cucurull , a Spanish exorcist based in Rome , said Fr Amorth had " gone well beyond the evidence " in claiming that Satan had infiltrated the Vatican .
" Cardinals might be better or worse , but all have upright intentions and seek the glory of God , " he said .
Some Vatican officials were more pious than others , " but from there to affirm that some cardinals are members of satanic sects is an unacceptable distance " .
Fr Amorth told ' La Repubblica ' , however , that the Devil was " pure spirit , invisible .
But he manifests himself with blasphemies and afflictions in the person he possesses .
He can remain hidden , or speak in different languages , transform himself or appear to be agreeable .
At times , he makes fun of me . "
Meanwhile , in a separate development yesterday Pope Benedict XVI 's older brother , Monsignor Georg Ratzinger , said in an interview with the ' Passauer Neue Presse ' newspaper yesterday that he regretted slapping students when he was the director of the Regensburg Cathedral choir in Bavaria .
Mgr Ratzinger ( 86 ) , who was director of the Regensburg choir from 1964 to 1994 , said he was sorry he used corporal punishment before it was outlawed in 1980 , although he said allegations of sexual abuse that have emerged in the diocese were never raised while he was in office .
The Diocese of Regensburg , where Pope Benedict once taught as a professor of theology , this week cited two cases of sexual abuse in the cathedral choir from the late 1950s , part of a wave of abuse allegations that has emerged this year in Germany .

Could this be the start of greener space programs ?
Next month , Japan is launching a spacecraft powered by solar sails into deep space .
The Ikaros , as the vessel has been dubbed , will take to the skies on May 18 , 2010 .
Ikaros stands for " Interplanetary Kite - craft Accelerated by Radiation of the Sun . "
The name is also a reference to the Greek myth of Icarus , a young man who , with his father Daedalus , attempted to escape exile in Crete by fashioning wings of feathers and wax .
According to the myth , Icarus flew too close to the sun , and the heat melted the wax in his wings , causing him to plummet to his death .
We certainly hope Ikarus the spaceship meets a happier fate when the rocket that carries it takes off from the Tanegashima Space Center .
Its creators call the Ikaros a " space yacht . "
Its 46 - foot sails are thinner than human hair ; they will propel the vessel by harnessing the pressure of sunlight particles as they collide with the sails .
The Ikarus is also outfitted will thin solar cells to help generate electricity .
" Solar sails are the technology that realizes space travel without fuel as long as we have sunlight , " said Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) spokesperson Yuichi Tsuda .
" The availability of electricity would enable us to navigate farther and more effectively in the solar system . "
Solar sails have been tested in vacuum chambers by NASA in the past , but the agency failed to successfully deploy this technology .
If successful , the Ikarus will be the first craft to use solar sails in space as a primary propulsion method .
This spacecraft has cost JAXA 1.5 billion yen ( around $ 16 million ) to build .
The rocket that carries it into space will also launch Japan 's first satellite to Venus .
JAXA 's upcoming plans also might include sending a robot to the moon by 2015 and building a robot - staffed lunar base by 2020 at a cost of 200 billion yen ( $ 2 billion ) between now and 2020 .
By way of comparison , the cost of the Apollo project was $ 25.4 billion , as reported in 1973 ( that 's around $ 175 billion now ) , and President George H.W. Bush - era NASA proposed a $ 400 billion Mars mission in 1989 .
NASA 's future lunar mission costs were projected at $ 104 billion for 13 years in 2005 .
Other proposed low - cost lunar missions have had estimated costs of around $ 10 billion .
Kudos to JAXA for creating an economical and relatively resource - friendly alternative to conventional methods of space exploration .
We look forward to hearing more about the Ikarus 's mission in the weeks to come .
Some Indonesians , watching Australia 's sponsorship of East Timor 's move to independence , suspected it was unstated policy to encourage a fragmentation .
On the contrary .
It was never Canberra 's policy , but it was one of Canberra 's paranoias .
That was the fear .
The fact : under the President , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , universally known as SBY , the most virulent separatist movement , in Aceh , has been reconciled .
The West Papuan independence movement is moribund .
The country is unified and stable .
East Timor was the only breakaway , and its sad stagnation has not inspired imitators .
The second big fear was that without a military dictator to repress fundamentalist Islam , Indonesia would turn radical .
Perhaps the Islamists would take control through the ballot box .
Perhaps the Islamic extremists would revive the Darul Islam project to overthrow the government violently and impose fundamentalist sharia law .
Either way , Indonesia would become a brooding presence , increasingly hostile to Western values and inimical to Australian interests .
The fact : as the Australian National University 's Greg Fealy wrote after last year 's legislative elections : " Despite the fact that almost 90 per cent of the electorate is Muslim , Islamic parties gained less than 30 per cent of the vote - their lowest figure over the three democratic elections held after the downfall of President Soeharto in 1998 . "
This does n't mean Indonesians are abandoning Islam .
There is a trend to increasing religious observance .
A growing percentage are attending prayers , fasting during Ramadan , and using Islamic banks .
Muslims pursue their religious beliefs as a personal , social and religious matter , not a political one .
Voters demand better services from their government , not religious exhortation .
Other religions , including its Christian churches , are flourishing too .
In the immediate post - Soeharto years , churches were firebombed in an effort to foment sectarian upheaval .
In an interesting role reversal , it 's in next - door Malaysia that churches are under attack .
In Indonesia , religious tolerance is practised and the secular state is increasingly entrenched .
A relapse into military dictatorship was the third scenario .
A new - generation general would assert control .
Perhaps he'd be provoked by an Islamist uprising , by the break - up of the nation , or by political disarray .
The fact : Indonesia today is led by a former general , but he was chosen by the people in a free election , not just once , but now for a second term .
SBY is a model democrat .
The only generals who vie for power do so at the ballot box .
They campaign for votes like other candidates do , often singing ballads at rallies to woo voters rather than ordering the troops to intimidate them .
Democracy is entrenched as the sole source of legitimacy .
The media is one of the world 's most thrusting and free , and strong democratic institutions are increasingly solid .
Corruption remains a serious problem , but the polity is struggling mightily to break its grip .
Neighbouring Thailand has relapsed into military coups .
In Indonesia , the generals are in the barracks and no one in Jakarta speaks of coups any more .
Fourth was the fear that massive economic dislocation and political unrest would precipitate a torrent of Indonesian boat people .
In a country of 230 million , it was often pointed out , you 'd only need 1 per cent to head for the boats and Australia 's systems would be overwhelmed .
The fact : the economic and political upheaval came and went .
The boat people ?
None came .
Refugees from Afghanistan , Sri Lanka and other countries have , via Indonesia , but the Indonesians stayed home .
They are pretty happy where they are .
Since the trauma of the Asian economic crisis in 1998 , Indonesia 's economy has developed better than almost anyone could have imagined .
In the crisis , one - seventh of the Indonesian economy evaporated , while interest rates shot up to 75 per cent .
But its average for the past five years is 5 per cent a year , behind only China and India among the region 's economies .
The World Bank recently said Indonesia has a ' ' unique opportunity to rise as a dynamic , inclusive , middle - income country which can be both a leading sophisticated commodity economy like Australia [ and ] a hub of labour - intensive industry in Asia like China " .
The final fear was that Indonesia would be an impenetrable haven for terrorists , who would launch operations against Australia at will .
Indonesia was so riddled with Islamist extremists , and the Indonesian state so weak and incompetent , Australia would have to live in a permanent state of terrorist siege .
The fact : there have been terrorist attacks against Australian citizens and interests , including the Bali bombing .
The threat remains real .
But the Indonesian authorities , in co-operation with Australian counterparts , have proved to be vigorous and highly effective counter - terrorists .
Loading
For all of these reasons , the Australian Parliament tomorrow recognises Indonesia 's emergence as a moderate , stable , peaceful , secular democracy , and it honours Yudhoyono as the pivot on which it has turned , when he addresses a joint sitting .
Peter Hartcher is the 's international editor .

Men , women and children were hacked with machetes as they rushed out .

That ’s my estimate anyways .
I remember it like it was yesterday .
It was my freshman year at Harvard , and I was going to the first lecture of “ Justice ” – one of the most popular classes on campus .
The lectures took place in Sanders Theater packed by over a thousand students since it ’s only offered once every three years .
The first question the professor asked – please stand up if you ’re the first born child in your family ( inclusive of only children ) .
I literally felt like everyone in the entire theater stood up – except me since I ’m a youngest child .
Why is it that such a high majority of Harvard students are first borns or only children ?
Because birth order matters according to Dr. Kevin Leman , author of The Birth Order Book – Why You Are the Way You Are .
I ’ve been reading it – here ’s his framework on how the different orders generally are ( noting that not every characteristic applies to every child ) :
First Child : perfectionist , reliable , conscientious , a list maker , well organized , hard driving , a natural leader , critical , serious , scholarly , logical , does n’t like surprises , a techie .
Middle Child : mediator , compromising , diplomatic , avoids conflict , independent , loyal to peers , has many friends , a maverick , secretive , used to not having attention .
Youngest Child : manipulative , charming , blames others , attention seeker , tenacious , people person , natural salesperson , precocious , engaging , affectionate , loves surprises .
Only Child : little adult by age seven , very thorough , deliberate , high achiever , self - motivated , fearful , cautious , voracious reader , black - and - white thinker , talks in extremes , ca n’t bear to fail , has very high expectations for self , more comfortable with people who are older or younger .

OBESITY has overtaken smoking as the leading cause of premature death and illness in Australia , as experts say the federal government is woefully unprepared for a tsunami of weight - related health problems .
Fat was rapidly becoming the biggest public health challenge Australia had to face , said the president of the Public Health Association of Australia , Mike Daube , who is also the deputy chairman of the government 's National Preventative Health Taskforce .
obesity
New figures from Western Australia , which are expected to be echoed across Australia , show the contribution of excessive weight to ill health has more than doubled in just six years , and by 2006 accounted for 8.7 per cent of all disease .
Tobacco 's role has fallen by a quarter , and now causes 6.5 per cent of illness and early death .
" The obesity crisis is not on its way - it is already here , " Professor Daube said .
" What we have done about obesity is not working .
This issue needs concentrated and determined action . "

The whole thing just seems like a terrible , terrible dream .
One minute you 're watching your little boy blow out the candles on his birthday cake , and the next minute , there you are , carrying his little flailing body out to the hole you 've dug in the backyard .
To be honest , I 'm still in shock .

Never did I think a day like this would come .
Never did I think I 'd someday have to bury my sweet , dear Kyle alive .
No parent should .
This pain , this excruciating pain — it 's unlike anything I 've felt before .
Especially in my ribs , where Kyle kept punching me .
It 's unbearable .
Advertisement
As a parent , it 's the worst thing imaginable .
Your own child , suddenly gone .
I 'd give anything to take his place in that hole beneath our doghouse !
Anything !
It should have been me screaming for my life as my mouth slowly filled with dirt .
But it was n't .
I have to come to terms with what happened .
Our little boy is gone and he 's never coming back .
Kathy packed the makeshift grave much too tight for there to be any chance of that .
At least he's not suffering anymore , as he was for the seemingly endless 15 - minute struggle beforehand .

Kyle .
Our little Kyle , he was so brave .
No matter how many times we beat him back down , our little guy never gave up .
He was a fighter to the very end .
Even when we thought he was a goner — when we thought it was over and had turned around to walk back inside , he surprised us by crawling his way out .
Wrestling him back into that hole was one of the hardest things I 've ever had to do .

If you 're a mother or a father , take my advice and spend as much time as you possibly can with your children .
Cherish every moment , because you never know when you 'll suddenly be shoving them into a crudely dug tomb .
Hold onto them tight so you can get a sense of their strength and then never let go .
I still can't believe it 's real .
Even now , days since we 've heard any thumping or muffled moans from the backyard , a million thoughts are running through my head : How ?
Why ?
Did the neighbors see anything ?
Can we ever move on ?
But we 'll never know the answers .

I thought burying my father alive was hard , but nothing can prepare you for this .
Dad was old and had lived a long , prosperous life .
He had three kids and five grandchildren by the time I brained him with a tire iron and dragged his semiconscious body to an abandoned quarry .
While there was too much electrical tape on his mouth for him to speak , I remember the way he looked up at me .
His eyes seemed to say , " It 's all right , son .
It 's my time .
Let me go . "
And he was right .
There 's a time for everything , even death .
But it was n't my son 's time .
Kyle was supposed to have lived until long after I was arrested for his attempted murder and locked away for good , until he had children of his own to love him as much as I do .

Are you there , God ?
Do you even exist ?
Because I 'd really like to know how you could breathe life into a beautiful child only to have a monster like me take him away from me .
When he gets to heaven , I want you to explain to him why he's so much smaller than the other angels and how he got those deep rope burns on his wrists and ankles .
I bet even you wo n't be able to do that .
I 've spent the past few sleepless nights in my daughter Samantha 's room , just watching her in her crib .
I think about how fragile life is and how quickly it can be taken away at any age .
If something so awful could happen to her brother , who was barely 5 , what 's to stop it from happening to a girl even younger and more vulnerable tomorrow or possibly next Tuesday ?

Nothing .
Absolutely nothing .
Last night the UK Government rammed through the controversial Digital Economy Bill after its third reading and just two hours debate .
This means that it will later become law , everyone will stop sharing files online and the music and movie industries will net billions in the years to come .
Better still , it has the full support of the people .
In a late night session yesterday the Digital Economy Bill was forced through by the Government with the assistance of the Conservative opposition .
Complaints that the Bill is far too important to be passed through the “ wash - up ” period were ignored and after just two hours of debate in the Commons , it will now almost certainly become law .
The anti-piracy measures in this Bill have been essentially written by the music industry but despite opposition from just about everyone , it was approved by 189 MPs with just 47 against .
Former Cabinet Office minister Tom Watson , who was one of the few who voted against , was clearly upset as he wrote on Twitter : “ First time I ’ve ever broken the whip in the chamber .
I feel physically sick . ”
A total of 650 MPs could have been present but only 236 bothered to turn up and many of those that did were still in for criticism .
“ It was painfully obvious to anyone watching the broadcast from Parliament this evening that any MP that only turned up for the divisions and not the debate does not care about the views of their constituents , does not care about democracy and does not care about the future of Britain ’s digital economy , ” said Graeme Lambert , the Pirate Party UK candidate for Bury North .
The Bill will pass without the hugely controversial site - blocking clause 18 , but in its place will be a convenient and even more worrying amendment to clause 8 .
This will allow the Secretary of State for Business to block “ a location on the internet which the court is satisfied has been , is being or is likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright ” .
The scope of this amendment simply boggles the mind .
Labour MP John
Hemming cited the more - often - than - not copyright infringing WikiLeaks as an example .
“ A recent example is the US air force video , which it published , ” noted Hemming .
“ Copyright exists with the US Government , who under the Bill could , and would want to , apply to ban WikiLeaks from the UK .
That provision is clearly in the Bill . ”
Finance secretary Stephen Timms , who insisted that since the creative industries are losing £ 1 billion a year to online file - sharing all these measures were absolutely necessary , was also in for criticism .
Mark Sims , Pirate Party UK candidate for East Ham noted that Timms spent “ much of his time on the floor delaying debate , and refusing to answer questions put to him , instead relying on the party whips to force the vote through , essentially ignoring the concerns raised by voters in their questions put to ministers . ”
So there we have it .
We ’re nearly at the end of the process that will save the music and movie industries , generating hundreds of millions in extra revenue , create countless jobs , stop all file - sharing sites , mechanisms and the general public from sharing files .

Digital transformation is the most popular phrase in “ digital ” technology .
The term is searched close to 1 million times a year on Google and means different things to different people .
This usually results in a lack of alignment on its definition of success and impact for a company .
What Is Digital Transformation ?
When there is a discussion about digital transformation , there seems to be some disconnect since the meaning of “ Digital Transformation ” will be different for each of us based on our role and priorities .
In this article , we will review what digital transformation could mean for different roles in an organization ; but the best thing is to ask these three questions when there is a discussion about digital transformation
1 . What do you mean by digital transformation ?
2 . What are your objectives and how will we track progress ?
3 . How will these benefit the other parts of the organization and how will you get buy - in and collaboration ?
After we review the meaning of different definitions , we will provide a common , theoretical definition based on microeconomics and value chain analysis .
Theoretical definition will help us understand the impact of digital on our company and the overall market and forms the basis for developing your digital strategy .
Before we discuss the theoretical discussion , here ’s a summary of what we have heard when discussing digital transformation with different stakeholders .
It would be great if you can add your definition and priorities to the end of this article .
• for a CEO , it could mean the revenue share from digital products or channels and avoiding being the next Blockbuster or Toys R Us .
• for an Enterprise CIO , it could mean having a Digital Transformation group and leader working closely with the business and achieving continuous delivery and daily release capability similar to companies like Amazons , Netflix , and Google
• for a VP of Data , it could mean the ability to integrate multiple databases and answer data questions that were not possible before and that drive business outcomes
• for a VP of Infrastructure , it could be cloud and mobile first enablers implementation , multi-cloud management , l across the enterprise ,
• for a Chief Security Officer , it could mean defining Cybersecurity guidelines in the digital world , implementing DevSecOps and enabling agile Identity and Access management in the world of cloud , Internet of Things and digitization
• for an HR leader , it could be Workday implementation and using data tools to help employees with their career progress
• for a Salesperson , it could be the ability to do real - time lead scoring and predictive analytics on the Salesforce platform ,
• for a Marketing VP , it could mean implementing best in class digital marketing strategies , building end to end customer journeys and enabling algorithm driven , dynamic pricing models
• for a Developer , it could mean that the teams can use a Jira tool and they now have an agile team with a fully trained Scrum Master and full - time Product Owner from the business .
Combine this with how the vendors are defining and marketing digital transformation in ways that best fit their product and service portfolio , and you have even more definitions for digital transformation .
The theoretical definition of “ digital transformation ” based on microeconomics and value chain analysis is as follows :
“ Digital transformation is the creation , displacement or re-distribution of profit pools along the value chain of a market due to leveraging digital technologies and distribution that result in significant changes in supply and demand functions for a market ”
Three questions to answer based on this definition are as follows :
1 . How are digital technologies impacting distribution part of the value chain in my market ?
2 . How is digital changing the supply function in my market , whether through changing the cost base ( change in elasticity of the function ) or removing barriers to entry so that supply is greater ( parallel shift in supply function ) ?
3 . How is digital changing the demand function in my market such as my adding new value elements for the customers and increasing their demand ?
Exploring digital transformation
We define digital transformation as “ the creation , displacement or re-distribution of profit pools along the value chain of a market by leveraging digital technologies and distribution that result in changes in demand and supply functions for a market . ”
When considering digital transformation , we ask the following three questions :
1 . How is digital changing demand in my market such as adding new value elements for the customers and increasing their demand ?
2 . How is digital changing the supply function in my market ?
This can happen when the cost base changes or barriers to entry are removed so supply is greater .
3 . How are digital technologies impacting distribution part of the value chain in my market ?
Answering these questions forces companies to rethink their business models .
The creation of new capabilities can enable a faster pace environment , agility , and responsiveness .
These changes are often correlated with the assumption that companies will be better aligned to meet customers ’ needs and experience growth .
However , that is not always the case .
Not all digital technologies cause permanent and significant changes in the economics of markets .
When that happens , it is considered a digital disruption .
Driving digital disruption : digital distribution , demand , and supply
In the last 20 years , companies have experienced massive disruption .
Half of the names on the Fortune 500 list from the year 2000 no longer exist .
When full market disruption occurs , a few technology investments are no longer adequate , and a full digital re-invention response is required .
It requires an understanding of the elements that drove the disruption : demand , supply , and digital distribution .
Digital disruption happens when digital technologies impact all three drivers of digital distribution , demand and supply , and create a significant impact .
In some cases , the impact starts small and increases past a tipping point when key technologies mature so that adoption increases and cost goes down .
Understanding these concepts help companies begin their full “ Digital Reinvention ”
Digital disruption drivers for Uber and Netflix
Uber has disrupted the taxi transportation value chain by using digital technologies such as mobile phone Apps , geo-location capability for the “ last mile distribution ” of taxis to customers in a new way ( clicking a button and access to larger proximity vs. waving hands to taxis in proximity ) .
This has increased demand by offering new customer values such as safety ( reviews of drivers , location tracking ) , no money exchange ( payment on the App enabled by digital payment technologies ) and more certainty and shorter wait times ( knowing when the taxi will come , access to more cars outside of immediate location ) .
This has also increased supply since anyone with a car that qualified could enter the market , breaking existing barriers to entry such as taxi licenses .
The ability to serve the increased demand with increased supply ( decreasing prices ) resulted in customers capturing more value and changed their behavior .
Netflix disrupted the store - based movie rental market value chain by using digital technologies such as advent of DVDs that could be easily sent by mail as opposed to VHS cassettes , web - based online platform and a robust user interface for mailing DVDs for rent and then disrupted the movie distribution value chain by offering a streaming service , enabled by digital technologies such as a proprietary content distribution networks to serve large files , machine learning algorithms to deal with large amounts of data , cloud technologies to scale to thousands of servers and terabytes of storage within minutes and capacity improvements in Internet bandwidth and 4G ( LTE ) live streaming techniques to enable streaming consistently in multiple devices .
This has increased demand by offering customers new value such as convenience and speed ( on - demand movie vs. going to video store in the past ) , access to a larger selection of movies , ability to offer recommendations based on watch history and no late fees .
This has also increased supply since barriers to entry decreased as movie producers could now bypass major film studios and online platform removed the capacity constraints of a rental store .
Netflix also started adding to the supply of movies and shows by producing unique shows to increase customer stickiness on their platform .
Ripple effects of digital disruption on adjacent markets
Disruption does not just impact one specific industry .
It causes ripples in other markets in the form of concentric circles .
The new business model starts in one disrupted market and moves to other markets over time , impacting all the markets in the process .
That is why it could be difficult to estimate the impact of a disruption in a totally different market to your industry
In the case of Uber , adjacent markets felt the impact of digital disruption in taxi transportation market .
Business travelers have started to use Uber more and more instead of rental cars , decreasing demand for rental cars .
This “ on - demand ” service model extended far beyond transportation .
It created new markets where people can get their groceries and food delivered more easily .
Consumers can now even find house sitters , nannies , and hair stylists on demand and have those services delivered .
These new markets offer similar significant values of convenience , trust , and options to consumers , resulting in new demand functions .
Another impact of this disruption was that the taxi market supply - side became more competitive since Uber drivers had more options to deliver on - demand services .
As a result , taxi companies had more competition to recruit drivers and started offering large sign - on bonuses to new employees .
In the case of Netflix , this business model also created new markets in adjacent markets such as game rentals .
Gaming distribution companies such as Steam are offering online game distribution and many other benefits to impact the demand and supply functions , like how on - demand service providers such as Instacart , Grubhub , TaskRabbit , Wag are expanding Uber model in new markets using similar technologies .
Positioning companies for digital success
“ What can we do to protect our company from disruptive forces ?
And if disruption results in value chain changes in our market , how do we position ourselves for success ?
Here are a few tips .
1 – Increase awareness on the impact of digital technologies on digital distribution , demand and supply : Review the main and adjacent markets from the perspective of demand and supply functions .
Consider the disruption potential of digital technologies on the value chain .
To increase awareness , start with digital disruption .
2 – Apply and scale agile practices of tech companies to drive innovation and become customer - centric :
First used in software development , the application of agile practices can be applied to any industry .
When aligned with business goals , creating an agile environment can help a company create new opportunities to serve customers quickly and more efficiently .
Understanding and responding to customers ’ needs is the biggest protection against disruption .
3 – Make the right investments in disruptive companies : Blockbuster CEO personally invested in Netflix because he saw the potential for disruption , even though he underestimated its speed .
Many companies have corporate venture arms and innovation labs to invest in innovative companies .
However , these organizational constructs need to be able to make big bets based on the digital disruption impact potential of start - ups to their core business and such companies are not always in the same industry .
Adding clojure to an existing slime setup in emacs
The current recommended setup of emacs and slime with clojure is to have elpa handle all the dependencies .
As an alternative , you can start a swank server using either the swank plug - in for the leiningen build tool , or the swank plug - in for the maven build tool .
All of this advice is good , but I 've been using slime with sbcl and emacs for years and I do n't want to start from scratch just to add clojure .
In addition , rather than hand things off to a tool like elpa , I 'd like to install things myself , so I get to understand how the various pieces work together .
I 'm going to show how you too can use use the current cvs head for slime , and the current git repos for clojure , clojure - contrib and swank clojure to run clojure with slime and lisp .
I "ll provide a few helpful links to get more information on slime and swank .
As it turns out , there 's currently a bit of incompatibility between clojure and the slime package , but it 's minor and easy to work around .
A few words on slime 's architecture
Bill Clementson 's blog entry on slime brings together quite a few resources on slime .
It has this illuminating illustration of slime 's architecture taken from Tobias Rittweiler 's slime talk .
As you can see slime 's a client - server architecture .
Each lisp needs to implement the swank protocol in order to talk to the emacs client .
Swank clojure provides a swank implementation for clojure .
Typically you start a ' swank ' session of your lisp through emacs .
But you can also choose to start up a lisp , load it 's swank module , start a swank server and connect to it from emacs .
That 's the method used by the leiningen and maven plugins mentioned earlier .
This picture underscores that there are various pieces that work together through a shared protocol .
Emacs and Slime
I installed slime from it 's cvs repository in ~ / Tools / slime .
Slime 's _./ contrib_ sub - directory contains addons to enhance slime 's basic functionality .
In particular _slime - fancy.el_ groups a large set of these enhancements together so you do n't have to initialize each and everyone of them .
I " ll get back to this later on .
By the way , _./ contrib_ also contains swank implementations for ruby , mit-scheme and kawa .
Unfortunately none of these work satisfactorily .
The slime manual has a section on how to setup slime for use with multiple lisps .
This involves adding entries like this
( name ( progam progam - args .. ) & key coding - system init init- function env )
to slime - lisp - implementations .
name is the symbol used to identify the program .
( program program-args ... ) is used to start up the lisp in question .
The function specified by the keyword : init is used to instruct the lisp to start its swank server .
An entry in the emacs initialization file to enable multiple lisps with slime might look like this :
( add - to - list ' load - path " /home/fons/Tools / slime / " ) ( add - to - list ' load- path " /home/fons/Tools /slime / contrib " ) ( require ' slime ) ( slime - setup '( slime - fancy slime - asdf ) ) ( setq slime - multiprocessing t ) ( set- language - environment " UTF - 8 " ) ( setq slime - net - coding - system ' utf - 8 - unix ) ( setq slime - lisp - implementations '(( clisp ( " /usr/bin/clisp " " - K full " ) ) ( sbcl ( " /usr/bin/sbcl " ) ) ( abcl ( " ~/Tools / bin/abcl " ) ) ( ccl ( " ~/Tools/bin/ccl " ) ) ) ) ( setf slime - default - lisp ' sbcl ) ( global - set - key [ f6 ] ' slime )
First slime 's directories are added to emacs ' load - path .
After loading slime and adding a bunch of useful add - ons by loading slime - fancy , a few lisps are added to slime - implementations .
Some of them run from standard linux locations .
Others are started with a shell script .
slime - default - lisp i set to sbcl so that 's the default list that 's going to used when I just do M-x slime ( or hit f6 since I 've bound this command to this key ) .
The other lisps are started by invoking slime with a negative prefix argument , M-- M-x slime and selecting the name of the lisp in the slime - defaults - list .
If you 've never really worked with slime it might be good idea to set up at least a few lisps just to test out your setup and get you in the right mood for the additional hacking which needs to be done .
swank - clojure
I cloned the swank clojure git repository and build it .
I put all the clojure related specif components in a directory called " ~/ Tools / swank - clojure - enablers " .
The swank - clojure - autoload file is obviously not part of the git repository and needs to be generated .
After adding this
( defun swank - clojure - autoloads nil ( interactive ) ( let (( generated-autoload- file " ~/Tools/swank-clojure-enablers/swank-clojure-autoload.el " ) ) ( update-directory - autoloads " ~/Tools/ swank-clojure-enablers " ) ) )
to my init file M-x swank - clojure - autoloads can be used to generate swank - clojure 's autoload file .
As you can see in the source file for swank - clojure.el defadvice is used to add clojure to slime - lisp - implementations :
( defadvice slime - read - interactive - args ( before add - clojure ) ;;
Unfortunately we need to construct our Clojure - launching command ; ; at slime - launch time to reflect changes in the classpath .
Slime ; ; has no mechanism to support this , so we must resort to advice .
( require ' assoc ) ( aput ' slime-lisp - implementations ' clojure ( list ( swank - clojure-cmd ) :init ' swank - clojure - init ) ) )
What 's basically happening here is that the keyword ' clojure is added to slime - lisp - implementations .
The function swank - clojure - cmd starts up clojure and the function swank - clojure - init instructs clojure to start up a swank server .
All the heavy lifting as far as customizing your clojure environment is done in the swank - clojure - init function .
It basically sets up the class path and swank - clojure.el provides hooks to customize the start up phase .
Setting the class - path through swank - clojure - classpath .
The first time clojure is started it checks to see if the jar files are installed so that clojure can be run with swank .
If it does n't ' see ' the jars installed it will download a precompiled version of clojure .
jar , clojure - contrib .jar and clojure - swank . jar to ~/.swank - clojure .
My preference is to use the latest and greatest versions of the various libraries .
I also do n't like to have jar files put in locations where I can't really see them .
I 'd rather know explicitly what my dependencies are .
Luckily the class - path can be customized through the swank - clojure - classpath variable .
After I put some links in ~/ Tools / swankclojure - enablers / to the required jar files , I added this to my emacs initialization file :
( setq swank - clojure - classpath ( directory - files " ~/Tools / swank -clojure - enablers " t " . jar $ " ) )
This highlights an interesting difference with the other lisps .
I use asdf to load libraries into an already running lisp image .
I do n't need to set asdf's paths before doing starting the lisp repl .
in fact I can change the asdf search path after the repl has started .
With clojure you 're obviously a bit constraint in that you can't change the class path or load a library into the jvm at run time .
swank - clojure provides swank - clojure - project as an alternative way to load your class dependencies at startup .
It will kill your clojure repl , set the class path for your project and restart the clojure swank server .
Dealing with the hanging repl
If you start up clojure at this stage and enter something like (+ 1 2 ) at the cursor you "ll notice that the repl " hangs " .
Swank - clojure cannot handle some recent changes introduced to one of to slime addons .
The details can be found in the
in the swank - clojure group and slime mailing list
The bottom line seems to be that the clojure reader does n't handle the same collection of characters as other lisp readers .
Luckily this is limited to the autodoc component in .../ slime / contrib .
autodoc provides fancy markup in the echo area for the arguments of lisp functions .
If you can live without that , you can unload the autodoc component after slime - fancy is loaded .
Alternatively you can just use the slime - repl package when you initialize slime .
To summarize
This than is more or less my setup :
( add - to - list ' load - path " /home/fons/Tools/swank-clojure -enablers " ) ( add - to - list ' load- path " /home/fons/Tools / slime / " ) ( add - to - list ' load- path " /home/fons/Tools/slime / contrib " ) ( require ' swank - clojure - autoloads ) ( require ' slime ) ( slime - setup '( slime - fancy slime - asdf ) ) ( unload - feature ' slime - autodoc t ) ( setq slime - multiprocessing t) ( set- language - environment " UTF - 8 " ) ( setq slime - net - coding - system ' utf - 8 - unix ) ( setq slime - lisp - implementations '(( clisp ( " /usr/bin/clisp " " - K full " ) ) ( sbcl ( " /usr/bin/sbcl " ) ) ( abcl ( " ~/Tools / bin/abcl " ) ) ( ccl ( " ~/Tools/bin/ccl " ) ) ) ) ( setq swank - clojure - classpath ( directory - files " ~/Tools / swank -clojure - enablers " t " . jar$ " ) ) ( setf slime - default - lisp ' sbcl ) ( global - set - key [ f6 ] ' slime ) ( defun swank - clojure - autoloads nil ( interactive ) ( let (( generated-autoload- file " ~/Tools/swank-clojure-enablers/swank-clojure-autoloads.el " ) ) ( update-directory - autoloads " ~/Tools/ swank-clojure-enablers " ) ) )
Notice that I unload autodoc after slime is loaded .
While memory is a dry topic , many of you would have experienced Blender grind to a halt ( or worse ) , with big files the workstation ca n’t handle .
Yesterday Beorn was having trouble loading a scene which was taking a lot of memory , After concluding it was n’t a memory leak in blender I looked into why Blender would show 75 mb in use while the system monitor shows over 700 mb .
It turns out is because the operating system cant always efficiently deal with applications memory usage and ends up using a lot more ram .
So I tested jemalloc , an opensource drop - in replacement for the operating systems memory allocation calls , used by firefox , facebook and freeBSD according to their site .
I was surprised to find memory usage went down by up to 1gig in some cases , without noticeable slowdown , using less memory in almost every case .
It can also decrease render times in cases where the system starts to use virtual memory .
The first example loads a complex scene , and then a blank file , notice there is over 600 mb difference .
The second graph shows rendering the sintel model , I ’d like to have made a few more examples but do n’t have much time right now .
While testing we found Blender exposed a bug in jemalloc ’s thread - cache , Jason Evans was kind enough to look into the problem for us , fixing it the next day in bugfix version 1.01 .
JeMalloc is now used on every workstation , if all goes well we may include this with Blender as Firefox does .
For more info see : http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/
– Campbell
Notes …
Hoard was also tested , but it did n’t improve memory usage all that much .
Edited , now ‘ decrease rendertimes ’ .
Comparing against the default allocator in Linux ( modified ptmalloc ) , one could argue the problems is because of bad memory usage within Blender , from what I have read the default malloc in linux is quite good .
Nevertheless it may prove to be an advantage for us .
For anyone who wants to test on * nix , you do n’t need to rebuild Blender , just pre-load :
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libjemalloc.so blender.bin
Apple is reportedly developing yet another version of the iPhone for launch this summer , according to " people briefed on the matter " speaking to the Wall Street Journal .
On top of this news , the company is also preparing a CDMA version of the new device that will work with Verizon Wireless .
Rumors about Apple developing a fourth - generation iPhone for summer 2010 are neither shocking nor new — the company has made a habit of launching a new iPhone yearly around that time .
However , the news of a CDMA version coming from the vetted sources of the WSJ means that this particular element has likely progressed beyond just a rumor stage .
The timing aligns with previous rumors about a Verizon - compatible iPhone launching in the summer of this year , as well as the impending end of AT&T 's exclusivity in the US .
According to the newspaper 's sources , the fourth - gen GSM iPhone will be manufactured by one of Apple 's usual manufacturers , Hon Hai , while the CDMA version will be manufactured by Pegatron Technology .
If this is indeed true , how many of you plan to migrate to Verizon ?

Ben S. Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , warned Wednesday that an aging American population posed fiscal challenges for the United States .
In a rare foray into the realm of fiscal policy , Mr. Bernanke said the United States “ must begin now to prepare for this coming demographic transition . ”
Mr. Bernanke , speaking before the Dallas Regional Chamber , said that the economy was still fragile , and he made it clear that he did not expect the federal government to raise taxes or cut spending anytime soon .
But he spoke about the budget pressures posed by Social Security and Medicare with greater urgency than he has in the past .
“ The arithmetic is , unfortunately , quite clear , ” Mr. Bernanke said .
“ To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits , the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes , modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare , less spending on everything else from education to defense , or some combination of the above .
These choices are difficult , and it always seems easier to put them off — until the day they can not be put off any more . ”
Robert Gibbs wasted no time firing back at John Roberts who on Tuesday told a law school audience in Alabama that President Obama 's criticism of the court 's ruling in Citizens United was " troubling . "
Sam Stein reports :
In a statement sent to reporters , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that the only troubling thing was the 5 - 4 ruling by the court , which said that corporations could spend unlimited amounts of money advocating on behalf of candidates in elections .
Roberts leads the court .
" What is troubling is that this decision opened the floodgates for corporations and special interests to pour money into elections - drowning out the voices of average Americans , " Gibbs said .
" The President has long been committed to reducing the undue influence of special interests and their lobbyists over government .
That is why he spoke out to condemn the decision and is working with Congress on a legislative response . "
I must comment on Fr Adrian Egan 's assertions regarding Good Friday ( ' Priest saddened by vintners ' bid for holy day opening ' , Irish Independent , March 9 ) .
He says it his opinion that " the match should not go ahead " , never mind the pubs just opening .
This man needs to get into the 21st century .
First of all , if people wish to go down to the pub to watch rugby on Good Friday that 's their business , it is not the place of a Catholic priest to be dictating when and where we watch sport .
Nor is it the place of the State to be facilitating bans in favour of one religious group 's ideology over another .
That is bordering on discrimination against non-religious citizens .
As for " sacred " Good Friday , perhaps it is to practising Roman Catholics , but let 's be honest here , pubs open on Sundays and it does n't stop Catholics going to Mass , does it ?
It is utter nonsense that pubs can't open on Good Friday .
It is a throwback to the days when Rome ruled the roost .
Although , given recent events , that appears to still be the case .
Also , there is no reliable historic evidence that the event ever happened in the first place , and if it did then you can be pretty sure it was not specifically on April 3 .
Was n't the dating of Easter the reason for the split between Rome and the Orthodox church ?
Once again we have the spectacle of religion interfering in the everyday lives of the people , even those of us who are not interested in their beliefs .
If Fr Egan wants to stay at home and " reflect " then good for him , but do n't spoil it for everyone else .
Munster v Leinster is going to be a cracker of a game and Limerick could do with some good publicity for a change , not to mention the economic boost it brings .
I hope the pubs are open and everybody has a great day out .

I strongly support Fr Adrian Egan of Limerick who calls for a public debate on how people should approach Good Friday .
Could no other day have been found for this match or is nothing sacred anymore ?
Is secularisation to take over without a murmur from anyone ?
More consideration and respect should be given to the religious sensitivity of many of us on this island .

The father of a child with severe autism has developed technology to help him communicate .
Stephen Lodge said the idea for his Speaks4Me system came to him years ago but has been waiting for technology to catch up in order to make it a reality .
His eleven - year - old son , Callum , is non-verbal and uses his father 's invention to speak .
Speaks4Me was on show at Naidex 2010 - the annual disability exhibition at the NEC in Birmingham .
Mr Lodge 's system runs on any device that can run the Windows XP , Vista and Windows 7 operating system .
It uses the concept of dragging and dropping images from one area of the screen to another to form sentences .
The user then presses a speech button to " verbalise " the sentence .
" Callum has been using Speaks4Me for some time now and he has already been able to create some very expressive sentences , " Mr Lodge told the BBC .
Examples include , " I want a drink of juice " , " I want to go outside " , and " I feel tired " .
A look around the Naidex show Mr Lodge - who lives in South Yorkshire - has 20 years ' experience in technology and developed Speaks4Me after deciding that other products on the market were unsatisfactory for Callum .
He cashed in his savings and raised money on his property in order to finance the venture .
Speaks4Me is currently sold on a portable , touch screen media player imported from the Far East .
But the company is finalising a " software only " price which will mean that it can run on any Windows laptop , desktop or even an interactive plasma white board in schools .
Mr Lodge says that several people have already tried the system .
" It 's fabulous to see how such an exciting but simple concept is well understood by the children that have been introduced to it , " he said .
Mr Lodge estimates it takes half an hour or less to be able to understand and use the system .
He is also hoping that it will prove useful to stroke survivors - about a third of whom lose the ability to speak , either temporarily or permanently .
" Imagine waking up in hospital , not being able to speak : how would you ask for the toilet ? " he said .
Speaks4Me currently retails for about £ 2,000 .
Mr Lodge says his future plans include being able to put his software on other portable devices such as mobile phones and gaming handsets .
On call Also having its UK launch at Naidex was a French product called the Minifone .
The device can summon help and take incoming calls
It is being sold in the UK by Essex - based PivoTell which describes the product as the world 's smallest digital cordless phone .
Designed with older and disabled people in mind , the Minifone is worn like a wrist watch .
It can be used to summon help from three pre-programmed numbers and has the additional option of being connected to a call centre .
Provided that the landline has caller line identification ( CLI ) enabled , the Minifone will also display the date and time and the name or number of an incoming caller .
The Minifone uses a built - in speaker and microphone .
" The experience in France has been that - unlike alarm pendants which have a certain stigma attached - people find these quite attractive and so are more likely to be wearing them , " said Adrian Milne of PivoTell .
The device costs £ 150 and a subscription to the call centre is £ 10 per month .
Naidex 2010 was at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham from 20 - 22 April .

It is no secret that pro-copyright lobbyists are exploiting child pornography to get file - sharing sites pulled offline .
They have done so for years .
Their ultimate goal is to use child porn as an excuse to impose a global Internet filter , and with a new directive being presented in the EU their strategy seems to be paying off .
In 2007 , a year after the Swedish police raided The Pirate Bay ’s servers in Stockholm , there was a seminar in the same city titled ” Sweden — A Safe Haven for Pirates ? ”
There , in a room filled with like - minded souls , Johan Schlüter of the Danish Anti-Piracy Group took the stage with the ultimate plan to curb piracy .
” Child pornography is great , ” he said enthusiastically .
” It is great because politicians understand child pornography .
By playing that card , we can get them to act , and start blocking sites .
And once they have done that , we can get them to start blocking file sharing sites . ”
Where one would have expected an averse reaction from the public , cheers started to fill the entire room instead .
For years the music and movie industries have tried to convince politicians that piracy was killing their businesses , without much result .
Using child porn as an excuse could just be what they needed for an extra push .
” One day we will have a giant filter that we develop in close cooperation with IFPI and MPA .
We continuously monitor the child porn on the net , to show the politicians that filtering works .
Child porn is an issue they understand , ” Johan Schlüter told his fellow attendees .
In the months and years that followed , the pro-copyright lobby continued to put pressure on local governments and courts to disarm The Pirate Bay .
In Denmark , they had some success in court as a local ISP was ordered to block access to The Pirate Bay .
Increasingly , the child porn argument is used all around the world to get governments to implement state run Internet filters .
“ The big film and record companies want censorship of the net , and they are perfectly willing to cynically use child porn as an excuse to get it , ” Pirate Party MEP Christian Engstrom writes in brilliant a blog post discussing the issue .
Engstrom ’s comments are a response to the plans of Swedish EU commissioner Cecilia Malmström to build a European Internet filter .
As Engstrom also notes , a filter is only going to hide the real problem while the real offenders can easily bypass the restrictions .
Would n’t it be much better to track down the sources spreading the material and throw them in jail ?
Would n’t that be great ?

The heatsink reviewed here from ProlimaTech - the MK - 13 Multi VGA heatsink is designed to fit many various graphics cards and allow either quiet configurations or optimal cooling for users who want to push their graphics cards - in either case the card equipped with this heatsink should run cool judging from the sheer size of the main heatsink with six heatpipes spanning its length with moderately spaced fins for a balance between restriction and performance .
Fans are n't included , which allows users to customize the setup to their liking - up to four fans can be fitted on the heatsink as long as the case space allows - a bracket stretches out on which to mount the fans .
Closer look :
Looking at the box , a white outline of the MK - 13 is immediately visible with a camouflage look in the background .
Blue , black , green , and white colors are common on the box art .
The ProlimaTech name and website are both boldly presented on the front of the box along with the larger MK - 13 and Multi-VGA Cooler moniker .
A white line separates the picture and the company logo / part name .
Rotating to the back reveals a similar style - torn border at the top that separates ProlimaTech 's logo / website , MK - 13 , and Multi-VGA Cooler from the installation notes and features - Omni-Mount Retention System for installation on various VGA cards , supports a maximum of four fans , no fuss , easy no - tool installation , solder on all contact points for maximum heat transfer , exclusive Prolimatech Omni-Mount Retention System for installation on all major VGA cards including future VGA cards , six high - quality copper heat pipes , works with 12 cm duo fans ( not included ) for maximum cooling capacity , and Includes metal supporting cast to install two fans perpendicular to the VGA heatsink .
The heatsink is made in China .
The first side sports the graphics card compatibility list separated for ATI and NVIDIA graphics cards .
Starting with the NVIDIA list , both Geforce and Quadro are listed and range from Geforce 7800 series all the way up to Geforce GTX 285 and from the Quadro FX1400 all the way up to Quadro FX5600 .
The ATI side lists fewer - starting with the Radeon HD 3850/3870 and Radeon HD 4770 to Radeon HD 4890 , to the Radeon HD 5750 and Radeon HD 5870 .
In red at the top it warns : " to ensure a more steady installation , a chassis with at least 20 cm of width is strongly recommended . "
Oddly , the 9800GX2 is listed as supported although it is a dual GPU graphics card , which I think is an error .
Opening the box shows some plastic foam padding the heatsink for protection , with the manual on top ready for viewing .
Lifting the initial foam pad shows another formed pad that encircles the heat sink - more are underneath it and provide a ring of protection .
The large heatsink is finally revealed !
Mounting holes are visible , along with the heat pipes .
A protective bag and a sticker over the base also help keep the heatsink safe during the transition from shipping to installation .
With everything removed , users will find that several medium and small heatsinks were also included for cooling memory and the occasional hot spots as well as voltage regulation .
A backplate and many thumb - screws are also included , meaning a straight and easy installation , although most people will have already used tools to get their old graphics card cooling solution taken apart .
The mounting brackets for the fans are seen to the right .
Lastly , we have the user manual that lists the parts and numbers them accordingly in several languages and should be a good aid in installing the heatsink to a graphics card .
Time to get some close ups and get it installed !
Pretty much everything you need to know about President Obama and the budget deficit is contained within this chart :
The chart , which is based on Congressional Budget Office figures , shows something which is both incontrovertible yet known by very few people : Obama 's budget does not increase the long - term , or even the medium - term , budget deficit .
It reduces it slightly .
Most of the commentary castigating Obama for the deficit is an attempt to imply , usually without quite saying so , that Obama 's policies have caused the red ink .
This editorial from National Review is typical :
federal fiscal policy has now run completely off the rails ... what had been a chronic problem that all involved knew needed corrective action has now become , in the Obama years , a full - fledged disaster in the making ....
If the Obama budget is adopted in full , federal borrowing will top $ 18 trillion by 2020 .
Over the period 2011 to 2020 , the president ’s plan is to run deficits totaling an astounding $ 8.5 trillion .
Based on the writing of this editorial , NR 's editors know full well that Obama 's budget does not cause the fiscal disaster .
They are blaming him for failing to clean up the mess he inherited .
That 's a fair thing to blame him for , but it's not a serious enough crime to sustain the rhetorical fury .
So the NR has written the editorial in such a way as to lead its readers to the erroneous conclusion that Obama has caused the deficit .
It 's true that " If the Obama budget is adopted in full , federal borrowing will top $ 18 trillion by 2020 . "
What the editorial fails to say is what will happen to federal borrowing if Obama 's budget is not adopted .
We are supposed to think that the debt will be lower , but it wo n't .
It would be higher .
Chocolate ?
Now that is a tasty new treatment
Not such a sin : Chocolate is being hailed a superfood because of its antioxidants
Once regarded as a health sin , chocolate is now being hailed as a superfood because of the high levels of health - boosting antioxidants it contains .
Other ingredients include theobromine , which is good for the nervous system .
A recent study at Imperial College London showed chocolate can suppress persistent coughing .
Another compound , phenylethylamine , is thought to have a mood - boosting effect .
Meanwhile , antioxidants in chocolate are said to protect the skin against UV damage .
They also boost cardio - vascular health ( these health benefits all accrue from dark chocolate , as it is higher in cocoa solids ) .
In fact , so good is chocolate that it's no longer just a healthy indulgence - some doctors are now recommending it as a form of treatment .
Dr K.K. Atsina , formerly of the University of Ghana Medical School , has used cocoa powder 'as an adjunct to treatment of hypertension and diabetes in my clinic for a very long time ' .
Another Ghanaian doctor , Professor F. Kwaku Addai , writing in the journal Medical Hypotheses , describes how he recommends two to five cups a day to help protect against malaria .
' I used to get malaria at least once a year , ' he says .
' But since 2004 , when my family started drinking unsweetened natural cocoa mixed with hot water , we have not had it . '
He says other doctors use it to help with everything from eyesight to asthma .
Closer to home , patients of Professor Dan Reinstein , a top laser eye surgeon at Harley Street 's London Vision Clinic , are encouraged to eat 'as much as they can ' 30 minutes before surgery .
' Patients who eat chocolate prior to laser surgery are less jittery , more alert and more co-operative than those who receive sedatives , ' he says .
' For example , with a relaxed , attentive patient I can perform a routine procedure in less than three minutes .
' But the same procedure can occasionally take much longer if the patient is tense and worked - up . '
The natural high many experience after eating chocolate is not , it seems , just in our minds .
Professor Donatella Lippi , a medical historian at the University of Florence in Italy , has researched the history of cocoa .
She says : ' In the past few years , natural substances such as flavonoids - high concentrations of which are found in cocoa - have been considered as antidepressant treatments . '
Chocolate can also be used to balance low concentrations of brain chemicals , such as serotonin and dopamine .
These important chemicals are both involved in mood regulation , food intake and compulsive behaviours .
Eating a moderate intake of dark chocolate is also suggested by psychiatrists because of its antidepressant - like effect .
In fact , this therapeutic use of chocolate is ages old .
Professor Lippi says : ' In Europe , the relationship between chocolate and medicine dates back to Columbus 's voyages to the New World .
For example , in 1577 , Francisco Hernandez ( court physician to the king of Spain ) affirmed that chocolate was used to treat liver disease . '
In a treatise published in 1662 , Henry Stubbe , the personal physician to Charles II , reported that English soldiers who were in Jamaica lived on a diet of cocoa paste mixed with sugar which was then dissolved in water .
Stubbe noted that chocolate could also be used as an expectorant ( which can ease respiratory difficulties ) , a diuretic or an aphrodisiac .
It was also suitable for treating hypochondriacal melancholy .
In other words , just eating some chocolate can make you happy .

Although Blizzard made my most favorite favoritest bestest game of all time , Diablo 2 ... I never got in to Starcraft .
Even though I 'm a huge 40 k fan ( before Starcraft was around ) and a Sci - fi nut .
So I figured what the hell and tried the beta of this game thinking , I like modern RTS right ?
Maybe this will be the thing for me .
Well .
I felt the entire time that is was a throwback to the old days before RTS had developed any of the modern aspects that make a genre worth even playing .
Like they completely ignored all the modern changes to the genre that have improved it since their first game came out .
Primitive , absolute yawn fest with mediocre graphics ( Blizzard after all is not renowned for their cutting edge ... anything , but rather for their extremely long development cycles and polish of course . )
Anyway yeah .
Count me as one person who was unimpressed .
But it was n't a ' let down ' since I did n't expect anything .
I just was surprised that this game felt like something from circa 2002 , they completely ignored the 8 years in between in terms of potential of what RTS games can deliver .
Can we loot the corpses ?
Can we equip items from our fallen foes ?
Can we build bottlenecks out of destroyed terrain aiming carefully our heavy bombardment to destroy that tower causing it to block a crucial road ?
Maybe , but only if scripted ... can we take control of a single soldier and control him from 3rd person and snipe with him ala Men of War and Faces of War ?
Can we upgrade our team with item slots and relics dropped on the battlefield ala Dawn of War 2 ?
Can we specialize our units outside of general upgrades to our bases and unit producing hubs ?
The laundry list of things that would be great but are not here is gigantic .
The gaping hole in " what could have been " that is left is even widened further when put under scrutiny that this game was in development for about a decade .
5 times longer than the average FPS .
From a studio that is filthy rich to boot .
Filthy stinking rich with no limit to their resources they can tap or no talent they could n't acquire should they have the need .
And this ... this is what they deliver ?
I was at least expecting to be impressed somewhat as I 'm very easily impressed !
Nothing about this title other than the unit art impressed me and only then because I thought it was mostly " cute " , but nothing that special honestly .
But , I 'm assuming this is because they want to make this game for the fans of the franchise and those people do n't really want anything new and fancy but probably will be overjoyed to just simply have " more " of their original game with sparklier graphics and maybe a few new tricks and probably made all of their design decisions based around that understanding .
I can actually dig that since for instance , if they were to simply repackage the original Diablo 2 with slightly upgraded graphics but with more content to explore , I would be pleased as can be just with that so I can totally understand .
Just my coinage on this game .
I 'm busy all this coming weekend and probably wo n't read all the hatred that is forthcoming , but feel free to behead me etc ... but I may not even have time to respond so it might fall on deaf ears !
After two and half years of almost complete silence surrounding the third installment in the Deus Ex-series , Square Enix has released a new teaser - trailer for Deus Ex : Human Revolution , as the game is now officially known .
The teaser was shown at the Game Developer s Choice Awards and was revealed by industry veteran Warren Spector , designer of the original Deus Ex and its sequel .
Spector is not involved in the development or design of the newest installment .
It was recently announced that development of the game was ongoing at the Eidos Montreal studio , but that another studio owned by Square Enix would be responsible for the development of the CGI cutscenes found in the game .
The teaser itself shows the downfall of Icarus , as one of the first ‘ augmented ’ humans in history , followed by a scene of a enhanced human from the future .
The trailer can be found after the break .
The game will be released for PC , Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 , though a possible release window was not specified .
For more info , check out the official website .
In an interview with IGN , game director Jean - Francois Dugas stated that the game will not include a multiplayer mode , but that the developer will focus solely on delivering a unique single player experience .
More information will be made available at the upcoming E3 , which will be held from June 15 until the 17th in Los Angeles .
The map is almost uncannily similar to today's : a spray of black dots showing the recorded sightings of a foul grey haze spreading across Europe , from Helsinki to Naples , from Heligoland to Mallorca , and reaching eventually to Aleppo and Damascus – and all of it caused by clouds of ash from an immense volcano erupting far across the sea in Iceland .
But this was a map made from data collected in 1783 .
The volcano was called Laki , it erupted for eight dismal months without cease , ruined crops , lowered temperatures and drastically altered the weather .
It killed 9,000 people , drenched the European forests in acid rain , caused skin lesions in children and the deaths of millions of cattle .
And , by one account , it was a contributing factor ( because of the hunger - inducing famines ) to the outbreak six years later of the French revolution .
Great volcanoes have a habit of prompting profound changes to the world – very much greater in extent than the most savage of earthquakes and tsunamis , even though the immediate lethality of the latter is invariably much more cruel .
Though ground - shaking events are generally fairly local in extent , their potential for killing can be terrific : 250,000 died after the Tangshan earthquake in China in 1975 ; and a similar number died in the Indian ocean tsunami of 2004 .
Volcanoes seem by contrast relatively benign : the accumulated total number of deaths in all of the great volcanoes of the last 300 years has probably not exceeded a quarter of a million : the total number of casualties from a hundred of the biggest recent eruptions has been no more than those from a single giant earthquake .
But there is a signal difference .
Earthquakes and their aftershocks , once done , are done .
Volcanoes , however , often trigger long - term and long - distance ill - effects , which history indicates generally far outweigh their immediate rain of death and destruction .
Emanations of particles from the tiniest pinprick in the earth 's crust , once lifted high into the skies by an explosive eruption , can wind themselves sinuously and menacingly around the entire planet , and leave all kinds of devastation in their train .
They can disrupt and pollute and poison ; they can darken skies and cause devastating changes in the weather ; they can and do bring about the abrupt end to the existence of entire populations of animals and people .
Earthquakes and tsunamis have never been known to cause extinctions ; but volcanoes and asteroid collisions have done so repeatedly – and since the earth is today still peppered with scores of thousands of volcanoes ever yearning to erupt , they and the dramatic long - term effects of their eruptions are in fact far more frequent , far more decisive , and far greater than those that are triggered by any other natural phenomenon on the planet .
It is worth remembering that ours is a world essentially made from and by volcanoes .
They are creatures that will continue to do their business over the aeons , quite careless of the fate of the myriad varieties of life that teems beneath them and on their flanks .
Including , of course , ours .
There is perhaps no better recent example of the havoc that a big eruption can cause than that which followed the explosive destruction of Mt Toba , in northern Sumatra , some 72,000 years ago ( which , in geological time , is very recent indeed ) .
The relics of this mountain today are no more than a very large and beautiful lake , 60 miles long and half a mile deep – the caldera that was left behind by what is by most reckonings the largest volcanic explosion known to have occurred on the planet in the last 25 million years .
On the widely used volcanic explosivity index ( VEI ) , Toba is thought to have been an eight – meaning that in the unusually flamboyant official language of vulcanology it was a super - plinian type eruption with mega-colossal characteristics ( Eyjafjallajökull is by contrast listed as a strombolian type , with its characteristic regarded as merely gentle , and having a probable VEI rating of just two ) .
About 680 cubic miles of rock were instantly vaporised by the super - eruptive blast of Toba , all of which was hurled scores of thousands of feet into the air .
This this is what did the lasting damage , just as Iceland 's high - altitude rock - dust is doing today .
But while we today are merely suffering a large number of inconvenienced people and a weakening of the balance sheets of some airlines , the effect on the post - Toban world was catastrophic : as a result of the thick ash clouds the world 's ambient temperature plummeted , perhaps by as much as 5C – and the cooling and the howling wave of deforestation and deaths of billions of animals and plants caused a sudden culling of the human population of the time , reducing it to maybe as few as 5,000 people , perhaps 1,000 breeding pairs .
Many anthropologists believe that the event caused a sudden evolutionary bottleneck , with genetic implications that linger to this day .
Put more crudely , humanity was nearly wiped out by Toba , and only by the merest hair 's - breadth did our ancestors of 72,000 years ago manage to cling on and bequeath to us our current existence .
Mercifully , from humanity 's point of view , there have been very few Tobas known in planetary history .
They are probably so large that they reach the upper limit of the kind of eruptions that can physically occur on earth – one VEI - 8 event occurs only every 100,000 years or so .
Yet of those known to have occurred , two have taken place in Britain ( mainly because Britain has such a vast variety of geology , with almost every age of rock known in the world found somewhere between Cape Wrath and the Port of Dover ) .
They are comfortingly ancient : both – the volcano that created Scafell in the Lake District , and the other that gave us Glen Coe in the Western Highlands – took place more than 400 million years ago .
But others of the 47 known VEI - 8 volcanoes are more alarmingly recent .
Taupo in New Zealand erupted with mega-colossal force some 22,500 years ago .
The newer of the great eruptions that helped form the mountains of today 's Yellowstone national park in Wyoming took place just 640,000 years ago , and all the current signs – from such phenomena as the rhythmic slow rising and falling of the bed of the Yellowstone river , as if some giant creature is breathing far below – suggest another eruption is coming soon .
When it does , it will be an American Armageddon : all of the north and west of the continent , from Vancouver to Oklahoma City , will be rendered uninhabitable , buried under scores of feet of ash .
( I mentioned this once in a talk to a group of lunching ladies in Kansas City , soothing their apparent disquiet by adding that by " soon " I was speaking in geologic time , and that meant about 250,000 years , by which time all humankind would be extinct .
A woman in the front row exploded with a choleric and incredulous rage : " What ? " she said .
" Even Americans will be extinct ? " )
Ratcheting down the scale a couple of notches , to the only slightly less gigantic eruptions that are classified as VEI - 7 and VEI - 6 , and a host of more familiar eruptions come into view .
These include Santorini , the Aegean volcano whose destruction around 4,000 years ago may have triggered the collapse of the Minoan civilisation ; Laki , the 1783 Icelandic volcano mentioned above , and which most obviously parallels today 's events at Eyjafjallajökull ; the Javan volcano of Krakatoa , which erupted so infamously in August 1883 ; and the rather more profoundly world - affecting eruption of 1815 , also in the Dutch East Indies , of the huge stratovolcano on Sumbawa Island , known as Tambora .
Each of these had massive after - effects , and all of the effects were global in their extent .
Tambora is the most notorious , not least because it was so immense : almost 40 cubic miles of pulverised Sumbawan rock were hurled into the sky , which darkened , cooled and polluted a world that , unlike in Toba 's day , was already well populated and widely civilised .
The consequences ranged from the dire – a lowering of temperature that caused frosts in Italy in June and snows in Virginia in July , and the failure of crops in immense swathes across Europe and the Americas – to the frankly ludicrous – Irish migrants , promised better weather in New England , found it on landing to be every bit as grim as the Connemara and Cork they had left , and so either went home , or pressed on in hope to California .
And Tambora 's eruption had its effects on art also : a gloomy Byron wrote the gloomiest of poems , Darkness ( " Morn came and went , and came , and brought no day /
And men forgot their passions in the dread /
Of this their desolation . . . " ) ;
Mary Shelley , it is said , became so fed up with the rain while visiting Byron in Geneva that she followed suit and wrote her exceptionally gloomy novel Frankenstein .
Only JMW
Turner rose more cheerfully to the occasion : the lurid colours of many of his paintings , it is said , owe much to the flaming Tambora sunsets that had half the world astonished , and Turner evidently inspired .
Krakatoa 's immediate aftermath was dominated initially by dramatic physical effects – a series of tsunamis that were measured as far away as Portland Bill and Biarritz , a bang of detonation that was clearly heard ( like naval gunfire , said the local police officer ) 3,000 miles away on Rodriguez Island , and a year 's worth of awe - inspiring evening beauty – astonishing sunsets of purple and passionfruit and salmon that had artists all around the world trying desperately to capture what they managed to see in the fleeting moments before dark .
A Londoner named William Ascroft left behind almost 500 watercolours that he painted , one every 10 minutes like a human film camera , from his Thames - side flat in Chelsea ; Frederic Church , of America 's so - called Hudson River School , captured the crepuscular skies over Lake Ontario in their full post - Krakatoan glory ; and many now agree that Edvard Munch had the purple and orange skies over Oslo in mind when 10 years afterwards he painted , most hauntingly , The Scream .
Yet there was an important legacy to Krakatoa 's eruption that was not shared by the other giant volcanoes of the time .
Close mapping of the spread of the 1883 sunsets showed them girdling the earth in a curious set of spirals , the stratospheric aerosols evidently being borne around the world on high - altitude winds that no one at the time knew even existed .
An atmospheric scientist in Hawaii mapped them and decided to call the air current the equatorial smoke stream ; it later became , more elegantly and economically , the jet stream .
There has to be some irony that the jet stream that drives today 's Icelandic dust so dangerously over Britain and mainland Europe is a phenomenon that was first discovered as a direct consequence of the study of Krakatoa .
And yet , of all the consequences of the truly great volcanoes of the past , the phenomenon of mass extinctions of life must surely be the most profound and world - changing of all .
Between two and five major extinction events occur in the world every million years or so .
We humans have not thus far been privileged to observe one of them – hardly surprisingly , since they would probably occur so slowly as to be barely noticeable .
However , with painstaking care , palaeontological evidence is currently being amassed to link sudden and catastrophic changes in world climate , changes that promote such extinction crises , with the known major eruptions of the past , and with what are known as flood basalt events ( such as those that have been triggered specifically in the past by eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and her neighbouring volcano in Iceland , Katla , which is herself currently well overdue for an eruption ) .
It is a study that opens up a fascinating speculative possibility .
For what if the kind of event that we have seen this month , and which caused us all in Europe such commercial inconvenience , is in fact not just a minor volcanic hiccup , but the beginning of an event that causes in time a mass extinction of some form of earthbound life ?
And further , since we know from the history books that the massive eruption of Santorini once had the power to destroy one proud part of human society , what if the extinction we might be beginning to see turns out to be what will one day surely occur , and that is the extinction of us ?

One car barreled through a stop sign , struck a tree and landed upside down in a Texas lake , drowning four people .
Another tore across an Indiana street and crashed into a jewelry store .
A third raced at an estimated 100 mph on a San Bernardino County street before striking a telephone pole , killing a restaurant owner .
At least 56 people have died in U.S. traffic accidents in which sudden unintended acceleration of Toyota Motor Corp.
vehicles has been alleged , according to a Times review of public records and interviews with authorities .
Most died while doing the mundane : returning to work after lunch , shopping , driving to the bank to make a deposit .
The deaths occurred in big cities and small towns throughout the U.S. : Los Angeles ; Tucson ; Auburn , N.Y. ; Marietta , Ga .
The stories are told in court filings , federal accident complaints and police reports .
In the last decade , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received complaints of 34 fatalities related to sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles , far more than for any other automaker .
At least 22 additional deaths related to Toyota acceleration problems have been alleged in lawsuits and police reports .
The NHTSA database does not determine whether the complaints are valid , and none of the allegations have been proved in court .
Still , the increase in the number of people who publicly blame Toyota vehicles for deaths and injuries comes at a difficult time for the world ’s largest automaker , which in recent months has issued nearly 10 million safety recall notices on vehicles worldwide .
Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons declined to comment for this report , saying the company does not discuss cases in which litigation has been , or may be , filed .
The company has said it is confident that all models with potentially sticking pedals have been identified and that the recalls will address all problems .
In the last week , Toyota has become the focus of a U.S. criminal investigation related to its handling of safety issues ; its president apologized before a congressional committee ; and an internal memo was released in which Toyota executives boasted about saving money by averting recalls .
‘ Look of terror ’
Umni Suk Chung screamed , “ No brakes !
No brakes !
No brakes ! ” as her Lexus RX330 sped along the shoulder of the 10 Freeway in West Los Angeles on a deadly collision course .
Chung ’s luxury SUV was going nearly 80 mph when it smashed into a Mercedes sedan on the Overland Avenue exit ramp .
The Lexus overturned , killing Chung ’s sister - in - law , Esook Synn , who was seated in the back seat .
Chung and another passenger were badly injured .
A woman who said she witnessed the accident said that she could see a “ look of terror ” in Chung ’s face just moments before the Dec. 15 , 2008 , crash .
“ They looked like they lost control of the car .
The car did not look like it was decelerating at all , as if the accelerator was stuck or something , ” the woman wrote on the Los Angeles Fire Department website .
Chung and Synn , both Torrance residents , had been returning to work at a real estate office after having lunch at a Korean restaurant .
Synn , 69 , was survived by her husband , Kyung ; a son , Gordon ; and a daughter , Aimee .
“ It ’s heartbreaking for us to know how scared or terrified she must have been because of the way the accident happened .
It breaks our heart , ” Gordon Synn said .
Synn ’s relatives have retained an attorney , Larry Grassini , who said he believes an electronic system malfunction caused the vehicle to accelerate while rendering the brakes useless .
The Lexus RX330 is not among the models recently recalled by Toyota for problems linked to unintended acceleration .
Toyota officials analyzed data from the Lexus ’ “ black box ” and determined it was traveling 78 mph at the time of the crash , according to a report by the California Highway Patrol .
Eleven months after the crash , the Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office charged Chung with gross vehicular manslaughter without alcohol impairment as well as reckless driving causing injury , both felonies .
Now 62 , Chung faces up to six years in prison if convicted .
Before the accident , she had a clean driving record , according to the CHP report .
“ This case got filed and investigated before anybody knew about the problems with these Toyotas , ” said Richard Hutton , Chung ’s attorney .
“ It ’s been hell for her , ” he said .
“ She feels bad enough that people were hurt and a relative was killed .
Hopefully this case will get thrown out . ”
‘ My accelerator stuck ’
Paramedics found Juanita Grossman with both feet still pressing the brake pedal .
Alert but critically injured , she said her 2003 Toyota Camry had inexplicably accelerated March 16 , 2004 , as she left a drive - through pharmacy , racing across a busy street and slamming into a jewelry store in Evansville , Ind .
“ It was like a car on a slingshot .
She was slung across the street into that building , ” said her son , Bill .
Grossman , 77 , died six days after the accident at a local hospital .
In the days before her death , she described a car with a mind of its own , racing forward as she sat helpless behind the wheel , her feet jamming the brakes without effect , her son said .
“ First thing she said was , ‘ My accelerator stuck , ’ ” recalled her son .
“ She kept emphatically saying that the accelerator stuck on her . ”
Grossman is survived by two children , four grandchildren and two great - grandchildren .
The Indiana woman worked for an accounting company and was active in her church .
Her son remembered her as principled and thorough , making to - do lists and never forgetting a birthday or anniversary .
The 2003 Toyota Camry is not among the models recently recalled by Toyota .
After the accident , the family considered taking legal action against the company .
They decided against it , worried that the legal costs would overwhelm them .
“ It would ’ve been the giant versus the little guy , ” Bill Grossman said .
Holiday horror
On the day after Christmas 2009 , Monty Hardy and three members of his church were proselytizing in a Dallas suburb , spreading their faith door to door .
The four Jehovah ’s Witnesses were traveling in Hardy ’s 2008 Toyota Avalon about 30 mph on a residential street when the car suddenly accelerated , raced through a stop sign and left the road , crashing into a fence and tree and landing upside down in a small lake , according to a police report .
All four drowned .
Hardy , 56 , and his wife had recently received a recall notice from Toyota ; it said the car ’s floor mats could cause the accelerator to stick .
So the couple removed those mats and placed them in the trunk , said Randy Roberts , a Tyler , Texas , attorney who ’s representing Linda Hardy in a planned lawsuit against the carmaker .
The couple had also taken the car into a dealership to have problems with its acceleration system examined , Roberts said .
Investigators removed the box that records speed data and gave it to Toyota for evaluation , Roberts said .
The data showed the car was traveling at 47 mph when it hit the fence and at 45.5 mph when it hit the tree , the lawyer said .
“ It ’s an engine throttling at a stuck speed , ” Roberts said .
“ To me , it ’s pretty obvious that this was your classic acceleration problem .
The man had a perfect driving record .
He ’s out doing work for his church the morning after Christmas . ”
Fined for speeding
Jose Madrigal , a Mexican immigrant and devoted Catholic , made the sign of the cross each time he took a drive .
“ My father was not very comfortable getting in a car , ” Adelina Aguilera , his daughter , said recently .
On March 9 , 2009 , Madrigal was a passenger in a 2009 Corolla driven by his wife of 50 years , Adelina Madrigal .
His wife said she was driving on Florence Avenue when the car suddenly accelerated , even as she applied pressure to the brakes .
In order to avoid approaching cars , she swerved onto the wrong side of the road , struck a car and then crashed into a concrete wall beneath the 605 Freeway , according to a Downey police accident report .
Jose Madrigal , 89 , was critically injured .
He died March 25 from internal injuries .
“ My dad was in wonderful health .
He still mowed the lawn , had a great appetite , was very active , ” Aguilera said .
“ I expected to have my father around for a long , long time . ”
Downey police Officer Sean Penrose did not believe Adelina Madrigal ’s account of the accident .
He issued the 71 - year - old woman a ticket for speeding and wrote in his report that she must have applied the gas pedal instead of the brakes .
On April 15 , three weeks after her husband ’s death , she paid a fine for speeding and the case was closed , according to DMV records .
It was the first ticket Madrigal ever received , her daughter said .
“ My mom feels so guilty .
It ’s awful for her .
Her partner of 50 years , the person she was with no matter what , is gone , ” Aguilera said .
“ As a Catholic you ’re taught that everything happens for a reason .
That ’s what ’s getting her through .
That everything happens for a reason . ”
In the months to follow , Toyota issued two recalls for the 2009 Corolla , one for floor mats that could cause the accelerator pedal to stick and another for a gas pedal prone to sticking .
Close to home
On a Sunday morning in March 2004 , a friend picked up Ethyl Marlene Foster to drive her to church in Phoenix , Ore .
It was their routine .
Foster ’s husband , Clarence , waved goodbye to the 67 - year - old woman with multiple sclerosis and strolled back into the couple ’s residence inside the mobile home park he managed .
Moments later his phone rang .
“ There ’s been an accident in the park , ” the voice on the other end said .
He rushed out to find the 2004 Toyota Camry mangled against a nearby double - wide .
The force of the impact had moved the structure a foot .
Ethyl Foster was dead inside the car , just about 100 feet from her own front door .
Her friend was injured .
The driver would later explain that the car accelerated uncontrollably when she shifted the transmission to drive , causing it to slam into the mobile home , according to a report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
In addition to her husband , Foster is survived by four daughters , eight grandchildren and four great - grandchildren .
The 2004 Camry has not been included in any of Toyota ’s recent high - profile recalls .
‘ The car had a mind of its own ’
On the day after Thanksgiving in 2009 , Colleen Trousdale and her 10 - year - old granddaughter went out on a Black Friday shopping spree .
They were driving through a busy intersection in downtown Auburn , N.Y. , their car loaded with presents , when a 2010 Toyota Camry ran a red light and slammed into the driver ’s side of Trousdale ’s Ford Taurus , said Auburn police Lt. Shawn Butler .
Trousdale was pronounced dead at Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse .
She was 56 .
Her granddaughter escaped with minor injuries .
Police questioned the Camry ’s driver , 56 - year - old Barbara Kraushaar , as she was treated by paramedics .
The woman had run through three red lights and was driving 60 mph , witnesses estimated , before the crash .
“ The car had a mind of its own , ” she said , according to Butler .
Doctors would later conclude that Kraushaar had suffered a stroke , Butler said .
In an interview about a month after the crash , Kraushaar told police she had applied her brakes but could not stop the car , Butler said .
Police have not determined whether the stroke or mechanical failure , or both , caused the accident , Butler said .
The 2010 Camry is under two recalls , one for a floor mat that can cause the accelerator to stick and a second to replace a gas pedal blamed in some sudden - acceleration cases .
Concerned about the problems with the Camry , police invited the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate .
The agency removed the “ black box ” that holds data about the vehicle ’s speed and asked Toyota officials to download it .
The company reported that it is not capable of retrieving data from black boxes in 2010 Camrys , Butler said .
The information in that black box , Butler said , “ is the last piece of the puzzle . ”
Professional driver
Adegoke Abdul Aladegbemi was a professional chauffeur , employed to shuttle around diplomats for the Nigerian consulate in Atlanta .
On the evening of March 1 , 2009 , Aladegbemi had just picked up his 6 - year - old daughter , Julianna , at an office park in suburban Marietta , Ga. , when the 2005 Toyota Camry that belonged to the consulate sped through a stop sign at a T - intersection and plunged into an ornamental lake .
Witnesses waded in to assist , but the father and daughter were n’t freed from the vehicle until Cobb County emergency rescue personnel arrived a few minutes later and extracted them , alive but unconscious .
Aladegbemi , 57 , and his daughter were both pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital .
“ Abdul , it is hard to believe that your address now is in the heaven , ” the driver ’s friend , Marcio Silva , wrote in the online guest book for remembrances .
“ Brother Goke and Julianna , rest in the bosom of the Lord .
We love you , ” added another , Gbadebo Adebayo .
A consular official confirmed that the chancellery owned the car involved in the accident , and that it had filed a complaint with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
The official declined to discuss further details about the incident other than to assert that Aladegbemi was known to be a good driver .
The 2005 Camry has not been included in any of the recent Toyota recalls .
Beloved matriarch
Noriko Uno left her Upland home on Aug. 28 , 2009 , to do some grocery shopping and deposit the latest receipts from the family ’s sushi restaurant .
Her errands were all within a mile of her home .
She was driving south along Euclid Avenue at about the 30 mph speed limit when her 2006 Toyota Camry suddenly sped up to nearly 100 mph .
Witnesses reportedly told police that they saw the 66 - year - old woman tearing along the eastbound lane of the suburban roadway , gripping the steering wheel , her face frozen in terror , trying to steer out of traffic and away from pedestrians .
The car struck a telephone pole and then careened into some shrubbery .
It became airborne and came to rest after crashing into a large tree .
When emergency workers extracted her body from the wrecked vehicle on that Friday afternoon , they noted the hand brake had been pulled up in a last - ditch attempt to halt the speeding car .
Reeling from their loss , Uno ’s husband , Yasuharu , and adult son , Jeffrey , at first were mystified as to what could have caused the normally cautious bookkeeper to be traveling at such a dangerous speed .
Then they learned details of the runaway Lexus accident in San Diego that took the lives of a California Highway Patrol officer and his family on the same day that Uno died .
Yasuharu and Jeffrey now presume that unintended acceleration caused the fatal accident that killed their family ’s beloved matriarch .
They filed a wrongful - death lawsuit against Toyota on Feb.
4 -- a painful decision , according to their lawyer .
“ They ’re a Japanese family .
They ’ve owned nothing but Toyotas .
They would have liked to see the jewel of the auto manufacturing society not tainted in any way , ” said Garo Mardirossian , the family ’s attorney .
The 2006 model Camry is not included in any of Toyota ’s recent high - profile recalls .
“ Seven witnesses saw this car rocketing down Euclid doing 100 mph with a woman behind the steering wheel frantically trying to steer out of harm ’s way , ” Mardirossian said .
“ She had pulled the hand brake all the way up .
Unfortunately , people do n’t know that the hand brake is only good if you ’re not going so fast . ”
The Unos still own two Toyotas .
Times researcher Zohreen Adamjee contributed to this report .
People who use microblogging sites like Twitter are used to URL - shortening services like Bit.ly , Tr.im , and Tinyurl.com .
But apparently those sites are not “ conservative ” enough , so the Republican party launched their own URL - shortening service on Monday called GOP.am , but with an annoying twist .
When someone clicks on a GOP .am shortened URL , it displays the original page , but with a GOP toolbar across the top and bottom of the page ( this toolbar does n’t go away , even if you click on a link to go to a new page ) .
It also has an animated Michael Steele , who walks around the bottom right of your browser window and even talks , as if he is showing off the web page .
So , what do you suppose happened next ?
Those damn liberals took advantage of this service to point to hundreds of sex sites .
The best part was that Steele was saying “ Notice something different ? ” on this page .
But wait , there ’s more !
As a funny followup fail , the GOP took the service down on Tuesday in order to clean out the pornographic URLs , and when they brought it back up it had a warning “ If you use GOP.am for spamming , illegal purposes or to promote lude content , your GOP .
AM URL will be disabled . ”
They probably meant to use the word “ lewd ” not “ lude ” but then maybe they have been laying on the drugs a little too heavily lately .
I came across the noxious concept of " lying for justice " when I was hanging out ( albeit briefly ) at the City University of New York 's graduate school of political science back in the 1980s .
The idea of some progressives is that it is necessary to exaggerate a problem in order to get attention from policymakers and funders .
" Sometimes you have to shout just to be heard , " was another way it was explained to me .
Well , kudos to the New York Times yesterday for reporting on the front page a similar attempt by advocacy groups to suppress scientific information that they believe would harm their cause .
First , the good news — global maternal mortality has fallen from 526 , 300 in 1980 to 342 , 900 in 2008 , as reported in the current issue of the Lancet .
The number dying is still too high , but progress has been made .
However , some advocates wanted this information to remain buried .
As the Times explained :
… some advocates for women 's health tried to pressure The Lancet into delaying publication of the new findings , fearing that good news would detract from the urgency of their cause , Dr. Horton said in a telephone interview .
" I think this is one of those instances when science and advocacy can conflict , " he said .
Dr. Horton said the advocates , whom he declined to name , wanted the new information held and released only after certain meetings about maternal and child health had already taken place .
He said the meetings included one at the United Nations this week , and another to be held in Washington in June , where advocates hope to win support for more foreign aid for maternal health from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Other meetings of concern to the advocates are the Pacific Health Summit in June , and the United Nations General Assembly meeting in December .
" People who have spent many years committed to the issue of maternal health were understandably worried that these figures could divert attention from an issue that they care passionately about , " Dr. Horton said .
" But my feeling is that they are misguided in their view that this would be damaging .
My view is that actually these numbers help their cause , not hinder it . "
For shame !
Matt Ridley offers some sharp comments on this misbehavior over at his new blog , The Rational Optimist ( which just happens to be the title of his forthcoming book ) :
This is wrong on all sorts of levels .
First , because it shows a staggering arrogance among pressure groups about who should be allowed to know the facts — almost amounting to attempted fraud .
Second , because the way to encourage people to fund projects is to show evidence that they work , not that they are futile and ineffective .
One might almost suspect that these groups would prefer maternal mortality to remain high .
In order to forestall future attempts of this type , the editors at the Lancet should call out the groups that tried suppress this good news .
Name names !

UPDATE III : The Republican National Committee has fired the staffer behind a nearly $ 2,000 charge for a night at a Los Angeles “ bondage - themed ” bar , Politico reports :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This was not an RNC sanctioned event and was not associated in any way with any RNC official event , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â RNC Chief of Staff Ken McKay wrote of the February outing to Voyeur , a West Hollywood club modeled after the risquÃ ƒÂ© Tom Cruise - Nicole Kidman movie Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ Eyes Wide Shut.Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
McKay wrote that the fired staffer , who is not named in the email , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ was aware that this activity was not eligible for reimbursement and had been previously counseled on this very subject .
Accordingly , that staff person has been terminated .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â McKay also wrote that the donor who was reimbursed for footing the bill at Voyeur , Erik Brown , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ has verbally agreed to repay the funds to the RNC .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
A source with knowledge of the situation said Brown , a church - going mid-level political operative , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ was not entirely thrilled with the venue that people ended up at , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  but nonetheless agreed to foot the bill after the RNC staffer in question told him the committee would reimburse the cost .

UPDATE II : A California political consultant has said he was behind the $ 1,946 charged to the Republican National Committee for an evening at a “ bondage - themed ” topless bar in L.A .
A report at the Daily Caller , published Monday , had suggested it may have been RNC Chairman Michael Steele who had spent that money .
The RNC released a statement after the report , denying that Steele had been there that night .
According to CNN , Erik Brown , president of Dynamic Marketing Inc. , was the person who was reimbursed nearly $ 2,000 that was spent at the topless bar .
Brown has reportedly said that he will return the money to the Republican Party .
“ It ’s not clear why the RNC re-imbursed Brown for the charges or who else was with him at the club , ” CNN reported .
UPDATE : The Republican National Committee is denying that it was party chairman Michael Steele who spent nearly $ 2,000 at a “ bondage - themed ” topless bar in L.A. — but the party does n’t deny it reimbursed costs for someone ‘s visit to the racy establishment .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We are investigating the expenditure in question , ” the RNC said in a statement quoted at TalkingPoints Memo .
“ This was a reimbursement made to a non-committee staffer .
The Chairman was never at the location in question , he had no knowledge of the expenditure , nor does he find the use of committee funds at such a location at all acceptable .
Good reporting would make that distinction crystal clear .
The committee has requested that the monies be returned to the committee and that the story be corrected so that it is accurate . ”
The statement also said that a story at the Daily Caller , published Monday morning , “ willfully and erroneously suggests that the expenditure in question was one belonging to the Chairman [ Michael Steele ] . ”
Reporter Tucker Carlson , who is editor - in - chief of the Daily Caller , responded on Monday afternoon by writing that the RNC ’s protests against the story “ lack substance . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Despite claims to the contrary , no one from the committee has ever explained the specific circumstances of any of the expenses listed in its most recent disclosure filings , ” Carlson wrote .
Our questions remain :
Why did the committee spend more than $ 17,000 on private jets in the month of February ?
How and why was RNC business conducted in a bondage - themed nightclub , and how and why were the nearly $ 2,000 in charges that resulted approved by RNC staff ?
To be clear :
We did not claim that Michael Steele personally visited Voyeur West Hollywood .
In fact , and unfortunately , we still know almost nothing about that trip , including its purpose .
If the RNC provides details , weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll put them on the site immediately .

ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS BELOW
Adding fuel to the fire already raging around Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele , a little - noticed expense in the Republican Party ’s 2010 budget includes a nearly two thousand dollar tab for a bondage - themed bar in West Hollywood , according to a report on Tucker Carlson ’s new politics website .
The report cites figures from a new Federal Election Commission filing .
According to the records , Steele dropped $ 1,946.25 at topless bar Voyeur West Hollywood , which the article notes is a “ bondage - themed nightclub featuring topless women dancers imitating lesbian sex . ”
On the same California trip , the records say , Steele spent $ 9,099 at the Beverly Hills hotel and $ 6,596 at the Four Seasons .

A review of the Voyeur club sums up the experience thus : “ In Los Angeles , it takes a lot to shock and awe .
When you walk into Voyeur on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood , you might not be completely shocked at the almost naked women writhing on each other but you will undoubtedly be in awe . ”
“ The walls are also lined with black and white pictures of beautiful naked girls from decades past while temptresses wearing nothing more than pasties and a black thong Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ stretchÃ¢â‚
¬
Â  on tables or in large glass boxes , ” the review adds .
“ Yes , the women do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t strip or show off their outdone go - go girl dance moves .
Instead , they hold onto ropes on the walls and literally stretch , like yoga class but much sexier ( and probably more naked ) . ”
Steele also suggested that the Republican Party buy its own private jet , according to aides quoted in the piece .
And even though the Party has n’t bought its own jet , the chairman continues to travel in style .
“ According to federal disclosure records , the RNC spent $ 17,514 on private aircraft in the month of February alone ( as well as $ 12,691 on limousines during the same period ) , ” Daily Caller ’s Jonathan Strong writes .
“ There are no readily identifiable private plane expenses for Democratic National Committee chairman Tim Kaine in the DNCÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s last three months of filings . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ RNC trips to other cities produced bills from a long list of chic and costly hotels such as the Venetian and the M Resort in Las Vegas , and the W ( for a total of $ 19,443 ) in Washington , ” Strong adds .
“ A midwinter trip to Hawaii cost the RNC $ 43,828 , not including airfare . ”
The high - flying RNC chairman declined to comment for the piece .
Attack pieces on Steele have mounted in recent months , oftentimes a seeming product of angry Party donors .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I know that Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦ regular ongoing use of planes was something that was looked at , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â one person in the piece is quoted as saying .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I canÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t speak to how serious those inquiries were .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
SteeleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s spokesman , Doug Heye , did n’t deny the RNC had discussed buying its own airliner .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know what somebody might have discussed or might not have discussed , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he says in the piece .
Tuesday , February 2 , I started a year - long commitment to a discipleship group , mentored by Bob Chisholm , one of the ministers at my church .
It ’s Bob and 3 guys , and he meets with 4 different groups each on a separate day of the week , at 5:30 am .
So while I meet with him once a week , he meets with 4 groups of 3 every week , which I think is very cool because that ’s 12 guys , just like Jesus .
Anyway , in our daily scripture reading I came across something incredibly fascinating that I just had to share .
Philippians chapter 3 is a very uplifting chapter .
Paul describes his previous life and how he had considered works of the flesh to be his righteousness .
He talks about how he has left everything for the Gospel and even considers what he ’s lost as nothing compared to the glory of Christ which he has been given .
It ’s a beautiful passage for certain , that is , until you read it in the original Greek and find that it ’s highly offensive .
Here ’s the passage as it ’s translated in the NIV .
What is more , I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord , for whose sake I have lost all things .
I consider them rubbish , that I may gain Christ … – Philippians 3:8
Is n’t that nice ?
Paul considers the things he ’s lost as rubbish .
The Greek word translated as “ rubbish ” is skybalon , but that ’s not the most accurate translation of the Greek .
Skybalon is a dirty word in Greek , and our lovely wholesome translators have really dulled the translation down .
What does it mean ?
The NET Bible translates it as “ dung ” , which is still not quite the full meaning .
The NET Bible note on verse 8 ’s “ dung ” says :
The word here translated “ dung ” was often used in Greek as a vulgar term for fecal matter .
As such it would most likely have had a certain shock value for the readers .
This may well be Paul ’s meaning here , especially since the context is about what the flesh produces .
Paul swears in his letter .
This was n’t like saying “ I consider them poop , ” or “ I consider them fecal matter ” , no it was much worse than that .
Skybalon was a vulgar term !
It has been found in ancient graffiti and in manuscripts linking it as pure profanity !
Paul purposefully uses a vulgar and offensive term in his letter in order to grab the attention of his readers and get into their faces .
But this is n’t the only place he ’s been known to get up into people ’s faces .
He does it in Romans as well .
What shall we say , then ?
Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase ?
By no means !
We died to sin ; how can we live in it any longer ?
– Romans 6:1-2
What the NIV translates as “ By no means ! ” is the Greek “ Me genoito ” which is the strongest Greek idiom to indicate repudiation ( refusal to accept and implies a casting off or disowning as untrue , unauthorized , or unworthy of acceptance ) and even conveys the idea of outraged indignation .
In other words , it was equivalent to today ’s “ hell no ! ”
Of course , this is n’t anything new .
The Tanakh has a few places of questionable language itself , such as when Rehoboam consults his friends to decide if he will listen to the people or not .
His friends ’ advice is rather startling .
The young men who had grown up with him replied , “ Tell these people who have said to you , ‘ Your father put a heavy yoke on us , but make our yoke lighter ’- tell them , ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father ’s waist .
– 1 Kings 12:10
Once again our Bible translators are so nice as to dull the eye - popping response of the friends .
The literal Hebrew says , “ - say unto them , ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father ’s loins ” .
What ’s the implication here ?
You get the picture , and you can see why Rehoboam ’s friends gave such poor advice : they ’re talking about penis size !
Yikes !
So what ’s the point in all of this ?
Why does Paul use such striking language in his letters , and even profanity ?
The Bible uses language which will grab its readers and widen their eyes .
If it can make you uncomfortable , you ’re listening with a different focus than if you ’re emotionally unaffected .
For Paul , he wanted it to be crystal clear about what his past life of works - righteousness meant to him .
It was n’t merely garbage , no , and it was n’t poop .
He considered it all pure s**t [ edit : censored on request by my wife ] .
If that last sentence I wrote does n’t make you uncomfortable – perhaps a bit squeamish in your chair – then you need to seriously ask yourself why .
Of course it made you uncomfortable to read that on this nice religious blog , and for the Apostle Paul to be saying it in a letter considered to be Holy Scripture ?
Even moreso !
But that ’s the very effect he wanted .
He wanted it get awkwardly silent in the room right after they read the Greek word skybalon .
Can you feel the tension as people look at one another with awkward glances ?
Can you hear the silence as everyone stops breathing for just a moment ?
Can you see the confusion as they all want to look at the letter and see for themselves if the reader read it right .
“ How could it be ? ” they ask themselves .
How could Paul , the very one who wrote to the Ephesian church not to let any unwholesome talk come out of their mouths , write such a thing ?
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths , but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs , that it may benefit those who listen .
– Ephesians 4:29
How could he say that ???
The answer is simple .
In this case , Paul ’s carefully planned use of a single vulgar word brings any who subscribe to works - righteousness out of their hard shell .
His vulgar word breaks through it and suddenly they hear his words for what they are .
Was his talk unwholesome ?
Yes .
But was it helpful for “ building up others according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen ” ?
I would say yes , a resounding yes .
But also notice that Paul does n’t do this often .
He does n’t lace his sermons and letters with swear words .
He gets mad , for instance with the Galatians for being so ignorant ( Gal 3:1 ) , but he does n’t “ cuss them out ” for it either .
Paul ’s use of this one vulgar word is not an excuse to go crazy .
It ’s not an excuse to start sounding like the world ( e.g. such as today where some use the f - word like a comma ) .
But can the occasional offensive word be used strategically to reach people and even to “ build them up according to their needs ” ?
I ’d say yes , but with one caveat : be careful with when and how you use it .
I ’m sure Paul thought for a long time before asking his scribe to pen that word into his letter and I ’m sure it was n’t an easy decision .
Do not be flippant in the use of vulgar words with the excuse of trying to reach people .
If you use them too often , you will lose your credibility as a set - apart follower of the Messiah , and the shock factor is dulled beyond use .
Of course , you can reach people without the use of vulgar words too .
But for everything , there is a season ( Ecc 3:1 ) .
It ’s certainly something to think about .
Peace to you ,
James
Nevada Federal Credit Union has too much money and does not know what to do with it .
Worse yet , sitting in cash is costing the credit union money .
Insurance premiums are the culprit .
On top of any deposit premium paid to customers , insurance runs .4 % .
Yet short term treasuries yield .25 % .
Nevada Federal sees no good lending opportunities so it is paying customers to close accounts .
Inquiring minds are reading Credit union : Pul - lease take your money .
Nevada Federal Credit Union has a deal for big savers : Withdraw your money and you 'll get a bonus .
The credit union is investing in short - term Treasurys and earns about one - quarter of 1 percent on those government securities on average , but it was paying 0.4 percent to customers with savings .
In addition , the credit union expects the National Credit Union Administration to boost deposit insurance premiums by 0.15 percent to 0.4 percent this year .
For each $ 100 million in deposits , that premium increase will increase Nevada Federal 's costs up to $ 400,000 yearly , Brad Beal , chief executive officer said .
Starting Monday , the credit union has cut the variable interest rates on deposits held by members that only save money to zero .
" We 're losing money , and they are not making money , " Beal said .
So the credit union will pay these savers a $ 25 bonus for withdrawing amounts between $ 25,000 and $ 49,999 .
The bonus jumps to $ 50 for amounts up to $ 74,999 and goes to $ 75 for larger sums .

* Split in a client and server part ( Client part does n't import
ghc-api )
* Compiles with GHC 6.12
* Many bug fixes and little enhancements
* Unstable and very limited Yi mode ( vim bindings only for now )
Not new but worth mentioning :
* < Ctrl > < Enter > evaluates current line or selection in GHCi
* < Ctrl > R adds missing imports
To building Leksah yourself :
* You need GHC 6.10 or 6.12 installed .
The preferred way is current
Haskell platform .
* You need Gtk2 Hs including the GtkSourceView2 package .
( Currently gtk2hs has no release for 6.12 .
On Linux we suggest you
use the darcs version and install it via cabal install )
* cabal install leksah
* leksah
Making a Gtk application look nice on Windows and OS X is not easy so
we recommend using one of these prebuilt binaries :
http://leksah.org/packages/leksah-0.8.0.6.exe
( Windows )
http://leksah.org/packages/leksah-0.8.0.6.dmg
( OS X )
( Installation of gtk2hs for the development of gtk2hs apps is not done
by these installers .
Please consult
http://leksah.org/download.html for
more details about installation !
Background information can be found in
the Leksah manual : http://leksah.org/leksah_manual.pdf.
Known bugs and problems :
* If you have installed an earlier 0.8 version please delete your
~/.leksah-0.8/prefs.lkshp and ~/.leksah-0.8/prefscoll.lkshp
* The server may occasionally allocate much memory , which has been
observed on Windows .
You can simply
restart leksah ( of leksah - server if you have started it separately )
* leksah do n't run with ghc - 6.12.2

The 0.6 version introduces a debugger mode .
This mode can be switched on and off from the toolbar .
In debugger mode expressions can be evaluated and the type of expressions can be shown .
The GHCi debugger is integrated , so that breakpoints can be set , it is possible to step through the code and observe the values of variables .
Other features of Leksah like building in the background and reporting errors on the fly work in debugger mode as in compiler mode .
Another new feature is integration of grep and text search with regular expression .
This can be accessed from the findbar .
The GUI framework has been enhanced , so that layouts can be nested in so called group panes .
This feature is used for the debugger pane .
Furthermore notebooks can be detached , so that Leksah can be used on multiple screens .
A lot of little enhancements has been made and numerous bugs has been fixed .
Look in the manual for further information
GHC 6.10.2 Leksah does work with GHC version 6.10.2 !
But currently you have to get the repo version of gtk2hs and compile it ( darcs get -- partial http://code.haskell.org/gtk2hs/)
In the gtk2hs repository the problems with changes on finalizers have been resolved .
Currently you have to change Cabal ==1.6.0.1 to Cabal >= 1.6.0.1 in the leksah.cabal file by hand .
So you have to install leksah with runhaskell Setup configure ( - - user ) ...
We will fix this with the next release .
2009/04/02 Release 0.4.4.1

BBC News , Mumbai
International development aid is one part of the UK budget unlikely to be cut in a squeeze on public finances .
But questions are being asked about how aid is used , and which countries need it .
India last year got almost £ 300 m from the UK , some of it spent on toilets in the country 's financial capital , Mumbai .
Streams in the slums are often used as toilets
The stench from the stagnant , fetid stream of the Queresh Nagar slum in Mumbai hits you as soon as you get out of the car .
The slum itself is bustling and vibrant .
There is a line of shops with living quarters above .
The stream is behind , the water a murky grey with insects buzzing on top .
Some residents have rigged up filthy plastic covers at the back of their homes for privacy .
But the children scamper around using the stream , or whatever ground they can find on the disused rail track behind , for a toilet .
" We have to live in these conditions , " says La La Nawab Ali , who is showing me around .
" What can we do ?
You can see the state of it .
This is Mumbai . "
In another slum at Munjul Nagar , residents show letters , many signed with thumb prints , asking the authorities to finish building a toilet block that has been left half - finished .
A similar stench pervades the air .
" It 's an extremely difficult and helpless situation , " explains Prasad Shetty , an urban planning consultant .
" It 's an extremely embarrassing undignified demeaning kind of experience for them . "

Most of the funding for the sanitation project initially came from the World Bank and was then was taken over by the Mumbai government .
A small amount of British aid goes from the UK Department of International Development ( DFID ) through charities in England and India , mainly to train people to maintain their community toilet blocks .
But many in the slums say they know little or nothing about it .
" You foreign people from over there , you keep on sending so much money , " says one angry slum resident .
" But the poor person sees nothing . "
No water Central to the scheme is building blocks of public toilets that can be used by the millions of people presently living with no sanitation .
India plans to spend more than US $ 1 bn on its space programme next year
Most of the blocks built so far work , but evaluators say there have been problems with about a third of them .
Some have been built with no water supply .
Some are not being maintained .
One in the Queresh Nagar slum had to be pulled down because it was unsafe .
The one in the Munjul Nagar slum has been left half - built because of objections from a developer .
" And somebody even sells the toilets , " explained Jockin Arputham , founder of the National Federation of Slum Dwellers .
" Sometimes they might have been sold to somebody for a premium . "
When asked if that was corruption , he replied : " That is it .
It is known to everybody . "
The dynamics of the Indian slums are almost impossible for outsiders to fathom .
With the Mumbai city authorities spending large sums on other infrastructure projects , questions are being raised as to whether British money is still needed .
Last year Britain gave almost £ 300 m ( US$ 500 m ) to India in development aid .
But India plans to spend more than US $ 1 bn on its space programme next year .
" The Mumbai government does not require British taxpayers ' money , " says Mr Shetty .
" It has money .
The government institutions are loaded with money . "
Jockin Arputham agrees that India is rich enough to fund the sanitation programme itself .
It is a question of priorities .
" If it were up to me , I would personally say I do n't need [ British aid ] . "
An International Development Committee report released in the UK this month highlighted the issue : " At a time of austerity and a search for savings in the public sector , " it said , " it is essential that every pound of public money spent on development assistance has a measurable impact . "
Behind the glitter Britain is about to stop its aid budget to China , which is now seen as being too rich to need it , putting India and other emerging economies under the spotlight .
Both the main political parties in the UK parliament say they would protect the almost £ 6bn aid budget from cuts .
One sanitation block has been left half - built
But the Conservatives say they want the way this money is spent to be far more transparent and independently accountable .
" The British taxpayer is not going to be satisfied with politicians and members of the development establishment saying his money is being well spent , " says Conservative development spokesman , Andrew Mitchell .
" They want it independently evaluated outside that system . "
Liberal Democrat development spokesman , Michael Moore , also wants a closer watch : " We understand that people are very concerned about money disappearing through corruption , " he says .
" But too often that corruption exists in some of the poorest countries in the world with the poorest systems .
We 've got to help those countries become better stewards of that money . "
But the government development minister , Gareth Thomas , insists such measures are not necessary .
" We have a series of checks on how our aid is spent .
Every programme is evaluated on an annual basis , " he says , adding : " Look behind the glitter because there are very different Indias with many poor people living in the slums in Mumbai .
" We believe that some of our aid should be used to help build up institutions and try and get more effective state more able to protect its citizens , and more able to invest in its own basic services as well .
" I also think it 's in Britain 's interest that we help developing countries improve the situation for their poorest people because that in turn helps in range of other ways that makes a difference in the UK . "

Ever wondered what it looks like when the entire nation wants a piece of Google ?
Well , we 've already seen some crazy action in a few cities , but here 's a bigger picture -- a map showing the vast lot of locations that have signed up for Google 's experimental 1 G bps fiber network service .
What 's more , the number of community submissions almost doubled between 10 am and the 5 pm deadline , resulting " more than 1,100 community responses and more than 194,000 responses from individuals . "
Yep , that sure is a lot of paperwork to go through , but Google reckons it 'll have a location or two picked " by the end of the year . "
Meanwhile , let 's hope that these Googletown - wannabes will churn out enough nutso videos to keep us entertained .
Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt 's record - setting performances have unleashed a wave of interest in the ultimate limits to human running speed .
A new study published Jan. 21 in the Journal of Applied Physiology offers intriguing insights into the biology and perhaps even the future of human running speed .
The newly published evidence identifies the critical variable imposing the biological limit to running speed , and offers an enticing view of how the biological limits might be pushed back beyond the nearly 28 miles per hour speeds achieved by Bolt to speeds of perhaps 35 or even 40 miles per hour .
The new paper , " The biological limits to running speed are imposed from the ground up , " was authored by Peter Weyand of Southern Methodist University ; Rosalind Sandell and Danille Prime , both formerly of Rice University ; and Matthew Bundle of the University of Wyoming .
" The prevailing view that speed is limited by the force with which the limbs can strike the running surface is an eminently reasonable one , " said Weyand , associate professor of applied physiology and biomechanics at SMU in Dallas .
" If one considers that elite sprinters can apply peak forces of 800 to 1,000 pounds with a single limb during each sprinting step , it 's easy to believe that runners are probably operating at or near the force limits of their muscles and limbs , " he said .
" However , our new data clearly show that this is not the case .
Despite how large the running forces can be , we found that the limbs are capable of applying much greater ground forces than those present during top - speed forward running . "
In contrast to a force limit , what the researchers found was that the critical biological limit is imposed by time — specifically , the very brief periods of time available to apply force to the ground while sprinting .
In elite sprinters , foot - ground contact times are less than one - tenth of one second , and peak ground forces occur within less than one - twentieth of one second of the first instant of foot - ground contact .
The researchers took advantage of several experimental tools to arrive at the new conclusions .
They used a high - speed treadmill capable of attaining speeds greater than 40 miles per hour and of acquiring precise measurements of the forces applied to the surface with each footfall .
They also had subjects ' perform at high speeds in different gaits .
In addition to completing traditional top - speed forward running tests , subjects hopped on one leg and ran backward to their fastest possible speeds on the treadmill .
The unconventional tests were strategically selected to test the prevailing beliefs about mechanical factors that limit human running speeds — specifically , the idea that the speed limit is imposed by how forcefully a runner 's limbs can strike the ground .
However , the researchers found that the ground forces applied while hopping on one leg at top speed exceeded those applied during top - speed forward running by 30 percent or more , and that the forces generated by the active muscles within the limb were roughly 1.5 to 2 times greater in the one - legged hopping gait .
The time limit conclusion was supported by the agreement of the minimum foot - ground contact times observed during top - speed backward and forward running .
Although top backward vs. forward speeds were substantially slower , as expected , the minimum periods of foot - ground contact at top backward and forward speeds were essentially identical .
According to Matthew Bundle , an assistant professor of biomechanics at the University of Wyoming , " The very close agreement in the briefest periods of foot - ground contact at top speed in these two very different gaits points to a biological limit on how quickly the active muscle fibers can generate the forces necessary to get the runner back up off the ground during each step . "
The researchers said the new work shows that running speed limits are set by the contractile speed limits of the muscle fibers themselves , with fiber contractile speeds setting the limit on how quickly the runner 's limb can apply force to the running surface .
The established relationship between ground forces and speed allowed the researchers to calculate how much additional speed the hopping forces would provide if they were utilized during running .
" Our simple projections indicate that muscle contractile speeds that would allow for maximal or near - maximal forces would permit running speeds of 35 to 40 miles per hour and conceivably faster , " Bundle said .

Urgent changes must be made to the system of vetting foreign doctors offering out - of - hours GP care , MPs say .
The Health Committee warned NHS trusts " were not doing their jobs " by failing to check language and medical skills .
That meant patients risked being treated by doctors who were incompetent or were not fluent in English .
Lives were at risk due to a reliance on overseas doctors in weekend and night GP shifts , the MPs said .
The government said improvements were being made .
Poor English
The MPs said ministers should push for changes to EU rules to allow checks by the General Medical Council .
European regulations which allow free movement of labour mean the GMC is unable to carry out clinical or language checks on doctors from EU countries as it does for those from elsewhere in the world .
As employers , NHS trusts can carry out their own tests , but the MPs said this was not always happening .
There are no exact figures for how many foreign doctors are employed for out - of - hours work , although ministers said in evidence to the committee that it was a " limited " problem .
GP OUT -OF - HOUR CARE GPs were allowed to opt out of providing weekend and night cover in 2004 .
Nine in 10 did so Responsibility for the service then passed to NHS managers working for primary care trusts
They have mainly contracted out the service to firms or not - for - profit groups of doctors
These tend to employ locums , some overseas medics , to cover shifts
The MPs looked into the issue after a coroner criticised the system in February following the death of a patient , David Gray , in Cambridgeshire two years ago .
He was killed by German doctor Daniel Ubani who administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine on his first NHS shift .
Dr Ubani's poor English meant he was refused work by the NHS in Leeds , but he was later accepted in Cornwall , which then led to work in Cambridgeshire .
Committee chairman Kevin Barron said : " Everything must be done as soon as possible to ensure another life is not lost in this way . "
The committee 's report said the government should lobby Europe about changing the law - it is due to be reviewed in 2012 and ministers have already promised to bring up the issue in the coming years .
But the report also raised questions about the UK's interpretation of the rules - the GMC believes regulators in other parts of Europe are still carrying out language checks .
The MPs said the issue was particularly pressing as GPs in the UK tended to have much more responsibility than their European counterparts .
Dr Stuart Gray , the son of Mr Gray and a GP himself , said the changes proposed must be made " urgently " .
' Urgent review ' Professor Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of GPs , co-wrote a separate review of out - of - hours service for the government .
He told BBC Radio 5 Live that European rules prevented the GMC from assessing the language skills of GP coming from Europe , although that could be done at a local level within the UK .
Professor Field said : " Ministers have accepted all of our recommendations , and gone further , but there needs to be an urgent review of the European legislation to make sure doctors are assessed at a national level as well as locally . "
Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said checks should be allowed .
He added : " Labour has known for some time that the current safeguards in place are not working but has completely failed to take action . "
And Conservative shadow health minister Mark Simmonds said the report had highlighted " significant failures " .
But the Department of Health said it was already making changes to improve the regime .
A spokesman said it had recently reminded NHS trusts of their obligation to assess doctors they were putting on their employment lists .
And he added the organisations in charge of providing out - of - hours care - mainly firms and not - for - profit groups of doctors , both of which use overseas medics to do shifts - would be facing tougher regulation in the future .

Shodo ( 書道 shodou ) , the Art of Japanese Writing
Japanese Calligraphy distinguished itself from Chinese Calligraphy in the Heian period ( 794 to 1185 AD ) with the addition of kana .
That is , Chinese Calligraphy only uses Chinese characters and modern Japanese Calligraphy uses Chinese Characters called kanji and the two syllabaries hiragana and katakana .
Because of kana , Japanese Calligraphy has a distinct look .
And in the hands of a Master Japanese Calligrapher , the art is sublime .
A beautiful example of Japanese Calligraphy using a cursive font is shown on the right .
This particular example uses an archaic syllabary called hentaigana which was used in the Heian period .
Hentai means “ strange ” and hentaigana is strange in that it is a mix of kanji and an early form of hiragana .
If you are interested in learning more , please do check out the art as we go to great lengths to fully document each piece .
In this example , we include the original Japanese , the modern Japanese , the reading , the English translation , and an independent reference .

MASHANTUCKET
– “ We have voted and we now have a contract ! ” exclaimed a game - table dealer and member of UAW Local 2121 at Foxwoods Resort Casino and MGM Grand complex on Friday night .
As the totals of the 24 - hour vote were announced – 1053 in favor and 355 against .- she realized her local had made history with the first union contract in the country negotiated under tribal law instead of the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) .
The two - year contract was won by 2,500 dealers at the largest casino in the country after three years of organizing and 14 months of negotiations .
“ Our settlement demonstrates what we have known all along : that tribal sovereignty and employee rights need not be inconsistent . ” said Bob Madore director of UAW Region 9A “ We value the investment and jobs the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has brought to Connecticut , and we look forward to promoting this exciting resort as a destination of choice for working families and union members across New England , ” he said .
The agreement was hailed by Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council chairman Rodney Butler as “ the first collective bargaining agreement to acknowledge tribal jurisdiction , which was the basis on which both parties expended extraordinary efforts to reach an agreement . ”
He said .
the agreement “ demonstrates the vibrant and effective legal system of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and the ability of tribal systems to administer matters relating to labor organizations . ”
Speaking for the casino management company , Mashantucket Pequot Gaming Enterprise , president Michael Speller said the agreement “ gives management the operational flexibility and cost controls necessary to remain competitive in the current economic climate . ”
The company has been hit with financial losses after building the MGM Grand in 2008 , coinciding with the economic crisis .
The diverse workforce which includes many Asian and Latin American workers , won improved wages and working conditions , and a seniority and grievance system .
“ We worked hard to get dealers a fair contract , ” said Yan Mei Shi , who has worked at the casino for six and a half years .
“ Dealers deserve job stability and fair treatment on the job , and this agreement is a great advancement . ”
A big issue was division of tokes ( tips ) , which represent two - thirds of income .
The contract stipulates that all tokes will be pooled and divided equally including workers at the new high - end MGM Grand and the larger Foxwoods casino .
The average base - rate of pay , $ 5.90 an hour will increase by 12 percent over two years and the toke - rate , which averages $ 14.14 an hour , will increase by $ 1.32 .
The UAW considers the health and safety language in the contract “ an industry model . ” .
Medical leave for serious illness is extended from six months to a year .
A 24 - table “ smoke - free pit ” separated from other gaming areas will be established for dealers with conditions aggravated by secondhand smoke .
Air -testing and ventilation systems will be established .
“ Such steps go beyond those the state called for in an agreement the tribe reached last year with Gov. M. Jodi Rell , ” the union said .

( CNN ) -- Laura
Bush is suggesting she , her husband and several aides were poisoned during a 2007 visit to Germany for the G8 summit , one of several new details in the former first lady 's forthcoming memoir , " Spoken From the Heart . "
Due to hit bookshelves May 4 but purchased by CNN at a Washington - area bookstore , Mrs. Bush says she and former President George W. Bush became mysteriously sick on the Germany trip to such a degree that the president became bedridden .
According to Mrs. Bush , doctors and the Secret Service investigated the possibility a poisoning had occurred but were unable to make a definitive conclusion .
News reports filed during the event show the White House did disclose Bush missed a series of morning sessions at the summit because he had contracted an apparent virus , but White House officials did not provide further details at that time .
Townsend : Bush illness investigated , poisoning unlikely
" Nearly a dozen members of our delegation were stricken , even George , who started to feel sick during an early morning staff briefing , " Mrs. Bush writes .
" [ O ] ne of our military aides had difficulty walking and a White House staffer lost all hearing in one ear .
Exceedingly alarmed , the Secret Service went on full alert , combing the resort for potential poisons . "
" George felt so ill that he met with [ French President Nicolas ]
Sarkozy and did not even stand up to greet him , " she continues , adding later , " We never learned if any other delegations became ill , or if ours , mysteriously , was the only one . "
Excerpts of the book were first published by The New York Times on Tuesday .
The 432 - page memoir is both a recount of the rare experience of being a first lady and a reflection of the eight years she spent in the White House as her husband 's popularity gradually declined .
Among the book 's most poignant passages are those that delve into Mrs. Bush 's involvement in a 1963 car collision in Midland , Texas , that killed her good friend who happened to be driving the other car .
The spotty details surrounding the accident became fodder for Bush 's opponents during his first run for the White House , and Mrs. Bush rarely addressed the matter in public .
Mrs. Bush covers the accident extensively in the memoir , revealing it occurred after she ran a stop sign in a rush to a drive - in theater .
Then 17 , Mrs. Bush was driving a car that collided with that of Mike Douglas , a fellow student at Mrs. Bush 's school .
Douglas was pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital .
" In the aftermath , all I felt was guilty , very guilty .
In fact , I still do .
It is a guilt I will carry for the rest of my life , far more visible to me than the scar etched in the bump of my knee , " Mrs. Bush writes .
" The whole time I was praying that the person in the other car was alive .
In my mind , I was calling ' Please , God . Please , God. Please , God , ' over and over and over again . "
Mrs. Bush writes she and a friend were talking when she ran the stop sign but also says the intersection was highly dangerous , the road was dark , and she could barely see the stop sign .
Guilt - ridden , Mrs. Bush says she lost her faith for " many , many years . "
" It was the first time that I had prayed to God for something , begged him for something , not the simple childhood wishing on a star but humbly begging for another human life .
And it was as if no one heard .
My begging , to my seventeen - year - old mind , had made no difference .
The only answer was the sound of Mrs. Douglas 's sobs on the other side of that thin emergency room curtain . "
Much of the book 's early chapters are devoted to a recounting of family history , with a special emphasis on the tragedies faced by her family as they weathered the Great Depression and her own personal beginnings as a young woman coming of age in Midland , Texas .
Mrs. Bush writes passionately about the time she spent after college teaching minority students in the large cities of Texas , before she met her future husband .
Mrs. Bush also reveals that she initially received a cold reception from Barbara Bush after marrying her son .
" [ F ] rom the start , she was ferociously tart - tongued .
She 's never shied away from saying what she thinks , " Bush writes .
" She 's managed to insult nearly all of my friends with one or another perfectly - timed acerbic comment . "
The relationship improved , however , when Laura and George moved to Washington to be closer to his parents , she writes .
The memoir covers in detail many of the policy initiatives that the first lady undertook while in office , including her efforts to promote women 's rights in Afghanistan and childhood literacy in the United States .
The first lady also acknowledges a misstep made by her twin daughters , who were caught trying to order alcoholic drinks in Austin , Texas , before their 21st birthday .
" That night in Austin was just dumb , in the way that so many nineteen - year - olds are dumb , " Mrs. Bush writes .
" But what bothered me long after the incident was over was the image left behind in the public mind , that Barbara and Jenna were party girls . "
Much as she did during her time as first lady , Mrs. Bush for the most part avoids commenting on politics .
But she does point to the 1992 presidential campaign of Bush senior as being particularly nasty .
Mrs. Bush writes that during the campaign , critics created " the most hideous caricatures of George H.W.
Bush until I barely recognized my own father - in - law . "
Bush also criticizes former presidential candidate John Kerry for mentioning the sexual orientation of Vice President Dick Cheney 's daughter during a 2004 debate , calling the move " cheap and tawdry " and suggests the campaign opened the door to a more hostile atmosphere for political candidates and their families .
" The strategy of making Mary Cheney 's private life an issue failed with the voters in November of 2004 , " Bush writes .
" But in the years since , it has become acceptable to mock candidates and their families , and other elected officeholders , in highly personal ways ; David Letterman feels free to ridicule Sarah Palin 's teenage daughters , and the audience laughs .
That is the legacy of the 2004 campaign . "
Mrs. Bush also uses the memoir to air a few gripes against her husband 's most vocal congressional critics , specifically Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Reid once called Bush a " loser , " while Pelosi said he was an " incompetent leader . "
" The comments were uncalled for and graceless , " Bush writes .
" While a president 's political opponents , as well as his supporters , are entitled to make what they see as legitimate criticisms , and while our national debates should be spirited , these particular worlds revealed the petty and parochial nature of some who serve in Congress . "
" George , as president , would never have used such language about them , " she adds .
President George W. Bush 's own memoir , " Decision Points , " is set for a November 2010 release .

Daryl Gates , former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department , has died at the age of 83 after a battled bladder cancer , the LAPD said .
Gates was the city 's top cop from 1978 through 1992 , when he resigned in the wake of the turmoil from the 1991 Rodney King police beating and the riots that followed .
His 14 years as chief was a time of change , growth and turmoil in Los Angeles , as the city passed Chicago to become the nation 's second largest .
His reputation was tarnished by racial gaffes , including one highly - publicized remark when he defended officers ' use of carotid chokehold that sometimes led to injuries or death .
Gates suggested that blacks had arteries that " do not open up as fast as on normal people . "
He later said he intended " normal " to mean all healthy people .
His department was credited with keeping the 1984 Summer Olympics safe , while not imposing an impressive police presence .
A native of the Los Angeles area , Gates joined the LAPD as a rookie cop in 1949 .

From CR :
There are so many reports of a housing bubble in China , I asked a friend living in China for his thoughts ... this is his view :
From Michael Kleist in Shanghai :
News of soaring housing prices in China , which are now hovering around late 2007 peaks , naturally invites talk of bubbles and excessive speculation .
More so , since the 2007 highs led to a humbling drop in prices for homeowners and investors in 2008 .
Are things heading that way again in 2010 ?
Not necessarily .
Let ’s start with the news in the papers .
See the WSJ today : China Property Prices Surge
It ’s clear the housing market in China has been hot , topped by February ’s 10.7 %
YoY increase in prices .
In fact , housing prices have been rising for 9 straight months YoY in China , which coincides to some degree with the government ’s massive stimulus package that took effect first quarter 2009 .
Certainly there is some speculation inside these numbers , as there would be in any hot property market .
The government has shown enough concern on this point , and overheating in general , to tell banks last month to curtail lending and increase reserve rations .
But the bigger reason for rising home prices in China may simply be due to an imbalance in supply and demand .
In 2008 the housing market tanked , in large part , because the China government , which was worried about overheating in the property sector , slammed on the brakes in 2007 .
The government added a hefty tax on homes sold within 5 years of purchase , increased fees , told banks to raise interest rates on home loans and increase minimum down payments , and essentially forced banks to stop lending to developers .
The result was a dried up market , a drastic drop in prices , and an almost complete halt in new home starts .
When in early 2009 , in response to the economic crisis , the China government launched its stimulus package it also stoked the property market by once again loosening lending regulations and lowering taxes and fees for both developers and home buyers .
Builders began building and people began buying homes again .
As a result , prices naturally began to go up .
What we are seeing today is that with fewer homes on the market after a nearly 2 year lull in building , the prices have continued to climb .
This imbalance will likely even out as the homes started in 2009 become available for sale .
Most likely , this will result in a stabilization of prices but not a bursting bubble because it ’s not even clear there is a housing bubble in China .
Certainly there is n’t a mortgage credit - related bubble .
The majority of homes in China are purchased with down payments between 30 - 40 % , which is required by the banks , and nearly 25 % of homes are purchased with all cash .
Only those qualifying for low - cost housing can purchase a home with a minimum down payment as low as 20 % .
For this reason foreclosures in China are practically nonexistent .
In addition , the majority of home buyers in China are still either first - time buyers or upgrading their home .
Only an estimated around 20 % of home buyers in China are pure investors .
As with any statistics coming out of China , this figure can be questioned , but regardless , if investors are speculating , they are doing it with large cash down payments .
Still , it is clear that prices in tier 1 cities such as Beijing , Shanghai , and Shenzhen in the south have risen to amazing levels for China .
Flats in downtown Shanghai can sell for RMB150,000 ( US $ 22,000 ) per square meter with exclusive homes in prime locations commanding even higher prices .
To get a new home for under RMB18,000 ( US $ 2,640 ) per square meter certainly requires a trip to the suburbs and only a hope of being near a subway line .
With prices at these highs , it is fair to wonder at what point the situation in China can be called a bubble and what risk there is of it bursting .
With regard to the bursting side of this question , two things to keep in mind are the tremendous amount of influence the China government has to manipulate the housing market ( both up and down ) and its strong desire to keep prices stable or rising comfortably without squashing the market like it did at the end of 2007 .
The central government in China has multiple tools at its disposal to directly impact the market .
This begins with its control over all of the country ’s commercial banks .
When the Party tells banks to increase or adjust lending there is an immediate response .
That ’s one reason why the country was able to recover so quickly from the world credit crunch .
The government uses this blunt tool when it feels there is a need for a country - wide impact on lending .
More subtly , it can direct banks to adjust mortgage rates or down payment percentages in specific locations that seem to be heating or cooling , it its mind , at an unreasonably pace .
One of the government ’s most effective tools against speculation is to raise the down payment ratio and interest rate for buyers with an existing mortgage trying to purchase a second home .
Currently , in Shanghai any buyer of a home with an existing mortgage is required to have a minimum down payment of 40 % and must pay a higher interest rate on the loan than a first time buyer or buyer without an existing loan .
This is a very effective approach that targets speculators without affecting the rest of the market and can be applied locally .
In some locations , banks are forbidden to approve any second home loan until the first loan is paid off .
The point here is that as long as China ’s government acts by tapping the brakes when and where necessary , a precipitous drop in home prices is unlikely .
This assumes the government has learned from its mistakes in late 2007 when it adjusted too hard .
Given the sentiment and concern out of Beijing about keeping a balanced economy as the world recovers , I think the likelihood of any strong movements to dampen the housing market across China are low .
More likely , through 2010 it will continue to use the banks and rules on second mortgages to cool specific locations while letting the overall market grow .
Note : Michael lives in Shanghai and has been in China for 8 years .
He is a founder of www.tradesparq.com, a trade advertising platform that combines products and categories with social networking web tools to match international buyers and sellers .
Michael hopes to address how local Chinese can afford homes in China in a future post .
From CR : This was Michael 's view .
It is certainly different than what we read in the U.S. I 'm looking forward to his next post - US $ 22,000 per square meter ( about $ 2,000 per foot ) sounds very expensive to me - but the large downpayments should cushion in spillover if prices do decline .

Introduction
Google dominates the search engine market for a large part thanks to its spartan , no - bells - nor - whistles interfaces .
But also thanks to its incredible speed ( which is partially thanks to that spartan interface , of course ) .
Since you ’re reading this article , you ’re probably a Drupal developer .
It ’s pretty likely that you ’ve had some visitors of your Drupal - powered web site complain about slow page load times .
It does n’t matter whether your server (s ) are shared , VPSes or even dedicated servers .
Visitors that live abroad – i.e. far from where your servers are located – will face the same performance issues , but at even worse scales .
This article is about tackling these issues .
Front - end performance
Faster servers with more memory stop improving your web site ’s performance at some point .
Yet , even before your web site gets big , there are other places to look at to improve performance , where greater effects can be achieved , even at lower costs – significantly lower costs actually .
Typically , less than 20 % of the total response time is used to retrieve the HTMl document .
That means the other 80 + % is used to process what ’s in the HTML file : CSS , JS , images , videos .
And in many cases , that number is even higher .
Depending on your website , your server (s ) , et cetera , these optimizations will probably shave off between 25 and > 100 percent ( estimated ) of your page loading time .
Initial ( empty cache ) and consecutive page loads ( primed cache ) will both be significantly faster , unless you ’ve already done your own round of optimizations .
Much thanks go to Yahoo !’s research that resulted in fourteen rules and the accompanying YSlow tool ( we ’ll get to that in a second ) that allows you to check how your web site performs according to those rules .
If you can apply all fourteen successfully , your web site should fly .
( Assuming that your page generation times are n’t super slow , of course . )
As always , more optimizations are still possible .
I ’ll discuss some very effective ones briefly at the end .
YS low
First things first : make sure you ’ve installed Firefox , Firebug and YSlow for Firebug ( version 0.9 or better ) .
Firebug is simply a must - have for any web developer , it does n’t matter whether you ’re a professional or an amateur .
YSlow is a Firefox add - on developed by Yahoo ! , that analyzes your web page and tells you why exactly ( remember those fourteen rules ? ) your site is slow ( hence “ y - slow ” , which is pronounced as “ why slow ” ) .
But at the same time , it tells you how you can fix those pain - points .
The lower the rule number , the greater the effect .
What follows is a comprehensive , yet pretty complete review of how Drupal 5 and 6 score on each rule , by listing the required features , settings or guidelines .
If you want to skip the information and want to see results , just skip to the part where I explain how you can apply the optimizations to your site .
Rule 1 : Make fewer HTTP requests
Requirement Drupal 5 Drupal 6 CSS aggregation yes yes JS aggregation no yes Generate CSS sprites automatically no no
Drupal even has the ability to compress CSS files ( through stripping comments and whitespace ) .
JS aggregation has been added in Drupal 6 .
To my knowledge , not a single CMS / CMF ships with the ability to generate CSS sprites .
Nor does a single one have a module or extension that allows them to do so .
This could be a Drupal key performance feature , if it were supported .
Solution
The easiest way to reduce this significantly is to enable Drupal ’s CSS and JS aggregation .
You can find these settings at admin/ settings / performance in your Drupal site .
If you ’re using Drupal 5 , there ’s a backport of Drupal 6 ’s JS aggregation feature , you can find it in this issue – I sponsored this patch .
There is not yet an automatic CSS sprite generator module for Drupal .
If your site is styled pretty heavily , this would benefit you even more than CSS and JS aggregation .
I hope somebody – or some Drupal company – will take the initiative .
In the mean time , there ’s a free CSS Sprite Generator out there , if you do n’t mind doing it manually .
Rule 2 : Use a CDN
Requirement Drupal 5 Drupal 6
Alter URL s of served files dynamically no no
Drupal ’s File API needs work : it should be trivial to alter file URLs dynamically , e.g. based on the file size or type of a file .
Solution
I chose to tackle this particular problem myself , because using a CDN greatly enhances the usability of your web site for visitors that live far away from your servers .
And one of the projects I ’m working on , is one with a very international audience .
The first part of what ’s needed , is obviously to update Drupal core to support file URL altering .
I chose to create a new function , file_url ( ) , through which all URLs for files should be generated , including the URLs for additional CSS files in the page .tpl.php file ( e.g. for a print.css file ) .
This patch also provides a new hook : hook_file_server ( ) , through which modules can provide new file servers .
To configure the preferred file server , a new “ File servers ” setting has been added to the File system settings form .
If one server ca n’t serve a file , Drupal will try the second server , and so on .
It will always fall back to the web server Drupal is being served from if all servers provided by modules failed .
Currently , I ’ve only got a Drupal 5 patch ( it ’s included in the CDN integration module and attached at the bottom of this article ) , because I want to get more feedback before I start maintaining patches for 2 different versions of Drupal .
As soon as the patch ends up in its final form , I will provide a Drupal 6 patch , and of course push for Drupal 7 inclusion .
An issue at Drupal.org has been created .
The second part – integration with a CDN – obviously requires an implementation of hook_file_server ( ) .
So the CDN integration module was born .
It ’s written with flexibility in mind : it supports synchronization plugins ( currently ships with one : FTP ) , can create unique filenames or directories ( necessary if you do n’t want to break relative paths ) , provides the tools to check whether your filters are working well ( per-page and site - wide statistics ) and the filters can be configured using parameters similar to Drupal ’s file_scan_directory ( ) function .
An article that includes benchmarks of the effects of the CDN integration module is being worked on .
The same article will include a complete installation tutorial as well .
Rule 3 : Add an Expires header
Requirement Drupal 5 Drupal 6
Do n’t set the Expires header for web pages yes yes Set the Expires header for all other files yes yes Allow far future Expires headers : ability to alter URL s of served files dynamically no no
By setting the Expires header for files , you tell the browser that it ’s ok to cache them .
Drupal sets the “ Expires ” header for all other files than web pages to 2 weeks .
This is sufficient for most uses .
For maximum performance , this should be set to a date in the far future ( e.g. 10 years from access ) , but this requires unique filenames : each time the file is updated , the filename should change as well this is why file URL altering is a requirement .
If not , your users could still be using the old files , since they may be in their cache .
Solution
Changing the future date for the Expires headers is easy enough : simply edit your .htaccess file .
Your Apache server must also have mod_expires installed , this is available by default on most servers .
However , making filenames unique is an entirely other matter .
The altering of file URLs is already solved in the solution for rule 2 .
So all you have to do now , is implementing a file server that supports this .
The aforementioned CDN integration module provides this feature , but if you want to use it , you of course have to use a CDN .
Rule 4 : GZIP components
Requirement Drupal 5 Drupal 6 GZIP web pages yes yes GZIP CSS and JS files no no
When Drupal ’s page caching is enabled , pages are written to the cache in GZIPped form !
To learn more about how Drupal handles GZIPping , run this command from your Drupal root directory :
egrep ‑rn " gzip " .
Do n’t forget the dot at the end !
However , Drupal does not yet allow you to gzip CSS and JS files .
Solution
A Drupal core patch for this is being worked on , but has unfortunately been inactive for quite some time .
If you are using my CDN integration module , you do n’t need to worry about this , since CDNs GZIP files by default , if the client supports it .
Alternative solution
As an alternative , you could configure your Apache server to automatically compress files .
An example for Apache 2.x : add the following lines to your .htaccess or httpd.conf file :
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text /css application /x- javascript
Rule 5 : Put CSS at the top
Requirement Drupal 5 Drupal 6 Abstraction to add CSS files to the web page yes yes Default location in the XHTML document is the tag yes yes
Drupal has this abstraction : drupal_add_css ( ) .
Putting stylesheets to the document HEAD makes pages load faster : it allows the page to be rendered progressively .
Rule 6 : Put JS at the bottom
Requirement Drupal 5 Drupal 6 Abstraction to add JS files to the document yes yes Default location in the XHTML document is just before no no
Drupal has this abstraction as well : drupal_add_js ( ) .
JS should be at the bottom , because browsers wait until everything in the tag has loaded .
As you probably know , JS files tend to be pretty large these days , so loading them might take a while , thus postponing the rendering of the page .
If you ’d put the JS files at the bottom , then your page can be rendered while the JS files are still loading !
It also achieves a greater download parallelization , thus cutting down your overall page loading time .
This is also being discussed at groups.drupal.org .
Solution
Unfortunately , the default value for the $ scope parameter of drupal_add_js ( ) is bad : ' header ' .
If we simply make ' footer ' the default , we ’re good .
The number of contributed modules that sets this to ' header ' explicitly , is very low , so it should n’t be too much work to convert these .
And I ’ve yet to encounter the first module that has issues with being at the bottom instead of the top .
A more complex part of the solution are Drupal ’s default JS files : misc / jquery.js and misc / drupal.js .
These can be put in the footer without any issues whatsoever .
But what if a contributed module chooses to put its files in the header ?
Then they may not yet be loaded !
For maximum compatibility , we should add the default JS files to the header if at least one module chooses to add its JS file to the header .
I ’ve attached patches for both Drupal 5 and 6 , but neither implement the more complex part I just explained .
In my opinion , Drupal should enforce a strict policy : all JS files should be “ footer - compatible ” .
Until somebody can point me to some JS that must be in the header to work properly , I ’m unlikely to change my opinion about this proposed policy .
Alternative solution
The second method to fix this , does n’t involve hacking Drupal core , but is also more hassle since you have to repeat it for every theme you ’re using .
Suppose you ’re using the default Drupal core theme , Garland .
Then open the themes / garland/page.tpl.php file in your favorite editor .
Find this line at the top of the file :
Cut it away from there , and put it just before this line at the bottom :
So your end result should look like this :
It ’s time to put away that winter gear and think sunshine and endless , clear - blue skies .
We ’re lucky enough to live in the best possible place for escaping for a day , a weekend or a week , and when the snowmelt starts to throw waterfalls down the mountains and the rivers rise up to meet the lush , green banks , then Colorado starts setting up its festival tents , and the resorts and towns throw out their wildflower - covered welcome mats .
We ’ve compiled a list of some of our favorite summer destinations , including hiking , biking , boating , fly - fishing , golfing , off - roading , horseback riding , camping and other outdoor adventures around the state , from the tried and true to the off the beaten path .
Look for some deals and a few splurges , new spots and old favorites , and be prepared to lead with Colorado when you talk about what you did on your summer vacation .
Scenic Colorado Drives
Lariat Loop Scenic & Historic Byway
A terrific reminder of how much history there is right in our backyards , the Lariat Loop — which started as a way to get people into the mountains in cars — is a 40 - mile route that links Golden , Morrison , Lookout Mountain and Evergreen and encompasses 25,000 acres of open space and more than 30 museums and stops .
Just drive for the gorgeous views or stop along the way to examine the interpretive sites and historical markers .
There ’s less traffic midday during the week , so if you ’re looking for an escape from work , this is it , and on the weekends , time it for late in the day to catch the sunset and then stop in one of the mountain towns for dinner .
Not to mention that it ’s a quick step into the past for a few gallons ’ worth of gas .
For a brochure detailing the loop and the stops along the way , visit lariatloop.org .
Stay :
The Loop is close enough to Denver that you do n’t have to stay overnight anywhere , but if you ’re looking for a sweet getaway spot that feels like a mini-vacation , check out Highland Haven Creekside Inn , tucked back in the woods right along Bear Creek .
Choose from guest rooms , cottages or suites ( the latter two come with hot tubs and fireplaces ) , and their remarkable hot breakfasts are included .
Rates start at $ 150 ( 4395 Independence Trail , Evergreen , 303-674-3577 , highlandhaven.com . ) .
Dine : Saigon Landing is an exceptional Vietnamese restaurant that pays attention to detail and makes amazing lobster in black bean sauce , crispy crêpes and grilled frogs legs .
In the background : a talented musician on grand piano ( 28080 Douglas Park Road , Evergreen , 303-674-5421 , saigonlanding.com . ) .
Grand Mesa Scenic Byway
This 63 - mile drive along Colorado 65 makes one feel very , very small , and the views atop this 6,000 - foot - high mesa , the largest flat - top mountain in the world , are amazing .
The drive covers four ecological systems , from desert sandstone canyons to thick , evergreen forests .
There are more than 300 lakes and untold numbers of orchards , farms and vineyards , many of which sell their wares at stands along the way .
Stop by one of the visitors centers — there ’s one at the junction of Interstate 70 in Palisade and at Cedaredge — to pick up a guide to the overlooks and picnic areas ( grandmesabyway.org ) .
Stay : Cedars ’ Edge Llamas
B&B does actually have many llamas ready to greet guests , and they all love to take apples from your hands , picked right from the trees that line this lovely farm with its great Grand Valley vistas out the windows of the lodging .
Rates start at $ 75 ( 21575 Colorado 65 , Cedaredge , 970-856-6836 , llamabandb.com . ) .
Dine :
Your best bet along here is to stop by the farms and stands to grab picnic foods and dine on the fresh peaches , apples , cherries , wines and other homemade goodies available in the area .
There ’s also The Apple Shed Deli in Cedaredge , which makes sandwiches that you could take along ( 250 S. Grand Mesa Drive , 970-856-7007 ) .
Tour the ghost towns of Ashcroft and Independence
About 10 miles south of Aspen sits Ashcroft , in the Castle Creek Valley , which once had a couple thousand residents , two newspapers and two saloons .
But the mines where silver was initially discovered went bust soon after they were found in 1880 , and the town folded soon after that .
Independence , 13.5 miles from Aspen and situated along the Roaring Fork River , has a similar tale .
Hear them both and tour the towns and their still - standing buildings ( some replications ) , with a “ resident ghost ” if you call ahead ( 970-925-3721 , heritageaspen.org . ) .
Stay : The Hotel Jerome in Aspen is a fitting lodging for a historic tour ; the place has been around since 1889 and is filled with glorious Victoriana — and is even rumored to be haunted .
Rates start at $ 610 ( 330 E. Main St. 800-331-7213 , hoteljerome.com . ) .
Dine : Balance out the old with the new at Buenos Aires Fusion , owned by the folks who run the Buenos Aires eateries in Denver , and they have a hit on their hands in Aspen , as well .
The snacks are the way to go — bacon - wrapped figs in a succulent barbecue sauce , fried , breaded mozzarella in marinara , buttery crab cakes — that you can munch on with a glass of wine , or try one of a dozen stuffed empanadas .
Reasonably priced ; you can save room for the killer chocolate cake .
Small space , but you can sit at the little bar ( 308 S. Hunter St. , 970-920-7722 ) .
Explore Dinosaur National Monument
This is one of those areas , located at the Colorado - Utah border , that everyone says they ’ll get to one of these days , but most of the drive can be done only in the summertime , as the roads are too mucked - out to get through any other time .
If you ’re even remotely interested in dinosaurs , this is a must - do , including the Tour of the Tilted Rocks , an 11 - mile , self - guided tour that starts at the Dinosaur Quarry ( from the Jensen , Utah , side ) and offers up petroglyphs and pictographs from the Fremonts , stunning tilted rock layers and short , easy canyon hikes .
The Harpers Corner auto tour is 32 miles ( one way , from the Dinosaur , Colo. , side ) and also yields outrageous views and the chance to hike or wander farther out of the way if you so desire .
Stop at the visitors center to pick up maps and brochures .
Fee : $ 10 per vehicle , valid for seven days ( 4545 E. U.S. 40 , Dinosaur , 970-374-3000 , nps.gov/dino . ) .
And while you ’re there , it ’s worth stopping by Canyon Pintado National Historic District near Rangely , about 20 miles southeast of Dinosaur , to inspect the Fremont petroglyphs in Douglas Creek Canyon on Colorado 139 ( co.blm.gov . ) .
Stay :
There are n’t a lot of options in this remote part of the state ; if you ’re determined to stay in a hotel , you might want to make the 150 - mile drive south to Grand Junction .
Rangely has a good campground , Buck ‘ n ’ Bull RV Park and Campground , which has a deal with nearby Cedar Ridges Golf Course .
Rates start at $ 25 for full hookups ( 2811 E. Main St. , 866-675-8335 ) .
Dine : Bedrock Depot in Dinosaur is for the kid in all of us , with homemade ice creams and sandwiches ( 214 Brontosaurus W. Blvd. , 970-374-2336 . )
Water Sports in Colorado
Paddle the Upper Animas
For strong paddlers , the Upper Animas is one of Colorado ’s most memorable rides .
It ’s a wild , 25 - mile stretch of whitewater that parallels the gawker - laden narrow gauge train between Durango and Silverton .
The Upper A is swollen with hard ( Class IV + to V ) rapids , big waves and ice - cold water .
It ’s a bruiser that many kayakers take two days to complete ( the train will ferry your overnight gear to a midway campground and pick it up the next morning ) .
Commercial and private rafters take out at Tacoma , before the Class V Rockwood Box .
Experts find thrills galore in Rockwood , where sheer , 500 - foot walls prevent both escape and scouting — but fall out in Rockwood and be prepared for an overwhelmingly bad swim .
Add the must - make take - out eddy just before the entire river pours into a sieve , and Rockwood is the ultimate finish for a mind - and body - rattling paddle trip .
Put in at downtown Silverton , take out at Tacoma , and hike up ATV trails to the Haviland Lake Campground .
After a mile in Rockwood , the take - out is river right , with a small sign marking the mandatory exit pool .
First - timers on the Upper A should bring a veteran .
Stay : The Wyman Hotel & Inn in Silverton is a 1902 building that beautifully bridges the gap between old and new — filled with period antiques , it also offers whirlpool tubs .
Complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea .
Rates start at $ 115 ( 1371 Greene St. , 970-387-5372 , thewyman.com . ) .
Dine :
You ’ll come off the river with quite an appetite , and a good place to hit soon after is Handlebars Restaurant & Saloon , a great old shrine to the mining town , filled with taxidermy and odds and ends from the area ’s history .
The specialty here is the baby - back ribs , slathered in the house sauce , which is also for sale by the bottle .
And if you have a “ handlebar ” yourself , they ’ll take your photo and hang it with the others ( 117 13th St. , 970-387-5395 , handlebarsco.com . ) .
Sailing Lake Dillon
In landlocked Colorado , it ’s hard to beat 26 miles of shoreline with mountain views , and the chance to soak up some rays on the water .
If you do n’t own one , you can rent a pontoon boat , motorboat or a 22 - foot Catalina sailboat ( cost : $ 185 - $ 380 for four hours ) .
If you do own one , you can store it at the marina .
Never sailed before ?
Not to worry — Dillon Marina offers sailing lessons ( prices vary , but the basic keelboat course to prepare for the American Sailing Association certification process costs $ 275 per person , while a private lesson costs $ 60 per hour , with a two - hour minimum ) .
If you get weary of the water ( hard to imagine ) there ’s plenty of mountain biking , hiking , horseback riding , golfing and more to keep you busy around Summit County .
Do n’t miss sunset at the Tiki Bar , at the north end by the marina .
Stay :
There are plenty of chain spots along Interstate 70 , but for something with a little more charm , just down the road in Frisco sits the reasonably priced Frisco Lodge , an adorable boutique hotel that feeds you a hearty complimentary breakfast .

Float - fish the Black Canyon of the Gunnison
The Gunnison River is one of the top spots for large rainbow and brown trout , and the isolated , narrow Black Canyon is one of those places that inspires either poetry or a complete loss of words when people try to describe it .
The best way to thoroughly explore the area and get a real feel for this awesome river is to take a float trip through it and spend several days working on flies and getting tips from experienced guides , such as those with Black Canyon Anglers , a longtime outfitter on the “ Gunny . ”
For 25 years , the company has been running the river and since 2000 has operated the only riverside lodge on the Gunnison .
They will take care of rafting gear , camping gear , food , shuttle fees , horse - pack fees and the federal user fees , and share their expertise on catching ( and releasing ) the big ones .

Colorado Hikes
Check out the view from Mount Morrison
Few area locales say Colorado like Red Rocks , and Mount Morrison , with its 7,881 - foot summit and jagged profile — seen around the world as the backdrop for many a concert and in music videos — is one of the more recognizable icons .
You can hike it year - round ( note that it is extremely hot midday in the summer ) unless there is a concert , in which case you ca n’t access it from the park side , only the South Ridge or North Ridge routes , or via Bear Creek Canyon .
Also , because Red Rocks Park is open 5 a.m.-11 p.m. , Mount Morrison makes a lovely moonlight jaunt , as well .
The hike can be as long as 2.7 miles one way or as short as about a half mile each way , depending on the route chosen .
Beware of rattlesnakes .
While you ’re up there , you can tour the rest of Red Rocks Park .
Stay : Another metro- area destination , this one nonetheless can be made into a weekend getaway by adding a stay at a local lodging , such as Morrison ’s Arrowhead Manor Bed & Breakfast , which has lavishly decorated rooms , some with antique furniture , whirlpool tubs , fireplaces and mountain views .
Rates start at $ 119 ( 9284 U.S. 285 , 303-904-4357 , arrowheadmanor.com . ) .
Dine : Cafe Prague in Morrison serves classic Czech fare , and it ’s impossible not to love it , sweet - and - sour cabbage , shnitzel and dumplings , sauerkraut and sauerbraten , brown sauce and lingonberries included .
Also some of the best salmon with hollan - daise sauce ever ( 209 Bear Creek Ave. , 303-697-9722 , cafepraguerestaurant.com . ) .
Explore the Never Summer Range
The Never Summer Range is lonely .
Wonderfully , alluringly lonely .
You can hike entire days in the Never Summer Wilderness and never see another backpack .
Just west of Rocky Mountain National Park lies one of the region ’s most secluded gems , Parika Lake .
The high alpine pool is ringed with arresting 12,000 - foot peaks .
A gurgling stream winds through wild - flowered meadows along the final mile of the 5 - mile trail .
The trail to Parika Lake begins at the Bowen - Baker Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park but crosses into the wilderness area .
From Grand Lake on U.S. 34 , enter the park ’s western Kawuneeche entrance and follow signs to the Bowen - Baker trailhead .
From Estes Park on Trail Ridge Road , the trailhead is about 11 miles south of Milner Pass .
Stay : Allenspark Lodge is conveniently located on Main Street , has cozy , mountain - lodge - style rooms and serves homemade breakfasts .
Rates start at $ 95 ( 184 Main St. , 303-747-2552 , allensparklodge.com . ) .
Dine : Nicky ’s Cattleman Steakhouse is a good choice for that last meal before heading off into the wilderness or refueling afterward , with thick - cut prime rib and big plates of spaghetti ( 1350 Fall River Road , 800-323-0031 , nickysestespark.com . ) .
Trek to Conundrum Hot Springs
Conundrum Hot Springs near Aspen is one of the state ’s busiest wilderness destinations — which is sort of surprising considering that it ’s an 8 - mile hike to the 11,200 - foot pool , making it the continent ’s highest hot spring .
Yes , it gets crowded ( more than 2,000 overnighters in the summer season ) and naked , especially on Fridays and Saturdays .
But if you go during the week , chances are very good you will have the secluded , 102 - degree bath all to yourself .
Ignore the hype and the grinning crowds : the Elk Range ’s Conundrum Valley is breathtaking , with lush groves stretching toward mineral - stained walls and 14,000 - foot peaks .
For an added thrill , take a second day and push onward past the springs — over Triangle Pass and onto the East Maroon Creek Trail — for a 9.3 - mile hike into Crested Butte .
To reach the Conundrum Creek Trailhead , drive 5 miles up Castle Creek Road and turn right for 1 mile up Conundrum Creek Road .
New this year : pack out your own waste in special bags provided at the trailhead .
Stay :
Most camp overnight after the hike in , but if you ’re looking for a place to stay the night before or after , the Limelight Lodge in Aspen recently underwent a major renovation .
It still remains one of the best bargains in town .
Rooms are small but include Wi - Fi , flat - screen TV , robes and kitchenettes , and there ’s a complimentary breakfast buffet .

Hike Booth Lake near Vail
With 3,100 feet of elevation gain — and starting out at 8,400 feet to begin with — this is n’t exactly for the faint of heart or legs .
But the reward for grunting out this 6 - mile ( one way ) hike is serene Booth Lake , surrounded by high , jagged rocks and small stands of trees .
Helping you along the way is a stop , 2 miles in , at Booth Creek Falls .
Despite the punishing quality of this one , it ’s enormously popular , so the early bird gets peace and quiet on weekends .
( Exit 180 off Interstate 70 ; follow Booth Falls Road to end ) .

Colorado Bikes
Mineral Belt Trail in Leadville
The views , the workout and the history on this 11.6 - mile paved trail combine to make it one of the state ’s best bike trails .
Walkers and in - line skaters are welcome , too , but nothing motorized , which means by the time you get to the top and the stunning views of the Sawatch and Mosquito ranges , the only sound will be your heavy breathing from making it to 10,653 feet .
Along the way , there are chances to stop and read about points on the trail , including mines and Turquoise Lake .
After you ’ve worked your legs hard on the trail , give them a break with a ride on the Leadville , Colorado & Southern Railroad , which takes you to the Continental Divide through the Arkansas River Valley , with its own great views ( including that of Mount Elbert , at 14,433 , Colorado ’s highest peak ) and a narrator with a sense of humor as he shares the story of Leadville ’s intriguing history .
They offer night rides , as well .
Tickets start at $ 32.50 / adults , $ 19.50 / kids 4-12 ( 866-386-3936 , leadville - train.com ) .
Other Leadville highlights include the Tabor Opera House ( 308 Harrison St. , 719-486-8409 , taboroperahouse.net . ) , open for tours in season , and the Mount Massive Golf Course , North America ’s highest nine - hole green ( 9,680 feet ) , which purportedly will get that ball farther in the thinner air ( 259 County Road 5 , 719-486-2176 , mtmassivegolf.com . ) .
Stay : The National Register of Historic Places has the Delaware Hotel listed , and for good reason : this 1886 hotel has been lovingly restored , with a gorgeous crystal chandelier gleaming in the lobby and pretty rooms that evoke the place ’s Victorian origins .
Rates start at $ 95 ( 700 Harrison Ave. , 800-748-2004 , delawarehotel.com . ) .
Dine : The Golden Burro Cafe ’s friendly staff has been serving homey favorites such as chicken - fried steak and Mexican specialties since 1938 ( 710 Harrison Ave. , 719-486-1239 ) .
Try the chairlifts at Winter Park
With more than 50 miles of singletrack and doubletrack to test your mountain - biking skills , Winter Park has become a mecca for fat - tire fanatics .
The sweet stuff off the chairlifts is especially intriguing , particularly if you are n’t a fan of the uphill part of the ride .
Simply hop on the lift and let it do all of the work — the Zephyr Express actually carries the bike for you — and then you come screaming back down the mountain .
Of course , if you want to get that great workout , you ’re more than welcome to grunt it uphill .
Either way , the views through the alpine routes are spectacular , and like the ski trails , they ’re rated green to black , with the latter being a gnarly , technical run that will have you twisting and turning , jumping rocks and roots , crossing water and dropping steeps like crazy .
Stay : The Vintage Hotel has regular one - and two - bedroom hotel rooms ( some have Murphy beds ) and studios with kitchenettes and fireplaces , less than one - third mile from the mountain .
They ’ll cheerfully store your bike for you in a locked room , too .

Sail down your first singletrack in Crested Butte
Say you ’ve heard about this mountain bike thing , and maybe you even have a fat - tire bike , and you ’ve always wanted to do some singletrack — but the idea of just going out on some trail in what ’s pretty much the mountain biking capital of the world scares the living daylights out of you .
As well it probably should .
But check this out :
The Lower Loop in Crested Butte is a gentle introduction to mountain biking , mostly pavement with a few miles of singletrack that can be connected to other trails to make it as long or short as you like .
Simply follow Butte Avenue west out of town , taking the trail to the left after the last house .
Follow the singletrack , always bearing right at crossroads .
When you come to the Peanut Mine , this is the official start of the Lower Loop .
All of the spurs reconnect from here .
Tony ’s Trail , be warned , is a bit harder ( it ’s a 9 - mile loop that gains about 1,200 feet in elevation ) .
But the rest of the trails , including the ride on Slate River Road back to town , are fairly easy .
And the views on the upper portion of Lower Loop , which includes Paradise Divide and the Slate River Valley , are spectacular , especially when the wildflowers are in bloom .
For more info or to pick up a good guide to the trails around town , stop by the Alpineer ( 419 Sixth St. , 970-349-5210 , alpineer.com . ) .
Stay :

Colorado Camping
Sleep at Great Sand Dunes National Park & Preserve
With the seemingly endless dunes — 750 feet high and continuing for 55 square miles — as well as the Sangre de Cristo mountains as backdrops to your tent site , it ’s hard to imagine a more fantastic campground than Pinyon Flats , the only one inside this national park , which fills on a first - come , first - served basis .

Most important : an outhouse , and unlimited coffee .

Choose from standard class , which is basic coach seating or open - air gondola cars , or the upscale classes that garner refreshments and nicer accommodations during the trip .

Attend a festival in Telluride
It ’s hard to go too long in Telluride without tripping over a festival ; look at the town ’s schedule , and it seems as though at about mid-spring there ’s something going on pretty much every weekend .
Fortunately , the locals are fairly tolerant of the constant visitors .
In retaliation , though , they did come up with the Nothing Festival , usually the third weekend in July , where since 1991 they have done nothing special to give themselves a break ( telluridenothingfestival.com ) .
Aside from that well - deserved rest , however , this easygoing town nestled in a box canyon , dramatically adorned by the San Juan Mountains and the San Miguel River , celebrates jazz , balloons , art , the Wild West , bluegrass , wine , Cajuns , mushrooms , film ( twice ! ) , the blues and beer .
It ’s hard not to get caught up in the fun . ( visittelluride.com )

Play Hate Tetris .
This is bad Tetris .
It 's hateful Tetris .
It 's Tetris according to the evil AI from " I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream " .
I have to be honest , this is not an entirely original idea .
However , RRRR 's implementation of the concept of a game of Tetris which always gives you the worst possible pieces leaves much to be desired :
the keyboard interface frequently does n't work
the conditions for failure are ambiguous and inconsistent
the playing field is only 8 blocks wide as compared to the standard 10
the AI is either overly generous , or stupid , and frequently does NOT provide you with the worst possible piece
( UPDATE : there is also Bastet , which can be played online here , but is also far too forgiving . )
HATETRIS was an experiment to rectify those flaws .
Also , every coder has to build Tetris at least once in their life .
In addition , I also have a passionate hatred of JavaScript , but I felt that that hatred was borne out of ignorance , so this was an attempt to reconnect with that most derided and crippled of languages .
The latter failed , but there you go .
Some things you 'll spot :
Yes , the game is written entirely in JavaScript .
You can find the source code here on GitHub .
Very few real games are amenable to this , but Tetris , being played on a very wide grid , is one of them .
If you want to save the game locally you 'll find a few things that are easy to tweak , including the dimensions of the playing field and the height of the bar .
You can also put custom pieces in the list at the top , including pieces of more or fewer than 4 " bits " ( components ) .
Note that at the moment these pieces are sorted so that the least convenient ones are at the top .
All things being equal , with no other major differences between possibilities , the AI will give you an S .
No , there is no gravity : on the one hand I simply never got around to implementing it and on the other hand I honestly think that gravity is the least of your problems with this particular Tetris clone .
The method by which the AI selects the worst possible piece is extremely simple to describe ( test all possible locations of all possible pieces , see which of the pieces ' best - case scenarios is the worst , then spawn that worst piece ) , but quite time - consuming to execute , so please forgive me if your browser chugs a little after locking each piece .
If you can figure out a way to accelerate the algorithm without diminishing its hate - filled efficiency , do let me know .
The algorithm for " weighing " possibilities is to simply maximise the highest point of the " tower " after the piece is landed .
More complex algorithms could be possible , but are n't strictly necessary .
Also , now that replays have been added , I can't change the algorithm without screwing up or invalidating all the replays .
Yes , you will get a lot of S pieces .
But it does n't give you solely S pieces - if that were the case , then it would be possible to make lines forever , which is much too easy .
If you can't figure out how to turn a constant stream of S pieces to your advantage , that 's your problem .
Rest assured that once you do , other pieces will appear .
If you get creative , it is possible to force all 7 different pieces to appear , including even those incredibly useful T pieces .
There is no randomness in the process - the AI is deterministic , so you are all playing the same game .
It may be possible to create a strategy to get into a loop and continuously outplay the AI .
If so , let me know .
If not , my top score is 5 lines .
Update 2010-04-04
I 've added some replay functionality .
This will allow you to share particularly high - scoring games with other people just by passing a simple string of hexadecimal around , instead of having to laboriously capture video !
2010-04-22
A small update regarding the possibility of HATETRIS II ( i.e. the one where the algorithm looks more than 1 piece into the future ) .
I successfully implemented this recursive search , which can theoretically look to unlimited depth .
I also added a huge number of optimisations - such as treating the well as a list of binary numbers rather than an array - in order to make it so that new pieces were generated in 0.5 seconds under these conditions , rather than closer to 30 seconds without those optimisations .
I also added functionality to add more variety to the pieces .
Unfortunately , this version of the game is still far too easy .
I can routinely get 3 lines or more in this mode , without any real planning .
It is frighteningly straightforward to devise a situation where even looking two moves ahead there is no way for the AI to prevent you from getting at least one line .
Forcing more variety in the pieces , even if the piece chosen is always one of the " equal worst " , makes the game a lot easier .
And finally , looking three moves ahead is computationally impractical to achieve ( in client - side JavaScript , at any rate ) .
I think it should be possible to build a game which permits no lines whatsoever , and I hope to create this , and I 'm not intending to release any kind of intermediate solution .
More as it happens .
2012-06-12
Contrary to what is stated here , HATETRIS is not related to Hatris .
2015-12-06
Replays are now presented in Base65536 , making them just about small enough to be shared via Twitter .
Old replays will still work , of course .
2017-11-17
Replays are now presented in Base2048 .
Thanks to a combination of this and the new increased character limit on Twitter , even the latest high score replay of 31 lines will now fit in a Tweet , which it previously did not .
Old hex and Base65536 replays will continue to work .
High scores

First off , I caved and joined twitter .
So if you want to know what spices I am running low on , today is your lucky day .
OK , now I ’ll make with the cookies .
It seems that Peanut Butter Pillows won this battle , but the war still rages and I ’ll post a few more of your recipe requests in the next few weeks .
Right now , though , let ’s get down to business .
This recipe come straight from the ska checkered oven mitted hands of Terry Hope Romero .
Chocolate and peanut butter fans will totally stalk you once they get a bite of these classic chocolately cookies with a heart of sweet and salty peanut butter .
We ca n’t deny impatience is rewarded here : these cookies when eaten warm just a few minutes out of the oven are dynamite .
We use black cocoa powder because we happen to have it , but dutch processed or even regular cocoa powder would be A - OK .
Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows
makes 2 dozen cookies
Chocolate dough :
1/2 cup canola oil
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
3 tablespoons non-dairy milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all - purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened dutch processed cocoa powder
2 tablespoons black unsweetened cocoa or more dutch processed unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
Filling :
3/4 cup natural salted peanut butter , crunchy or creamy style
2/3 cup confectioner ’s sugar
2 to 3 tablespoons soy creamer or non-dairy milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
In a large mixing bowl combine oil , sugar , maple syrup , non-dairy milk and vanilla extract and mix until smooth .
Sift in flour , cocoa powder , black cocoa if using , baking soda and salt .
Mix to form a moist dough .
Make the filling .
In another mixing bowl beat together peanut butter , confectioner ’s sugar , 2 tablespoons of soy creamer and vanilla extract to form a moist but firm dough .
If peanut butter dough is too dry ( as different natural peanut butters have different moisture content ) , stir in remaining tablespoon of non-dairy milk .
If dough is too wet knead in a little extra powdered sugar .
Preheat oven to 350 °F .
Line bakings sheet with parchment paper .
Shape the cookies .
Create the centers of the cookies by rolling the peanut butter dough into 24 balls .
Scoop a generous tablespoon of chocolate dough , flatten into a disc and place a peanut butter ball in the center .
Fold the sides of the chocolate dough up and around the peanut butter center and roll the chocolate ball into an smooth ball between your palms .
Place on a sheet of waxed paper and repeat with remaining doughs .
If desired gently flatten cookies a little , but this is not necessary .
Place dough balls on lined baking sheets about 2 inches apart and bake for 10 minutes .
Remove sheet from oven and let cookies for 5 minutes before moving to a wire rack to complete cooling .
Store cookies in tightly covered container .
If desired warm cookies in a microwave for 10 to 12 seconds before serving .
Arsenal 's Andrey Arshavin has said he would like to play for Barcelona , emphasising that it would be the highlight of his career .
Before Arshavin joined Arsenal in February 2009 , Zenit St Petersburg rejected a lower offer from the club , to the Russia international 's frustration .
" If I have the opportunity to play one season in Barcelona , it would be the peak of my career , " Arshavin was quoted as telling the English - language website of the Russian newspaper Sport Express .
Arshavin played in the first leg but was injured for the second when Arsenal were knocked out by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter - finals earlier this month .
" After Arsenal played against Barça in the Champions League , my feeling of excitement changed to a feeling of dissatisfaction because the Spanish club has become much stronger than any other , " the 28 - year - old said , before adding that he would prefer to finish his career back in the Russian league rather than playing for an English team that is not challenging for the title .
" If some day I have to choose between a mid-table English club and a leading Russian championship team , I would prefer to return to Russia . "
Arshavin's second season at Arsenal will end without a trophy – the Gunners are third in the Premier League , which they have not won since 2004 .
Child and youth sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clergy Part 1 : Overview :
Introduction ; The Church and the cover up ;
How common is / was the abuse ?
Sponsored link .
Introduction to clergy abuse :
Whenever one person is in a position of authority over another , there is an enhanced possibility of emotional , physical , financial , spiritual , and / or sexual abuse .
Of these , sexual abuse of children and youth are generally considered the most heinous .
When the abuser is a clergyperson -- an individual who is expected to act at the highest spiritual and moral level -- the public becomes particularly outraged .
Such abuse represents a gross violation of trust and a massive misuse of human sexuality by a perpetrator who is supposed to be among the most trustworthy .
When the church leadership systematically conceals sexual abuse , the public can go ballistic .
Donald Cozzens reported that " by the end of the mid 1990s , it was estimated that some six hundred priests had been named in abuse cases and more than half a billion dollars had been paid in jury awards , settlements and legal fees . "
1
The latter grew to about one billion dollars by 2002 and continues to increase .
The Roman Catholic Church has been the focal point of a great deal of public anger .
Unfortunately , it has been largely misdirected :
The vast majority of abuse by priests who victimize minors -- persons under the age of 18 -- has taken the form of ephebophilia 2 -- involving post - pubertal youths who are often 16 or 17 years of age .
Yet most of the public has concluded from the media that most of the abuse is taking the form of pedophilia 3 -- involving young , pre-pubertal children under the age of 11 .
In 2004 - FEB , CNN was able to view a draft copy of a survey prepared by the church .
It reveals that 4,450 of the 110,000 Roman Catholic clergy ( 4 % ) who served between 1950 and 2002 have been accused of molesting minors .
This has resulted in 11,000 individual abuse claims filed against Catholic clergy during that interval .
More details
In 2005 - FEB , Dr. Kathleen McChesney of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said that the crisis is not yet over because thousands of victims across the country are still reporting the abuse .
She said : " In 2004 , at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States .
Most of the alleged incidents occurred between 1965 and 1974 .
What is over is the denial that this problem exists , and what is over is the reluctance of the church to deal openly with the public about the nature and extent of the problem . "
4 About the Roman Catholic Church and its cover ups of abuse : Some investigators have been reporting for decades that many dioceses within the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. have been routinely covering up sexual abuse by its ephebophile 2 and pedophile 3 priests .
On policy matters , the Church has been quite decentralized ; each bishop establishes his diocese 's own methods of handling this problem .
This changed in 2002 when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops developed a unified policy , had it approved by the Vatican , and implemented it .
Many dioceses had found it expedient in the past to pay off the victims and their families with hush money .
Generally , a confidentiality agreement was a standard part of these settlements .
5 Perhaps because of the church 's tradition of forgiveness and perhaps out of an unrealistic belief in the effectiveness of therapy , the dioceses often routed abusive priests through residential treatment centers , and later reassigned them to a different parish .
Unfortunately , this often resulted in a whole new group of children being abused .
The Seattle Archdiocese broke new ground under then - Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen in the late 1980's .
They created a new sex - abuse policy which involved the creation of semi-independent review panels composed of both Catholics and non-Catholics .
The panels have included therapists , attorneys , prosecutors , church - law experts , and priests .
It is headed by a bishop .
They hear from accusers , review psychological evaluations of the alleged abusers , and listen to testimony from counselors .
The panel makes recommendations to the Archbishop which may include having the priest defrocked or ordering him to undergo psychological treatment .
According to author Jason Berry , " Hunthausen was really the first archbishop to deal with this problem publicly .
The fact that Hunthausen spoke out and was so forthright  you cannot underestimate a statement like that . "
Berry added that certain aspects of the policy were " pioneering " efforts at the time .
These included reaching out to victims , and making sure that perpetrators were n't shuffled from parish to parish .
6,7 Although many books on clergy abuse were written during the 1990's , it was n't until allegations surfaced of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clergy in the Boston , MA area during 2002 - JAN that a moral panic materialized among the public .
It has since spread across the U.S. During the first half of 2002 , about 300 of the 46,000 priests currently serving in the U.S. were relieved of duty over abuse allegations .
8
This represents about 0.65 % of the total population of priests .
Allegations of new instances of child and youth sexual abuse appear frequently in the media .
Hundreds of priests and at least one bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. have been accused .
After a 16 month investigation , the Massachusetts Attorney General 's office issued a 76 page report in late 2003 - JUL which concluded that Roman Catholic priests and other workers in the Boston Archdiocese probably molested more than 1,000 people over six decades .
Attorney General Tom Reilly blamed church leaders for the abuse .
He said : " The mistreatment of children was so massive and so prolonged that it borders on the unbelievable ....
The choice was very clear , between protecting children and protecting the church .
They made the wrong choice .
In effect , they sacrificed children for many , many years . "
Attorney Jeffrey Newman , whose firm represents more than 200 alleged victims in lawsuits against the archdiocese said : ' The fact is that a group of lawless rogues were allowed to reside in our community and to harm our children under the protections of the freedom of religion and the First Amendment , and this simply cannot be allowed in the future ' . "
No church leaders could be charged , because the state 's incredibly weak statute of limitations laws for child abuse crimes made this impossible .

How common is the abuse ?
In moral panics , as in wars , truth is often the first victim .
There is massive speculation about the scope of the abuse .
But there is also an almost complete lack of reliable data .
Much heat is being generated , and very little light .
Some claim that sexual abuse by priests is quite common ; others claim that : " There is no good data either from the general population or from the priesthood about numbers of pedophiles or people who have a vulnerability that increases their risk to children .
The issue of sexuality , particularly of people who may have unusual kinds of sexual cravings , has been one that society has tended to sweep under the carpet .
Getting that data is terribly important , but as of now I know of no systematic surveys that would allow us to come to any firm conclusions . "
10 Two widely circulated estimates suggest that approximately 2 % to 6 % of Roman Catholic priests abuse children and youths .
This compares with other common estimates : that perhaps 1 % of all adults and 2 % of all adult males are abusive pedophiles .
However , priests have freer access to many children than does the average male .
His position of authority and trust can facilitate abuse .
Thus the number of abused young people per abusive priest may well be larger than for the average molester .
William Reid has written that " careful studies have indicated ... that child molesters commit an average of sixty offenses for every incident that comes to public attention . "
11 But Thomas
Fox estimated that the " average pedophile priest abuses 285 victims . "

The goat woman : Chinese grandmother , 101 , grows mystery horn on forehead
An elderly Chinese woman has stunned her family and fellow villagers by growing from her forehead a horn than resembles a goat’s .
Grandmother Zhang Ruifang , 101 , of Linlou village , Henan province , began developing the mysterious protrusion last year .
Since then it has grown 2.4in in length and another now appears to emerging on the other side of the mother of seven ’s forehead .
Bizarre : Zhang Ruifang began growing a horn last year .
It is now 2.4in long
The condition has left her family baffled and worried .
Her youngest of six sons , Zhang Guozheng , 60 , said when a patch of rough skin formed on her forehead last year ‘ we did n't pay too much attention to it ’.
‘ But as time went on a horn grew out of her head and it is now 6 cm long , ' added Mr Zhang , whose eldest brother and sibling is 82 years old .
‘ Now something is also growing on the right side of her forehead .
It ’s quite possible that it ’s another horn . ’
Although , it is unknown what the protrusion is on Mrs Zhang ’s head , it resembles a cutaneous horn .
This is a funnel - shaped growth and although most are only a few millimetres in length , some can extend a number of inches from the skin .
Cutaneous horns are made up of compacted keratin , which is the same protein we have in our hair and nails , and forms horns , wool and feathers in animals .
They usually develop in fair - skinned elderly adults who have a history of significant sun exposure but it is extremely unusual to see it form protrusions of this size .
The growths are most common in elderly people , aged between 60 and the mid-70s .
They can sometimes be cancerous but more than half of cases are benign .
Common underlying causes of cutaneous horns are common warts , skin cancer and actinic keratoses , patches of scaly skin that develop on skin exposed to the sun , such as your face , scalp or forearms .
Cutaneous horns can be removed surgically but this does not treat the underlying cause .

An entomologist at the University of Montana has found that mountain pine beetles are attacking trees for longer periods as the season of cooler weather shrinks , part of a pattern of forest die - off that is sweeping North America .
From Yale Environment 360 , part of the Guardian Environment Network
For many years , Diana Six , an entomologist at the University of Montana , planned her field season for the same two to three weeks in July .
That 's when her quarry — tiny , black , mountain pine beetles — hatched from the tree they had just killed and swarmed to a new one to start their life cycle again .
Now , says Six , the field rules have changed .
Instead of just two weeks , the beetles fly continually from May until October , attacking trees , burrowing in , and laying their eggs for half the year .
And that 's not all .
The beetles rarely attacked immature trees ; now they do so all the time .
What 's more , colder temperatures once kept the beetles away from high altitudes , yet now they swarm and kill trees on mountaintops .
And in some high places where the beetles had a two - year life cycle because of cold temperatures , it 's decreased to one year .
Such shifts make it an exciting — and unsettling — time to be an entomologist .
The growing swath of dead lodgepole and ponderosa pine forest is a grim omen , leaving Six — and many other scientists and residents in the West — concerned that as the climate continues to warm , these destructive changes will intensify .
Across western North America , from Mexico to Alaska , forest die - off is occurring on an extraordinary scale , unprecedented in at least the last century - and - a - half — and perhaps much longer .
All told , the Rocky Mountains in Canada and the United States have seen nearly 70,000 square miles of forest — an area the size of Washington state — die since 2000 .
For the most part , this massive die - off is being caused by outbreaks of tree - killing insects , from the ips beetle in the Southwest that has killed pinyon pine , to the spruce beetle , fir beetle , and the major pest — the mountain pine beetle — that has hammered forests in the north .
These large - scale forest deaths from beetle infestations are likely a symptom of a bigger problem , according to scientists : warming temperatures and increased stress , due to a changing climate .
Although western North America has been hardest hit by insect infestations , sizeable areas of forest in Australia , Russia , France , and other countries have experienced die - offs , most of which appears to have been caused by drought , high temperatures , or both .
One recent study collected reports of large - scale forest mortality from around the world .
Often , forest death is patchy , and research is difficult because of the large areas involved .
But the paper , recently published in Forest Ecology and Management , reported that in a 20,000 - square - mile savanna in Australia , nearly a third of the trees were dead .
In Russia , there was significant die - off within 9,400 square miles of forest .
Much of Siberia has warmed by several degrees Fahrenheit in the past half - century , and hot , dry conditions have led to extreme wildfire seasons in eight of the last 10 years .
Russian researchers also are concerned that warmer , dryer conditions will lead to increased outbreaks of the Siberian moth , which can destroy large swaths of Russia 's boreal forest .
While people in some places have the luxury to doubt whether climate change is real , it 's harder to be a doubter in the Rocky Mountains .
Glaciers in Glacier National Park and elsewhere are shrinking , winters are warmer and shorter , and the intensity of forest fires is increasing .
But the most obvious sign is the red and dead forests that carpet the hills and mountains .
They have transformed life in many parts of the Rockies .
It has hit home for me on a personal level .
Virtually every one of the hundreds of old - growth ponderosa pines on the 15 acres of land where I live near Helena , Montana is dead , and we are surrounded by a valley of dead and dying forest .
Most trees have been logged and taken to a pulp mill , where they were turned into cardboard for boxes .
The tiny mountain pine beetle , which is just a quarter of an inch long , has destroyed nearly 70,000 square miles of forest in the Rocky Mountains .
University of Montana ecologist Steve Running says warmer temperatures in the Rockies bring spring earlier and fall later , each by about a week , yet precipitation has remained about the same .
That translates into a drought , and stressed trees are highly susceptible to beetle infestations .
Wintertime minimum temperatures in the 1950s , meanwhile , ranged from 40 F to 50 F below zero .
That 's risen to the 30 - below range , and there are fewer days when minimums are reached .
It 's not getting cold enough anymore to kill the beetles , which over - winter in their larval stage and survive the milder temperatures because they are filled with glycol , a natural anti-freeze .
In addition , the past suppression of fire and the fact that many Western trees are reaching the age at which beetles target them — 80 to 100 years — are also factors in the widespread loss of forests .
So the forests across the West are dying , in such large numbers that U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called it the West 's Hurricane Katrina .
In Colorado and southern Wyoming , the U.S. Forest Service has created an emergency management team to cut down dead trees around towns and along roads and power lines .
Forest Service campgrounds and trails have been closed because of the hazard from dead trees , and communities surrounded by dead forests have drawn up emergency evacuation plans for residents .
Large - scale die - offs have occurred in the past .
Mountain pine beetles are native to the West and are part of the ecosystem .
Lodgepole forests regenerate through large - scale " stand replacing events , " which include fire and insects .
The die - offs now , though , are on a scale unprecedented since the West was settled and are so big that they are having unusual impacts on ecosystems .
The whitebark pine , once largely protected from the beetles because it grew at high altitudes and was shielded by cold , is functionally extinct and may no longer be able to feed grizzly bears and other species that love its high - fat nut .
In Mexico , bark beetles are beginning to kill oyamel fir trees in a rare 139,000 - acre biosphere preserve where the majority of North America 's monarch butterflies travel each fall to spend the winter .
So far , about 100 acres in a core area of 33,000 acres have been killed by bark beetles .
Tree - killing bugs are n't the only problem .
In 2005 Colorado researchers noticed that aspens were suddenly dying in large numbers .
That year they found 30,000 acres of dead aspen forest .
The next year there were 150,000 acres , and in 2008 it had soared to 553,000 .
The die - off is called Sudden Aspen Death , or SAD .
" It 's growing at an exponential rate , " said Wayne Shepperd , who researches aspen for the Forest Service .
" It 's pretty sobering when you see a whole mountainside or whole drainage of aspen forest dead . "
Groves at low elevations and facing south are dying fastest , and scientists believe the cause is hotter temperatures and drier weather .
It 's not only killing mature trees , but the root mass as well .
An aspen grove is the offspring of a large single underground clonal mass , which sends up shoots .
" The whole organism is disappearing and it has profound implications , " Shepperd said .
" When the roots die , groves that are hundreds or thousands of years old are n't going to be there anymore . "
If the die - offs continue , the loss of the aspen trees would be a blow to goshawks , songbirds , and a number of other species that find food and refuge in the groves .
Perhaps more than anyone , Craig Allen is familiar with these large - scale forest die - offs .
A forest ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey 's Jemez Mountain Field Station in New Mexico , not only are his office and home surrounded by a pinyon die - off , he also is the lead author of the paper — with 19 other authors — published in Forest Ecology and Management , which sought to document and begin to understand what is happening to forests in North America and around the world as the result of climate change .
Coming up with a definitive understanding at this point is impossible , Allen says .
Forests are complex , and unfortunately , woefully understudied , and there is n't nearly enough data to draw a conclusion about the reasons behind forest die - offs globally .
" There 's huge information gaps and uncertainties , " says Allen .
What contributors were able to do in the paper is collect anecdotal reports of broad - scale forest mortality from around the world .
" The point of this paper is to connect the dots , at least the ones we can connect , " says Allen .
" We can't even tell you for sure if there 's more forest mortality .
There 's not consistent monitoring . "
In 2005 a strong El Nino caused a dramatic drought in the Amazon .
It killed forest across the region and is extremely well documented because so many researchers had existing plots there .
" The heart of the biggest rainforest in the world turned from a carbon sink to a carbon source , " said Allen .
" If you have long - term drought you can bleed a lot carbon into the atmosphere . "
A lot of beetles can also turn vast tracks of forest from carbon sinks to carbon sources .
Take British Columbia , which is ground zero for the mountain pine beetle infestation in North America .
Some 53,000 square miles of mature pine forest is dead and the province is projected to lose 80 percent of its mature trees by 2013 .
The second largest known die - off there occurred in the 1980s and claimed just 2,300 square miles .
Bill Wilson — the province 's director of Industry , Trade and Economics Research — said he has flown in a plane for hours over the province and seen nothing but dead forest the entire time .
In 2008 , so much of British Columbia 's forests had died they also went from being a net carbon sink to carbon source .
Diana
Six works in Africa where she has seen other die - offs first - hand .
" In Africa where I work , suddenly whole hillsides are dropping dead , " she said .
" It 's happening so fast people are in shock .
It 's a tragedy . "
Species include the quiver tree , camel - thorn , and the giant euphorbia , a 30 - foot - tall succulent .
The causes are not known , but the suspects are hotter and drier weather , or shifting rainfall patterns .
If there was a way to predict die - offs , Allen said , land managers could take preemptive action , such as mechanical thinning or prescribed burning to increase the vigor of forests .
What gives researchers pause is that many of these large die - offs have occurred with minimal warming , in just a few years .
In the West , for example , the average temperature has warmed on average 1.8 F over the past century .
" This is before we put two to four degrees centigrade ( 3.6 F to 7.2 F ) into the system , " said Allen , referring to forecasts for warming by the end of this century .
Trees across the world are stressed already from fragmentation , air pollution , and other problems , he said .
" I do n't know how much stress the forests of the world can take , " said Allen .

Central Falls High School firings
Rhode Island school district seeks to tear up teachers ’ contract
By Mike Ingram
1 March 2010
Central Falls High School
The mass firing of teachers at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island on Tuesday , February 23 , was greeted with predictable enthusiasm by the Obama administration .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan , declared , “ I applaud Commissioner Gist and Superintendent Gallo for showing courage and doing the right thing for kids . ”
Duncan was referring to events at the school committee meeting at which the names of all 74 teachers and a further 19 staff members were read aloud in an announcement of their impending dismissal in the fall .
The firings are the result of Superintendent Frances Gallo ’s adoption of the so - called “ turnaround ” option — one of four options set out by the Obama administration for dealing with “ failed schools . ”
For the first time , Obama ’s education policy requires states to identify their bottom 5 percent of schools in performance and “ fix ” them using one of four methods .
The other options are school closure , takeover by a charter school or school - management organization , and transformation , which requires a longer school day and other attacks on the working conditions of teachers .
Gallo ’s first choice was the “ transformation ” option , which included demands that would have amounted to the tearing up of the teachers ’ contract .
Gallo laid down six conditions to be accepted by February 25 , or else the teachers would be fired .
Gallo demanded :
• An increase in the length of the school day by 25 minutes
• Formalize tutoring schedules to provide extra help to struggling students one hour before and after school
• Agree to eat lunch with students one day a week to build stronger relationships
• Stay after school for 90 minutes one day each week to work on analyzing student work and test data
• Attend two weeks of professional development in the summer , for which they would be paid at a rate of $ 30 an hour
• Accept rigorous evaluations by a third - party starting March 1
Gallo ’s ultimatum was rejected by the teachers , who rightly saw it as an attempt to rip up established contracts .
Teachers in impoverished schools such as Central Falls already give substantial amounts of their free time — and money — to provide the best education they can under conditions of worsening budget cuts .
The conditions laid down in the “ transformation ” proposals were not aimed at improving education , but rather at challenging the existing pay and conditions of teachers .
When the teachers rejected this ultimatum Gallo lost no time in switching to the “ turnaround ” option , which had already been agreed by State Education Commissioner Deborah Gist .
It was Gist ’s order of January 11 to overhaul the state ’s lowest performing schools that set in motion the events leading to last week ’s firings .
Gist was among the first state education chiefs to publicly list the bottom 5 percent of failing schools and use the new federal requirements as the basis for an intervention .
It is for this pioneering of Obama ’s policy of national shake - up that Gist received the praise of Education Secretary Duncan .
The Central Falls firings have received national and even international coverage .
The Christian Science Monitor commented on the firings , “ It is possible that this is a watershed moment in US labor history , not unlike the Reagan administration ’s firing of unionized air traffic controllers in the early ’ 80s .
The reaction has been muted so far because the Obama administration is Democratic , but public - sector unions must be paying close attention to what is happening . ”
Even under conditions of a direct attack on teacher representation , however , the unions prove incapable of confronting the Democratic Party to which they have repeatedly subordinated the interests of their members .
Reporting on a meeting of national and local union leaders that took place Friday , February 26 , the Providence Journal quoted Macia Reback , president of Rhode Island Federation of Teachers , saying , “ No one anticipated this .
I ’m not sure even the Obama administration anticipated that as a result of their regulations , there would be mass firings . ”
The general line of media commentary on the firings has been to portray the teachers as overpaid and unwilling to sacrifice for the good of the children .
Much has been made of their supposedly exorbitant salaries of $ 72,000 a year , with frequent contrasts to the median income of Central Falls , which stood at $ 22,628 against the national figure of $ 41,994 , according to the 2000 US Census .
None of these media commentators find it necessary to mention the pay of Education Commissioner Gist , who , according to a May 2009 article in the Providence Journal , receives a total compensation of $ 203,870 a year .
Neither has anyone in the mainstream media sought to explain how firing the school ’s entire staff , including all teachers and the school psychiatrist , is supposed to turn the school around .
The boarded up Central Falls Department of Parks &
Recreation building
No one would deny that there are real problems in Central Falls , both inside and outside the school .
The high school sits at the center of Rhode Island ’s smallest and most impoverished city of the same name .
The square mile of Central Falls is an old mill town in which textile workers clashed with the National Guard in 1934 .
A boarded up house adjacent to the school
Today the city is 65 percent Hispanic and home to some of the state ’s poorest families .
The city had an official unemployment rate of 13.8 percent for December 2009 , reaching as high as 16.9 percent in July of last year .
In 2007 some 30.1 percent of Central Falls residents had incomes below the official poverty line , compared with 12 percent for the whole state .
The official poverty rate in 2007 was $ 10,210 for a one - person household and $ 20,650 for a household of four people .
Incredibly , some 12.5 percent of Central Falls families had incomes below 50 percent of the poverty level compared to 5.2 percent in the state as a whole .
More than 43 percent of children in the city live below the poverty level compared to 17.3 percent for the state .
With figures such as these , combined with a pupil base for many of whom English is not their first language , it is hardly surprising that the local high school would rank below the national or state average for performance .
The immediate vicinity of the school is littered with boarded up housing and “ For Rent ” signs .
The impact of the economic crisis can be seen in a listing of foreclosures for the city .
The high school is located on Summer Street , which is surrounded by bank owned properties .
The Central Falls Department of Parks and Recreation is among the boarded up buildings .
The World Socialist Web Site spoke to Aaron Lessa , who lives close to Central Falls .
Like many in the area , Aaron considers the problems at the high school to be reflective of the social conditions in the area , rather than the fault of the teachers .
Aaron Lessa
He told the WSWS , “ I think it ’s wrong that they fire all the teachers , because it ca n’t be the teachers ’ fault that the kids are doing bad .
For them to fire all the teachers is just going to shred their relationships with the schools .
Kids build lifelong relationships with these teachers , and I ’m sure that because the teachers are leaving it ’s going to make most kids want to leave the school .
It ’s not going to empower kids to want to stay in school and strive to do better .
It will make them look down on the school system and it is just going to make the superintendent look bad for taking the money out of all those teachers ’ pockets .
“ If you look at Central Falls and the high school , they ’re one of the worst schools in the state .
Economically things are n’t doing too good around here , especially with the recession .
Nobody has got money .
It is pulling hope away from the kids .
It ’s sending the wrong message .
If people are n’t doing things right , they are just going to get pushed to the side rather than brought up .
Just like they are doing to the teachers , the teachers supposedly are n’t doing things properly , so they are just going to fire all of them .
It ’s not a good message to the kids .
“ There were a lot of promises that Obama made .
He was supposed to fix everything .
It takes time to build up the economy , but there are a lot of empty promises that have n’t been fulfilled .
People were looking for that golden ticket after Bush left office , and everyone was putting that hope into Obama .
He ’s not superman , but nothing ’s changed at all .
“ There is a high drop - out rate right now .
A lot of kids do n’t want to finish school .
To be honest , if I was a student in Central Falls High School right now , I would transfer to a better school if I had the opportunity .
I would go to a better high school , because if you were to go somewhere other than Central Falls you would get looked at by more colleges .
The way the school system is right now there is nothing good coming out of CF , especially after firing all the teachers .
“ I do n’t see the logic to it .
They are going to give more funding to schools that get better grades and less to schools that get worse grades .
There is no logic behind that .
They should stop worrying about the people on top and start building people up from the bottom .
The rich get richer , and the poor get poorer .
We have to change that . ”

Nagle was arrested last Wednesday on a New York warrant and charged with stalking actress Kathryn Erbe , who plays Detective Alex Eames in " Law & Order : Criminal Intent . "
The show 's season premiere was last night on the USA Network , and Erbe , who also had roles in the HBO series " Oz " and the Bill Murray comedy " What About Bob ? " is expected to depart the series this season .
A Short Story About Verbosity
In the early 2000s I was writing a book .
I do n't mean in the vague sense of sitting in a coffeeshop with my laptop and pretending to be a writer ; I had a contract with a tech book publisher .
I 'm in full agreement with the musician 's saying of " never turn down a gig , " so when the opportunity arose , I said yes .
I did that even though there was one big , crazy caveat :
" In order for a book to sell , " said my publisher , " it 's got to be thick .
600 pages thick . "
" In the worst case we could go as low as 500 pages , but 600 + should be your target . "
Wow , 600 pages .
If I wrote two pages a day , that 's almost a full year of writing , and I had less than a year .
But still , never turn down a gig , and so I took a serious attempt at it .
I can't prove or refute the claim that a 600 page tech book sells better than thinner ones , but it explains a lot of the bloated tomes out there .
Mix sections of code with the text , then reprint the whole program at the end of the chapter .
That can eat four or eight pages .
Add a large appendix that reiterates a language 's standard library , even though all that info is already in the help system and online .
Add some fluff survey chapters that everyone is going to skip .
I try not to wax nostalgic about how the olden days of computing were better .
While I might have some fond memories of designing games for 8 - bit home computers , there has been a lot of incredibly useful progress since then .
But I do find myself wishing that the art of the 250 page technical book had n't gone completely out of style .
Eventually I did give up on the 600 page monster I was writing .
It was a combination of me not having enough time and my publisher taking weeks to give feedback about submitted chapters .
In the end I think I had written the introduction and maybe eight full chapters .
Do I wish I had finished it ?
Yes .
Even with the 600 page requirement , there was still some clout that went along with writing a book at the time .
These days it 's much less so , and I think those padded - out - to 600 pages volumes had a lot to do with it .

ISP Internode plans to double its share of network capacity between Sydney and the USA before June as part of a five year deal with Southern Cross Cable network .
Adelaide - based Internode stepped up its capacity on the crucial link from 5 Gbps to 7.5 Gbps this week , and the company said it planned to upgrade to 10 Gbps in the second quarter .
Under a five year deal with Southern Cross , signed in February 2008 , Internode will further boost its share of the link to 20 Gbps in 2011 .
Since 2005 , Internode has maintained two geographically separate links on Southern Cross - one from Sydney to Los Angeles and the other from Sydney to San Jose .
The ISP also has links on the Australia - Japan cable and Pipe 's PPC - 1 through Guam to the United States .
At present , its total international capacity exceeds 15 Gbps .
Internode managing director Simon Hackett [ pictured ] raved of the quality of the Southern Cross link .
" The Southern Cross Cable proposition , with the lowest latency to the US and fully protected circuit capacity , is the highest quality Internet path to the US - hands down , " he said .
Hackett said he was interested in learning more about a plan announced yesterday for a new link between Australia and the United States .
" We look forward to talking to [ Pacific Fibre ] when they 're ready to start talking to us , " he said .
It ’s war you can watch on video , much like a movie , except the victims really die and the killers really murder .
If you watch and listen to the entire recording of the July 12 , 2007 helicopter attack on a group of Iraqi civilians , including two Reuters employees , you will hear the repeated use of military call signs , but towards the end , you hear an exasperated voice sharing an aside with " Kyle . "
It ’s Grand Theft Auto meets Reno 911 — except it is n’t .
One is entertained by GTA and the antics of incompetent policepeople .
One is simply floored by what our soldiers are doing , and how they are doing it .
In their defense , they say , " This is war . "
Except , of course , it is n’t war at all .
It ’s an occupation , and a partial occupation at that .
In July 2007 , the Iraq mission had been accomplished for over four years .
We are allies with Eurasia ; we have always been at war with Eastasia .
How could you have possibly missed it ?
Reuters had a longstanding FOIA request for this record of how their unarmed employees died that day .
The military delayed , refused , and by some reports , lost the videotape .
WikiLeaks apparently received an anonymous donation of the evidence Reuters had asked for , and they posted it .
The military has confirmed the authenticity and is downplaying what happened , with the help of major American media .
So far , views on YouTube are over 4 million and rising .
If you watch what American soldiers and their commanders did on that day , and presumably on many such days , you will be struck by the laughter .
Laughing when they shoot , after they shoot , in viewing the dead and near dead , and even laughing as they drive over the bodies in a hurry to record mission success .
For the most part , this is n’t nervous laughter ; instead , it is the laughter of thugs , the laughter of bullies .
You may also be struck by the obsession with personal safety and the reliance on technology to murder and maim from afar — a disturbing trend that air operations have known for decades .
From a distance , the men and a few children appear to be scurrying insects .
Except , of course , they are not .
The conditioning of our soldiers in occupation operations is clear , and complete .
Listen to the recording .
The people are the enemy , and if they or their children die , it ’s their own fault for being in a war zone .
As some have noted , when these guys leave the military they often join local police and security forces .
Can they turn off the hatred and brutality and self - justification when it is Americans who are congregating and scurrying ?
WikiLeaks has worried the Pentagon for some time .
The website recently posted a two - year - old Army intelligence product entitled , " An Online Reference to Foreign Intelligence Services , Insurgents , or Terrorist Groups ?
The report indicates that the Army considers WikiLeaks a threat , observes approvingly that allies China , Israel and Russia block such sites and prosecute the leakers , and suggests that " The identification , exposure , or termination of employment of or legal actions against current or former insiders , leakers , or whistleblowers could damage or destroy this center of gravity and deter others from using WikiLeaks.org to make such information public . "
Suspicion confirmed .
American official defense strategy is " shoot the messenger . "
The problem for the state , as Gary North explained so clearly , is that we are all messengers .
For the first time , it is clear that the problem for the people is , er , well , we are all messengers .
As the American public discovers the record of this one slaughter conducted by American troops on this one day in July four years ago , and they will , it will become far more important than the leak of the torture photographs at Abu Ghraib .
Just as this July 2007 slaughter is a typical and mundane operation , the torture at Abu Ghraib was n’t the worst , or only case of American torture of the incarcerated under the auspices of the War on Terror .
General Miller and many others had developed these techniques and cultured the attitudes , the standing orders and practices at Guantanamo , and at the American gulag of secret holding facilities across Europe and Asia .
The release of the pictures did not signify the end of the torture or the occupations , but over time , the images did have a powerful social impact on Americans .
Americans were forced to think about torture as legal policy , they were forced to talk about it because the media inundated us with it , and they were forced take sides .
Many supported torture as politically necessary and expedient , but many more were repulsed , and felt betrayed and discredited by the state and the military .
Specifically , Abu Ghraib marked the beginning of the end of blind unquestioning fundamentalist Christian support for George W. Bush .
However , the Abu Ghraib revelations did not seriously change politics .
It was a big media topic throughout most of 2004 , yet George W. Bush and his cohorts in crime , the Republican and Democratic Parties , maintained power as before .
That ’s mainly because those tortured were not humanized , and the guilty parties , as we were told by the brass and the media , were a bunch of low - ranking redneck losers .
Meaning , it ca n’t happen here .
The New Baghdad Massacre , however , is going to have quite a different effect .
The murderers are pilots and army aircrew , and of course , their higher - ranking bosses back at HQ .
The mainstream state media is not talking about the video , showing only sanitized versions of it , back paging and burying the story .
But like a quiet insistent melody in the back of our minds , average Americans hear their voices .
They sound remarkably like voices we know .
The political class in this country does n’t come out of trailer parks and put dog collars on prisoners .
The political class in this country , supported by and supporting the mainstream media , could rest easy watching the bad apples in Abu Ghraib go to jail , and they did .
This class of people , however , senses that something has changed .
The tenor has shifted , a certain shrill coolness is now in the air .
These casual acts of inhumanity were conducted by people with whom they are identified .
The political class smells blood , and it may be their own .
As I reel , and millions of other Americans are reeling , from this sadistic yet oddly routinized Iraq occupation activity , I read that in Afghanistan , special forces soldiers actually dug bullets out of dead Afghan women killed in a raid , in order to avoid accountability .
We do not yet know if they were laughing and joking as they cut and sawed the flesh of the freshly murdered .
State wars are advertised and sold as wars of honor and justice .
The Afghanistan and Iraq invasions , occupations , and rigged elections of our political lackeys have followed that playbook very closely .
This New Baghdad video brings home the naked reality of what the state has done , what the state is doing , and what it can do in the name of force protection — and absolutely nothing else .
It ’s not war at all .
But it is the wake - up call to immediately end the extravagant spending on offense that most Americans have been waiting for .
For the political class , the state and its parasites , the other shoe is now falling .

UXO stands for Unexploded Ordinance – bombs dropped from the air or land mines placed in the earth – that remain dormant , often for decades , until touched off by contact or by heat to do their deadly work long after war ’s end .
Such was the fate of Ho Nguyen , a 40 - year - old farmer in Viet Nam ’s Quang Tri Province on February 12th , just two days before Tet , the joyous Asian Lunar New Year celebration .
He was killed while weeding the banana trees in his field by a UXO cluster bomb , dropped by our military perhaps before he was born .
There are estimates that 30 % of cluster bombs do not explode on initial impact .
Mr. Nguyen leaves behind a wife and six young daughters .
Just three weeks before , in the same province of Quang Tri , 550 middle school children narrowly escaped death and injury when a buried 105 mm missile exploded in their school play yard , shattering windows and hurling shrapnel .
( An over - sized tree had been felled and the remaining stump was being burned – detonating the hidden UXO . )
This happened on Wednesday , January 27th , the day Howard Zinn died .
Perhaps
The Great Humanitarian ’s departing spirit intervened to spare the 13 to 15 - year - olds , who would have been out on the playground a mere 5 minutes later for recess .
The first sentence of the Boston Globe ’s obituary for Zinn reads , “ Howard Zinn , the Boston University historian and political activist who was an early opponent of US involvement in Vietnam ……. died today .
He was 87 . ” Zinn knew that more explosive power than World War I and II combined – including Hiroshima and Nagasaki – was dropped on South East Asia in the form of conventional bombs ….. 450 Hiroshimas on Viet Nam alone , to say nothing of Laos and Cambodia .
On February 7th , just five days before the farmer ’s death , a Sunday afternoon explosion of old wartime ordnance seriously wounded four Van Kieu men , all in their 20s , while they were weeding a coffee plantation near the former U.S. Marine Combat Base of Khe Sanh – again in Western Quang Tri .
The accident occurred in Tram Village , where the Van Kieu and Paco ethnic minorities make up most of the local population .
All three recent incidents happened in Quang Tri , the northern most province of southern Viet Nam – hard up against the DMZ ( Demilitarized Zone , or 17th parallel – the Western Power ’s arbitrary division of North from South in the mid-1950s ) .
Quang
Tri remains the most heavily bombed area of the country , accounting for 7,000 ( 1.2 % of the population ) of the more than 105,000 Viet Namese children and adults killed or injured since the war ’s “ end ” in 1975 .
Fully one third of those casualties are victims of cluster munitions .
Ho Nguyen died in the Western part of Quang Tri , just 5 kilometers southwest from the infamous “ Rockpile ” – a huge , natural out cropping of stone used by our Army and Marines as an observation post and artillery base from 1966 to 1968 .
“ The big guns were there , too : 175 Long Toms , 8 - inchers on tracks and of course a bevy of 105s and 155s , ” reads the webpage on the Rockpile .
It was perhaps one of those 105 mm shells that landed over 40 years ago near Dong Ha City in the Eastern part of Quang Tri , the present - day location of the middle school .
Back then the Department of Defense estimated that such missiles had a 10 % failure rate ( this rate has been lowered since then ) .
Mr. Nguyen ’s uncle heard the explosion and was the first to rush to the accident scene .
When he arrived , he saw his nephew lying lifeless on the ground .
Both his hands were severed , his eyes were badly damaged , his skin scorched from the chest up to his face .
His wife and six daughters , the youngest only three years old , are facing shock and grief , and an uncertain future .
The family ’s emotional tragedy is compounded by the loss of their only breadwinner , who also supported his aging parents .
“ I married twice but have only that son , ” lamented Nguyen ’s father , Mr. Ho Van Mong , who was a guerrilla fighter during the war .
“ How can I live on without him ? ”
It is too late for Mr. Nguyen and his family , but Project Renew is pressing forward in an heroic effort to clean up Quang Tri Province .
Founded in 2001 and directed by an American veteran , Chuck Searcy , Project Renew is supported by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund ( the group that built The Wall in Washington , D.C. ) and individual donations .
The Project has removed thousands of UXOs – you can see their exemplary work at : www.landmines.org.vn

Teen detective Nancy Drew , of all people , led Peggy Wilkins to Playboy .
It was July 1978 in Kalamazoo , Michigan , and 13 - year - old Peggy was a huge fan of the TV series .
That summer the actress who played Nancy , Pamela Sue Martin , appeared on the cover of Playboy .
Coyly holding a magnifying glass , she was wearing an artfully draped trench coat and clearly little else .
Peggy had to have it .
But how ?
The shopkeeper peered at her skeptically .
" Are you 18 ? " he demanded .
" No , sorry ! " Peggy admitted , and ran away .
She screwed up her courage to ask her mother .
" Not gonna happen . "
So Peggy did what any real fan would do in the face of adversity .
She went back to the store where the magazine was , made sure the coast was clear , and stole it .
That was the start of a long romance between Wilkins and Playboy , but the courtship had begun three years earlier .
Ten - year - old Peggy stumbled across her parents '
Book - of - the - Month Club copy of Norman Mailer 's Marilyn .
The Milton Greene photographs of Marilyn Monroe sparked a fascination with the aesthetic and glamour of 50s - era Hollywood .
" The women are almost always smiling , " Wilkins explains .
" It 's not a detached model — there 's a connection with the viewer , a sense of fun . "

Marilyn kept the self - described " geek " in the library for long hours , reading biographies and poring over microfilms of old magazines , and drove her to take the bus around town buying old books and magazines from library and garage sales .
Her schoolmates did n't understand her affinity for these materials — or , for that matter , for old movies , pinup art , and big band music ;
Wilkins says they were " more interested in popular music and current TV shows . "
As a result , she entered her teens " totally ostracized . "
Marilyn was Playboy 's first Playmate — or , as she was called in the December 1953 issue , Sweetheart of the Month .
When the 25th - anniversary issue came out in 1979 , Marilyn was featured prominently in its 410 pages .
Of course , Wilkins had to have that , too .
Having no more luck procuring that issue by honest means than the Pamela Sue Martin issue the year before , she resorted again to thievery .
When she finally got her hands on it , she was floored .
" It just had amazing content , " she says .
" It spoke to many of my personal interests in terms of pinup style photography .
They present their Playmates very much in a similar way that Hollywood presents its glamorous movie stars , especially 40 to 50 years ago . "
Wilkins was 14 in January 1980 , when she successfully bought a Playboy for the first time , and since then she 's bought every issue , new and old .
She hid her magazines from her mother in boxes in the closet — and she hid her obsession from just about everyone else she knew too .
" The first person I told was my high school boyfriend , " she says .
" Of course I told him . "
In 1983 she left Kalamazoo for the University of Chicago , where she took out a subscription .
She 's been a subscriber ever since .
Nowadays Wilkins has far too many Playboys to hide in a closet .
She shares an apartment with her current boyfriend , Dean Armstrong , in Hyde Park , and rents the one - bedroom apartment above them to house her collections .
( " Having a Playboy collector as your girlfriend is fantastic , " says Armstrong .
" There 's no downside to it . " )
The apartment is packed with loose magazines and stacks of boxes , and its walls are lined with posters of Marilyn and famous Playboy covers .
The bedroom walls disappear behind leather Playboy storage cases embossed with the famous bowtied bunny , which sit on wooden shelves held up by cinder blocks .
These cases hold the best - preserved copies Wilkins could find ; the others , stuffed into cardboard boxes , are duplicates .
" I worry about these bookshelves sometimes , " she admits .
" They just came with the apartment .
This has got to weigh like 3,000 pounds . "

In the living room , positioned so it 's the first thing you see when you enter the apartment , is the crown jewel : one of the original 53,991 issues of Playboy Volume 1 , Number 1 .
On the cover , Hugh Hefner 's autograph ends by Marilyn 's smiling face .
In the upstairs apartment 's bedroom , which doubles as a guest room , Wilkins pulls out her copy of Playboy : The Complete Centerfolds , 1953 - 2002 , a 35 - pound leatherbound paean to the girl next door .
Many of the pages have been autographed by the women on them .
" Basically , it 's classic pinup art , " Wilkins says .
" They used to spend over $ 30,000 a month producing this single image , taking hundreds of shots on eight - by - ten film .
Literally , many of them are works of art .
They could be hanging in a museum . "
Flipping through , she stops on May 2002 , Christi Shake : " Look at the note she 's holding !
If you look close , it says , ' Dear Mr. Hefner , I would love for you to consider me for a Playmate .
Sincerely , Christi Shake . ' "
April 2003 , Carmella Danielle DeCesare : " The sign says no co-eds in rooms after 10 pm .
If you look at her watch it 's after 10 PM , so the idea is that she 's breaking the rules . "
This attention to detail , to Wilkins 's mind , creates the illusion of an intimate romantic relationship with the viewer .
" It 's just charming , that 's all , " she says .
Wilkins has attention to detail in her genes : her father had a job in high school operating an electron microscope at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati ; later , he became president of Aviation Computer Systems .
She joined a computer programming club when she was in junior high — still an oddity in the late 70s .
She studied music at the University of Chicago but went to work in the Regenstein Library as soon as she graduated .
Today she runs Unix servers for the library .
When the Internet emerged , Wilkins used it to find other people who shared her interest in Playboy .
She participated in conversations on alt.mag.playboy on Usenet and was one of the first ten subscribers to the Playboy Mailing List , started in 1994 at the University of Michigan .
Now she moderates it .
Through the mailing list — which its members call the PML for short — she met Mark Tomlonson , who , oddly enough , was also from Kalamazoo .
Tomlonson began reviewing centerfolds on the list in an " attempt to recall the impact certain outstanding centerfolds had had on me when I first saw them , " he explains in an e-mail .
Eventually he took on all of them , churning out a 200 - word review on each Playmate 's birthday over the course of 18 months : " In my personal life , several things were taking a turn for the worse .
. . . " he writes .
The reviews " provided structure in my life at a time when the old structures seemed shaky . "
Wilkins gave Tomlonson 's reviews a larger audience by linking to them on a Web site she created on her computer at work , a " memory aid " of all the knowledge she 'd accumulated about the Playmates — and then some .
The searchable database ( now at wekinglypigs.com ) stores their names , the months they appeared in the magazine , their birthdates and birthplaces , and who photographed them , plus their height , weight , and astonishing measurements .
She also created databases for the Playboy special editions — photo - only issues of Playboy models — and the Playboy Cyber Club Daily Doubles , new photos of Playboy models available only to paying subscribers of Playboy.com .
" I used to have it all memorized , " she says .
" Not to that degree of detail , obviously — but I was constantly wondering , has so - and - so model been featured in the Daily Double ?
It got to be too much to handle . "
The site was featured in Wired and on MSNBC.com , both of which sent it so much traffic that the U. of C. machine she was hosting it on slowed to a crawl .
Wilkins 's online devotion to Playboy also captured the attention of the man at the top : Hugh Hefner .
The company 's new - media division in Chicago found the PML in the mid-90s and began to follow it .
Wilkins says Mary O'Connor , Hefner 's longtime personal secretary , would print out posts she thought would interest him .
" I think we have a lot of common interests , " Wilkins gushes .
" We 're both big movie fans .
I talked about how I got interested in Playboy and how I came to collect it , I talked about the times I met Jane Russell and Alice Faye .
He became quite familiar with me through my writing . "
In 1997 , Wilkins and her PML cohort learned about GlamourCon , a yearly convention that celebrates pinups and commands appearances by past and present Playmates .
Wilkins could n't afford to make the trip to Los Angeles , so PML member Dan Stiffler organized a collection to send her .
Hefner heard about it and invited both Wilkins and Stiffler to visit the Playboy Mansion .
Wilkins , normally reserved and bookish , lights up when she recalls the weekend .
" It was really cool .
He led the tour himself , which they told us is very rare , " she remembers .
" Oh , it was really cool .
We had dinner and went to one of his movie nights , where we saw Liar Liar .
It was his birthday and we saw his wife light the candles on his cake and everything . "
Since then she 's visited the Mansion twice more and has run into Hefner at Playboy events .
" I 've written to him several times and he 's always written me back , " Wilkins says .
" He 's just one of the nicest , most generous people I 've ever met .
A great human being , basically . "

But Wilkins 's fondness for Hef can't overcome her distaste for the direction Playboy has taken in recent years .
Her beloved centerfold , photographed on large - format film for decades , has changed to medium format and then digital photography over the past decade .
Wilkins seethes when she looks at the first digital centerfold ( March 2006 , Monica Leigh ) .
" Look at this ! " she cries .
" It 's grainy .
Her skin tone is all off .
It 's just a technically bad picture . "
About a decade ago the PML began rumbling with discontent over a perceived new emphasis at Playboy on celebrity over the Girl Next Door .
When it was young , Playboy interviewed celebrities — sometimes at enormous length — but it did n't depend on their faces to sell the magazine .
Hefner preferred to put Playmates on the cover , and though Marilyn Monroe launched it , during Playboy 's first 25 years it appeared with a celebrity cover only seven times .
( The numbers are all in Wilkins 's database . )
But eventually Playboy joined the crowd .
It 's published at least seven celebrity covers , and usually more , every year since 1997 .
Also troubling the PML were the rapidly diminishing word counts of the articles .
Around the time of Playboy 's 50th anniversary Wilkins saw the media referring to it as " your grandfather 's magazine " and dismissing it as a " dinosaur . "
Saddest of all , she saw Hefner in interviews " quoting some of those things , and it became clear to me that he actually kind of believed that , that the world had changed , that people do n't want to read as much anymore . "
Wilkins refused to believe that the Playboy she 'd grown up with was a spent cultural force .
" I 'm sorry , " she says indignantly , " but Playboy is not irrelevant . "
She set out to persuade Hefner .
In 2002 she convened the 50th Anniversary Playboy Roundtable , an e-colloquium " bringing together dedicated Playboy readers and contributors to discuss in detail Playboy 's past , present , and future , using the past and present as a springboard to the future , " according to its mission statement .
Hot topics included covers ( no longer as artistic and no longer a reliable tribute to a Playmate , lamented roundtable contributors ) , Playmates ( when even they were displaced on the cover by celebrities a line was crossed ) , and Playboy 's general drift toward Maxim .
This drift did n't simply take the form of shorter , more superficial articles .
In the fall of 2002 Playboy hired Maxim 's executive editor , James Kaminsky , as its editorial director .
Because Kaminsky was in New York and wanted to stay there , the magazine pulled up stakes in Chicago and moved east .
The e-colloquium continued on the PML for months .
When it finally settled down , Wilkins printed it all out , went over the reams of pages with a highlighter , and wrote index cards stressing the most important points .
In 2004 she bound everything together and sent it off to Hef .
" It was a very happy day of my life , " she laughs .
Did it make any difference ?
" It may have been coincidence , but within two weeks of me sending the report he replaced the editorial director , " she says proudly .
Since then , she says , there have been changes for the better , though " quite subtle " ones , with somewhat less emphasis on star power and less " hitting you in the face with a page of nothing but graphics . "
Last year the magazine moved back to Chicago .
( Maxim still casts a shadow : for the past year the editorial director and then " chief content officer " of Playboy 's print and online versions has been Jimmy Jellinek , another former Maxim editor . )
Nothing about Playboy says Playboy more than its centerfolds , which are pornographic in some eyes and simply archaic in others .
When they went digital Wilkins almost canceled her subscription .
" Fortunately , " she says , " they got a higher resolution camera and I 'm still hanging on .
It 's become acceptable , but it 's still not as good . "
The current Playboy , the January / February double issue , offers two Playmates , and Wilkins looks them over with a connoisseur 's eye .
She observes that January 's Playmate is over 30 — " which I love " — and " there 's the sense of a romantic relationship .
They 're in Paris , and you can see a bowtie hanging on a chair and a suit in the background . "
Miss January is " a real beauty " — as is Miss February , both of them " beyond reproach . "
But the centerfolds themselves are merely " OK images , " she says .
" If this were the first Playboy I 'd ever seen I would n't be that impressed . "
She prefers the " stunning " photos of the Playmates that can be seen only by subscribers online .
Hugh Hefner turns 84 this year , and Wilkins is sure now that she 'll stay a Playboy subscriber as long as he 's around .
But once he 's gone , " anything could happen , " she says .
Her beloved centerfolds might not survive ; but it 's more likely , she believes , that the entire magazine will disappear , " just because it 's been so intimately tied up with him , and also because print magazines are in a steady decline . "
She 'd miss the photography most of all : " To me , the mere fact of nudity — what 's degrading about that , especially when it 's presented artfully , beautifully ?
If I were photogenic enough I 'd have been a Playmate in two seconds . "

An independent film is bringing to light a well - kept secret : Soviet dictator Josef Stalin 's only daughter has lived incognito for much of the past two decades in small towns in Wisconsin .
It is unclear whether the 84 - year - old who fiercely guards her privacy still lives here today , but Svetlana Alliluyeva has lived at several addresses around Madison in the last 20 years .
And in the summer of 2007 , a determined filmmaker tracked her down at an apartment at a retirement home in an undisclosed Wisconsin town for a rare interview that could be the last she gives .
A documentary based on the interview , " Svetlana About Svetlana , " tells her fascinating and complex life story , which is probably most noted for her defection to the U.S. during the Cold War .
On April 18 , the film will be screened at the Wisconsin Film Festival in Madison .
First - time director Lana Parshina said she read Alliluyeva 's 1967 memoir , " 20 Letters to a Friend , " when she was a girl growing up in Moscow and loved it .
When she later became a U.S. citizen and learned Alliluyeva was still alive in Wisconsin , she got the idea for the movie .
But first , she had to find the recluse whose father brutally ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years until his death in 1953 .

Alliluyeva 's first tie to Wisconsin came in the early 1970s when she married William Wesley Peters , a noted architect who was Frank Lloyd Wright 's apprentice and lived in Spring Green , Wis. , about 40 miles west of Madison .
They had a daughter , Olga , before divorcing a few years later .
Alliluyeva took on the name Lana Peters , which she still uses .

Wisconsin Film Festival Director Meg Hamel said she grew up with Olga , who now goes by Chrese Evans , in the Madison area , and they knew each other as kids .
Ironically , Evans has attacked the movie as an invasion of her mother 's privacy .
Hamel said she feels comfortable showing the film , whose rights were purchased by New York - based Icarus Films .
" This is a little piece of Wisconsin history , which I 'm interested in sharing with our audience , " she said .
After months of searching for Alliluyeva , Parshina put an ad on Craigslist seeking help , and paid $ 150 to a man who vowed to find her .
Eventually , the man connected her with one of her neighbors , who passed along the interview request .
Alliluyeva called back to tell her to leave her alone .
Parshina would not give up , saying she was influenced by her book and wanted to tell her story .
Alliluyeva would n't budge , warning in one phone message : " Do n't try to come here .
You 'll meet a closed door .
I told you - I do n't want to see anybody . "
Finally , Alliluyeva agreed to allow the 28 - year - old Parshina to come because they shared the same name and " I love young people . "
" She lived in Wisconsin for so long , I would consider her not only an American , but a Wisconsinite . "
But she instructed her not to bring any camera equipment and to pretend like she was just a visitor so that her gossipy neighbors , unaware of her identity , would n't notice anything unusual .
After they spent one day together , Parshina convinced her to allow her to return with Madison freelance videographer William Q. Hartin to tape an interview .
Hartin said Alliluyeva was " very leery of us , " would speak only English , and nearly ended the interview after a question upset her .
" We were walking on egg shells the whole time , " he recalls .
But after hours of talking , he said , he and Parshina gained her trust .
On the second day , Parshina and Alliluyeva spoke in Russian for hours and she opened up .
The result is a fascinating interview that includes reflections on her difficult childhood , her defection and her complex identity .
Alliluyeva said she was grateful to the CIA for helping her defect to the U.S. after she departed the Soviet Union for India in 1966 , where she left the ashes of her late third husband .
Arriving in the U.S. , she denounced communism and her father 's policies .
Her defection embarrassed the ruling communists and was a public relations victory for the U.S .
But Alliluyeva said she ultimately regretted coming to the U.S. , saying she never learned anything from America in 40 years and should have stayed in a neutral country like Switzerland .
" People say , ' Stalin 's daughter , Stalin 's daughter ' , meaning I 'm supposed to walk around with a rifle and shoot the Americans .
Or they say , 'no , she came here .
She is an American citizen , " she says .
" No , I 'm neither one .
I 'm somewhere in between .
That ' somewhere in between ' they can't understand . "
Parshina said she did not give away the location of her apartment in the film to protect Alliluyeva from being harassed by journalists and others .
Hartin would say only that it was about a 45 - minute drive from the city .
After the interview , Parshina says Alliluyeva disappeared again .
She changed her phone number , and letters to her address were returned as undeliverable .
A neighbor told her she had moved .
Parshina said Alliluyeva switched retirement homes every few years to escape notice .
She believes she is still either living in rural Wisconsin , or in Portland , Ore. , with her daughter .
In e-mail messages , the 37 - year - old Evans would not reveal her mother 's whereabouts ( or her own ) .
" She was definitely undercover .
Nobody knows who she is , " Hartin recalled .
" She lived in Wisconsin for so long , I would consider her not only an American but a Wisconsinite . "

MORRISTOWN , N.J. —
On a Friday in 1989 , before the biggest hockey game of his life , James Olsen walked into his school gym expecting a pep rally .
He 'd waited months for this moment .
The Delbarton School senior played for one of two powerhouse hockey teams set to compete the next day for the New ...
TIJUANA , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Police running scared from drug gangs in one of Mexico ’s deadliest cities are using bizarre rituals involving animal sacrifice and spirit tattoos to seek protection from raging violence on the U.S. border .
In secret meetings that draw on elements of Haitian Voodoo , Cuban Santeria and Mexican witchcraft , priests are slaughtering chickens on full moon nights on beaches , smearing police with the blood and using prayers to evoke spirits to guard them as drug cartels battle over smuggling routes into California .
Other police in the city of Tijuana , across the border from San Diego , tattoo their bodies with Voodoo symbols , believing they can repel bullets .
“ Sometimes a man needs another type of faith , ” said former Tijuana policeman Marcos , who left the city force a year ago after surviving a drug gang attack .
“ I was saved when they killed two of my mates .
I know why I did n’t die . ”
Violence has exploded along the U.S. border since President Felipe Calderon set the army on drug cartels in late 2006 .
Turf wars have killed 19,000 people across Mexico over three years .
Badly - paid Mexican police have long prayed to Christian saints before going out on patrol in Mexico , the world ’s second - most populous Roman Catholic country after Brazil .
Cops are part of a messy war between rival trafficking gangs and the army as cartels infiltrate police forces , offering officers cash to work and even murder for them or a bullet if they say no .
More than 150 police are among those killed in Tijuana and the surrounding Baja California state since 2007 .
Army raids on homes of police working for cartels have found ornately adorned Santeria - type altars covered with statues and skulls stuffed with money paying homage to gods and spirits .
“ We all know that guns and body armor are useless against the cartels because they are well - armed and can attack any time .
But this is something we can believe in , that really works , ” said a Tijuana - based policeman called Daniel .
BLACK MAGIC
A battle between top drug lord fugitive Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman and the local Arellano Felix drug clan has wrecked tourism in Tijuana and shuttered manufacturing businesses .
Small groups of police in the city started turning to strange rituals about 18 months ago , a practice spotted when municipal cleaners found a trail of dead chickens on beaches .
Priests and police say the animal sacrifices release life to rejuvenate spirits that will shield officers against hitmen .
They believe the effects are intensified on full moon nights .
Many police see a need to shield themselves from witchcraft used by drug gangs who mix Caribbean black magic and occultism from southern Mexico using things like human bones , dead bats and snake fangs to curse enemies and unleash evil spirits .
Others worship the Mexican cult of “ Saint Death ” , a skeletal grim reaper draped in white and carrying a scythe .
The rituals are carried out by sometimes shadowy Mexicans who have menial day jobs and are priests by night .
They claim to be trained in Voodoo , Santeria and other religions from time spent in the Caribbean and in Mexican towns like Catemaco , a center for witchcraft on the Gulf of Mexico .
Police have the quiet support of their superiors .
“ We know some agents use charms , saints and other methods for their protection , ” said Baja California federal police chief Elias Alvarez .
“ They look for something to believe in . ”
Mexico ’s often poorly armed police are intimidated by hitmen with automatic rifles , grenades and rocket launchers and despite low wages of around $ 300 a month some pay up to $ 160 for a tattoo of a Voodoo spirit like the three - horned Bosou Koblamin who protects his followers when they travel at night .
Joe Stack , the bass - playing , tax - hating Austin divebomber who murdered at least one person yesterday , left a confusingly post - partisan populist suicide note , making it hard for pundits to assign blame for his actions to their political opponents .
But they 're still trying .
As soon as Stack 's suicide note was discovered online yesterday , the political calculations began :
He hated Bush ( so do liberals ! ) .
He hated taxes ( so do Tea Partiers ! ) .
He hated religion , but he also thought we live under a totalitarian regime .
He approvingly quoted Karl Marx , but he hated government bureaucrats .
That 's quite an incoherent grab - bag of positions , often with mutually exclusive political implications , which is n't really surprising seeing as how it was issued by someone who set his own house on fire and then piloted an airplane into a building .
But since we 've lately had a rash of sudden and random violence from politically motivated actors , from James von Brunn to Scott Roeder , the de rigeur ( and sometimes justified ) next step is to associate the murderer 's rantings with other law - abiding political partisans , and begin the laying of blame .
Since Stack 's manifesto is so confusing , the initial moves yesterday as the event unfolded were preemptive :
He 's not one of ours .
Literally minutes after the note was discovered , CNN's Rick Sanchez was on the air arguing that Stack 's condemnation of " presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies " should be taken with a grain of salt , because Stack also attacked " Obama 's policies " ( though that 's not really true — he seems to support health care reform , and nothing about the tax system that Stack rails against is specifically associated with Obama ) .
Time observed that the note " eerily reflected the angry populist sentiments that have swept the country in the past year , " obliquely referring to the teabaggers .
Meanwhile , the right - wingers at Newsbusters started complaining that the " liberal media " was deliberately covering up Stack 's shout - out to Marx , which constituted " perhaps the most politically consequential lines in the entire note " and proved conclusively that he was no teabagger .
Last night , Laura Ingraham warned Bill O'Reilly that " over the next few days , you will hear from the left and all the crazies that , you know , we talk about other networks and so forth trying to tie CPAC maybe , the Tea Party movement , all of this anger on the right that is out there ....
I mean , you 're going to hear that .
I do n't think it 's believable .
The guy is obviously a total nut . "
And this morning .
Michelle Malkin launched a screed against the " furious left - wing bloggers " trying to link Stack to right - wing rage , arguing that " no law - abiding Tea Party group would ever condone what he did " ( ignoring the question of how the law - breaking Tea Party groups feel about it ) .
It 's all a tiresome little game , really .
When someone who hates taxes and the government kills people , he 's a lone nut and anyone who says otherwise is a disingenuous liberal .
When a Muslim who hates the war in Afghanistan kills people , he 's part of a sophisticated international terrorist conspiracy and anyone who says otherwise is a traitor .
The same people who are so strenuously declaiming that anti-tax rhetoric and ideas had nothing to do with his crime were literally days ago shouting that the Alabama professor who shot up her tenure committee was a " ' far - left political extremist who was ' obsessed ' with President Obama ' " — as though we are at risk of a rash of gun crimes from Harvard - educated lefties .
Stack is one in a long , long line of people who have attempted to injure or kill IRS agents .
People have hated tax collectors for as long as people have liked money .
Honestly , his profile — a bass player in the Austin country - rock scene , graduate of the Milton Hershey School for troubled teens in Pennsylvania , and lover of jazz — does n't seem to align too well with the reactionary gun-toting revanchist types that show up at Tea Party rallies .
He sounds a little like a hippie .
And to the extent that his little screed seemed to take up opposing threads of the contemporary political debate , it 's silly to try to fit him into a caricature of either side .
He was motivated by rage at his own failures , for which he blamed faceless bureaucrats .
But he did hate the IRS , and he did hate taxes , and he did feel entitled to not have to pay them .
Political partisans will always be able to find examples of violent extremism with which to tar their opponents .
The balaclava - clad lefties who throw rocks at G5 meetings are ideological cousins of the American left , just as Timothey McVeigh and Eric Rudolph were ideological cousins of the teabaggers .
The difference is that the Democratic Party establishment is n't currently engaged in actively fomenting the sort of rage that motivates the fringe of their party .
The problem is n't that the right wing is creating Joe Stacks , or should be held responsible for inciting them .
It 's impossible to know whether Stack would have done what he did absent a current environment of deluded anti-government hysteria on the right wing , but given the facts that his grievances go back to the Reagan era and that he seems to have been squeezed to despair by the recession , it 's likely that his rage transcended the Fox News - driven political dynamic .
And there will always be people like him .
The problem is that the GOP and Fox News are currently addressing their political messaging to people like him .
They 're not creating or inciting the right - wing fringe so much as bringing it in from the cold .

Heute wurde in Großbritanien die Digital Economy Bill im britischen Unterhaus behandelt .
Lediglich 20 Abgeordnete hielten es für nötig , sich an der Aussprache zu beteiligen .
In Ermangelung an Phantasie für die Entwicklung neuer Geschäftsmodelle jammert die Clique aus Verlegern , Musikverlagen und Filmindustrie ständig rum und fordert neue Rechte - völlig ohne Rücksicht auf den Schutz der Bürgerrechte .
Nicht mal die Rechte ihrer eigenen Kunden werden von diesen Leuten wirklich respektiert , garantiert doch keines der mittlerweile Rechtsschutz genießenden Digital Rights Management Systeme das Eigentumsrecht der Kunden und es kommt immer wieder vor , das die redlichen Kunden in die Röhre schauen .
Da kommerzielle Interessenvertreter immer wieder versuchen werden , sich mit Hilfe der Westerwelles dieser
Welt über Lobbyarbeit einen Vorteil zu verschaffen , sind Bürgerrechte erst dann sicher , wenn die Interessenvertreter aus Presse , Musik - und Filmindustrie vom Verbraucher überzeugt werden , dass diese nicht gewillt sind , ihr Treiben zu akzeptieren und eine entsprechende Selbstverpflichtung abgeben .
Wie kann so etwas erreicht werden ?
Es gibt etliche Studien , die belegen
... die oben genannten Industrien also Vorzugsweise die systematische Kriminalisierung ihrer eigenen Kunden betreibt .
Aber wie macht man einem Haufen phantasieloser alter Männer so etwas so klar , dass sie es trotz Vorurteilsbarriere zur Kenntnis nehmen müssen ?
Das kann nur über das Geld geschehen , die einzige Sprache die verstanden wird .
So ein Signal muss eindeutig und für jeden nachvollziehbar sein .
Die Medienindustrie lebt auch von Hypes und um diese zelebrieren zu können , haben sie Media Control geschaffen , das wöchentlich die Umsatzzahlen bekanntgibt , um eine entsprechende Rangliste zu erstellen .
Diese haben jahrzehntelange Tradition und können demzufolge nicht ohne Weiteres zu Vertuschungszwecken abgeschafft werden .
Würden jetzt alle Menschen , die Ihre Bürgerrechte gefährdet oder sich unangemessen kriminalisiert sehen , darauf achten , dass sie nur noch an ungeraden Wochen Medienprodukte kaufen , leihen oder bezahlen , so entstünde ein für alle sichtbares Signal .
Die Aktion könnte unbefristet laufen und sich so langsam aufschaukeln und weltweit verbreiten und würde von Media Control & Co öffentlich zugänglich unmissverständlich und objektiv dokumentiert .
Irgendwann müsste , wenn die Wissenschaftler Recht haben , die Amplitude so riesig werden , dass die Talsohlen so tief sein , dass sie alleine schon den Managern den Angstschweiß auf die Stirn treiben müsste .
Folgendes sollten die Verbraucher in Wochen mit gerader Nummer im Kalender unterlassen :

World - renowned spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar shares how to be your best self during stressful times
Verizon Media ’s CEO Guru Gowrappan and CTO Rathi Murthy sat down with world renowned humanitarian , spiritual leader and Art of Living founder The Art of Living Foundation , Sri Sri Ravi Shankar , to discuss how to be your best self during stressful times .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Dark matter , which contains the " missing mass " that 's needed to explain why galaxies stay together , could take any number of forms .
The main possible candidates include MACHOS and WIMPS , but there is no shortage of proposals .
Rather , the biggest challenge is finding some evidence that would support one or more of these candidates .
Currently , more than 30 experiments are underway trying to detect a sign of dark matter .
So far , only two experiments claim to have found signals , with the most recent observations coming just a month ago .
Now , physicist Robert Foot from the University of Melbourne has shown that the results of these two experiments can be simultaneously explained by an intriguing dark matter candidate called mirror matter .
As it name implies , mirror matter is basically a spatial reflection of ordinary matter .
Matter particles can be either left - handed or right - handed , so if an ordinary matter particle were left - handed , its mirror particle would be right - handed , but exactly identical in every other way .
In the theory of mirror matter , every ordinary matter particle ( e.g. protons , electrons , etc. ) would have a mirror particle , thus doubling the number of particles in the universe .
The inspiration for mirror matter came from an experiment performed in 1956 that showed that the laws of nature are not left - right symmetrical ( also called parity - symmetrical , or p- symmetrical ) .
Specifically , the experiment showed that particles in weak interactions display a preference for left - handedness , so that in a way , the Universe is left - handed .
Since the other two forms of symmetry - rotational and translational - do seem to be symmetrical everywhere in nature , scientists wonder why nature does n’t have p-symmetry as well .
But if mirror matter exists , it would solve this problem by having slight right - handedness and restoring the Universe ’s p-symmetry .
At first , mirror matter may sound a bit like antimatter ( which is ordinary matter with an opposite charge ) .
In both theories , the number of known particles would double .
However , while antimatter interacts very strongly with ordinary matter , annihilating itself into photons , mirror matter would interact very weakly with ordinary matter .
For this reason , some physicists have speculated that mirror particles could be candidates for dark matter .
Even though mirror matter would produce light , we would not see it , and it would be very difficult to detect .
However , mirror matter would not be impossible to detect , and Foot thinks that the DAMA experiment and the CoGeNT experiment may have detected mirror matter .
In DAMA , scientists observed a piece of sodium iodide , which should generate a photon when struck by a dark matter particle .
Since the experiment is Earth - based , the scientists predicted that they would observe more photons during the time of year that the Earth is moving toward the dark matter background than away from it - and they did .
The more recent CoGeNT experiment is similar , where scientists found evidence of dark matter collisions in a germanium crystal .
Interestingly , both DAMA ’s and CoGeNT ’s results involve particles of a similar mass range .
In Foot ’s model , if ordinary and mirror particles interact with each other via a process called photon - mirror photon kinetic mixing , then mirror particles could explain both results .
In Foot ’s theory , a mirror particle plasma would be the predominant ingredient in galactic halos , where dark matter seems to be “ hiding ” based on observations of its gravity ’s effects .
While this proposal supports the possibility of mirror matter as dark matter , Foot added that experiments in the near future will further test this idea .

The postcode lottery facing men with prostate cancer in the West Midlands can today be revealed .
New figures show a man 's chances of dying from prostate cancer – the most common cancer in men – vary according to where he lives .
The death rate in Dudley and Sandwell stands at 37.5 per cent above the national average with a rate of 33 deaths per 100,000 of the population , while figures for South Birmingham are 21 per cent below the national average rate of 24 deaths per 100,000 of the population .
Wolverhampton is 8.3 per cent below the average while Walsall is 4.2 per cent below .
Birmingham East and north and Solihull are 17 per cent below the average while South Staffordshire is eight per cent above , according to the Office for National Statistics .
There are more than 10,000 men living with prostate cancer in the West Midlands and nationally one man every hour dies from the condition in the UK .
It is unknown why there are such fluctuations in survival rates but factors such as poverty could be part of it .
John Neate , chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity , said : " These new figures are of particular interest as they show a strong imbalance in death rates for men with prostate cancer across the country .
" While we can be encouraged that prostate cancer services have improved in recent years , this new data underlines that there is still much to be done in tackling the many inequities men with prostate cancer can face .
" Although it is not completely clear why these variations in death rates exist , we know that there are some key areas where rapid changes are needed to help improve a man 's chances of being successfully treated .
" By ensuring every man has the opportunity to make an informed choice about having a test which can give early indication of possible prostate cancer , and can then access a range of effective treatment options , we hope that many more men will survive their cancer . "
Newly compiled figures show the federal and state governments will give a Scientologist - linked private school in Sydney more than $ 1 million .
The Athena School in Newtown says on its website that it teaches from the booklet The Way to Happiness , which was written by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard .
New South Wales Greens MP
John Kaye has compiled data sourced from answers given to questions on notice in both federal and state parliaments .
He found that over the next four years , the school will get about $ 1.4 million of government funding .
" Public money is now being used to support a school that admits to using the discredited Scientology - based teaching methodology , " he said .
New South Wales Greens MP
John Kaye told Parliament last week that recognising Scientology as a religion granted legitimacy to a cult that bullies , intimidates and exploits .
He says governments should not be funding the Athena School .
" It 's time for both the state and federal education ministers to take this seriously , " he said .
" The whistle has been blown on Scientology by Senator Xenophon .
" It 's time for the state and federal governments to act to make sure that their money is not being used to promote Scientology . "

If you ’ve been jonesing for an epic fantasy to help fill the gap between Peter Jackson ‘s “ Lord of the Rings ” movies and the maybe - someday remake of “ Dune , ” HBO may have just rolled the saving throw you needed .
On Tuesday , the cable channel announced that it had officially ordered “ Game of Thrones , ” a new series based on George R. R. Martin ‘s “ Song of Ice and Fire ” fantasy novels .
The best - selling book franchise , which began in 1996 with “ A Game of Thrones , ” chronicles the dynastic conflicts among several families on the mythical continent of Westeros .
The principal cast of the HBO series , which will run 10 episodes , features no less than 17 cast members , including Mark Addy , Sean Bean , Peter Dinklage , Jennifer Ehle , Iain Glen and Lena Headey , as well as Tamzin Merchant ( of “ Pride and Prejudice ” ) as the heroine Daenerys Targaryen .
HBO said that the pilot episode of the series was written by David Benioff ( “ X - Men Origins : Wolverine ” ) and D.B. Weiss ( the author of “ Lucky Wander Boy ” ) , who are also among its executive producers .
Production on the series is to begin in Belfast in June ; a premiere date has not yet been set .
Meanwhile , Mr. Martin should have plenty of time to finish writing the last two books in what he has said is a seven - book series .
Though more and more women are staying single or waiting to marry these days , the stigma against " spinsters " has n’t lessened , a new survey found .
About 40 percent of adults were single in 2009 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Researchers interviewed 32 of these middle - class , never - married women over age 30 .
They found that these women perceive themselves as caught in a double bind :
Their single status made them both highly visible and invisible .
" We found that never - married women 's social environments are characterized by pressure to conform to the conventional life pathway , " said Larry Ganong , co-chair of Human Development and Family at the University of Missouri .
" Heightened visibility came from feelings of exposure , and invisibility came from assumptions made by others . "
For example , the study subjects said they felt more visible in situations such as bouquet tosses at weddings , which prompted unwanted , intrusive questions about the their marriage status .
Yet the respondents also felt invisible in society , with others assuming they were married and had children , and ignoring the reality of single women .
The subjects often felt people expected them to justify or explain their singlehood .
The women also reported other difficulties tied to their social status :
· Awareness of shifting realities as they become older , such as the shrinking pool of eligible men ;
· Reminders that they are on different life paths than most women when others inquire about their single status ;
· Feelings of insecurity and displacement in their families when parents and siblings remark about their singlehood and make jokes or rude comments .
While one might think these annoyances become worse with age , the researchers actually found that dealing with single stigma is the worst for women in their mid-20's through mid-30's , while women older than age 35 tend to be more content with being single and do n't express as much dissatisfaction as do younger women .
Before age 25 , being single is considered more acceptable for women , the study indicates , but after reaching that age , women felt scrutinized by friends , family members and others for their singlehood .
" Mainstream media also enforce these ideas , " Ganong said .
" For example , shows like ' Sex and the City , ' which portray female protagonists who are hyper - focused on finding men , and end with the majority of those characters getting married , are popular . "
Ganong and his co-researcher Elizabeth Sharp of Texas Tech University will detail their findings in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Family Issues .
AT&T 's preaching about the mucho dinero it 's dropping into renovating its network to pretty much anyone who'll listen these days , and a veritable cornucopia of press releases this week start to go into detail on some of the upgrades we 'll be seeing over the course of 2010 .
We 're counting at least a dozen here , covering everything from New York City to Florida to Oklahoma , but the message is basically the same in every one : more cell sites , more 3G coverage , more backhaul .
AT&T liberally pimps its nine - figure investments in most states over the past several years , too -- but of course , phones need spectrum to communicate , not blank checks and promises .
Let 's see how we finish the year after those iPads , next - gen iPhones , and AT&T - compatible Nexus Ones ( our fingers are crossed ) have had a chance to slam the airwaves for a bit , shall we ?
I smoke cotton balls !
HELP !!?
Ok .
My friends and I thought it would jus be easier to make or own fake cigarette .
So we cut out a square of paper , fold it over a pencil or pen , tape it close and then stuff it wit cotton balls .

When Jake Shields , the reigning EliteXC welterweight champion , moved up to 182 pounds to fight Robbie Lawler in Strikeforce last year , I thought he was too small to handle a middleweight striker with Lawler 's power .
It took Shields two minutes to prove me wrong and force Lawler to tap with a guillotine choke .
But even though I had Shields as the fourth - best middleweight in MMA the last time I did these rankings , I guess I still was n't completely sold on him as anything more than a beefed - up welterweight fighting above his natural weight class because middleweight is Strikeforce 's marquee division .
Now that he has dominated Dan Henderson , however , I 'm done underestimating Jake Shields , who takes a big step up the middleweight ladder .
My latest rankings are below .
( Editor 's note :
The individual fighter 's ranking the last time we did middleweights are in parentheses .
) 1. Anderson Silva ( 1 ) : I know Dana White and plenty of fans and members of the MMA media are angry at Silva over his performance at UFC 112 , but the reason I can't get too worked up about Silva is that his real problem is he 's just too good .
He 's so much better than the rest of the middleweight division that he 's bored fighting in it .
I personally believe it 's time for him to move up in weight class and give up his middleweight belt , but as long as he 's fighting at 185 , I 'll keep him at the top of these rankings .
2. Jake Shields ( 4 ) :
The thing I like best about Shields is that he moved up to 185 pounds the right way , taking his strength and conditioning very seriously and adding powerful , explosive muscle .
No , he would n't stand much of a chance against Silva , but I would absolutely pick him to beat either Chael Sonnen or Vitor Belfort , who are likely to be Silva 's next two middleweight opponents .
If Shields signs with the UFC , it will be interesting to see whetherhe moves back down to welterweight or stays at middleweight .
He 's an elite fighter in either class .
3. Vitor Belfort ( 4 ) : He 's still recuperating from an injury and it's not clear when we 'll see him again .
I think he'd be a more interesting opponent for Silva than Silva has had at middleweight for the last couple of years , and if Silva is going to stay at 185 pounds , I 'd like to see Belfort get his shot at the belt .
4. Chael Sonnen ( 5 ) : White says Sonnen is next for Silva , and he says Sonnen is the kind of opponent to take the fight to Silva .
I 'm not so sure I agree , although I do know Sonnen will engage in plenty of trash talk to hype the fight , and maybe get under Silva 's skin just enough to make Silva knock him out in the first round .
5 . Demian Maia ( 6 ) : He has a submission victory over Sonnen on his record and is still the best grappler in the division , but he 's never going to be able to hang with the best middleweight strikers .
6. Nate Marquardt ( 7 ) : I probably have Marquardt ranked a little too high , but he does have that first - round knockout of Maia on his record .
Maybe the two of them should have a rematch .
7 . Dan Henderson ( 2 ) : Strikeforce thought Hendo would be its big star , but after Shields manhandled him it's hard to see where he goes next .
Maybe a move up to light heavyweight and a fight with Gegard Mousasi would be in order .
Come to think of it , that 's the fight Strikeforce should have done all along .
8. Robbie Lawler ( 8 ) :
He 's supposed to fight Jason " Mayhem " Miller next , although Miller 's part in the ugly post - fight brawl at the end of the Strikeforce Nashville show calls that into question .
9 . Yushin Okami ( 9 ) : The UFC just keeps burying Okami , who beat Lucio Linares last month in a fight no one saw .
It 'd be nice to see this guy fight on TV some time .
10 .
Jorge Santiago ( NR ) : No word yet on when we 'll see the Sengoku champ again .
I 'd love to see him return to the UFC ; he 's a far better fighter now than he was in 2006 when the UFC cut him after back - to - back losses against Chris Leben and Alan Belcher .

Several weeks ago , I spoke of the threat of a volcanic eruption in Iceland .
Correct headline , correct country , wrong volcano .
I was speaking of news regarding Mt. Hekla and how some observations had been made that the summit was absent of snow and that there was speculation that may have indicated an impending eruption .
I wonder if there is a connection .
It ’s purely speculation on my part and I have a very limited background in geology and vulcanology , but I wonder if perhaps magma was coming to the surface at Mt. Hekla while at the same time was rising to the surface elsewhere and the pressure was instead released with the recent eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull ( AYA - feeyapla - yurkul ) volcano .
Eyjafjallajokull is apparently considered to be a relatively small volcano and there is some concern due to its close proximity to the glacier of the same name .
If you heat up a bunch of ice , it tends to melt and then there is a big flood .
But , there is a larger concern .
Now the last time that Eyjafjallajokull erupted was in 1821 and it was boring eruption which oozed lava in a rather slow , pedestrian manner for a couple of days .
Keep in mind that Iceland was settled by the Vikings in the 9th century and is known as the land of fire and ice because its covered in glaciers but is also an island of volcanoes .
Islands such as Iceland are created by thermal plumes in the earth ’s crust that create hot spots .
Iceland and island chains like Hawaii are formed by hot spots in which a volcano emerges from the depths and and island forms .
The earth ’s crust moves and so the next time a plume develops , a new island forms after the old one has moved on .
Unlike Hawaii which is in the tropical region , Iceland is pretty close to the Arctic Circle so its not the same kind of paradise as Hawaii .
Now , one of the more active volcanoes on Iceland is the previously mentioned Hekla volcano which gained the moniker of the “ Gateway to Hell ” during the Middle Ages because the locals believed that souls were dragged below .
The fear now is not the current eruption , but instead that it could create a larger fissure that would be the catalyst for an eruption of nearby Mount Katla .
Experts say that historical evidence suggests that when Eyjafjallajokull blows , Katla follows .
But , they do n’t know when .
So , it could be tomorrow or years from now .
But , leave it to the media to not miss the chance for a dramatic headline .
NBC goes so far as to say that the volcano that is only speculated to maybe erupt at some distant time could have “ world consequences . ”
That is because in1783 , the Laki volcano erupted , causing scores to die of famine when livestock and crops were destroyed and changing weather patterns across Europe .
Some historians link the climate disruption to the French Revolution and in 1784 , the US had one of its coldest winters on record with the Mississippi River supposedly freezing at New Orleans .
The Katla volcano , which lies under the thick Myrdalsjokull icecap , has not erupted since 1918 .
Since Eyjafjallajokull has n’t erupted since 1821 , that would suggest that Katla is not necessarily terminally linked to Eyjafjallajokull .
So , that would seem to me to allow for the possibility that an Eyjafjallajokull eruption does not necessarily mean a Katla eruption .
Now , the idea that these two volcanoes do have some sort of apparent historical link , it makes me wonder if it is so unreasonable for me to speculate whether the Mt. Hekla observations are somehow connected .
Who knows ?
And who knows if there would be gloom and doom for the world with a Mt. Katla eruption .
No doubt , it would cause a huge flooding problem with the melting of the adjacent glacier .
But , the doomsday scenario that is being trumpeted as a potential since it happened in the late 18th century is a bit misleading .
You ca n’t necessarily take one incident in history and then say that if that event happened again , the results would be the same 240 years later .
And in this case , they are n’t even talking about the same volcano .
So , here ’s the real lowdown : Eyjafjallajokull eruptions have been known to preceed a larger eruption of Katla but not all Katla eruptions are preceeded by a Eyjafjallajokull eruption and the Laki eruption in 1783 created global consequences and we ’re talking about Mt. Katla in 2010 , not 1783 .
Possible , not necessarily probable and certainly not worthy of scare tactic headlines .
Weather Bottom Line :
Told you we would n’t get out of the 40’s on Monday .
Official high was in low 50 ’s but that was just after midnight .
Does n’t count unless you are our adopted stray cat , Paintbrush .
But , Snow
White has a nice warm bed for him on our front porch so the falling temperatures were n’t a problem .
After a chilly night , Paintbrush and the rest of us will warm up nicely to the low 60’s on Tuesday and then mid 60’s on Wednesday with the sun doing its job .
Low to mid 60 ’s Thursday will help fuel rain and perhaps a few rumbles of thunder as another cold front swings through .
Jean Springer was only 20 years old when she started flying military open - cockpit planes across the country as a test pilot in the Women Airforce Service Pilots ( WASP ) group during World War II .
WASP FACTS WASP FACTS
First women to serve as pilots and fly military aircraft for the United States Army Air Force during World War II
Served in the Air Corps from September 1942 to December 1944
25,000 women applied for the Women 's Flying Training Detachment ; 1,830 women were accepted ; 1,074 graduated from the training program
Stationed at 120 Army Air Bases within the U.S .
The WASP flew 78 different types of aircraft , including the B - 29
38 died while flying for the Army Air Corps
In 1977 , President Carter signed a house bill giving WASP military recognition .
The WASP received veteran 's status in 1979 under Public Law 95 -202 .
On July 1 , 2009 , President Obama recognized all the Woman Airforce Service Pilots by awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal for their invaluable service to the nation .
Source : National Museum of the U.S. Air Force Enlarge By Thomas E. Smith , Cincinnati Enquirer Jean Springer sits with photographs of her as a WASP pilot from more than 60 years ago .
ABOUT THE MEDAL ABOUT THE MEDAL The Congressional Gold Medal is considered " the nation 's highest civilian award and the most distinguished award " given by Congress .
It may be given to recognize a lifetime contribution or a singular achievement .
Legislation authorizing each medal must be passed by Congress and signed by the president .
— Congressional Research Service , Library of Congress Female WWII pilots to receive medals Jean Springer was 22 when she joined a new corps of female pilots needed to help the country in World War II .
Now 89 , the Cincinnati woman is in Washington on Wednesday with about 180 other former fliers finally to receive the nation 's thanks .
Congress is awarding the Congressional Gold Medal , the highest civilian honor , to members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots , a civilian branch of the Army Air Force .
Fewer than 300 of the 1,100 survive .
Relatives of those who have died or could not attend will also get medals .
When Springer joined , " it was kind of a lark , " she says .
She had been taking flying lessons .
" It was patriotic .
And boring at home .
I loved flying . "
The WASP was created to allow more male pilots to go to the war front .
Prohibited from flying in combat , the female pilots transported military personnel , towed targets for gunnery practice and shuttled planes from factories to bases .
They flew every military plane model flown in the war .
" Sometimes the guys who gave us weather predictions in the morning when we left were n't particularly accurate , " Springer says .
" In snowstorms , it was scary . "
Yet no military honors were granted to the 38 women who were killed during service to the program .
In December 1944 , as the war was ending and male pilots were coming home , the program was disbanded .
" One day I came back from a flight , " says Doris Nathan , 93 , of Kalamazoo , Mich .
" And the commanding officer said , ' I just got orders to tell you to get off the base by tomorrow morning . ' "
Some of the women kept flying as instructors in Florida or bush pilots in Alaska , says Albert " Chig " Lewis , a Washington lawyer and founding member of Wingtip to Wingtip , an association that promotes the fliers ' legacy .
His mother was a WASP .
Others raised families and accepted that most of the nation did n't know what they 'd done .
The fliers were already trying to gain recognition as military veterans in 1976 when the Air Force announced that " for the first time ever " it would teach women to fly military airplanes , says Kate Landdeck , an associate professor of history at Texas Woman 's University who is writing a book about WASPs and their lives after the war .
" They realized their Air Force had forgotten about them , " Landdeck says .
In 1977 , after a " huge effort in Congress " and with the help of Sen. Barry Goldwater , who had flown with WASPs during the war , the women were recognized as military personnel and given partial veterans benefits .
" They get to go to VA hospitals , and they get that flag on the coffin , " she says .
" That 's the most important thing to them . "
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Texas Republican , co-sponsored the bill to honor the women with the medal .
" These women have yet to receive the recognition they deserve , " Hutchison says .

Two brothers have admitted involvement in a violent assault and kidnapping in the north - eastern suburbs of Adelaide on Christmas Day in 2007 .
Their identities are suppressed because one was a youth at the time .
The District Court was told the brothers from Syria used phone messages to lure their victim and his friend to netball courts at Golden Grove early on Christmas morning .
With at least two others , they savagely beat both men , tied them up and put one in the boot of their car .
He was later dumped near Gumeracha in the Adelaide Hills .
A lawyer for the elder brother said the attack was in response to racial vilification , including having the words ' Allah is dead ' sprayed on their car .
She said the accused feared for their family 's safety because the victim allegedly stole one of their cars and had keys to their house and businesses .
The court was told a third party recorded the bashing because someone involved accidentally made a telephone call during the fight .
There will be more submissions on penalty next week .
NASA Sees Re-Suspended
Ash from the Eyjafjallajökull Volcano
By May 26 , 2010 , when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite captured this photo - like image , Iceland ’s Eyjafjallajökull Volcano had slowed its eruption .
A tiny , white puff of steam rises from the volcano in this image .
Considerable steam had been coming from the crater , said the Icelandic Met Office , but monitoring the eruption became difficult because of windblown ash .
The problem is illustrated here .
Two broad swaths of tan ash , many kilometers across , obscure the Icelandic coastline and sweep over the Atlantic Ocean .
The ash resembles an eruption plume in color , but it is actually resuspended ash .
During Eyjafjallajökull ’s eruption , fine powdery ash fell around the volcano and on areas downwind .
The ash still rests lightly on the land ’s surface and is easily lifted in the wind .
On May 26 , winds blew toward the south , southeast , picking up a thick cloud of ash near the volcano .
The ash is blowing over the North Atlantic Ocean .
The ocean itself is colored with subtle swirls of blue and green , revealing the presence of a large phytoplankton bloom .
While volcanic ash can fertilize ocean waters in parts of the world where waters contain little iron , the North Atlantic already contains more than enough iron to sustain large phytoplankton blooms .
This bloom is part of the large phytoplankton bloom that covers much of the North Atlantic every spring and summer .
The large image is the highest - resolution version of the image .
The image is available in additional resolutions from the MODIS Rapid Response System .

Author ’s note : Below is the text of a talk delivered to the fifth Bilin international conference for Palestinian popular resistance , held in the West Bank village of Bilin on April 21 .
Israel ’s apologists are very exercised about the idea that Israel has been singled out for special scrutiny and criticism .
I wish to argue , however , that in most discussions of Israel it actually gets off extremely lightly : that many features of the Israeli polity would be considered exceptional or extraordinary in any other democratic state .
That is not surprising because , as I will argue , Israel is neither a liberal democracy nor even a " Jewish and democratic state , " as its supporters claim .
It is an apartheid state , not only in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza , but also inside Israel proper .
Today , in the occupied territories , the apartheid nature of Israeli rule is irrefutable – if little mentioned by Western politicians or the media .
But inside Israel itself , it is largely veiled and hidden .
My purpose today is to try to remove the veil a little .
I say " a little , " because I would need far more than the time allotted to me to do justice to this topic .
There are , for example , some 30 laws that explicitly discriminate between Jews and non-Jews – another way of referring to the fifth of the Israeli population who are Palestinian and supposedly enjoy full citizenship .
There are also many other Israeli laws and administrative practices that lead to an outcome of ethnic - based segregation even if they do not make such discrimination explicit .
So instead of trying to rush through all these aspects of Israeli apartheid , let me concentrate instead on a few revealing features , issues I have reported on recently .
First , let us examine the nature of Israeli citizenship .
A few weeks ago I met Uzi Ornan , an 86 - year - old professor from the Technion University in Haifa , who has one of the few ID cards in Israel stating a nationality of " Hebrew . "
For most other Israelis , their cards and personal records state their nationality as " Jewish " or " Arab . "
For immigrants whose Jewishness is accepted by the state but questioned by the rabbinical authorities , some 130 other classifications of nationality have been approved , mostly relating to a person ’s religion or country of origin .
The only nationality you will not find on the list is " Israeli . "
That is precisely why Professor Ornan and two dozen others are fighting through the courts : they want to be registered as " Israelis . "
It is a hugely important fight – and for that reason alone they are certain to lose .
Why ?
Far more is at stake than an ethnic or national label .
Israel excludes a nationality of " Israeli " to ensure that , in fulfillment of its self - definition as a " Jewish state , " it is able to assign superior rights of citizenship to the collective " nation " of Jews around the globe than to the body of actual citizens in its territory , which includes many Palestinians .
In practice it does this by creating two main classes of citizenship : a Jewish citizenship for " Jewish nationals " and an Arab citizenship for " Arab nationals . "
Both nationalities were effectively invented by Israel and have no meaning outside Israel .
This differentiation in citizenship is recognized in Israeli law : the Law of Return , for Jews , makes immigration all but automatic for any Jew around the world who wishes it ; and the Citizenship Law , for non-Jews , determines on any entirely separate basis the rights of the country ’s Palestinian minority to citizenship .
Even more importantly , the latter law abolishes the rights of the Palestinian citizens ’ relatives , who were expelled by force in 1948 , to return to their homes and land .
There are , in other words , two legal systems of citizenship in Israel , differentiating between the rights of citizens based on whether they are Jews or Palestinians .
That , in itself , meets the definition of apartheid , as set out by the United Nations in 1973 : " Any legislative measures or other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political , social , economic , and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups . "
The clause includes the following rights : " the right to leave and to return to their country , the right to a nationality , the right to freedom of movement and residence , the right to freedom of opinion and expression . "
Such separation of citizenship is absolutely essential to the maintenance of Israel as a Jewish state .
Were all citizens to be defined uniformly as Israelis , were there to be only one law regarding citizenship , then very dramatic consequences would follow .
The most significant would be that the Law of Return would either cease to apply to Jews or apply equally to Palestinian citizens , allowing them to bring their exiled relatives to Israel – the much - feared Right of Return .
In either a longer or shorter period , Israel ’s Jewish majority would be eroded and Israel would become a binational state , probably with a Palestinian majority .
There would be many other predictable consequences of equal citizenship .
Would the Jewish settlers , for example , be able to maintain their privileged status in the West Bank if Palestinians in Jenin or Hebron had relatives inside Israel with the same rights as Jews ?
Would the Israeli army continue to be able to function as an occupation army in a properly democratic state ?
And would the courts in a state of equal citizens be able to continue turning a blind eye to the brutalities of the occupation ?
In all these cases , it seems extremely unlikely that the status quo could be maintained .
In other words , the whole edifice of Israel ’s apartheid rule inside Israel supports and upholds its apartheid rule in the occupied territories .
They stand or fall together .
Next , let us look at the matter of controlling land .
Last month I met an exceptional Israeli Jewish couple , the Zakais .
They are exceptional chiefly because they have developed a deep friendship with a Palestinian couple inside Israel .
Although I have reported on Israel and Palestine for many years , I cannot recall ever before meeting an Israeli Jew who had a Palestinian friend in quite the way the Zakais do .
True , there are many Israeli Jews who claim an " Arab " or " Palestinian " friend in the sense that they joke with the guy whose hummus shop they frequent or who fixes their car .
There are also Israeli Jews – and they are an extremely important group – who stand with Palestinians in political battles such as those here in Bilin or in Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem .
At these places , Israelis and Palestinians have , against the odds , managed to forge genuine friendships that are vital if Israel ’s apartheid rule is to be defeated .
But the Zakais ’ relationship with their Bedouin friends , the Tarabins , is not that kind of friendship .
It is not based on , or shaped by , a political struggle , one that is itself framed by Israel ’s occupation ; it is not a self - conscious friendship ; and it has no larger goal than the relationship itself .
It is a friendship – or at least it appeared that way to me – of genuine equals .
A friendship of complete intimacy .
When I visited the Zakais , I realized what an incredibly unusual sight that is in Israel .
The reason for the very separate cultural and emotional worlds of Jewish and Palestinian citizens in Israel is not difficult to fathom : they live in entirely separate physical worlds .
They live apart in segregated communities , separated not through choice but by legally enforceable rules and procedures .
Even in the so - called handful of mixed cities , Jews and Palestinians usually live apart , in distinct and clearly defined neighborhoods .
And so it was not entirely surprising that the very issue that brought me to the Zakais was the question of whether a Palestinian citizen is entitled to live in a Jewish community .
The Zakais want to rent to their friends , the Tarabins , their home in the agricultural village of Nevatim in the Negev – currently an exclusively Jewish community .
The Tarabins face a serious housing problem in their own neighboring Bedouin community .
But what the Zakais have discovered is that there are overwhelming social and legal obstacles to Palestinians moving out the ghettoes in which they are supposed to live .
Not only is Nevatim ’s elected leadership deeply opposed to the Bedouin family entering their community , but so also are the Israeli courts .
Nevatim is not exceptional .
There are more than 700 similar rural communities – mostly kibbutzim and moshavim – that bar non-Jews from living there .
They control most of the inhabitable territory of Israel , land that once belonged to Palestinians : either refugees from the 1948 war ; or Palestinian citizens who have had their lands confiscated under special laws .
Today , after these confiscations , at least 93 percent of Israel is nationalized – that is , it is held in trust not for Israel ’s citizens but for world Jewry .
( Here , once again , we should note one of those important consequences of the differentiated citizenship we have just considered . )
Access to most of this nationalized land is controlled by vetting committees , overseen by quasi - governmental but entirely unaccountable Zionist organizations like the Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Fund .
Their role is to ensure that such communities remain off - limits to Palestinian citizens , precisely as the Zakais and Tarabins have discovered in the case of Nevatim .
The officials there have insisted that the Palestinian family has no right even to rent , let alone buy , property in a " Jewish community . "
That position has been effectively upheld by Israel ’s highest court , which has agreed that the family must submit to a vetting committee whose very purpose is to exclude them .
Again , the 1973 UN Convention on the " crime of apartheid " is instructive : it includes measures " designed to divide the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group or groups … [ and ] the expropriation of landed property belonging to a racial group or groups or to members thereof . "
If Jewish and Palestinian citizens have been kept apart so effectively – and a separate education system and severe limits on interconfessional marriage reinforce this emotional and physical segregation – how did the Zakais and Tarabins become such close friends ?
Their case is an interesting example of serendipity , as I discovered when I met them .
Weisman Zakai is the child of Iraqi Jewish parents who immigrated to the Jewish state in its early years .
When he and Ahmed Tarabin met as boys in the 1960s , hanging out in the markets of the poor neighboring city of Beersheva , far from the center of the country , they found that what they had in common trumped the formal divisions that were supposed to keep them apart and fearful .
Both speak fluent Arabic , both were raised in an Arab culture , both are excluded from Jewish Ashkenazi society , and both share a passion for cars .
In their case , Israel ’s apartheid system failed in its job of keeping them physically and emotionally apart .
It failed to make them afraid of , and hostile to , each other .
But as the Zakais have learned to their cost , in refusing to live according to the rules of Israel ’s apartheid system , the system has rejected them .
The Zakais are denied the chance to rent to their friends and now live as pariahs in the community of Nevatim .
Finally , let us consider the concept of " security " inside Israel .
As I have said , the apartheid nature of relations between Jewish and Palestinian citizens is veiled in the legal , social , and political spheres .
It does not mirror the " petty apartheid " that was a feature of the South African brand : the separate toilets , park benches , and buses .
But in one instance it is explicit in this petty way – and this is when Jews and Palestinians enter and leave the country through the border crossings and through Ben Gurion international airport .
Here the façade is removed and the different status of citizenship enjoyed by Jews and Palestinians is fully on show .
That lesson was learned by two middle - aged Palestinian brothers I interviewed this month .
Residents of a village near Nazareth , they had been lifelong supporters of the Labor Party and proudly showed me a fading picture of them hosting a lunch for Yitzhak Rabin in the early 1990s .
But at our meeting they were angry and bitter , vowing they would never vote for a Zionist party again .
Their rude awakening had come three years ago when they traveled to the U.S. on a business trip with a group of Jewish insurance agents .
On the flight back , they arrived at New York ’s JFK airport to see their Jewish colleagues pass through El Al ’s security checks in minutes .
They , meanwhile , spent two hours being interrogated and having their bags minutely inspected .
When they were finally let through , they were assigned a female guard whose job was to keep them under constant surveillance – in front of hundreds of fellow passengers – till they boarded the plane .
When one brother went to the bathroom without first seeking permission , the guard berated him in public and her boss threatened to prevent him from boarding the plane unless he apologized .
This month the court finally awarded the brothers $ 8,000 compensation for what it called their " abusive and unnecessary " treatment .
Two things about this case should be noted .
The first is that the El Al security team admitted in court that neither brother was deemed a security risk of any sort .
The only grounds for the special treatment they received was their national and ethnic belonging .
It was transparently a case of racial profiling .
The second thing to note is that their experience is nothing out of the ordinary for Palestinian citizens traveling to and from Israel .
Similar , and far worse , incidents occur every day during such security procedures .
What was exceptional in this case was that the brothers pursued a time - consuming and costly legal action against El Al .
They did so , I suspect , because they felt so badly betrayed .
They had made the mistake of believing the hasbara ( propaganda ) from Israeli politicians of all stripes who declare that Palestinian citizens can enjoy equal status with Jewish citizens if they are loyal to the state .
They assumed that by being Zionists they could become first - class citizens .
In accepting this conclusion , they had misunderstood the apartheid reality inherent in a Jewish state .
The most educated , respectable , and wealthy Palestinian citizen will always fare worse at the airport security check than the most disreputable Jewish citizen , or the one who espouses extremist opinions , or even the Jewish citizen with a criminal record .
Israel ’s apartheid system is there to maintain Jewish privilege in a Jewish state .
And at the point where that privilege is felt most viscerally by ordinary Jews to be vulnerable , in the life and death experience of flying thousands of feet above the ground , Palestinian citizens must be shown their status as outsider , as the enemy , whoever they are and whatever they have , or have not , done .
Apartheid rule , as I have argued , applies to Palestinians in both Israel and the occupied territories .
But is not apartheid in the territories much worse than it is inside Israel ?
Should we not concern ourselves more with the big apartheid in the West Bank and Gaza than this weaker apartheid ?
Such an argument demonstrates a dangerous misconception about the indivisible nature of Israel ’s apartheid toward Palestinians and about its goals .
Certainly , it is true that apartheid in the territories is much more aggressive than it is inside Israel .
There are two reasons for this .
The first is that the apartheid under occupation is much less closely supervised by the Israeli civilian courts than it is in Israel .
You can , to put it bluntly , get away with much more here .
The second , and more significant , reason , however , is that the Israeli system of apartheid in the occupied territories is forced to be more aggressive and cruel – and that is because the battle is not yet won here .
The fight of the occupying power to steal your resources – your land , water , and labor – is in progress , but the outcome is still to be decided .
Israel is facing the considerable pressures of time and a fading international legitimacy as it works to take your possessions from you .
Every day you resist makes that task a little harder .
In Israel , by contrast , apartheid rule is entrenched – it achieved its victory decades ago .
Palestinian citizens have third - or fourth - class citizenship ; they have had almost all of their land taken from them ; they are allowed to live only in their ghettoes ; their education system is controlled by the security services ; they can work in few jobs other than those Jews do not want ; they have the vote but cannot participate in government or effect any political change ; and so on .
Doubtless , a related fate is envisioned for you too .
The veiled apartheid facing Palestinians inside Israel is the blueprint for a veiled – and more legitimate – kind of apartheid being planned for Palestinians in the occupied territories , at least those who are allowed to remain in their Bantustans .
And for this very reason , exposing and defeating the apartheid inside Israel is vital to the success of resisting the apartheid that has taken root here .
That is why we must fight Israeli apartheid wherever it is found – in Jaffa or Jerusalem , in Nazareth or Nablus , in Beersheva or Bilin .
It is the only struggle that can bring justice to the Palestinians .
When economic growth finally levels off , what kind of world comes after ?
Shall we be unchained from the mad rush for money of the last century ?
Or will other but equally chafing chains weigh us down instead ?
In 1930 , Keynes wrote that “ For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair ; for foul is useful and fair is not .
Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still .
For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight . ”
Keynes has not been the only person to predict that the modern rise in living standards will come to an end , and that a better kind of society will follow .
Marx thought universal abundance would usher in socialism .
And those who predict a running out of resources like oil are predicting a move to more sustainable , and thus more humane , ways of living .
It is these cultural and political aspects of an end to growth that I find most interesting .
For the merely material side of our industrial takeoff has got most of the attention so far .
Even the poorer people in rich countries now have food - filled fridges and gadgets that their great grandparents could hardly have imagined .
And folk elsewhere are catching up .
The modern world has surely inflicted a kind of rat race on us .
But even though the rat is running on a wheel , he is plumper than before .
And free - market types tend to like looking at plump rats .
For both the plump rat who has long been on the wheel , and the gaunt rat just climbing on to it , they dangle in front of him the same lump of enticing cheese : given time , growth will bring him closer to paradise .
Such optimism conveniently distracts from the fact that some rats are fatter than others , of course .
The rise in living standards has been real .
But having more plump rats does not change the fact that modern capitalism has tended to cultivate rat -hood .
This was just Keynes ’s point about “ avarice and usury ” going together with growth , at least until growth has served its purpose after a few generations .
So does an end to growth get the rat off the wheel and lead to less rat - hood ?
This depends , first , on what we expect an end to growth to look like .
Classical economists of the early nineteenth century , including David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill , predicted that growth would taper off eventually .
Saturation of capital and technical innovation would bring us to what they called a “ stationary state . ”
It would be a society at a higher living standard than before the industrial revolution , but done with its upward trajectory .
Take one scenario .
Suppose , as many predict , that oil gradually runs out over the next two generations , and we are forced into sustainable but expensive ways of generating energy .
If we can no longer “ scale up ” the world economy , we are stuck with something like a fixed capacity .
The world population is also ageing such that , when it looks more like Japan than like India , the demographic burden will weigh down growth too .
And while there are still many more technological innovations to be wrung out — in energy , medicine , transportation , and the like — there comes a point when they , too , will become less and less frequent .
We are not going to get to a stationary state in the strict sense within our lifetimes .
But I can well imagine the younger end of the FPR audience looking out , in our old age , on a world in which profit rates are low and long term income growth has fallen to a quarter of a percent or so .
Brought down to lived experience , that rate means real incomes from one generation to the next rise by less than 8 % .
It is slow enough to feel static from parent to child , more or less .
And the more a society feels like the stationary state , in more facets , then the more the psychological and cultural landscape will look very different from the last two centuries .
Many observers think this could only be a healthy thing .
People who want a fairer sharing out of society ’s wealth might expect that zero growth means an end to political distraction .
The free - market right has told us for a long time that if another , bigger pie is about to come out of the oven , we need not quibble much over how to cut up the one on the table .
We might have to open up a hard but honest political conversation about fairness .
Deeper critics of the modern world — including many on FPR — take satisfaction from the idea that an end to growth would force people to reassess their priorities in general .
Even something as simple as rising fuel costs would urge us to live and buy more locally .
Communities would get stronger as the rush for money and the excesses of the global market are reined in .
If wealth is more static , maybe we should all be more content with what we have and focus on more human satisfactions .
This vision of an end to growth is appealing in many ways .
And it could indeed happen , if the political commitment to steer events in that direction is solid enough .
But we should not blithely assume that the stationary state will mean such a humane outcome .
Bringing back more independence and dignity for ordinary people is possible only if zero growth disperses power .
But there is a much darker alternative .
What if zero growth just tightens up present concentrations of power ?
There have been many societies in history that look like stationary states , and some of them have been quite vast and hierarchical .
China through much of its history was one of them .
And what do we get in a stationary state on a large scale , with institutions that endure generation after generation ?
We get the inertia and soft despotism that Tocqueville saw in China and feared would come to the West .
He wrote of “ a Chinese novel in which the hero , after many ups and downs , succeeds at last in touching his mistress ’s heart by passing an examination well . ”
This might not be the rat race to get ever more baubles from consumer culture .
But it is a rat race of petty hierarchies , status - consciousness , credential - seeking , and obedience to authority .
It is the stuff of stable and complacent élites .
It is the kind of order that one historian of civilisations said the whole world is likely to end up with , based on past experience : “ a unitary , authoritarian , bureaucratic , peaceable , élitist , and sterile world state . ”
Hardly the stuff of FPR dreams .
Part of the reason for this dismal prospect is that a zero - growth society selects for different talents than does one in a heady phase of economic takeoff .
The kind of entrepreneurial spirit that many celebrate in America serves its purpose when an economy is dynamic .
But if you live in a world of bureaucracy and stable expectations , then a very different kind of personality thrives .
I see this in the Chinese education system every day .
China as a whole is not economically stagnant nowadays .
But the norm of how one rises in the world here is not as a self - made free agent .
It is through rote replication of what authority wants , from the university entrance examination to getting a job in the civil service or a state - owned company .
“ That is what we were taught ” is a frequent refrain among my students , on all kinds of topics .
This is probably a drag now on keeping up with more innovative societies .
But if innovation runs its course , such a more passive temperament might be rewarded all over the world .
It serves self - interest , and those in power love it .
And sure enough , we see it happening already even in the most unexpected places .
There are more and more pre-professional “ organisation kids ” at élite universities in the West .
I remember a dinner a couple of years ago with some of my Harvard freshmen .
After these generally likable and intelligent youngsters went off for rather too long about investment - banking , I asked them what they would do if they were given a year off and complete freedom .
I was hoping for a chink that might let something break out of the careerist mould .
But the most common answer was about getting one or another credential to advance them in the rat race .
One has to keep up , or get ahead , after all .
To see a harsher version of what this future might look like , take a country that I think foreshadows it today : Singapore .
This city - state has been stuck for two generations in a moneyed soft authoritarianism , with politically infantile consumer - subjects .
Those in power there pride themselves on being a perfect meritocracy , a blend of the modern and the Confucian .
Top scorers on the university entrance exam get lifetime perks , in a way that would make Tocqueville cringe .
And there is a hard edge to it , too .
A few years ago , the teenage daughter of a Singaporean cabinet minister sparked a scandal with a blog posting that told “ the sadder class ” — those not elevated into the social stratosphere in their youth — to “ get out of my élite uncaring face . ”
Her father ’s apology hardly went beyond saying that she had to learn more tact .
This kind of future may well come to afflict us , even in parts of the world where it does not now .
Perhaps zero growth will just tighten the screws around ambitions different from the fevered accumulation of wealth , but no less petty or inhumane .
Perhaps ordinary people , rather than regaining a sturdy independence and community life , will lose even the leeway that a society in flux now gives them at the margins .
Or perhaps we can turn things in the more hopeful direction that many on FPR now expect a slowdown of growth to allow .
But doing so will mean taking nothing for granted .
Rather than assuming a more humane world will come of its own accord , we must build the political will to fight for it .
We should also be painfully aware that things are likely to get locked in for quite a long time , one way or the other , once we get there .
Recently by Gary North : David Frum : Hatchet Man for Ben Bernanke
Before I explain the title of this report , I want to prove to you that Americans are losing their liberties , day by relentless day .
I also want to prove to you why it is that , unless there is an economic breakdown so severe that Washington D.C. goes broke , we will not get back these surrendered liberties .
My demonstration will take approximately three minutes .
For skeptics , it may take five minutes .
The United States Government Printing Office publishes the Federal Register .
Each issue is a 275 - page book , three columns per page .
There are about 250 issues published each year , totaling approximately 69,000 pages .
These are pages of incoherent rules that apply to every area of our lives .
They are written by government lawyers to be interpreted by lawyers and debated by lawyers .
Unless the public , including Congress , demands a hearing on a rule within 15 days of publication , the rule becomes the law of the land .
Congress rarely protests .
It is too busy with its infighting to pay attention to the Federal Register .
The public rarely protests .
It takes a team of lawyers to gain a hearing .
Only if the rule generates a huge outcry from the media or the public is a rule repealed .
I have been involved in only one such protest , which was successful : the IRS ’s 1979 rule to withdraw tax exemption from any private school founded after 1960 that did not have the same racial percentages of students and faculty as prevailed in the community in which it operated .
It took 125,000 letters of protest in 30 days , plus Congressional hearings , to get that rule reversed .
The public buried the IRS in written protests — the most it had ever received on a ruling .
I generated this protest by pulling copyright on my Remnant Review report on that ruling .
This led to the letters of protest generated by the second newsletter after mine went out .
The snowballing effect took over .
To head off such protests by the public , the limit was cut to 15 days .
We would have failed in 1979 under this limit .
Almost no voter has ever heard of the Federal Register .
Of those who have , only a tiny percentage have ever read a single page .
I am asking you to spend three minutes reading one column of one page .
Read it carefully .
See if you understand it .
Pick your page here .
After you read that column , ask yourself this question : “ At 69,000 pages per year , meaning 207,000 columns just like this one , what is happening to Americans ’ freedom of choice ? ”
To ask this question is to answer it .
“ POWER TO THE PEOPLE ! ”
Back in the late 1960 ’s , “ Power to the people ! ” was a well - known phrase of Black power activists .
I remember it as being up there with “ never trust anyone over 30 ” and “ make love , not war . ”
The people have gained no increase in power .
The under - 30 crowd is now over 60 .
Viagra is selling well , but America is still at war .
We have come a long way , baby : in the Federal Register — maybe two million pages ( it used to be shorter ) , or six million columns .
We think of the Presidency as the culmination of American political power .
Yet the Presidency is a shell of what it was under Franklin Roosevelt .
Apart from some perceived national emergency , either terrorist or financial , nothing gets done in Washington .
In the financial crisis of 2008 , Bush was invisible .
Paulson ran the whole media show : nationalizing the mortgage market on his own authority , bailing out the financial sector along with silent Ben Bernanke .
This is not new .
Richard Nixon became the symbol of authority after Lyndon Johnson left the scene .
He succeeded Johnson , who refused to stand for re-election .
I cannot think of any two Presidents in American history who possessed greater knowledge of the details of the political process .
I also cannot think of any two Presidents who were more chewed up and spit out by this process .
Both men achieved enormous electoral victories : 1964 and 1972 .
Both left the office as beaten men , consumed by the system they had overseen .
Johnson was heralded by the Left in 1964 , as well he should have been .
The Left drove him out of office in 1968 .
Nixon was seen by the Left as a bastion of the Right in 1968 .
The Right did not lament his departure in 1974 .
Meanwhile , gridlock in Congress now prevails .
What ’s going on here ?
If the people have lost power , and the Presidency has become a shell , and Congress is in gridlock , who grabbed all that power ?
The bureaucrats .
In every nation , it is the same story .
The politicians centralize power .
The bureaucrats exercise this power .
Politicians come and go .
Political parties exchange the trappings of authority .
The bureaucrats keep their jobs , extend their reach , and consolidate power .
In the 1980 ’s , the British sitcom Yes , Minister showed us how the system really works .
It is on Netflix , and we can watch it on our computers .
It is just as funny today and just as true as it was then .
In 1983 , Harvard University ’s legal historian Harold Berman summarized the story in a 45 - page introduction to his book , Law and Revolution .
We are losing our liberties in the West , he said , because of a quiet but relentless legal revolution that has been underway for a century : the transition to administrative law .
The executive bureaucracies are writing the regulations and enforcing them through administrative law courts .
You can read 90 % of his introduction here .
Nothing reverses this process .
Only one thing can : budget cuts .
No other force can reverse the relentless extension of administrative law over the lives of citizens .
No other reform ever takes hold , for the system is self - enforced .
It takes a bureaucrat to hedge in a bureaucrat .
The best we can hope for , apart from budget cuts , is bureaucratic gridlock .
But bureaucratic gridlock restricts progress , economic growth , and the recovery of lost liberties .
The status quo prevails until such time as one or the other bureaucracy prevails .
Then the process resumes .
Liberty expands these days by being able to stay two jumps ahead of the bureaucracies .
Digital technology surely helps .
The bureaucrats are slow learners and slower movers .
By the time they write new regulations , the technology has moved on .
But , when the grasping hand of bureaucracy slows economic growth , the capital available to entrepreneurs gets more scarce .
Innovations cannot get as much funding as before .
It becomes more expensive to stay ahead of the regulators .
Ludwig von Mises wrote in 1922 that the goal of every bureaucrat is to structure that sector of the economy which he oversees in terms of a working model : the Post Office .
No one has described it any better than this .
VETOING THE VETO POWER
The crucial power to restrict the growth of bureaucracy is the power of the veto .
This power used to be imposed by juries .
This became the great threat to the power of bureaucracies .
This is why they began to substitute administrative law courts for civil courts .
There are no juries in administrative law courts .
There are only judges on the payroll of the bureaucracies .
These administrative law judges interpret the law of their employers .
They are funded by their bureaucracies .
The defendants must hire their own lawyers to play the legal game of “ look it up . ”
Then the administrative law judge decides which lawyer is correct .
This system is what Berman has described as the greatest single threat to freedom .
He was correct .
Best of all from the point of the bureaucracy is the principle of the Napoleonic Code : the accused is guilty until proven innocent . . . at his expense .
This is contrary to the common law tradition .
Common law is being reversed today .
The Internal Revenue Service operates in terms of the Napoleonic Code .
Then where is the veto power ?
Congress has 15 days to veto a rule in the Federal Register .
That is not enough time .
The rule can be vetoed by an Executive Order signed by the President .
Presidents rarely issue vetoes of executive enforcement procedures ; they sign extensions of executive powers .
The agency with the greatest immunity to a veto is the Federal Reserve System .
The Board of Governors is appointed by the President .
Legally , it is under Congress .
But until Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the FED got the support of 317 House members , no previous attempt to veto any aspect of the FED had come out of Congress since the FED began operating in 1914 .
Paul ’s bill sits in the House .
The Senate has ignored it .
Obama will surely veto it if it ever gets to him , which is unlikely .
The FED almost always goes along with the President in order to get along .
The only major exceptions were these .
First , the FED ’s refusal in 1951 to keep buying Treasury debt at a below - market rate .
That decision had taken ten years .
Second , the decision by Volcker ’s FED in late 1979 to let the Federal Funds rate shoot upward in 1980 .
The resulting recession cost Carter his re-election .
The FED must henceforth supply the fiat money to keep the economy going .
It must either inflate directly or impose a charge on the commercial banks ’ excess reserves in order to get banks lending again .
The push is inflationary .
It has been ever since 1914 .
This will not change .
For as long as the FED controls the money supply , it can keep the Federal government going .
This was stated clearly by the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank ( and the inventor of income tax withholding in 1943 ) , Beardsley Ruml , in 1945 .
To read his speech , click here .
The end of the FED ’s power could come in one of two ways :
It inflates continually until hyperinflation destroys the dollar .
It inflates but then draws back , allowing another Great Depression .
It will do its best to steer through these rapids , but the size of the Federal deficit will make this middle path difficult to navigate .
Ultimately , Congress can nationalize the FED to force it to inflate .
The Board of Governors knows this .
That would mean the end of the FED ’s semi-autonomy and the end of the dollar .
ESCAPING THE PUBLIC’S VETO
The international trade system , 1815 to 1914 , rested on an agreed - upon gold standard by major nations .
They agreed to redeem their nations ’ currencies in gold coins .
This kept power in the hands of the people .
The person holding a receipt from a bank or a bank note could demand gold coins for these paper receipts .
The veto power was in the hands of citizens .
After World War I began and the central banks stole the depositors ’ gold in the commercial banks , this veto power was renewed only briefly in Europe : England , 1925 to 1931 .
It ended in the United States in 1933 , by Roosevelt ’s Executive Order .
He confiscated the people ’s gold at $ 20 an ounce .
Then , in 1934 , he hiked gold ’s price to $ 35 .
That act of national theft unshackled the bureaucrats .
Before this , the bureaucracies had to be funded by governments .
There were limits on this funding : tax revenues and the interest rates on borrowed funds .
With the end of the various government - enforced gold standards , nation by nation , the governments reduced these restraints .
Their central banks could always buy the governments ’ debt by creating fiat money .
The great winners have been the bureaucrats .
They have escaped vetoes by governments , because governments have escaped the public ’s vetoes that were created by gold - redeemable currencies .
This is why all big - government politicians and their obedient , salaried intellectuals hate anything even remotely resembling the nineteenth - century gold standard .
They resent the veto power of gold over the expansion of credit by the banking cartel .
This is why they never challenge the central banks .
They know who butters their bread : the central banks .
They know what the butter is : borrowed fiat money used by governments to expand power .
The politicians and their many hired spokesmen — economics professors , newspaper columnists , think - tank intellectuals — dismiss the gold standard because they understand that this system placed a veto power in the hands of individual holders of IOU ’s from banks .
This restrained the banks .
This also limited the ability of governments to borrow money in order to defer tax increases .
The IOU - holding citizen had the power to say : “ You ’re lying .
I ’m calling your bluff . ”
He could walk into a bank and demand gold coins .
That legal authority was the greatest single tool of decentralized power in the world — yes , even greater than the right to keep and bear arms .
People rarely take up arms against their governments .
They could impose a veto on their governments by walking into a bank and demanding their gold .
A gold - redeemable currency was to the economy what the jury system is to courts : a way to veto the lawmakers and law - enforcers .
The lawmakers and law - enforcers deeply resent such decentralized authority .
THE ULTIMATE BUREAUCRACY
When you read the sneering comments of the gold - hating , central bank - defending hired intellectuals , know what motivates them most of all : to eliminate the ultimate veto power in the hands of the common man and woman .
This is the power to say : “ I am cutting off your access to additional fiat money .
I am therefore cutting your budget . ”
The average person does not think in these terms .
He thinks only : “ I want gold , not an IOU to gold . ”
That is all it takes to cut the budgets of the bureaucrats .
When you hear an intellectual attack gold , think to yourself : “ A well - paid performer . ”
Think : “ The bureaucrats ’ best friend . ”
We are losing our liberties to the bureaucrats .
There is only one sure defense : cut their budgets .
Until central banks are eliminated , simply by revoking their charters and thereby eliminating all of their governmental authority , there is no way to veto the expansion of bureaucracy .
So , if we ever want to recover our lost liberties , we must get the Federal government to take three steps .
Revoke the Federal Reserve ’s charter .
Repeal all legal tender laws .
Enforce contracts , including gold contracts .
Simple !
Also nearly impossible . . . until the Federal Reserve visibly ruins the economy .
I trust the Federal Reserve to achieve this in full public view .
Why ?
Because it is the ultimate bureaucracy , for it prints its own money .
It sets its own budget .
It has almost unchallenged power , yet its employees are not its owners .
There are no owners — not owners who can pocket the profits .
This is a universal recipe for disaster .
CONCLUSION
The case for gold as money is the case for cutting the bureaucrats ’ budgets .
It is therefore the case for the restoration of our liberties .

Since its release in 2008 , Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition has come under a lot of fire from seasoned D&D players who dislike many of the changes the new edition has made to the three - decades - old rules set .
Yet others have defended D&D 4e as a necessary re-invention to keep an old game up to pace with current times , and one of the designers has claimed D&D 4e is better for classic gaming than its immediate predecessor , D&D 3.5 .
The Escapist was excited to sit down with Andy Collins and Liz Schuh from Wizards of the Coast to talk about the real strategy behind Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition .
Andy Collins manages the design and development of 4th edition and was also on the team for 3.5 , while Liz Schuh is WoTC 's brand director and oversees all D&D products from novels to games and miniatures .
On The Escapist side of the table is Publisher and old - school D&D aficionado Alexander Macris , along with Games Editor Greg Tito .
Read on for Part
One of our two - part exclusive interview and find out why 4th Edition came out when it did , as well as the real reason tieflings are a core race .
Part Two can be found here .
***
Alexander Macris :
Why did 4th Edition come out when it did ?
Liz Schuh :
As you know , there were eight years between 3rd and 4th Edition launches and , you know , the world is speeding up , I think , in every aspect of it , so if anything I think we 're not keeping pace with the speeding up of the world but we just felt that it was time for a new edition , so we went forward .
Andy Collins : Frankly , I think the intervals between editions is more coincidence than anything ; it 's not like there 's been one unified body behind the timing of Dungeons and Dragons since 1974 .
It 's gone through a lot of different hands , a lot of different people managing that , so there seems to be a pattern there , but I think that 's more perception than reality .
And as far as the transition from 3rd to 4th , the thing I like to say is it took the company going out of business for going from 2nd to 3rd , and we were n't really eager to replicate that business model .
So rather than wait until it was too late , we decided to be a little more proactive there .
AM : What is the audience for today 's Dungeons and Dragons , and how is that different from the audience for my Dungeons and Dragons , growing up in the ' 80s and early '90s ?
AC : One thing we certainly saw over the course of 2nd edition was the audience did tend to age along with the game .
The game was a very playable , a very entertaining system , but it did n't necessarily speak to the people who were coming up into the optimal RPG age category through new ways .
When we were all playing 1st and 2nd Edition , we did n't cut our teeth on MMOs or console gaming or Facebook or any of those things .
At best , maybe we had experience playing Monopoly or games like that , Risk , so that D&D was a totally foreign thing .
That 's just not true anymore .
People today , the young kids today , are coming into exposure from D&D after having playing games that have very similar themes , often have very similar mechanics ... they understand the concepts of the game .
So in some ways they are much more advanced as potential game players .
But in other ways , they are also coming from a background that is short attention span , perhaps , less likely interested in reading the rules of the game before playing .
And I 'm not just talking about younger players now , but anybody .
I know when I jump into a new console game , for instance , the last thing I want to do is read the book .
I want to start playing .
And that 's a relatively new development in game playing and game learning .
And we 've been working to adapt to that , the changing expectations of the new gamer .

I had a go at implementing a simple force directed graph layout algorithm in JavaScript .
Try it out .
So what does this force directed stuff mean anyway ?
Basically , it uses a physics simulation to figure out how to show the graph / network decently .
In particular , it simulates a bunch of springs connected to each other .
It also simulates magnetic repulsion in the sense that nodes are repelled by other nearby nodes .
It works surprisingly well for not very much code .

Rumours of a second anime adaptation of epic slashing things manga Berserk have been swirling for some time , and now some supposed images of the anime have surfaced , said to be a Studio Studio 4 °C project .
They are visible below :
The images clearly show Casca , Gattsu , Puck and Zod in what look to be some artistically accomplished scenes .
The images were apparently leaked by a Studio 4 °C employee , and generally have a rather poor provenance .
The source warns to exercise one ’s own judgment in deciding whether these are genuine signs of a new series .
Fortunately , the indications are that Dream C Club is not very good , so it is just possible Berserk mangaka Kentaro Miura may escape further entrapment …
When you hear the words , ‘ foreclosure crisis , ’ most people probably think of homeowners who are in trouble , unable to pay their mortgages , and with “ For Sale ” signs on their lawns .
Here in the New York City there ’s another face to this crisis : that of tenants living in buildings that were sold during the property boom of a few years ago , but whose new owners have declared bankruptcy and are now being foreclosed upon .
In between the filing for bankruptcy and court decisions on ownership , these buildings are often grossly neglected .
500 families in the Bronx have been stuck in this situation for more than a year , after Wells Fargo bank foreclosed on ten properties owned by Milbank Real Estate .
With more than 4,400 violations in just 548 apartments , the living conditions are “ deplorable , ” according to NYC City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , at a press conference called in support of the tenants .
“ No family should have to live like this because of unstable investments someone else made , ” Quinn said .
There have been no repairs made to the building since March 2009 , when the loans went into default .
The press conference announced a lawsuit , filed by Bronx Legal Services – NYC , which argues that once a foreclosure action is initiated , and a court - appointed receiver is in place , the mortgage holder , aka Wells Fargo Bank in this case , can be held liable for maintaining building conditions .
The tenants are demanding that those parties connected with their landlord ’s failed mortgage take responsibility for repairing their apartments .
“ The disastrous situation confronting Milbank ’s tenants could not have occurred without the irresponsible behavior of the financial entities involved , ” including Wells Fargo and the commercial mortgage - backed security trust , the court filing says .
This week Bronx Congressman Jose Serrano weighed in on the case , saying , “ We cannot have buildings falling apart as legal wrangling takes place over ownership or foreclosure .
Tenants are entitled to housing that is safe and decently maintained . ”
Serrano pointed to a recent decision in New York State Court that ruled that tenants could seek financial compensation from lenders when buildings go into foreclosure .
A hearing on the motion is scheduled for May 10th in Bronx Supreme Court .
Meanwhile Wells Fargo is taking heat on the other side of the country .
A demonstration at its annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday called for a halt to predatory lending , jobs creation and keeping families in their homes .
The action was one of many aimed at the financial industry and Wall Street that are taking place around the country this week and next .

Key difference between reprogrammed adult mouse cells and embryonic stem cells discovered .
Mouse stem cells can be used to create neurons ( above ) for the screening of drugs .
Y.SUN , UCSF / CIRM
Stem - cell researchers have puzzled over why reprogrammed cells taken from adult tissues are often slower to divide and much less robust than their embryo - derived counterparts .
Now , a team has discovered the key genetic difference between embryonic and adult - derived stem cells in mice .
If confirmed in humans , the finding could help clinicians to select only the heartiest stem cells for therapeutic applications and disease modelling .
Induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells are created by reprogramming adult cells , and outwardly seem indistinguishable from embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
Both cell types are pluripotent — they can form any tissue in the body .
Yet subtle distinctions abound .
Last month , for example , Su - Chun Zhang and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison compared the ability of both types of pluripotent cell to form human neurons in a laboratory setting , and found that iPS cells did so with markedly lower efficiency than ES cells ( B.-Y .

Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 107 , 4335 –4340 ; 2010 ) .
Last year , researchers also reported consistent differences in gene expression between the two cell types ( M. H. Chin et al. Cell Stem Cell 5 , 111 –123 ; 2009 ) .
However , because scientists have always obtained iPS and ES cells from different sources — in general , iPS cells are derived from skin samples taken during biopsies and ES cells from excess embryos from fertility clinics — it was impossible to tell whether the discrepancies could be chalked up to the unique biology of the cells or the genetics of the underlying tissue .
Silence please
A team led by Konrad Hochedlinger at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston has now derived iPS and ES cells with identical DNA .
The iPS cells were less efficient than the ES cells at incorporating into chimeric mice — a standard test of pluripotency , or ' stemness ' .
The team added the stem cells into embryos from mice of a different colour ; once each mouse matures , the colouring of its coat reveals how much the stem cells contributed to forming its tissue .
“ This is an important step towards identifying the differences that may exist in imperfectly reprogrammed cells . ”
When the scientists compared genome - wide expression patterns between the two cell types , they discovered that a small stretch of DNA on the long arm of chromosome 12 displayed significantly different gene activity .
In this region , two genes and a slew of tiny regulatory sequences called microRNAs were consistently activated in the ES cells and silenced in the iPS cells , regardless of whether the reprogrammed cells came originally from skin , brain , blood or other tissue .
Although the function of the key genes is unknown , this region is usually silenced in mouse sperm cells and activated in other types of cell , so reprogramming might somehow mimic the silencing process , the authors speculate .
" This is an important step towards identifying the differences that may exist in those imperfectly reprogrammed cells , " says Sheng Ding , a stem - cell researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California .
The discovery raises the possibility that human iPS cells carry similar silenced sequences that make them less effective than ES cells , according to team member Matthias Stadtfeld , also from the Massachusetts General Hospital , who presented the work at a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences on 23 March .
" It points towards the possibility that hot spots for epigenetic abnormalities exist also in human iPS cells , " he says .
" A profound abnormality like that could confound results obtained with patient - specific iPS cells . "

John Hambor , director of stem - cell - based drug discovery at Cell Therapy Group , a consultancy based in Madison , Connecticut , cautions that although the iPS cells in the experiment did not meet the strictest criteria of stemness — they did not introduce significant colouring into chimeric mice — they may still have been able to form many types of tissue , something the researchers did not explicitly test .
Stadtfeld agrees , noting that the silenced genes " might not matter for tissues in which [ such ] genes have no role " .
Although findings in mice do n't always apply to humans , if a similar gene signature is found in human cells , it could help researchers to identify which iPS cells to avoid using , and which stand the best chance of producing the desired tissue .
Hochedlinger 's team has therefore begun to look at human ES and iPS cells in search of similar gene - activity patterns to those they found in mice .

Amid fears of renewed armed conflict in the North , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak reassured his Lebanese counterpart Sa'ad Hariri on Tuesday that Israel had no plans to attack his country .
On his way out of a meeting with Mubarak at the Red Sea resort of Sharm e-Sheikh , Hariri said the Egyptian president had cited " positive " signs from his recent contacts with Israel .
However , the Lebanese president said he was assured Egypt would support Lebanon should such a war break out .
Hariri denied recent accusations that Syria had transferred Scud missiles to Hizbullah in Lebanon , saying his country was " not prepared to sit in the dock .
" Reports of the alleged Scud transfer surfaced in Kuwait ’snewspaper earlier this month .
Israel subsequently issued a stern warning that it would consider attacking both Syrian and Lebanese targets in response to a Scud attack on its territory .
Earlier Tuesday , Israel Radio reported that Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit had passed on messages to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and representatives of the other permanent UN Security Council members , warning that the current Israel - Lebanon tensions could deteriorate into a war in the summer .
Meanwhile , according to the radio station , Egypt denied Arab media reports that Aboul Gheit had called Israel an enemy state at a press conference in Beirut on Monday .
Israeli Ambassador to Egypt Yitzhak Levanon had protested the alleged remark on Monday to the director of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry 's Israel desk .
In response , the ministry said that all Aboul Gheit had said was that he could not transmit messages from Israel to Lebanon since Lebanon viewed Israel as an enemy state .

Once upon a time , back in Internet Explorer 4 , Microsoft produced something great ( this is not a joke ) .
They decided that when you bookmarked a favorite in your web browser an icon should appear next to its name .
On a day sometime in or around 1997 , the glorious favicon was born .
Every browser since then has supported favicons , in the widely supported .ico format .
Many browsers are now supporting them in other formats such as animated .gifs , .pngs , .jpgs , and more .
I ’m here to talk to you about why they ’re great , and how this is probably Microsoft ’s greatest contribution to mankind , ever .
For those that do n’t know , a favicon is a small square image ( usually 16x16 pixels ) that can be seen in places like your browser URL bar , bookmarks list , browser tabs , and RSS feeds .
The biggest reason why favicons are so important is their ability to help users identify their links , tabs , and feeds better .
That little 16 pixel icon is such a helpful visual cue , I often go as far to say that no design can be complete without a favicon .
As a designer I feel that everything in my power should be done to facilitate the user in finding their way around the product .
If something as simple as a favicon can be such a helpful tool , why on earth would you ever leave it out ?
To drive my point home even further , I remembered this post from Google ’s blog about their extensive research with over 300 favicons .
This is n’t intended to be one of those sweet list posts but I ca n’t talk about favicons without showing some that I think are really great .
A great favicon to me does n’t have to be stellar visually ( although that ’s usually nice ) it only has to assist the user in associating the mark with the name .
My test to decide if a favicon is successful or not is if you can identify the site it belongs to by seeing only the favicon .
Needless to say , this only applies if you ’re already familiar with the site .
There are obviously thousands of great favicons out there but I picked a few from my bookmarks or recent sites that I ’ve visited .
Google has had their share of bad favicons in my opinion but this current one knocks it out of the ballpark .
You can relate all four of Google ’s colors and their famous lower case g to the Google brand with ease .

With all the publicity Pepsi had a year or so ago with their logo change , everyone should know this brand .
There are even some special cases , two come quickly to mind .
The first is our own Hoptoad favicon .
It has been around for over a year now and it ’s time to let the cat out of the bag for those of you who do n’t know .
If you watch intently with a little patience ( about 43 seconds ) the Hoptoad favicon will give you a lively blink or two .
Note : this does not work in IE so do n’t sit there staring for 5 minutes , it will never happen .
The other cool favicon I know about , is from a project called Sound Manager 2 , and is really impressive .
It changes your favicon to show the audio levels of an audio file playing in your browser .
I honestly do n’t have a clue how it works , but definitely impresses me .
We used it last year during Rails Rumble in our Pockets App , so when you played back a voicemail it displayed the levels of the voicemail as it played .
Ironically , i was n’t able to get this to work in the browser that gave birth to the favicon , IE , as only browsers such as Firefox , Chrome , and Safari have improved upon favicon handling .
Update :
Mike Kivikoski informed me of this seriously awesome favicon game .
It plays a remake of the classic arcade game Defender in a favicon on that site .
Definitely check it out .
Needless to say it only works in a few browsers , I played it in Firefox 3.6 .
If you do n’t know how to create a favicon and implement it on your site check out this great tutorial .
If you have any cool favicons , especially any that are more than just static images , leave a comment - I always love seeing new favicon brilliance .
As always , thanks for reading and let ’s keep our fingers crossed … maybe IE9 will roll out some great new revolutionary tool that rivals the creative genius they showed with the favicon .
Uncontrolled Daily Mail readership has been ‘ damaging ’ for Britain and would be capped under a future Labour government , Gordon Brown has promised .
‘ Some areas of our nation have been swamped by waves of Daily Mail readers , ’ said Mr Brown , ‘ and , with their alien culture of prejudice , they are placing unbearable demands on the country ’s normally liberal supplies of patience and tolerance . ’
The decision follows increased social unrest with a rising tide of tutting , whinging and exasperated cries of ‘ It ’s political correctness gone mad . ’
Mr Brown pledged that Labour would set annual limits to Daily Mail readers according to a points based system .

Although supporters of the market economy often have good reason for pessimism , it is important , especially in this age of globalization , not to lose sight of the genuine victories that the classical liberal tradition can boast .
Half a century ago , Gunnar Myrdal could declare : “ The special advisers to underdeveloped countries who have taken the time and trouble to acquaint themselves with the problem , no matter who they are … all recommend central planning as the first condition of progress . ”
At that time , development economists who dissented from this consensus could have fit inside a phone booth .
Today , economists who still favor central planning for the less - developed countries may as well hold their convention in a phone booth .
Public protests against globalization — protests that occur by and large in the prosperous West — denounce free trade and the mobility of capital as instruments of exploitation and oppression .
The great development economist Peter Bauer used to say that if that were the case , then we should find the greatest prosperity among those less - developed countries that have the fewest economic connections to the West , and that those places that are altogether isolated — and therefore suffer from none of this alleged exploitation at all — should be paradise on earth .
Needless to say , that is not even close to what we find , and most serious observers know it .
Today practically everyone agrees that some kind of market economy is essential if the less - developed countries are to progress to developed status .
There are differences of opinion , to be sure , and the so - called “ new development economics ” of the past decade holds far more peril than promise .
But that the terms of the debate have shifted there can be little doubt .
As globalization has proceeded , the subject of the market economy has attracted more and more attention , with friend and foe alike seeking to understand the implications of the creation of a truly global marketplace .
One of the market ’s virtues , and the reason it enables so much peaceful interaction and cooperation among such a great variety of peoples , is that it demands of its participants only that they observe a relatively few basic principles , among them honesty , the sanctity of contracts , and respect for private property .

The imperial court , on the other hand , decided that all this accumulation of wealth by mere commoners amounted to an intolerable departure from pure Confucian principle , which imagined great wealth in the hands only of society ’s elite , and demanded that commoners be satisfied with their lot .
The government simply seized the entire industry , and this wonderful example of innovation and wealth creation was crushed .
Here is an example of cultural values that were incompatible with a market economy . [ 1 ]
But I want to go even further , and suggest that morality and the market are mutually reinforcing .
It is n’t merely that the market requires certain moral attributes in order to function properly .
The market itself encourages moral behavior .
It takes little imagination to surmise how critics of the market would respond to such a claim .
Does n’t the market encourage greed , rivalry , and discord ?
Does it not urge people to think only of themselves , accumulating wealth with no thought to any other concern ?

That human beings seek their own well - being and that of those close to them is not an especially provocative discovery .
What is important is that this universal aspect of human nature persists no matter what economic system is in place ; it merely expresses itself in different forms .
For all their saccharine rhetoric , for example , communist apparatchiks were not known for their disinterested commitment to the common good .
They , too , sought to improve their own well - being — except they lived in a system in which all such improvements came at the expense of their fellow human beings , rather than , as in a market economy , as a reward for serving them .
Communism brought out the worst in human nature , and crippled people ’s ability or ambition to participate in a market economy .
“ Traveling around the country , ” wrote American reporter Hedrick Smith in 1990 , “ I came to see the great mass of Soviets as protagonists in what I call the culture of envy .
In this culture , corrosive animosity took root under the czars in the deep - seated collectivism in Russian life and then was cultivated by Leninist ideology .
Now it has turned rancid under the misery of everyday living . ” [ 2 ]
The Soviet ruling class , with their cushy cars , clinics , and country homes , are a natural enough target for the wrath of the little people .
But what is ominous for Gorbachev ’s reforms is that this free - floating anger , the jealousy of the rank and file , often lights on anyone who rises above the crowd — anyone who works harder , gets ahead , and becomes better off , even if his gains are honestly earned .
This hostility is a serious danger to the new entrepreneurs whom Gorbachev is trying to nurture .
It is a deterrent to even modest initiative among ordinary people in factories or on farms .
It freezes the vast majority into the immobility of conforming to the group .
Under the system of tyranny and deprivation that the Russian people were forced to endure for seven decades , illicit “ profiteering ” — “ think of the worker stealing wheelbarrows and multiply him by a million , ” one writer says — made it possible for countless Russians to acquire the goods they needed .
We might therefore expect the profiteer to emerge as at least vaguely heroic , but the actual effect seems to have been to poison the idea of profit in the minds of many Russians , since they came to assume that anyone making a profit must be engaged in behavior that was somehow illicit or underhanded .

The countless stories in the Soviet press , as late in the socialist experiment as the 1980s , about vandalism and attacks on small shops by those who resented the success of their fellow man “ bear witness to the powerful influence of decades of Leninist indoctrination , ” Hedrick Smith explained .
“ For great masses of Soviet people , capitalism is still a dirty word , and the fact that someone earns more , gets more , is a violation of the egalitarian ideal of socialism .
Tens of millions of Soviets deeply mistrust the market , fearing they will be cheated and outsmarted .
They see the profit motive as immoral . ”
The Supreme Soviet ’s Anatoly Sobchak once remarked , “ Our people cannot endure seeing someone else earn more than they do … .
They are so jealous of other people that they want others to be worse off , if need be , to keep things equal . ”
Sobchak described this attitude as one of the chief obstacles to economic reform .
Television personality Dmitri Zakharov put it this way : “ In the West , if an American sees someone on TV with a shiny new car , he will think , ‘ Oh , maybe I can get that someday for myself . ’
But if a Russian sees that , he will think , ‘ This bastard with his car .
I would like to kill him for living better than I do . ' ”

That system , the polar opposite of the free market , encouraged greed in the ruling class and apathy , envy , and alienation among everyone else .
Scarcely anyone defends it any longer .
At the same time , we are urged not to let the socialist debacle sour us on the state itself , which we are told is an indispensable instrument in the pursuit of “ social justice . ”
But the less predatory state that such critics have in mind carries its own moral and cultural perils , only a few of which we can consider here .
Economists speak of the disutility of labor .
Albert Jay Nock referred to the human inclination to seek after wealth with the least possible exertion .
In a formulation familiar to libertarians , Franz Oppenheimer described two ways of acquiring wealth : the economic means and the political means .
The economic means involves the production of a good or service that is then sold to willing buyers seeking to improve their own well - being .
Both parties benefit .
The political means , on the other hand , involves the use of force to enrich one party or group at the expense of another — either to acquire someone else ’s wealth directly or to give oneself an unfair advantage over his competitors through the use or threat of coercion .
That is a much easier way of enriching oneself ; and since people tend to prefer an easier over a more difficult path to wealth , a society that hopes to foster both justice and prosperity needs to discourage wealth acquisition via the political means and encourage it through the economic means .
But the state , wrote Oppenheimer , was the organization of the political means of wealth acquisition .
It was through this channel that people could find paths to their own economic well - being that involved the use of force — carried out on their behalf by the state — rather than their own honest work .
For that reason , the baser aspects of human nature can find in the state an irresistible attraction .
It is easier to become dependent on welfare than to work ; it is easier to accept farm subsidies and thereby to increase food prices than it is to compete honorably and freely ; and it is easier to file an antitrust complaint against a competitor than to outcompete him honestly in the marketplace .
By making these and countless other predatory options possible , the state fosters unattractive moral attributes and appeals to the worst features of human nature .

In short order , society degenerates into a condition of low - intensity civil war , with each pressure group anxious to secure legislation aimed at enriching itself at the expense of the rest of society .
The Hobbesian war of all against all that allegedly characterizes life under the pre-political state of nature creeps into political life itself , as even those who were initially reluctant to seek political favors pursue them with vigor , if only to break even ( that is , vis - à - vis groups who are less scrupulous about using the state to secure their ends ) .
All of this looting under cover of law is what Frédéric Bastiat memorably called “ legal plunder . ”
The same phenomena are observable around the world , when misguided development aid programs have strengthened the interventionist state in less - developed nations .
Ben Powell makes the important point , echoing Peter Bauer , that the fashionable proposals we hear about nowadays that seek to direct foreign aid to responsible , relatively non-predatory regimes miss the point : these aid programs are inherently bad , no matter how selectively the funds are allocated .
Not only do they tend to enlarge the public sector of the recipient country , but competition for a share of the grant money also diverts private resources away from the satisfaction of genuine wants and into the wasteful , anti-social expenditure of time and resources for the purpose of winning government favors .
Some Virtues of the Market
If the state is the organization of the political means of wealth acquisition , then the market is the embodiment of the economic means .
The market all but compels people to be other - regarding , but not by means of intimidation , threats , and propaganda , as in socialist and statist systems .
It employs the perfectly normal , morally acceptable desire to improve one ’s material conditions and station in life , both of which can grow under capitalism only by directing one ’s efforts to the production of a good or service that improves the well - being of his fellow man .
This is why the title of Frédéric Bastiat ’s book Economic Harmonies is such a beautiful encapsulation of the classical liberal message .
( The American Anti-Imperialist League ’s George McNeill made essentially the same observation , if perhaps more vividly , in the late 1890s : “ Wealth is not so rapidly gained by killing Filipinos as by making shoes . ” )
John Rawls famously argued in A Theory of Justice that we could judge a society on the basis of the material condition of the least well - off .
The market wins according to that moral criterion as well .
Capital University ’s Robert Lawson has shown that all around the world , the poor are consistently better off in the least interventionist , most market - oriented societies .
America ’s poor are better off than much of the European middle class today , and better off than the American middle class of the 1950s .
This happy outcome follows from the very nature of capitalism .
When businesses invest in capital equipment to render the production process more efficient , they make it possible to produce more goods at a lower unit cost .
Competition then passes these cost cuts on to the consumer in the form of lower prices ( a phenomenon not always so visible in an inflationary economy , but at work all the same ) .
This greater abundance increases the purchasing power of all real incomes , and thereby redounds to the benefit of everyone .

Needless to say , the market possesses a great many virtues in addition to these .
But what we might call the Enron objection will at this point be raised : does n’t that fiasco reflect a serious moral problem at the heart of capitalism ?
Enron , it is said , was the free market in action , and Ken Lay an apostle of laissez faire .
In fact , neither claim is true .
Time constraints limit me to recommending the Enron chapter in Tim Carney ’s important book The Big Ripoff : How Big Business and Big Government Steal Your Money ( 2006 ) .
To make a long story short , Enron was on the receiving end of countless waves of government subsidies .
It also manipulated the bizarre regulatory thicket that was the California energy market in grotesquely anti-social ways that enriched Enron at the expense , quite literally , of everyone else .
The Cato Institute ’s Jerry Taylor correctly described Enron on balance as “ an enemy , not an ally of free markets .
Enron was more interested in rigging the marketplace with rules and regulations to advantage itself at the expense of competitors and consumers than in making money the old - fashioned way — by earning it honestly from their customers through voluntary trade . ”
Enron was in fact punished by the market for its behavior , while the American government , awash in Ponzi schemes , accounting irregularities , and unfunded liabilities it can’t possibly cover , goes about its business in peace .
“ Far from an example of a market failure , ” argues Jacksonville State University ’s Christopher Westley , “ Enron ’s saga shows that firms which invest too much in politics can easily become complacent in the face of changing market conditions … .
If there ’s a scandal to be found in the Enron debacle , it is this : Enron ’s faith that its political investments would eventually solve its problems caused it to avoid making necessary changes in its organization until it was too late .
Anyone who checks
Enron ’s stock price , now listed on one of the penny stock exchanges , knows that the market has penalized this strategy . ”
Amazon.com and Kmart , on the other hand , were up front with their investors about their financial difficulties , and ended up doing much better — by and large , their investors , no doubt impressed by these firms ’ honesty and transparency , stuck by them .
The nature of the attacks on capitalism frequently changes : one day it ’s the corruption of businessmen , as with Enron , the next it ’s environmental degradation ( which is typically the fault of poorly developed property rights and arbitrary regulatory regimes rather than of capitalism itself ) .
Sometimes capitalism will be criticized for one alleged failing one day and exactly the opposite failing the next .
Thus socialists once claimed that capitalism was less efficient than socialism , and could not produce in nearly the same abundance .
Now that that argument has been silenced , we have begun to hear exactly the opposite claim : capitalism brings about too much wealth , and makes people materialistic and fat .
As Joseph Schumpeter put it , “ Capitalism stands its trial before judges who have the sentence of death in their pockets .
They are going to pass it , whatever the defense they may hear ; the only success a victorious defense can possibly produce is a change in the indictment . ”
For a system that has brought about such astonishing and unprecedented advances in the well - being of the great mass of mankind , it is surprisingly vulnerable to attack .

Capitalism and Public Opinion
Murray Rothbard was fond of citing the arguments of Étienne de La Boétie ( as well as those of such later figures as David Hume and Ludwig von Mises ) to the effect that governments survive or perish on the basis of public opinion .
Since those who rule are of necessity vastly outnumbered by those who are ruled , it is curious that any regime — much less the truly oppressive — should get away with it for so long .
The only way they can do so , according to these men , is through the voluntary consent of the public .
That consent need not take the form of wild enthusiasm , which is rarely forthcoming for any regime ; passive resignation is quite enough .
If a critical mass of the population withdraws that consent , on the other hand , regimes collapse .
The fall of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe was a textbook example of exactly what La Boétie meant : when next to no one obeys commands any longer , how can the ruling elite hold on to power ?

It is not only political regimes but also economic systems that must pass a public opinion test if they are to endure .
And here we encounter an essential cultural attribute for the maintenance of a free economy : a critical mass of the population must consider market exchange , and the institutional supports that make it possible , to be fundamentally just .
And yet from our major institutions here in the United States we hear something like the opposite .
Schoolchildren are given the impression that the private sector is the source of all wickedness and oppression , from which public - spirited government officials , in their selfless commitment to justice , must rescue and protect us .
The selection of subject matter itself exhibits a pro-state bias : students leave school knowing all about how a bill becomes a law , for example , but with no idea of how markets work .
All of this applies just as strongly to popular culture and the media , with of course a few noble exceptions like John Stossel .
That is why I am surprised not by how much of the market economy has been suppressed in the United States , but by how much has managed to survive in the face of a hostile educational and cultural establishment .
Europe ’s opinion molders , as Olaf Gersemann observes in his book Cowboy Capitalism , are utterly contemptuous of American capitalism , a phenomenon they do not understand , and it is not surprising that in such an intellectual milieu those countries find themselves burdened with even more statism than we do .
The Culture of Enterprise : Concluding Thoughts
We are being much too ambitious if we think even the best economic institutions can transform human beings from flawed creatures into saints .
The correction of human failings is the business of families , churches , and voluntary organizations of all kinds .
The twentieth century served , among other things , as an extended lesson in both the danger and the folly of state - led efforts to transform human nature .
We can be more than satisfied if our economic system is content to take human beings as they are , direct their energies into productive rather than anti-social outlets , and reward them for satisfying the needs of their fellow men .

Stark , Rodney Best Price : $ 3.19 Buy New $ 7.98 ( as of 11:05 EST - Details )
Thomas Jefferson once observed that the mass of mankind was not “ born with saddles on their backs , nor a favored few booted and spurred , ready to ride them . ”
That is what the free economy is all about : anyone is free to serve the public in the manner he thinks best , and no one , not even those who have been most successful in the past , can claim exemption from the daily referenda that take place whenever the public decides to buy or to abstain from buying what he has to sell .
To my ear , the term “ culture of enterprise ” suggests a society that possesses a conscious appreciation of the distinct virtues of the market economy , some of which I have described here , and why it is morally and materially superior to statist alternatives , as I have also described here .
In other words , the points I have made in my remarks today are the kind of arguments that should resonate with and constitute important pillars for a culture of enterprise .
Instead of being held up for condemnation and abuse , entrepreneurs in such a society would be respected and honored for the risks they assume with their own property in order to bring improvement to people ’s lives , from the latest technological innovation to the most mundane of necessities .
For a true culture of enterprise to last , people must see in the unhampered market economy not merely the least intolerable system but a positive good , in which living standards consistently rise , human creativity is given free rein , and human interaction proceeds on the civilized basis of respect for others ’ person and property .
The decades following World War II taught anyone who was paying attention how not to encourage prosperity or escape from less - developed status : demonize producers and the successful , nationalize industry , harass foreign investors , make property insecure , institute “ import substitution ” policies , and suffocate entrepreneurship through regulation .
Development aid programs , meanwhile , either expressly endorsed these policies ( as in the case of import substitution ) or enabled them to continue by masking the true effects of such disastrous measures or propping up the regimes that implemented them .
If the less - developed countries are to enjoy the prosperity of such success stories as Hong Kong and South Korea , or enjoy the growth rates being observed today in Ireland and even China , they must abandon the destructive and wicked policies of the past , discard the culture of envy their leaders have fostered , and embrace the principles of freedom that have allowed more people than ever before in history to enjoy the material conditions of civilized life .
And at a time when our countrymen are being courted by all manner of interventionist politicians — with one noble exception , I hasten to add — peddling all kinds of grandiose schemes for human betterment , Americans themselves could stand to be reminded of the values that inform a culture of enterprise .
There was something disturbing , and yet revealing , in the title of MSNBC ’s election coverage segment last year — Battleground : America .
Every two years , but especially every four , the country becomes in effect a battleground between opposing forces , in which the winner acquires the power to take the country to war unilaterally , to impose a uniform social policy on 280 million Americans , and to implement all manner of policies on his own authority , by means of executive orders and signing statements .
Americans typically take for granted that this is normal , and indeed how life must be .
But in fact we do n’t need Hillary Clinton or John Edwards , Rudy Giuliani or John McCain , to “ run the country ” ( to use an infelicitous if unfortunately common phrase ) or to make us prosperous .
A free and responsible people can manage its affairs without the platitudes and paternal custodianship of a Great Leader , and exhibits no superstitious reverence toward the occupants of political office .
Once a society begins to absorb this revolutionary discovery , it has already embraced the culture of enterprise .

The Best of Tom Woods
NEW ARRIVALS IN federal prison are stuck in a sort of purgatory for the first month or so .
When you are on Admissions and Orientation status , you ca n’t do anything — ca n’t have a job , ca n’t go to GED classes , ca n’t say a word when ordered to shovel snow at odd hours of the night .
The official line is that your medical tests and clearances must come back from whatever mysterious place they go before your prison life can really start .
But almost nothing involving paperwork happens quickly in prison .
During my A&O period at the minimum - security prison in Danbury , Conn. , I was often afraid — less of violence ( I had n’t seen any evidence of it ) than of getting cursed out publicly for breaking a prison rule or a prisoner rule .
There are a dizzying number of official and unofficial rules and rituals to learn .
You learn them quickly or suffer the consequences , such as : being thought an idiot , being called an idiot , being forced to clean bathrooms , getting an incident report put on your record , or getting sent to solitary .
Yet the most common response to a query about anything other than an official rule is , “ Honey , do n’t you know not to ask questions in prison ? ”
Everything else — the unofficial rules — you learn by observation , inference , or very cautious questioning of people you hope you can trust .
Early on , I spent as many hours as I could standing out in the February cold , staring to the east over an enormous Connecticut valley .
I wrote letters and read books .
I braved the rickety icy stairs that led down to a field house gym and a frozen track .
But except for pestering my temporary bunkmate with questions , I kept mostly to myself .
Finally , one evening , the PA system boomed my name , and I scurried down to the office of my counselor , Mr. Butorsky .
I was off A&O .
“ You ’re moving down into B Dorm , ” Butorsky said .
“ Cube 18 .
Miss Malcolm will be your bunkie . ”
I had no idea who Miss Malcolm was , but I had learned that in prison “ Miss ” was an honorific conferred only on the elderly or those who were highly respected .
Though I did n’t yet know it , I had won the bunkie lottery .
B DORM WAS known as “ the Ghetto . ”
Housing in the prison was assigned by the counselors , its three dorms organized along obvious racial lines .
I might have blended more easily into A Dorm , or “ the Suburbs , ” but I was assured that my assignment meant that my counselor “ liked me . ”
When I had imagined what the dorms looked like , I pictured murky caves .
They turned out to be large , semi- subterranean rooms that were mazes of beige cubicles , each housing two prisoners , a bunk bed , two metal lockers , and a stepladder .
Miss Malcolm , a petite , dark - skinned , middle - aged woman with a heavy Caribbean accent , was waiting for me when I arrived at Cube 18 .
She was all business .
“ That ’s your locker . ”
She indicated the empty one .
“ And these are your hooks .
Those hooks are mine , and that ’s just the way it ’s gonna be . ”
Her clothes were neatly hung , including a pair of checkered cook ’s pants .
“ I do n’t care if you ’re gay or what , but I do n’t want no foolishness in the bunk .
I clean on Sunday nights .
You have to help clean . ”
“ Of course , Miss Malcolm , ” I agreed .
“ Call me Natalie , ” she said .
Natalie , a woman near the end of an eight - year sentence , would prove to be a reserve of quiet dignity and good counsel .
Because of her heavy accent , it took careful listening on my part to understand everything she said , but she never said anything unnecessary .
She was the head baker in the kitchen .
She rose at 4 a .m. to begin her shift and kept largely to herself with a few select friends from among the West Indian women and her kitchen co-workers .
She spent quiet time reading , walking the track , and writing letters , and went to bed early , at 8 p.m .
She could answer just about any question I had about life at Danbury , but we spoke very little about our lives outside of prison .
She never said what had landed her there , and I never asked .
How Natalie got to sleep at 8 o’clock every night became a mystery to me immediately , because it was loud down in B Dorm .
My first evening there I was quiet as a mouse in my top bunk , trying to follow the hooting and hollering that took place across the big room filled with four dozen women .
I was worried that I would never get any sleep , and that I would lose my marbles in the cacophony .
When the main lights were shut off , though , it quieted down pretty quickly .
But the next morning , something woke me before dawn .
Groggy and confused , I sat up in bed in the dark .
I could hear someone , not shouting exactly , but angry .
I leaned forward cautiously , and peeped out of my cubicle .
Two cubes away I could see a Spanish woman who ’d been particularly loud the night before .
She was not happy .
What was angering her , I could not figure out .
Suddenly she squatted for a few moments , then stood up and stalked off , leaving behind a puddle in front of my neighbor ’s cubicle .
I rubbed my eyes .
Did I just see what I thought I saw ?
About a minute later a black woman emerged from the cubicle .
“ Lili ! Cabrales !
Lili Cabrales !
Get back here and clean this up !
Lil - EEEEE ! ” People were not happy to be awakened this way , and a smattering of “ Shut the f --- up ! ” broke out across the big room .
I ducked my head back out of sight and flopped back down on my bunk .
I had fallen down the rabbit hole .
MR. BUTORSKY HAD warned me about my fellow prisoners on my first day .
“ We ’ve got all types up there .
Some of them are all right , ” he said .
“ No one ’s going to mess with you unless you let them .
Now , women do n’t fight much .
They talk , they gossip , they spread rumors .
So they may talk about you .
Some of the girls are going to think you think you ’re better than them .
They ’re going to say , ‘ Oh , she ’s got money . ’ ”
I felt uncomfortable .
Was that how I came across ?
“ And there ’s lesbians up there .
They ’re here , but they ’re not gonna bother you .
Some are gonna try and be your best friend , whatever — just stay away from them !
I want you to understand , you do not have to have lesbian sex .
I ’m old - fashioned .
I do n’t approve of any of that mess . ”
I tried very hard not to smirk .
In truth , I would soon be struck by the fact that there did not seem to be any lesbian activity at Danbury .
It was hard to see , within a few days , how a person could conduct an intimate relationship , let alone an illicit relationship , in such an overcrowded environment .
A lot of the romantic relationships I eventually observed were more like schoolgirl crushes , and it was rare for a couple to last more than a month or two .
My strategy for avoiding complications was to talk a lot about my fiancé , Larry , which made it known that I was not “ that way . ”
NATALIE HAD THE respect of everyone in B Dorm , and I soon could tell that being Natalie ’s bunkie conferred on me an odd credibility among other prisoners .
Despite her reserve and discretion , she also had a dry but lively sense of humor and treated me to sharp , sidelong observations on our daily life in B Dorm .
“ You in the Ghetto now , bunkie ! ”
Her best friend , Ginger Solomon , who was also Jamaican , was like the yang to Natalie ’s yin : antic , combustible , and loud .
Miss Solomon was also a fantastic cook , and once she and Natalie had decided that I was all right , she would make me a plate of her special Saturday night dinner , usually a knockout curry prepared with kitchen contraband .
On special occasions , Natalie would magically make roti appear .
I grew powerfully attached to Natalie in just a short time .
But despite , or because of , the fact that Natalie and I lived in the closest of quarters , I knew virtually nothing about her — just that she was from Jamaica and that she had two children , a daughter and a young son .
It was clear that where Natalie was concerned , personal subjects were off - limits .
In a world of women confined to such close quarters , juicy secrets had a way of leaking out anyway .
Any story you heard in prison had to be taken with about a pound of salt , but some stories had real currency .
Pop , the intimidating middle - aged wife of a Russian gangster , had the best gossip , the most historical and revealing .
Pop ran the kitchen with an iron fist , and it was from her that I eventually found out why years earlier Natalie had once been sent down to FCI , the higher - security facility in our compound :
My quiet , dignified bunkmate had thrown scalding water on another prisoner in the kitchen .
I was incredulous when I heard this , but Pop said the victim had it coming .
“ And what you do n’t know , Piper , is your bunkie got a temper !
Natalie ’s no joke . ”
Seeing that I was still puzzled , she tried to illuminate some prison realities for me .
“ Look , Piper , things are pretty calm around here now , but that ’s not always the way .
And down the hill — forget about it !
You ’ve got lifers down there .
When you ’re doing serious time , or life , things look different .
You ca n’t put up with sh-- from anyone , because this is your life , and if you ever take it from anyone , then you ’re always going to have problems . ”
When Pop told me her stories , I would hang on every word .
I had no way of verifying whether they were the gospel truth , but I understood that these stories held their own accuracy .
They described our world as we experienced it .
MERCIFULLY , THE CLOSEST
I got to fighting during my brief stay did not involve scalding water or a “ slock ” ( the name for a popular weapon made by slipping a combination lock inside a tube sock ) , but rather , roughage .
Whenever anything other than cauliflower and iceberg lettuce appeared in the salad bar at the mess hall , I went to town .
One day there was a bunch of spinach mixed in with the iceberg , and I happily began to select dark green leaves for my dinner , humming as I did so .
“ Hey !
Hey !
Hey you !
Stop picking !
Stop picking like that ! ”
To my surprise , the shouting came from a beefy young girl in a hairnet who was glaring at me .
I gestured with the salad tongs .
“ Are you talking to me ? ”
“ Hell , yeah .
You ca n’t be picking out the greens like that .
Just fill up your plate and keep moving ! ”
I vaguely recognized my salad bar adversary as new — a reputed troublemaker who had yet to be assigned to a dorm .
There was even a chance that , as a newbie , she had prepped the salad herself .
Still , I was furious that she had had the nerve to step up to me .
By then , I felt like I was pretty firmly established in the prison ’s social ecology .
Besides , she was breaking a cardinal rule among prisoners :
Do n’t tell me what to do — you have eight numbers after your name just like mine .
So to have some 18 - year - old messing with me in the dining room was enraging .
To get into a public battle with a black woman was a profoundly loaded situation , but it did n’t even occur to me to back down from this punk kid .
I opened my mouth , mad enough to spit , and said loudly , “ I do n’t eat iceberg lettuce ! ”
Really ?
I asked myself .
That ’s what you ’re going to throw down with ?
Fortunately , before I could raise the stakes higher , Jae , a tall , solidly built friend from B Dorm , materialized at my side .
Her normally smiling face was stern .
She looked at Big Mouth , not saying a word .
And just like that , Big Mouth turned and slunk away .
“ You okay , Piper ? ” said Jae .
“ I am totally okay , Jae ! ” I replied hotly , glaring after Big Mouth .
But I knew that Jae had just saved me many months of trouble .

Citigroup : US to sell its stake in bailed - out bank
Citigroup needed three cash injections from the US government
The US government is preparing to sell its 27 % stake in Citigroup , in what would be one of the largest share sales in history .
Some 7.7 billion shares in the bailed - out bank will be sold in tranches throughout 2010 , the US Treasury said .
It will mark another stage in Wall Street 's recovery , and could make the US taxpayer $ 8 bn ( £ 5.3 bn ) in profit .
Citigroup , which has posted more than $ 100bn in write - downs , required three government rescues in 2008 and 2009 .
At Citigroup 's opening share price of $ 4.39 on Monday , the Treasury 's stake would be worth just over $ 33bn , giving an $ 8bn profit to the US taxpayer .
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
The bank has received a total of $ 45bn in bail - out money from the Treasury 's $ 700 bn Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) .
It was the largest amount given to a bank ( and was equal to the sum given to Bank of America ) .
Citigroup was given $ 25 bn in return for 7.7 billion in shares , and was loaned another $ 20bn in two tranches .
This $ 20bn was repaid in December .
The bank , once one of America 's most illustrious financial institutions , has seen its share price collapse 90 % since late 2006 as fears about its financial health grew .
Its shares fell after the Treasury confirmed the sale , falling 4 % to $ 4.11 .
Before the credit crisis they were worth more than $ 50 .
Morgan Stanley has been chosen to underwrite and advise on the sale , though the US Treasury emphasised that the disposal was subject to market conditions .
A Treasury statement said that it " intends to sell its Citigroup common shares into the market through various means in an orderly and measured fashion " .
It is thought that the share sales will begin after Citigroup reports its results next month .
Analyst Greg Valliere of Soleil Securities said a profitable exit of the government 's stake in Citi would be a " great PR victory for the Obama administration " .
" There are many skeptics who never thought this day would come , " he added .
Taxpayer money Citi follows other Wall Street banks , including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America , who have repaid the government investment .
Although the bank rescues now seem likely to be profitable , BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker says , other financial aid will probably cost the taxpayer money , including the insurer AIG and the carmakers General Motors and Chrysler .
According to the latest official report on the state of Tarp at the end of 2009 , 67 recipients had repaid all or part of their bail - out money , totalling more than $ 165.2 bn .
The Treasury had also received by the end of December $ 16.9bn in additional payments such as interest and dividends on its investments .

Israeli officials and MKs sharply criticized the announced intention of the UK government to expel an unnamed Israeli diplomat in response to its passports being used in the Dubai assassination of senior Hamas arms trafficker Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
" I think [ the ]
British are behaving hypocritically and I do n't want to offend dogs on this issue , since some dogs are utterly loyal , " MK Aryeh Eldad ( National Union ) told Sky News .
" Who are they to judge us on the war on terror ?
" Eldad added that Israel 's " natural reaction should be to expel one of the senior diplomats in the British Embassy , maybe the military attache or someone on his level .
" Eldad 's party colleague , MK Michael Ben - Ari , responded : " The British may be dogs , but they are not loyal to us , but rather to an anti-Semitic system , and Israeli diplomacy partially plays into their hands .
This is anti-Semitism disguised as anti-Zionism " .
In contrast , Foreign Affairs and Defense committee chairman MK Tzahi Hanegbi ( Kadima ) recommended not to respond to the crisis with Britain .
" I believe keeping silent was a good policy at the height of the Dubai crisis , and certainly it is now , when it is nearly behind us .
" Years ago , he said , Israel " adopted a policy of not responding to allegations in these areas . "
He added that such opportunities are exploited to " make baseless charges against Israel . "
Sky News also reported that the Israeli Foreign Ministry would not comment on the issue .
According to Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch , " The British government made the wrong decision .
I am surprised by thisreport and do not know who the diplomat to be expelled is .
" Aharonovitch was quoted by Channel 2 as saying that " The government hasmade legal provisions , involving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs andother ministries , for the eventuality that Israeli diplomats ormilitary personnel would be expelled from friendly countries .
Suchmatters should be discussed between governments .
" The British commission investigating the alleged passport misuse isexpected to announce that the Mossad 's complicity cannot be provenbeyond reasonable doubt .
Nevertheless , Channel 2 reported that seniorBritish officials believe the expulsion will not be sufficient topunish Israel over the Dubai incident .
Howard Dean has close links with the Liberal Democrats Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg could be the surprise winner of the UK 's general election , former US presidential candidate Howard Dean has said .
Mr Dean praised Mr Clegg as a " young , dynamic leader " .
And he said he could be the big winner from Britain 's first televised election debates , capitalising on disillusion with the two larger parties .
The UK 's first - past - the - post voting system makes it difficult for a third party to break through .
The most likely outcome of a surge in support for the Lib Dems , who are currently trailing Labour and the Conservatives in the opinion polls and have far fewer MPs , would be a hung Parliament , with Mr Clegg holding the balance of power .
Coalition But Mr Dean , who was briefly frontrunner for the 2004 Democratic Party nomination and whose infamous " Iowa scream " - a yelp of defiance at a campaign rally - became an internet hit , said Mr Clegg believes he can win outright .
He is a young , dynamic leader that they do n't know much about and the Brits really would like a change
Howard Dean Speaking on the Washington Journal , simulcast on US network C - Span and BBC Parliament , he said : " I do n't think there 'll ever be a coalition between the Liberals and the Labour government .
" I know the Liberals , I know Nick Clegg very well , and he intends to win this and I think they could .
" So you may have a hung Parliament but I think you wo n't have a coalition .
At least not that coalition going forward . "
Asked if Mr Clegg could be the next British prime minister , Mr Dean said : " I think he could " .
' Dynamic ' Mr Dean , who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009 , has close links with the Lib Dems and has spoken at their party conference in the past .
He acknowledged that Britain 's electoral system mitigated against a Lib Dem victory in the general election , widely expected to take place on 6 May .
" It 's a different system ours , first - past - the - post , but I think the debates are going to be enormously helpful to everybody .
He is a young , dynamic leader that they do n't know much about and the Brits really would like a change .
" Just the fact that Labour and the Conservatives are so close shows that the Conservatives are not what they want either .
" They 're mad at Labour , they do n't want the Conservatives , they happen to have a young dynamic leader , leading a party that in fact has been in power in Britain and run governments in Britain , although not for the past many decades , and I think those debates are going to put them all on an equal footing and I think Nick Clegg could make a lot of hay out of this . "
Mr Clegg declared in his party conference speech last year that he wanted to be prime minister .
It was talked up by his aides as the most ambitious statement ever made by a Lib Dem leader , but it attracted ridicule from political opponents and some commentators .

The serial online prankster David Thorne is at it again , this time creating the party of the century on social networking site , Facebook .
Thorne , known for his hilarious attempt to pay a bill with a spider drawing , has created a new viral phenomenon with his hoax Facebook event , Kate ’s Party .
The event , which appeared to be a birthday party on May 1st for Adelaide woman Kate Miller , attracted 60,000 attendees after Thorne posted the link on his Twitter page , 27b / 6 .
A day later there were a further 180,000 people who had been invited waiting to be confirmed .
The event was to take place at Miller 's apartment and had , seemingly , been accidentally left open to public viewing instead of set to private .
Thorne , pretending he had stumbled across the event , sent a link to his thousands of Twitter followers urging them to " hit attending & give the host an aneurysm " .
From here the details of the party spread across the globe , with many believing Kate Miller was a genuine person , until Facebook administration closed the group down due to security concerns .
However the demise of the original event only spurred on its fans , who have now created hundreds of related pages in reference to Kate ’s Party , such as " Which turban should I wear to Kate's " , " I hope there 's more than one toilet in Kate 's apartment " , " Flight QF785 to Kate ’s Party " , " Who the hell is Kate " and " That awkward moment when someone was n't actually invited to Kate 's party . " .
Thorne reportedly said he created the hoax to show how quickly events could go viral through sites like Facebook and Twitter , and the need for extra caution with privacy settings .
As Kate - styled street parties pop up in every capital across the country this weekend , it is hoped the attendees have learnt this lesson the easy way .
MarketWatch is reporting March sales are fresh signal that U.S. consumers are back
U.S. retailers '
March sales rose by their highest percentage in more than a decade , another sign that U.S. shoppers are back spending beyond what they need .
Total March sales rose 9.1 % , the highest since data began to be compiled in 2000 , with 92 % of reported numbers topping Wall Street expectations , according to Thomson Reuters .
International Council of Shopping Centers reported sales rose 9 % , their highest since March 1999 .
With the benefit of Easter falling this year on April 4 , and thus being included as part of retailers '
March reporting month , instead of April 12 last year , they also said combining retailers ' March and April results would be a better gauge of shoppers ' spending power .
From high - end retailers Saks Inc. ( SKS ) and Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN ) to discounters Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST ) and Target Corp. ( TGT ) , same - store sales gains of more than 10 % were seen across the board .
Easter Bonus
Shoppers are finally coming out of hibernation .
Better weather and an earlier Easter enticed Americans to shell out for spring clothes in March , the fourth straight month of gains for retail sales .
Target , Macy's , Gap and the parent of Victoria 's Secret all beat Wall Street expectations .
The improvement was broad , spanning discounters , mass merchants , specialty stores and luxury retailers .
The gains offer strong evidence that people are feeling more confident in the economic recovery and are more willing to spend .
Retailers had several factors on their side .
The earlier holiday combined with comparisons to notoriously weak sales in March 2009 had analysts expecting solid improvements .
But it 's also clear that shoppers ' mindset is changing .
" There was a lot of talk about the frugality of the American consumer and that the recession taught people to save more , " said Sherif Mityas , a partner in the retail practice at management consultant A.T. Kearney .
" But U.S. consumers have short - term memories . "

State Sales Tax Collections Tell The Real Story
Texas Sales Tax Collections
Wednesday , April 7 , 2010
Texas has fallen a bit deeper into the budget hole with another month of disappointing sales tax collections , according to a Texas comptroller 's office report released on Wednesday .
A closely watched indicator of Texas ' fiscal health , the state 's sales tax revenue is now $ 1.5 billion below where it was at the same time last year , the figures showed .
Even so , state officials say they have not yet decided to pull the trigger on proposed agency budget cuts , aimed at saving about $ 1 billion in the current two - year budget .
The $ 1.46 billion collected from February sales — and remitted to the state in March — was 7.8 percent less than the amount brought in during the same month a year ago .
Email From A Texas Reader
Mish ,
This is from the Austin American : State sales tax still sinking , but pace slows
This is the official notice : Local Governments to Receive $ 394 Million in Sales Tax Revenue
Texas Comptroller Susan Combs said today the state received $ 1.46 billion in sales tax revenue in March , down 7.8 percent compared to March 2009 .
“ For the second month in a row , the decline in sales tax collections continued to moderate , ” Combs said .
“ Following an eight - month stretch of double - digit declines , the pace of revenue losses is slowing .
The oil and gas , construction , manufacturing , and retail industries registered lower sales tax revenue collections than one year earlier .
We expect further declines in the near term followed by a return to sales tax revenue growth later this year . ”
From what I gather from these articles , a big increase in auto sales due to various incentive programs was a big part .
In addition , I noticed that sales tax receipts in some rural areas picked up .
This is due to a wet winter breaking a 3 - year drought .
This will be a very good farm year in Texas , and many rural sales are based on that .
So , let 's see , massive auto promotions , unusually good weather for agriculture , and all we get is a slowing in the rate of decrease , over an already bad year .
Does that sound like a recovery ?

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Dubai ’s police chief plans to seek the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the head of Israel ’s spy agency over the killing of a Hamas leader in the emirate , Al Jazeera television reported .

Dahi Khalfan Tamim “ said he would ask the Dubai prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for ... Netanyahu and the head of Mossad , ” the television said .
It did not give details .
Tamim has said he is “ almost certain ” Israeli agents were involved in the killing of Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh at a Dubai hotel in January , calling for Mossad ’s boss , Meir Dagan , to be arrested if it is proved responsible .
Tamim said on Monday Mossad had “ insulted ” Dubai and Western countries whose fraudulent passports were used by suspects in the assassination .
Dubai has asked the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into prepaid cards issued by the Meta Financial Group ’s MetaBank which the suspects used , a United Arab Emirates newspaper said .
Citing an FBI source , The National newspaper said the investigation would look into any Israeli involvement in the killing .
“ Thirteen of the 27 suspects used prepaid MasterCards issued by MetaBank , a regional American bank , to purchase plane tickets and book hotel rooms , ” the newspaper said , quoting Dubai police .
MetaBank said it followed proper procedures when it issued the cards .
Authorities told the bank that the suspects appeared to have used stolen passports to get employment with U.S. companies , MetaBank said in a statement on Tuesday .
The companies paid the employees with prepaid cards issued by MetaBank and other banks .
MetaBank said it had launched its own review of the matter , and had so far found that it followed all bank and regulatory requirements .
The suspects authorities had identified were not on any list that would indicate their identities were fraudulent , it said .
The UAE , a U.S. - allied Arab state that backs the Palestinian drive for an independent state and an end to Israeli occupation , has no diplomatic relations with Israel .
But it has established low - level political and trade links in recent years , with some Israeli officials attending events in the Gulf Arab state .
Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer competed in the Dubai Championships last month .
Members of the hit squad used fraudulent passports from Britain , Ireland , Germany , France and Australia .
Residents of Israel with the same names as the suspects , holding dual nationalities , have said their identities appear to have been stolen .
The passport abuse has drawn criticism from the European Union , and some of the governments involved have summoned the Israeli ambassadors to their countries to protest .

Re-use old candy packaging to make practical art : a recycyling craft .
Many types of candy and lozenges come in tins .
While they are an awfully great way to carry the mints or other hard candies around it's an awful waste to throw them out when the contents have been consumed .
But the good news is that you can re-use these handy containers to store things in or to assemble small kits of useful items .
You can make up a tiny first aid kit in a candy tin or use one to store needles and thread .
Empty mint tins have lots of uses !
I prefer such things be a bit more decorative or at least more interesting and I find I need a way to distinguish tins put to a new use from the ones with mints still in them .
It 's good to have some way to tell all of them apart and to distinguish them from the ones that still have sweets inside , so my solution is to decorate my old candy tins by etching images or designs into them .
This lens will give you step - by - step instructions on how to etch an image or design using saltwater and electricity .
It 's kind of like a craft and a science project combined .
Supplies for etching candy tins with saltwater and electricity photo by Kylyssa Shay
Materials , Tools , and Supplies for this Etching Project
One 6V dry cell battery
Coarse grit sandpaper
Fine grit sandpaper
Crayons
One metal candy tin
Dust mask
Eye protection
Insulated copper wire
Wire cutters and stripper
A ballpoint pen or pencil
Hairdryer
A large glass or plastic bowl
Salt
Water
Choosing a Good Container
A smooth ginger Altoids tin found under my sink photo by Kylyssa Shay
Choosing the Right Tin for the Project
A good candy tin for this project will be smooth rather than embossed and will have enough room on the front to draw the design or image of your choice .
I like to use the packages that Newman 's Own and Penguin mints come in as they are free from embossing or other raised designs , but any smooth tin will work just as well .
Altoids boxes used to work great because they were smooth , but the new ones are embossed .
This old , smooth Altoids tin was a fortunate find from under my sink .
Be Safe !
Be sure to wear eye protection and a dust mask while working on this project !
Step One : Sand Off the Paint
Coarse sandpaper being used to remove paint from a tin photo by Kylyssa Shay
Use the Coarse Sandpaper First
Starting with the coarsest sandpaper , sand off all the paint on the surfaces you will be using .
The paint can be left on the sides and back of the tin if desired .
Sand in a single direction to more easily achieve a smooth finish .
It will take less work to sand out the scratches from the coarse sandpaper with the fine sandpaper if you do .
Step Two : Sand the Surface Smooth
Fine sandpaper smooths the tin photo by Kylyssa Shay
Polish It Smooth With Fine Grit Sandpaper
Use a fine grit sandpaper to smooth the rough surface of the rough - sanded tin .
Again , pick a direction and sand in it to avoid a grooving or crosshatching effect .
A Blank Slate

Once you 've sanded the surfaces to the desired smoothness your tin is ready to begin the crayon wax masking process .
Step Three : Cover
It with Crayon

Scribble Wax Onto the Tin
Use a dark colored crayon to color in the side you wish to create a design on .
Any color will do because you are just going to rub it off later , but dark colors provide the best contrast so you can see what you are doing when you scratch an image into it .
Step Four : Melt the Crayon with a Hair Dryer
Tin successfully masked with melted purple crayon Kylyssa Shay
Melt the Wax Crayon
Once you 've solidly colored in the side you wish to use , heat it with a hairdryer on high until it begins to melt .
While the metal is still hot , fill in any thin spots of wax using your crayon .
You do n't need to get perfect coverage but keep in mind that all uncovered parts will get etched .
Undisturbed areas of this wax covering will seal the saltwater solution away from the surface of the tin except in the areas you choose to scratch it away .
That 's how you 'll end up with a picture or design of your choosing instead of just a pitted - looking old tin .
Step Five : Use a Pencil to Scratch in an Image

Draw the Image of Your Choosing By Scratching Away Wax
Use a pencil or ball - point pen to scratch out a design or picture .
Do n't try to scratch into the metal , just scratch through the wax .
I like trilobites so I scratched one into the wax this time .
You can also lay a drawing or printed image over top and trace it , pressing hard , if you do n't feel confident drawing something freehand .
Simple line drawings work best for this project .
Step Six : Hook the Wires to the Battery
Copper wires hooked up to a battery photo by Kylyssa Shay
Prepare and Attach the Wires
Cut the wires about a foot long , strip about an inch and a half ( about three centimeters ) of each end on each wire .
Test the wires to see how you need to bend them to stay on the battery 's contacts without allowing their stripped ends to touch each other or the other contact .
Step Seven : Put the First Wire Into the Salt Water Bath
photo by Kylyssa Shay
Mix Up the Salt and Water Bath and Lay the Positive Wire in It
Mix table salt into a glass or plastic bowl of warm water until you can dissolve no more in it .
Remove the negative terminal 's wire , leaving the positive terminal 's wire attached .
Lay the positive wire 's end in the saltwater bath .
Step Eight : Attach the Second Wire to the Battery and Submerge the Tin
photo by Kylyssa Shay
Give Your Tin a Shocking Bath
Set one stripped end of the negative wire into the saltwater bath .
Then set the tin into saltwater bath so the side to be etched is in the water above the negative wire end and touching it .
Then attach the negative wire to the negative battery terminal .
This will make a stream of bubbles come up from the wire 's tip under the tin .
This is normal and desired .
The gas made is hydrogen which is flammable so perform this part of the project away from open flame and in a well ventilated area .
Allow the tin to sit there over the bubbling negative wire for five to ten minutes then remove the negative wire from the battery .
Step Ten : Remove
It from the Bath and Dry It Off
photo by Kylyssa Shay
Dry It and Rub Off the Wax Crayon Mask
Remove the tin from the saltwater bath and dry it off .
Then scrub off the crayon wax with a washcloth and polish it with the fine - grit sandpaper .
Wash it gently with warm water to remove any metal dust and dry it gently with a towel .
The Finished Etching

Put on a Coat or Don't .
It Looks Cool Either Way .
You can now either coat the tin with a clear varnish or allow the natural patina of oxidation to age and enhance your etching .
Do You Re-Use Food or Product Packaging ?
Do you re-use any of the durable packaging your food or household products come in ?
Whether it 's using margarine tubs to store leftovers , jars to store paperclips , or candy tins to make art and storage , it all helps to keep these things out of landfills .
Re-using product packaging also helps the environment in other ways - it saves you from buying something else to serve the same purpose , something which would have to be manufactured from raw materials and brought to you using more fossil fuel .
Kylyssa Shay ( author ) from Overlooking a meadow near Grand Rapids , Michigan , USA on January 27 , 2015 :
The need for the idea came from having a partner addicted to Altoids and a need to distinguish between tins with candy still in them and tins with things like pushpins or matches in them .
The idea of this kind of etching came from my seventh grade science teacher , Mr. Harper , who had us make hydrogen in class and kicked it up a notch by having us etch our initials into these little metal disks we used during the process .
It was brilliant teaching because I still remember it over thirty years later .
The little bubbles coming up when you do the etching are hydrogen gas .
I suggest not mentioning that if you do this project with kids because they 'll want to do what we all did which was to catch the hydrogen underwater in an inverted cup , bring it out , and light it .
Daphne D. Lewis from Saint Albans , West Virginia on January 27 , 2015 :
A great project for recycling my Altoid tins !
Thanks for sharing !!
Liz Elias from Oakley , CA on January 26 , 2015 :
Most interesting !
How did you ever come up with this idea ?
The only etching I 've ever done is with an acid paste on glass , using stencils made for that purpose .
It never would have occurred to me to try to etch metal tins , though I do re-use them .
I do n't get many candy tins ; most of mine are cookie tins , and I re-use them for the same purpose .
Voted up , interesting and useful .
Virginia Kearney from United States on January 26 , 2015 :
Very interesting technique -- I 've done lots of different kinds of crafting but never tried anything like this .
Pinned .
Marilyn from Nevada on January 26 , 2015 :
Very interesting , and I also find uses for containers rather than throw them out .
The candy container you show in your photo , I use for safety pins , push pins , paper clips .
There is a multitude of ideas .
Thank you for sharing yours !
Peg Cole from Northeast of Dallas , Texas on January 26 , 2015 :

well done
Kylyssa Shay ( author ) from Overlooking a meadow near Grand Rapids , Michigan , USA on February 08 , 2014 :
@tfsherman lm :
Thank you !
The battery would probably not be appropriate for littles to use and the drawing probably requires too much co-ordination .
If you prepped a bunch of tins with the wax or crayon coating and let the kids etch them and did the part with the battery and saltwater bath yourself , kids as young as second or third grade could participate .
The drawing part could be made easier by using some kind of image on paper as a template over the wax .
Kylyssa Shay ( author ) from Overlooking a meadow near Grand Rapids , Michigan , USA on February 08 , 2014 :
@Coleton LM : Thank you !
It works with most kinds of tins used in food packaging and also works on copper and brass for certain .
I 'm not entirely sure about how it works on other metals .
I remembered saltwater etching from an eighth grade science class and I was fiddling around with things I have at home that I could make crafts with .
The crayon was something I had handy and I knew that anything that sealed all but the design area and was n't water - soluble would work to mask off the area I did n't wish to etch .
My hobbies of arts , crafts , and tinkering often intersect in odd ways .
MarcellaCarlton on February 08 , 2014 :
I 'm going to try this one out .
This looks incredible , Kylyssa .
Another great lens !

Yesterday we made arm bands out of TP rolls and tinfoil in my pre-k art class , but I do n't know if I dare tackle this with a herd of youngsters .
Very , very cool though , thanks !
Coleton LM on February 08 , 2014 :
Very nice !
Does this work with all metals , or just specifically the metal used in mint containers ?
Also , where did you come up / come across this ?
It 's awesome !
philipcaddick on February 08 , 2014 :
This was GREAT , so simple and looks fun .
Thanks very much .

Oh Kylyssa , this is just terrific !
I absolutely love this lens and am going to add it to my favorites straight away ( though they seem to have disappeared from Squidoo , so I 'm going to bookmark it on Tagfoot as well lol ) .
This is just spectacular , these would make terrific gifts !
I reuse tins for storage all over the place , though I probably should just go ahead and recycle them since I wind up with so much extra " stuff " laying around that I do n't need .
We 've got a huge carton for recyclables and take them in once there is enough of a stack to make it worth while to wait over an hour in line .
What do you do with these when you 're done ?
Are you selling them somewhere ?
I * love* the trilobite sketch !
Kylyssa Shay ( author ) from Overlooking a meadow near Grand Rapids , Michigan , USA on January 27 , 2010 :
@SoyCandleLover : I think that would work great .
You might be able to mask the tin with something like clear packing tape , print or draw an image on paper , and use another piece of clear packing tape to hold it on top of the tin as you cut through it .
You could probably use a thick , sharp needle to scrape away the masking , too .
That would give you tighter fingertip control of the cutting tool even if you might have to go over the design more than once .
Beth Webster - Duerr from Henrietta , New York on January 27 , 2010 :
I have always save tins , nd now you 've shown me something I can do to actually make them look good .
You 're a great sketcher , so I might have trouble with that .
I might try using tape or contact paper to be the resist .
That way I could probably trace a design and use a knife to cut it out .
Do you think this might work ?

When will we reach the peak of global oil production ?
It ’s a question of crucial importance as governments around the world prepare for a world of declining oil resources , in which we will be much more reliant on alternative sources of energy .
The body on which the UK and others rely heavily to make that assessment is the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) based in Paris and set up in the aftermath of the oil crisis between 1973 and 1974 .
For years , IEA reports have been reiterating the conclusion that peak oil was not a problem .
Behind the scenes however , it is now clear that senior staff thought otherwise .
It was only through the work of 22 - year - old Lionel Badal , a politics student at Exeter University , that the truth about this cover - up finally emerged .
First enquiries ...
It started innocently enough , as Lionel , working on his undergraduate dissertation on peak oil , set about trying to arrange interviews with politicians and figures working inside and outside the oil industry .
He was surprised when the IEA agreed to allow him to interview one of their top officials .
In the end the first official pulled out of the interview but he was replaced by one of his colleagues , a senior economist at the organisation .
The new interviewee turned out to be far more forthcoming than his superiors might have wanted .
December 2008 ...
Lionel met the official at the IEA ’s Paris headquarters .
His interviewee was initially a reluctant speaker .
‘ He was very concerned about how I would quote him and where it would appear – just from this I knew the meeting could be interesting , ’ says Lionel .
‘ He then asked if he was the first person I had interviewed still working in the industry .
I replied that yes he was ( I had tried speaking to OPEC but had been told they did not do interviews ) .
After hearing this he said this was a problem .
‘ He did n’t say why but it was obvious he did not want to be the only one speaking out . ’
Most of the interview was ‘ interesting but nothing revelatory ’ , remembers Lionel , but that changed towards the end when the official was asked for his opinion on predictions for peak oil .
The IEA has repeatedly said oil output can increase until at least 2030 as long as ' adequate investments are made in exploration and development ' .
Other analysts , including those behind the UK Energy Research Centre report on peak oil , say this is ' wildly optimistic ' and that the IEA does not have the evidence to back up this prediction .
Far from sticking to the IEA line , the official said he was actually very worried about peak oil and shared some of the more pessimistic concerns .
‘ From that meeting I understood there was a problem , ’ says Lionel , ‘as publicly the IEA did not say this type of thing . ’
Over the next few months Lionel continued his research and met with politicians in France .
Spring 2009 …
By early 2009 he had finished his research and contacted the IEA official to send him his dissertation .
He also told him about the contact he had had so far with French MPs concerned about peak oil .
The IEA official told him that he respected one of the politicians with whom Lionel had met and later agreed to testify to other politicians about the problem .
It was a pivotal moment - through his involvement in an undergraduate disseration , a key IEA official was prepared to go public about what his organisation really thought about peak oil .
July 2009 …
By July , Lionel had managed to arrange a meeting between himself , the IEA official and the MEP Corrine Lepage , a former French environment minister and well - known figure in French politics .
Clearly pleased to meet such a respected figure , the IEA official became much more open about the downplaying of peak oil concerns at the agency .
‘ He told her reports had been modified and that there were pressures on the IEA from the US not to make too pessimistic predictions , ' Lionel remembers .
' He said just as peak oil theorists claimed , there was a big problem with oil . ’
By the end of the meeting the IEA official had agreed to write a briefing note for the MEP on the issue .
But by then Lionel thought the issue needed to be made public .
‘ I knew on her own the MEP could not do anything about the problem .
But I also knew that some British journalists were writing a lot about the issue , so a few weeks later I asked the IEA official whether he would be willing to testify anonymously to journalists .
The official was initially sceptical , preferring to inform politicians in a discreet way .
But a few weeks later , Lionel pressed him again on the issue and he agreed .
‘ I think arranging the meeting with the French MP definitely helped .
It gave me some credibility as she was well known .
He was certainly not naïve about the whole process and understood that his career could be at risk . ’
September 2009 …
Having been given the green light , Lionel contacted two journalists at the Economist and the Independent .
The Independent was slow to respond and did not seem convinced by the story , remembers Lionel , but the Economist journalist agreed to meet the following month when he was in London .
However , at the meeting he said he could not immediately write about the issue as he was working on other stories .
‘ I also got the feeling his position was isolated at the Economist and that the magazine would not want to take a stance by running such a story on peak oil , ’ says Lionel .
October 2009 …
Soon after these first attempts to make the issue public , the respected NGO Global Witness released a report on peak oil , Heads in the Sand .
Reading Guardian journalist Ashley Seager 's article on this report , Lionel decided to contact him and sent information about his IEA whistleblower to both Seager and the paper ’s environment columnist , George Monbiot .
Seager forwarded it onto the Guardian ’s energy editor , Terry Macalister .
By coincidence the IEA was preparing to publish its latest annual report on oil supply and demand in early November .
With the launch scheduled to take place in London , the Guardian had the perfect opportunity to maximise exposure of the story .
November 2009 …
Macalister spoke to Lionel ’s IEA official , and on November 10th , 2009 - the same day that the IEA ’s chief economist Dr Fatih Birol was launching the agency ’s major annual report - the story appeared on the Guardian ’s frontpage .
As expected , the reaction was huge .
‘ Peak oil whistleblower ’ stories were splashed across the media .
What do you think ?
Comment here
The IEA attempted to downplay the idea of a peak oil cover - up , arguing that their reports were peer - reviewed by international experts .
But since the story broke , further reports from Uppsala University and the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security have been critical of IEA predictions .
Next step …
Lionel himself says the allegations from the whistleblower and reports from Global Witness are too serious for governments to ignore .
He is lobbying politicians to launch an independent inquiry into predictions being made by the IEA .
‘ We have to know what is really going on behind the walls of the so - called global oil watchdog , ' he says .
‘ If the Agency deliberately covers up the seriousness of the situation and provides misleading information , then the consequences could be world - shaking .
‘ By not knowing that peak oil will happen within 10 or even five years , governments and businesses around the world are not preparing adequately .
And this could have dramatic effects for everyone in a not too distant future , ’ he says .

The Supreme Court overturned pardons of a dictatorship - era president and economy minister on Tuesday , paving the way for them to be tried for kidnapping and extortion .
Former President Jorge Videla , left , and his economy minister , José Martínez de Hoz , are accused of detaining Federico Gutheim , a textile merchant , and his son Miguel for five months in 1976 and 1977 to force them to settle a trade dispute .
The court upheld a lower - court ruling that the pardons were unconstitutional .
There are some inventions and inventors you just grow up knowing about - Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone , Thomas Edison and the lightbulb ( even though he really just improved upon it ) .
But there are a lot of inventions lurking out there that you did n't learn about in your elementary school history and science books - inventions from geniuses known for other creations and discoveries , and inventions from people you did n't expect to be inventors at all .
Here are a few of them .
Henry David Thoreau , of all people , invented raisin bread when he tossed a handful into the dough he was baking while at Walden Pond .
It does n’t sound like a big deal , but the addition of the shriveled little grapes is said to have just stunned and scandalized the housewives of Concord , Massachusetts , who were used to doing their baking in a very particular manner .
I bet their minds would be blown by cinnamon raisin bread .

Marlon Brando : actor , icon ... inventor ?
Yup .
Toward the end of his life , Brando received several patents all related to a device that would help musicians tune drumheads .
Why ?
Your guess is as good as mine - the patents all stemmed from 2002 - 2004 , and when he died in 2004 , he presumably took the idea with him .
Zeppo Marx owned a company that made industrial clamps and straps that were used quite heavily during WWII - the Marman Clamp was actually used to hold the atomic bombs carried by the Enola Gay .
But Marx himself held three patents - one for a “ Vapor Delivery Pad for Delivering Moist Heat ” and two related to a device that monitored heart rates .
And actually , Gummo Marx had a patent too - it was for a “ Packaging Rack . ”
Sir Isaac Newton was undoubtedly a genius with many discoveries and inventions to his name .
Where do you think the cat flap ranks on his list of accomplishments ?
Rumor has it that Newton invented the cat flap when his beloved pet kept nudging the door to his lab open while he was working on light experiments , ruining hours of work .
But he loved his cat and did n’t want to shut her out of his lab - or trap her inside .
The solution ?
He cut a hole in the door , then installed a piece of felt at the stop so the least amount of light possible would seep through .
Allegedly , when the cat had kittens , he cut a smaller door for them to go through even though they easily could have gone through the larger door .
However , take this story with a grain of salt - at least two Newton biographers have done extensive research on the man ’s life that turned up no trace of a pet of any kind .

What ’s a parent to do when their helpless infant is suffering after a terrible accident ?
Well , if you ’re Roald Dahl , you team up with a couple of other guys to invent a brain shunt to ease the pain .
Dahl ’s son
Theo was happily sitting in his baby carriage when it was hit by a taxi cab , severely injuring the infant and causing water to pool on his brain .
The current device that helped drain the fluid was unreliable ; it often jammed and was known to cause blindness .
So Dahl partnered with a hydraulic engineer and a neurosurgeon to come up with a better solution - the Wade - Dahl - Till valve .
His son had recovered by the time the valve was complete , but it served others well .
The three men responsible for the valve all agreed that they would never accept payment for the invention .
Mark
Twain has three patents to his name , but he was mostly a wannabe inventor .
He was fascinated by inventions and gadgets and invested a lot of money in unknown inventors in hopes that his investments would make him quite rich .
None of them ever panned out , though , and he eventually declared bankruptcy .
But back to Twain ’s patents - they were quite diverse .
The first was granted in 1871 and was called “ Improvement in adjustable and detachable straps for garments . ”
The strap tightened shirts up at the waist ; the idea was to replace cumbersome suspenders .
He also held a somewhat successful patent for a self - pasting scrapbook that ended up earning him about $ 50,000 .
And in 1885 , he filed a patent for a history trivia game .
It should come as no surprise that the author wrote about his ventures - you can read about the creation of the strap here .
Margaret Thatcher - yes , the ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - helped invent soft serve ice cream .
I ’m not sure if I should be thankful or not .
After Maggie graduated from Oxford in 1950 , she went to work for J. Lyons and Co. , a British restaurant and food manufacturing company .
The team she worked on developed a way to whip air into ice cream , leaving it lighter and creamier than existing ice cream .
The result ?
Soft serve .
Yum .

Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died Friday in a horrific crash in an Olympic training run at Whistler , B.C. , just hours before the Games opening ceremony .
Kumaritashvili was coming around the final 270 - degree turn , where speeds approach 140 kilometres an hour , when he flipped off his sled and flew into a metal pole .
Medics administered CPR to the 21 - year - old from Borjomi , Georgia , before he was lifted into an ambulance .
An air - rescue helicopter arrived eight minutes after the crash .
Curve 16 to be altered Olympic officials have decided to make some changes to the track at the Whistler Sliding Centre following the death of Nodar Kumaritashvili .
Officials from the International Luge Federation and the Vancouver 2010 organizing committee say their investigation found " no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track . "
They said the track would reopen Saturday morning with changes " to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again . "
The wall will be raised at the exit of Curve 16 , the last on the course and where Kumaritashvili lost control , went airborne and slammed into a steel pole .
Other unspecified changes will be made to the ice .
- Canadian Press
Luge training was suspended temporarily and the B.C. Coroners Service , assisted by the RCMP , began conducting an investigation into the fatality at the Whistler Sliding Centre .
Members of the International Luge Federation were called for a briefing and team captains from each country were asked to attend a meeting .
International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge had difficulty keeping his composure at a brief , sombre media conference .
" This is a very sad day .
The IOC is in deep mourning , " he said .
" Here you have a young athlete who lost his life in pursuing his passion .
He had a dream to participate in the Olympic Games , he trained hard , and had this fatal accident .
" I have no words to say what we feel . "
Rogge said the IOC had been in touch with Kumaritashvili 's family , and that he had a conversation with Mikheil Saakashvili , the president of the Georgia , who is attending the Games .
John Furlong , the CEO of the organizing group VANOC , shared Rogge 's sentiments .
" We are heartbroken beyond words to be sitting here , " Furlong said .
" It 's not something that I had prepared for , or ever thought I would need to be prepared for . "
Furlong expressed his condolences to the friends and family of Kumaritashvili , " who came to Vancouver to follow his Olympic dream . "
VANOC will conduct a complete investigation , he said .
" The accident is tragic .
It will be investigated , and when we know the substance of what happened , you will know it . "
Nodar Kumaritashvili was speeding around the final 270 - degree turn at 140 kms an hour when he flipped off his sled .
( ( The New York Times ) )
As mark of respect for their " fallen comrade , " the Georgian Olympic team will still compete in the Vancouver Games , Georgian Sport and Culture Minister Nicholas Rurua told a Vancouver media conference later Friday .
Dick Pound , Canada 's senior IOC member , told CBC News : " The Games go on with a little bit of a cloud and sorrow .
And I think what to do in luge is analyze this and say , ' Are we making the tracks too demanding for athletes or is it one of these things that , because there 's a high risk in a lot of these winter sports , it was just not his day ? "
Kumaritashvili went high in the corner , banking left , near the finish of the run .
His sled swooped out from under him and he rocketed through the air , turning backward as he launched into a thick metal pillar that supports the canopy above the finish area .
There was a collective gasp on the finish dock from officials and athletes as the crash was beamed on the large - screen TVs .
The screens were immediately turned off as crews raced to Kumaritashvili .
Medics were seen performing mouth - to - mouth resuscitation on the Georgian , his helmet still on , face up on the concrete beside the track and the ambulance .
Track officials then ordered all bystanders away .
Medics administered CPR to the bloodied Kumaritashvili before he was loaded into an ambulance .
An air - rescue helicopter arrived eight minutes after the crash and the slider was taken to a medical facility at the athletes ' village south of Whistler .
Video of the crash was posted on YouTube — but was quickly removed .
Alpine skier Brad Spence of Calgary wrote on Twitter : " My thoughts and condolences go out to the family and friends of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili .
What a tragedy . "
Kumaritashvili was a relatively inexperienced luger .
He had competed in five World Cup races this season , finishing 44th in the world standings .
It was his second crash during training for the Vancouver Games .
He also failed to finish his second of his six practice runs .
" Half the time in luge , people are shaking their heads and saying , ' You 're heading down this track , feet first , in something you can't really steer — is n't that crazy ? '
But in kind of a funny way .
And now you realize there 's a huge degree of skill and risk involved , " said Pound .
Concerns over sliding track
" This is the first time we 've seen this .
It 's very sad , " said Canadian luge team coach Wolfgang Staudinger , who was in the finish area .
He said he planned to meet with his team to discuss what happened .
The $ 105 - million sliding centre , on the southeast face of Blackcomb Mountain , has been billed as a wild ride and the crash happened at its fastest point .
The 1,450 - metre course has 16 turns and drops steeply for 152 metres , the longest drop of any track in the world .
The average grade is about 11 per cent , including two stomach - inverting drops of 20 per cent .
Canadian world champion skeleton racer Mellisa Hollingsworth has called the Whistler course the most challenging track in the world .
It was the second crash of the day on the course after defending Olympic champion Armin Zoeggeler of Italy lost control on the lower part of the track .
He did n't appear to be injured .
On Thursday , Romanian women 's slider Violeta Stramaturaru crashed and had to be airlifted out .
More than a dozen athletes have crashed during Olympic training .
Harper statement
Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed his condolences to the Georgian Olympic team and Kumaritashvili 's family .
" All Canadians were deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of Georgian Olympic team member Nodar Kumaritashvili following a luge training accident in Whistler today .
His competitive spirit and dedication to sports excellence will be remembered and honoured during the Games , " Harper said in a statement .
" On behalf of all Canadians , Laureen and I send our deepest sympathies to Mr. Kumaritashvili's family and friends and the entire Georgian Winter Olympic team . "
The luge competition was scheduled to begin Saturday .
There was no immediate word if the men's singles event would be delayed .
Slots are great for so many reasons , but the latest reason we ’re loving slots is all down to the features .
One of the best ?

Cottontails seek habitats with lots of food sources and thick brush for protection , so it 's possible there are still some hiding out .
No one introduced the rabbits , which have been living there since well before the park was established 161 years ago .
No other New York park has seen a decline in wild rabbits , said Sarah Aucoin , director of Urban Park Rangers for the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation .
" I 've been here for 17 years , and there were not many when I got here , " Regina Alvarez , director of horticulture for the Central Park Conservancy , a nonprofit that manages the huge Manhattan park for the city , said in an e-mail .
" But I would see them once in a while . "
Though abandoned pet rabbits perennially turn up after each Easter in what 's affectionately called New York 's backyard , a wild cottontail has n't been spotted in the park for about four years .
NEW YORK —
If anyone knows why the bunnies have disappeared from Central Park , wildlife officials are all ears .
Because bunnies " mate like rabbits , " if there are still a few , " we 'll see an increase , definitely , " Aucoin said .
" Only time will tell . "
The bunnies are especially vulnerable to weather , predators and automobiles -- all features of the park , said Alan Hicks , a state wildlife biologist .
A recent storm took out large trees throughout the park , and several city streets cut through it .
Hawks and falcons are a common sight there , and a random coyote is not out of the question .
One was spotted in the park in 2006 .
But Aucoin said she did n't think an increase in predators was to blame , because they generally do n't decimate their own food source , she said .
" That 's not smart , evolutionarily speaking , " she said .
" That predator population would die off if they did n't have anything to eat . "
So since no one has the answer , officials are doing what they can to encourage repopulation .
The city has been working to remove invasive plants and planting others to make the park more livable for small animals , including rabbits , Aucoin said .
" When people see a wild animal , even if it 's just a bunny , it helps people connect to the environment in a more tangible way , " she said .
" That 's a really important relationship we 're trying to encourage here in the city . "
But if you 're dying to see a bunny in the park , visit on Monday .
Some people give them to their children as pets , discover they require feeding and cleaning , and set them free in the park , Aucoin said .
When that happens , park rangers rescue the domesticated bunnies and take them to a shelter .
" It 's a horrific problem , " said Mary Cotter , who teaches veterinary technology at LaGuardia Community College in Queens and has founded a rabbit rescue group in the city .
Her group put up posters around the city reading , " Setting Your Pet Rabbit Loose Does n't Make Her ' Free . '
It Makes Her ' Food . ' "
" Domestic rabbits do not survive in the park , " she said .
" The ones that are caught and are taken to a shelter are the lucky ones . "

The NCAA announced Thursday a new 14 - year agreement with CBS and Turner Broadcasting for rights to the men's basketball tournament , which will expand to 68 teams starting next season .
TO NCAA , 68 GREATER THAN 96 TO NCAA , 68 GREATER THAN 96 Starting next year , the NCAA men's basketball tournament will stand at 68 teams .
But for how long ?
A 96 - team field had been discussed leading up to the new 14 - year CBS / Turner Sports agreement announced Thursday .
The NCAA still can expand the tournament further under the deal worth nearly $ 11 billion .
But Greg Shaheen , the NCAA 's vice president of basketball and business strategies , said it is in no hurry to do so .
" There 's no expectation that further conversations will take place related to the field anytime in the near future , " Shaheen said .
For now the money is n't there to make a leap to 96 , which started to become clear in negotiations after the Final Four , according to Ohio State athletics director Gene Smith .
He 's a member of the NCAA basketball committee and will be its chairman next season .
" I 'm not sure the financial differential was much between 68 and 96 , " Smith said in a telephone interview .
" A lot of us assumed it would be .
You assume more inventory would mean more money .
But at the end of the day the games are played in the same window .
It 's not like you 're going to get a whole lot more .
But we did n't know that until the negotiations . "
He said he was ecstatic about a 68 - team field : " We were able to keep the tournament ( model ) as it is , and you 're able to make a little more money .
If you go to 96 there were questions :
What does it do to the regular season , conference tournaments , and does it dilute the tournament ? " --

The NCAA men's basketball tournament is expanding , starting next season , but not on the large scale once expected .
The sport 's signature event will grow to 68 teams from 65 in conjunction with a new 14 - year , nearly $ 11 billion television agreement with CBS and Turner Sports announced Thursday .
That gives the NCAA a 41 % hike in annual media and marketing rights connected to the tournament — and " financial stability through the first quarter of this century , " interim President Jim Isch said — without the controversy of a more dramatic move to a 96 - team bracket .
Negotiations with CBS / Turner , ESPN and Fox Sports initially had targeted a 96 - team field , drawing concern and criticism from traditionalists and others over the impact on the tournament 's aesthetics , effect on college basketball 's regular season and conference tournaments and potential for further intrusion on players ' time and studies .
Sentiment turned to 68 shortly after the men's Final Four this month , when it became apparent that the money would n't significantly change , according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations .
VIDEO : USA TODAY breaks down the new NCAA deal OPENING ROUND :
Who will land in four play - in games ?
REACTION : Overall , coaches positive on tourney changes BLOG : More on the field 's expansion to 68 teams VOTE :
Do you like the 68 - team format vs. 96 ?
The more modest expansion preserves the NCAA - run National Invitation Tournament , whose 32 berths would have been folded into a 96 - team NCAA field .
A five - year TV contract for that event expired this year , and negotiations for a new deal are underway , one of the persons said .
" Some expansion is a good thing .
I do n't know if anyone really wanted 96 , " said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim , a long - outspoken proponent of a larger NCAA field .
Said Big Ten Conference Commissioner Jim Delany , a former chairman of the committee that oversees the tournament and leading opponent of expansion to 96 , " I was a little surprised but pleased .
" I think a lot of teams can fill those additional three or four slots .
The NCAA got security and some growth .
A traditional ( broadcast ) partner was retained , and a new partner was added .
I think the fans will be well - served .
More of these games will be seen on more platforms ( with ) less regionalization . …
I think all in all , Isch and his team got us to a good place . "
Every game will now be shown nationally in its entirety for the first time .
The new deal replaces an 11 - year , $ 6 billion contract with CBS that was scheduled to run through the 2012 - 13 season but gave the NCAA an option to opt out three years early — by July 31 .
The NCAA 's Division I Board of Directors , comprised of university presidents and chancellors , is expected to sign off on the accompanying expansion to 68 teams when it meets April 29 in Indianapolis .
The Division I men's basketball committee then must work out the 68 - team format , which will feature four opening - round games rather than the current one to pare down to a conventional 64 - team bracket .
A key question is whether the eight lowest - seeded teams — typically the champions of lower - echelon conferences — will be assigned to those initial games or if the committee will fill at least some of the slots with the lowest - seeded at - large invitees .
Many of the latter come from marquee leagues .
" I ca n't predict , " said Ohio State Gene Smith , the committee 's incoming chairman .
" We spent more time mentally preparing for 96 because it was the most daunting and challenging . "
Said UCLA athletics director Dan Guerrero , the current chairman : " There are a number of options .
Clearly the most obvious option is to add three at - large teams and continue to seed the way we normally do , " with the 16th - and 17th - seeded teams playing opening - round games .
" Or we could be real creative and look at other models that might make the opening games , at least to the fans , a little more intriguing . "
The panel meets next month in Indianapolis and again in Chicago in late June and early July .
Further expansion of the tournament , to 96 or some lower number , is n't impossible under the new agreement , which runs through the 2023 - 24 season .
The NCAA can alter the bracket if it chooses , and CBS News and Sports President Sean McManus said " we have flexibility in our deal to accommodate " it .
However , NCAA Senior Vice President Greg Shaheen , who works closely with the basketball committee , said , " There 's no expectation ( that ) further conversation takes place related to the field anytime in the near future . "
The last tinkering with the bracket came in 2001 , when the 65th team was added to accommodate a rise in the number of automatically qualifying conference tournament champions to 31 .
At - large bids go to 34 other teams .
The last significant expansion of the tournament , from 53 to 64 teams , came in 1985 .
The new agreement with CBS and Turner will spread NCAA tournament games across four networks starting next March .
The four opening - round games and 48 first - and second - round games will be carried by CBS , TBS , TNT and TruTV .
Regional semifinals will play out on CBS and Turner .
Through the 2014 - 15 season , regional finals and Final Four games will stay on CBS .
Starting with the 2015 - 16 season , CBS and Turner will share regional final coverage and alternate carrying the nationals semifinals and championship game ( on CBS and Turner 's TBS ) .
" For the basketball fan , if he is now living in Chicago and wants to watch the Kentucky game , he has the opportunity to do that , " McManus said .
" It really is a win - win for everybody involved . "
The new deal is worth a little more than an average of $ 771 million annually — up from $ 545.5 million under the previous CBS contract — and payments for digital and other new media rights will push the total value past $ 11 billion .
" I do n't call it a windfall , " Delany said .
" I call it a secure , conservative play that guarantees a good , solid stream of revenue in a tough time .
" Whether or not the marketplace will be better a year or two from now is hard to say .
But I would say … it 's a good reflection that the property is still healthy even in a marketplace that 's not considered by most people to be incredibly vibrant . "
The NCAA also holds an agreement with ESPN for the women 's basketball tournament , College World Series and 21 other NCAA championships worth $ 55 million over the next three years .
And it 's shopping the rights to 60 - plus other national championships .

This morning got off to a roaring start , as a fast - filling thread plopped onto maemo.org seemed to have it from an authoritative source that there will not be a version of MeeGo to run on Nokia ’s N900 .
The fear , uncertainty and doubt spread like wildfire , naturally igniting the ideal 140 - character vehicle for misunderstandings , Twitter .
It became obvious to me that the root problem was a misunderstanding by a CNET Asia blogger that was picked up by speed - readers and blown up into a noisy tornado of nonsense .
I ’ll break this down for those interested .
Headlines as weapons
The title of the article was Nokia N900 not upgradeable to MeeGo , which sure seems definitive .
One could assume the writer had done his homework .
The offending quote
But then we start reading and realize the writer was tripped up by semantics of the quote , which by the way was unattributed .
The wording was “ Maemo on Nokia N900 is not upgradeable to MeeGo .
The first MeeGo device is targeted to be released during the second half of 2010 .
However , applications written for Moblin or Maemo Qt APIs will run on MeeGo . ”
The first sentence is key .
To the speed - reader it appears to say the N900 will not be upgradeable to MeeGo .
But what it actually indicates is that the Maemo operating system itself will not be directly upgradeable to MeeGo on the device .
Take “ on Nokia N900 ” out of the sentence and it becomes very clear .
The safe assumption here is that any version of MeeGo designed for the N900 would need to be installed fresh , overwriting the original Maemo OS and very likely every user setting as well .
Odds are that means backups wo n’t work and applications will have to be reinstalled ( Qt apps should work on either OS ) .
What Nokia has said
The true definitive word here comes from Valtteri Halla , director of Nokia MeeGo and a member of MeeGo ’s Technical Steering Group .
His quote in this regard :
N900 is a natural tool for Nokia to drive MeeGo support for our designs and for the ARM CPU architecture in general .
We want to have baseline HW that is powerful , easily available for anyone and form - factor stuff so that one HW works for most platform and application development needs .
That said , please do not take this yet as a commitment to fully productise MeeGo on N900 .
I am quite confident that we will end up having a really good developer distro for N900 already but committing to stabilise a consumer - grade MeeGo 1.0 ( first half this year ) for N900 is another story .
That is a product business decision beyond my scope .
Also , we do not yet know about MeeGo 1 release content .
I am not yet sure if I would be personally ready to let my Maemo5 go for the first MeeGo release in my daily N900 use .
Let ’s see
Conclusion
So the plan is to create a developer distribution of MeeGo for the N900 .
At a minimum this makes sense given that the N900 is the reference platform .
Note that as of this writing there is no released official statement on a commercial build for the N900 , one way or another .
To try and prevent or at least minimize future FUD , I have updated the maemo.org wiki with a summary of the contents here .
Ultimately I blame blogger Damian Koh for not doing his homework before posting so irresponsibly .
It looks like he was so eager to get this juicy quote onto the internet he did n’t actually consider what it meant .
And I have to confess to getting testy on Twitter when attempts to clarify were met with resistance .
No excuse for that , and no excuse for the original sin .
There ’s already enough uncertainty swarming around the N900 , Maemo and MeeGo … let ’s all avoid feeding it , okay ?
Addendum :
Okay , after posting the article after this one and digesting some comments here , I realized something .
I was irresponsible with this article .
I did n’t finish it .
Because some commenters are correct : Nokia is not being as clear as they can on the subject of MeeGo on the N900 .
A developer version demonstrates there ’s no technical hurdle keeping MeeGo off the device .
Forget “ nonvolatile upgrades ” – will any sort of commercial variant be produced ?
If not , then that ’s a business decision … and in my personal opinion , the wrong one .
I wo n’t join the crowd and claim Nokia is directly guilty of FUD – but indirectly , the lack of commitment one way or another to answering the $ 600 question is certainly laying a foundation for it .
Maemo / MeeGo guys in Nokia , you know I respect you all and am behind this venture 100 % even after losing the best gig I ever had supporting you .
So level with me , and those who have stuck with this platform through the best and worst of the ride :
Will there be a commercial rendition of MeeGo for the N900 ?
Yes or no .
A teenager in Littleton , Colorado , was arrested and spent eight hours in jail for failing to return an overdue DVD to a local library .
Nineteen - year - old Aaron Henson was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 70 last month , and found himself in prison after police found a failure - to - appear warrant out for his arrest .
Henson had n’t returned House of the Flying Daggers , a Chinese DVD valued at just over $ 30 that he had borrowed from the library .

“ I was just shocked , ” Henson told ABC News .
“ I was like ‘ What ?
I ’ve got a what now ? ' ”
Henson says when he called his parents from jail , he had a hard time convincing his mother he was telling the truth .
She told him there is no such thing as “ book police . ”
Though the charge against Hanson was dropped and the city now says it wo n’t have people arrested over $ 30 DVDs , the incident showcases the extreme lengths some municipalities — faced with declining revenues — are going to in order to plug budget holes .
The city of Littleton says it lost $ 7,800 last year in library materials that were n’t returned .
National Public Radio notes that cities are coming up with “ novel ways ” to raise revenues , including “ new charges for responding to 911 calls to taxes and fees on sodas , bottled water , groceries and grocery bags . ”
ABC News reports that Littleton is by no means the only city that has taken to issuing summonses for missing library materials .
“ Similar arrests and warrants have been reported in Washington state , Iowa and Texas , ” it states .

In Hanson ’s case , the arrest was for failure to appear , not for theft .
The city of Littleton says it sent Hanson repeated notices in the mail and left phone messages for him , requesting that he return the DVD .
Hanson says he failed to return it because he accidentally packed it while moving last fall .
The move , he says , is why he did n’t receive the library ’s messages .
Because he never received notice of the summons , the arrest was “ a clear violation of his right to due process , ” Hanson ’s father , Allen Hanson , said .
KMGH in Denver reports that the arrest cost Hanson ’s family $ 460 in all — $ 200 for bail , $ 200 to get his car out of the impound lot , and $ 60 for court costs .
The city says it will reimburse the Hansons , and Littleton Mayor Doug Clark has announced a change in the city ’s policy , saying that “ we ’re not going to arrest people who do n’t return $ 30 DVDs . ”

“ Cities and states are going mostly after these kinds of sin taxes , ” Justin H. Higginbottom , an analyst with conservative research group Tax Foundation , told NPR .
“ They ’ll target a politically unpopular industry and go after them to raise revenue .
It ’s much easier to do that than to raise rates on sales taxes . ”
NPR ’s Alan Greenblatt reports that “ one reason sin taxes are easier to sell is that they are n’t presented purely as ways to raise money .
Mayors like to stress the idea that they ’re helping to curb bad behaviors . ”
The City of Portland , Oregon says it 's ready to be one of Google 's test run fiber - to - the - home projects , and how :
" No city in the USA is as ready as Portland to launch a citywide or scaled test bed for ultra high speed open platform broadband , " its response to Google 's Request for Proposals proudly declares .
" Portland has the history , broad community support , willing businesses , committed local government , and cost - effective , year - round construction metrics . "
As we 've reported , Google says it 's planning to roll out and test " ultra - high speed broadband networks " in various trial areas around the United States .
And they sound pretty darned ultra : one gigabit per second , fiber - to - the - home connections " at a competitive price " to cities and regions of 50,000 to ten times that many people .
Portland says if you build it , we will download .
But beyond that , why should Google choose that rainy northwestern city where people prefer to rust rather than tan ?
Here are some answers the RFP gives .
First , hardcore telecommuters , Portlanders like to work at home , or " over Wi-Fi in coffee shops , or in co-working spaces , " the RFP notes .
In fact , " nine Portlanders telecommute for every one who commutes by light rail . "
Plus it 's a small business city — within Multnomah County , three out of four businesses have ten employees or less .
Next , Portlanders are huge long - term planners of the green variety .
This was the first city to embrace a plan for global warming , the document adds .
Its emissions levels have dropped 14 percent while national emissions continue to go up .
The town already serves as a test site for sensor nets , telemedicine , and advanced geolocation services .
And Portland " was the first government in the nation to endorse ' open access ' requirement to then - emerging broadband Internet platforms , " doing so back in December of 1998 .
Google 's project , it should be noted , will be open access — letting users choose from a variety of ISPs .
Finally , Mr. Linux himself , Linus Torvalds , lives in Portland , as does wiki inventor Ward Cunningham .
This all sounds pretty competitive to us ( we , of course , are n't making the decision ) .
Applicants had until March 26 to make their move ; as cities now reveal their applications , everyone else can see what they are up against .
Google may take until the end of this year to make its decision .
One of the things that happens major political parties and major media figures indulge in naked fearmongering is that -- surprise ! -- a lot of people get fearful .
Really fearful .
Some of them become downright paranoid , and start believing in all kinds of looming conspiracies against them .
Which means you wind up with outfits like the Oath Keepers , who clearly are one of the major " Patriot " groups leading the recent surge in Patriot movement activity .
You can watch Stewart Rhodes , the Oath Keepers ' leader , at the recent CPAC conference being interviewed by the ever - friendly Bill Whittle and come away with the impression that , gosh , these are just folks who want to uphold the Constitution and apple pie .
Paranoid , us ?
As with all Patriot groups and their leaders , that 's the schtick when the cameras are on .
When the mask comes off , it becomes quite a different picture .
That 's clear from reading Justine Sharrock 's in - depth piece on the Oath Keepers for Mother Jones , a must - read .
[ Full disclosure : I am quoted in several places in this article . ]
As Sharrock makes clear , one of the more disturbing aspects of this group is that it has the effect of radicalizing the very people who are supposed to be upholding the law and protecting us from violent extremists :
There are scores of patriot groups , but what makes Oath Keepers unique is that its core membership consists of men and women in uniform , including soldiers , police , and veterans .
At regular ceremonies in every state , members reaffirm their official oaths of service , pledging to protect the Constitution — but then they go a step further , vowing to disobey " unconstitutional " orders from what they view as an increasingly tyrannical government .
Moreover , recruiting from military and police veterans increases exponentially the lethal competence of these extremists .
As we observed back in our first post on the Oath Keepers :
This is an example of why I 've called the Iraq War " the Timothy McVeigh Finishing School " :
Inevitably , there are going to be competent killers either joining the far right from our military ranks -- especially if they 've been recruited into those beliefs either before or during their service -- or enacting far - right " lone wolf scenarios , " and they are going to have the ability to wreak a great deal of havoc .
...
Remember , too , that there have already been concerns raised about concerns raised then by the FBI hold true in this situation as well : Military experience — ranging from failure at basic training to success in special operations forces — is found throughout the white supremacist extremist movement .
FBI reporting indicates extremist leaders have historically favored recruiting active and former military personnel for their knowledge of firearms , explosives , and tactical skills and their access to weapons and intelligence in preparation for an anticipated war against the federal government , Jews , and people of color .
...
The prestige which the extremist movement bestows upon members with military experience grants them the potential for influence beyond their numbers .
Most extremist groups have some members with military experience , and those with military experience often hold positions of authority within the groups to which they belong .
...
Military experience — often regardless of its length or type — distinguishes one within the extremist movement .
While those with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists , FBI investigations indicate they frequently have higher profiles within the movement , including recruitment and leadership roles .
Rhodes and Whittle are eager to portray the core of the Oath Keepers ' creeds -- the " ten orders " they " will not obey " -- as involving merely ordinary rights that everyone naturally would stand up for , and in a way , that 's true .
But only deeply paranoid people would believe there is any reason to be concerned that these rights violations might be looming .
Here they are :
1 . We will NOT obey any order to disarm the American people .
2 . We will NOT obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people .
3 . We will NOT obey orders to detain American citizens as “ unlawful enemy combatants ” or to subject them to military tribunal .
4 . We will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a “ state of emergency ” on a state .
5 . We will NOT obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty .
6 . We will NOT obey any order to blockade American cities , thus turning them into giant concentration camps .
7 . We will NOT obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext .
8 . We will NOT obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to “ keep the peace ” or to “ maintain control . "
9 . We will NOT obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people , including food and other essential supplies .
10 .
We will NOT obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech , to peaceably assemble , and to petition their government for a redress of grievances .
It seems not to occur to Whittle to ask how many people believe the government is about to cordon off our cities and turn them into concentration camps .
Evidently , because he too shares that fear .
It 's widespread among the Oath Keepers , as Sharrock makes clear -- and highly selective .
That is , it 's relegated largely to liberal Democratic presidents , because Republicans are people they can trust :
Pray ( who asked me to use his middle name rather than his first ) and five fellow soldiers based at Fort Drum take this directive very seriously .
In the belief that the government is already turning on its citizens , they are recruiting military buddies , stashing weapons , running drills , and outlining a plan of action .
For years , they say , police and military have trained side by side in local anti-terrorism exercises around the nation .
In September 2008 , the Army began training the 3rd Infantry 's 1st Brigade Combat Team to provide humanitarian aid following a domestic disaster or terror attack — and to help with crowd control and civil unrest if need be .
( The ACLU has expressed concern about this deployment . )
And some of Pray 's comrades were guinea pigs for military - grade sonic weapons , only to see them used by Pittsburgh police against protesters last fall .
Most of the men's gripes revolve around policies that began under President Bush but did n't scare them so much at the time .
" Too many conservatives relied on Bush 's character and did n't pay attention , " founder Rhodes told me .
" Only now , with Obama , do they worry and see what has been done .
I trusted Bush to only go after the terrorists .
But what do you think can happen down the road when they say , ' I think you are a threat to the nation ? ' "
In Pray 's estimate , it might not be long ( months , perhaps a year ) before President Obama finds some pretext — a pandemic , a natural disaster , a terror attack — to impose martial law , ban interstate travel , and begin detaining citizens en masse .
One of his fellow Oath Keepers , a former infantryman , advised me to prepare a " bug out " bag with 39 items including gas masks , ammo , and water purification tablets , so that I 'd be ready to go " when the shit hits the fan . "
And yes , they 're closely enmeshed with the Tea Party movement now :
Oath Keepers collaborates regularly with like - minded citizens groups ; last Fourth of July , Rhodes dispatched speakers to administer the oath at more than 30 Tea Party rallies across America .
At last fall 's 9/12 march on Washington , he led a contingent of Oath Keepers from the Capitol steps down to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial .
Afterward , Oath Keepers cohosted a banquet with the hawkish Gathering of Eagles .
This February , a member of the group organized a Florida Freedom Rally featuring Joe the Plumber and conservative singer Lloyd Marcus .
( Sample lyrics : Mr. President !
Your stimulus is sure to bust / it 's just a socialistic scheme /
The only thing it will do / is kill the American Dream . )
And the paranoia knows few limits , as all kinds of conspiracy theories are encouraged :
Oath Keepers is officially nonpartisan , in part to make it easier for active - duty soldiers to participate , but its rightward bent is undeniable , and liberals are viewed with suspicion .
At lunch , when I questioned my tablemates about the Obama - Hitler comparisons I 'd heard at the conference , I got a step - by - step tutorial on how the president 's socialized medicine agenda would beget a Nazi - style regime .
I learned that bringing guns to Tea Party protests was a reminder of our constitutional rights , was introduced to the notion that the founding fathers modeled their governing documents on the Bible , and debated whether being Muslim meant an inability to believe in and abide by — and thus be protected by — the Constitution .
I was schooled on the treachery of the Federal Reserve and why America needs a gold standard , and at dinner one night , Nighta Davis , national organizer for the National 912 Project , explained how abortion - rights advocates are part of a eugenics program targeting Christians .
It 's a long piece , but essential reading .
Here are some notes from today ’s practice :
After returning from the Olympic break , Devils coach Jacques Lemaire decided to move captain Jamie Langenbrunner to the front of the net during the powerplay , where Ron Wilson used the captain .
The new position worked last night , as Langenbrunner ’s screen led to a Paul Martin powerplay goal .
Even during the Olympics , Langenbrunner ’s presence in front of the net helped lead to offensive chances , including Zach Parise ’s game - tying goal in the gold medal game .
The change does n’t entirely effect Langenbrunner , who said “ it does n’t matter ” to him whether he plays the point or in front during the powerplay .
“ It ’s a change for me from where I was playing before , but if it helps then I ’m all for it , ” he said to Tom Gulitti of the Bergen Record .
Before the change , Langenbrunner manned the point on the man advantage .
During 5 - on - 3 opportunities , he ’d sometimes come down and play in front of the net .
But it seems Lemaire will continue to use Langenbrunner in front of the net .
The Devils spent nearly 2/3 of their practice on the powerplay despite scoring three goals with the man advantage last night .
Many of the players believe the practice will help to reinforce the success they had on the powerplay .
***************
After practicing the powerplay , the team resumed 5 - on - 5 practice .
There were a few changes to the line , but the biggest came with David Clarkson moving to the second line with Ilya Kovalchuk and Travis Zajac .
Brian Rolston manned the right wing last night , but recorded no shots on goal and was virtually invisible in the team ’s victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets .
Clarkson , who has spent most of his time on the third line , has nine goals and 11 assists in 36 games .
Clarkson , however , did n’t read too much into today ’s practice .
“ It would be exciting , ” he said to Gulitti .
“ Wherever they feel I can help , I ’ll be I ’m sure , but I do n’t think that was anything more than being there on the power play . ”
I think Clarkson could do better on the third line than Rolston .
Mostly anybody on this roster will fit in better than Rolston .
We ’ll see if this line combination holds up tomorrow night .
Cleggs lays down his four tests for LibDem support if election ends in hung Parliament
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg today set out his four tests that Labour or the Tories will have to satisfy to win his support in the case of a hung Parliament .
Mr Clegg refused to say whether this party would lean towards Labour or the Conservatives if , as some polls predict , neither manage to secure an overall majority .
But he has listed ' four steps to fairness ' which will form his party 's initial demands if they are asked to back a minority government led by David Cameron or Gordon Brown .
The four are :
Reform of the tax system to lift four million people on £ 10,000 a year or less out of income tax altogether , financed by higher taxes for the rich ;
A ' pupil premium ' to target extra education spending at the most disadvantaged children ;
Moving to a greener economy less reliant on the financial sector ;
Voting reform for Westminster elections .
He also revealed that he would propose an immediate £ 10 billion payoff of national debt , funded by £ 15 billion in spending cuts .
The move aimed at calming fractious markets , which are already wobbling over the prospect of a hung Parliament , would be funded by £ 15 billion in spending cuts .
In a hung parliament , David Cameron or Gordon Brown would have to satisfy four tests set out by Nick Clegg before getting LibDem backing
Mr Clegg will formally unveil the four tests at his party 's spring conference in Birmingham tomorrow .
' If a party with no majority has the strongest mandate , we accept the principle that that party has the right to govern either on its own or to reach out to others , ' he told the Independent .
But he insisted ' no deals ' would be discussed with the other parties until after the votes are counted .
' We are not here to play games with other parties .
We are here to secure a big mandate for the big changes we want in Britain .
Once we know the lie of the land after the election , we have to work out the best way to do that , ' he said .
The clearest enunciation yet of how the LibDems will decide who to back came after Mr Clegg declared his admiration for Margaret Thatcher .
In an apparent bid to woo old school Tory voters he said his party 's economic policies were more in tune with Lady Thatcher 's than those of David Cameron .
Mr Clegg told the Spectator Magazine he was now grown up enough to see that Lady Thatcher had been right about many policies .
He said : ' I 'm 43 now .
I was at university at the height of the Thatcher revolution and I recognise now something I did not at the time : that her victory over a vested interest , the trade unions , was immensely significant .
' I do n't want to be churlish , that was an immensely important visceral battle for how Britain is governed . '
Iron Lady : Nick Clegg says he has realised Margaret Thatcher was right about many policies
He added : ' And what has now happened to the British economy ?
It has gone belly - up because , once again , we have allowed a vested interest [ the banking sector ] to run riot . '
Mr Clegg also compared the Lib Dems tax policies with those of former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson .
He said his party 's plans to lift anyone out of tax if they earned under £ 10,000 was a ' Lawson policy ' .
In an attack on Mr Cameron , Mr Clegg said : ' A real liberal believes in genuine competition , a genuine level playing field and he is unremittingly hostile to vested interests . '
Mr Clegg 's attempts to emulate the Tories will fuel suspicions in some quarters of his party that he is too Right Wing .
The Lib Dem leader has previously been accused of being a closet Conservative .
Senior Lib Dems believe they are more likely to win seats from Labour , rather than the Tories at the General Election .
But the third party knows it will struggle to hang on to some of its key seats in rural constituencies where there has been a Tory revival .
Mr Clegg also insisted only the Lib Dems were committed to tackling the deficit through solely spending cuts rather than tax rises - unlike the Conservatives .
' If you want the economy to grow , you must stimulate demand , ' he said .
Chinese girl getting cosmetic surgery to look like Jessica Alba to win her boyfriend back
21 year - old - girl Xiaoqing just ended a 1 year relationship with her boyfriend not long ago .
The reason was her boyfriend ’s strange obsession over American movie star Jessica Alba .
She could not take the fact he always dressed her up as Jessica Alba .
After the break up , Xiaoqing was in so much pain that she decided to have cosmetic surgery to look like Jessica Alba to win her boyfriend back .
Because of her tight budget , Xiaoqing did not have enough money to have the make - over , so she posted a post online ( on Tianya )
“ Cash reward offer , who can give me the make - over to have the most beautiful face in the world . ”
She also posted her picture , and hoped using the power of Internet to attract more attentions , and to attract cosmetic surgeons ’ attentions .
On the Internet , some people gave her advice , some people supported her , some people insulted her , some people questioned her , Xiaoqing ’s life has changed .
Reporter found Xiaoqing in a coffee shop on Wujiang road ( in Shanghai ) …
Translation of what she said in the video :
The first time when he saw me he thought I looked like Jessica Alba .
Because I use to have long hair except for the color the hair style looked very much like Jessica Alba’s .
He said you would look a lot better if you put makeup on .
During that time I put on makeup everyday .
He told me to sleep with makeup on at night , so I did , and he treated me very well .
He is from Hunan , a designer , born in 1981 , 7 years older than me .
Maybe I have a little bit of Electra complex .
I am from Wuhan Hubei , born in 1988 , working as customer service at an Internet company .
I got to know my ex-boyfriend in a classmate gathering .
The first time when I saw him , he was very gentle .
After we were together for two month , we lived together .
After I met him , I had no more feelings for anybody else , and would not fall in love with anyone else anymore .
Now I think about it , the only thing I can think of is how good he was to me ; I do n’t remember anything that he was not good to me .
Actually he was steady , he took care of me very well , but the only thing was he had an obsession .
Any places within his eye sight , if possible , to put up pictures of Jessica Alba , he would .
The reason we broke up is when we went out to see friends .
He put on a wig for me and directly asked me to go out .
People on the street saw me , all pointed at me and laughed , but he did n’t care .
I could not take it anymore .
There were many things I was not happy about that I suppressed inside for long time .
I stood there and stopped walking .
He turned around and looked at me .
I was crying .
After three and four minutes after , there were more and more people on the street watching .
Then he asked me what I wanted to do .
I took off the wig and the fake eye lashes and threw them on the ground .
I said I do n’t want to do anything , I just do n’t want to wear a wig to go outside .
He said it ’s fine if you really do n’t want to do it .
Then he said you think about it and left .
Then I went to his place and moved all my stuff out .
He never contacted me .
I contacted him .
It was the second day after I posted my post .
He said he was busy and would contact me later .
I just wanted to tell him I posted this post on the Internet , and many people are concerned about me , I wanted to get cosmetic surgery .
After we broke up , I was closed off .
I was just in bed and did not want to get off the bed and eat anything nor sleeping .
I was just crying .
Friends tried to advise me but it was no use .
My friends said , if you really can’t deal with it , then go ahead and get the plastic surgery to look like Jessica Alba .
Then when you go back to him , he will treat you better .
Or else it is no use even if you go back to him .
Finally I posted a post on the Internet asking for help .
I will have plastic surgery to look like Jessica Alba .
Then many people advised me and told me that I am stupid and foolish .
But I know they really cared about me .
I also thought about it for long time , and also thought about it for my mom .
She brought me up by herself , anything I am doing I should ask her for opinions .
I am not going to tell her .
I will tell my mom , but I will not tell her that I am getting plastic surgery for my boyfriend .
I think she is going to get hurt if I did .
My nose , eyes and my chin need to have surgery .
This is the preliminarily suggestion by the doctor .
Because I do n’t have any physical defects , the doctor hoped I would really think it through .
I think I am already an adult , should be able to take responsibilities for my actions .
I am having the huge hope and making this huge decision .
I am not going to think about the problems after the plastic surgery .
My hope of love is all depending on this make - over .
I am imagining this is going to be a beautiful thing .
After the make - over my boyfriend and I can be together and my mom will be ok , everything will be ok .
After I become like Jessica Alba , we will be happy together .
I do n’t care if he treats me like another person because Jessica is a very far away , but I am right next to him .
Maybe after my make - over , and he finds out that I did so much for him , I really love him , he would think I am the one that is worth him to love , not Jessica .
Then I think it will all be worth it .
He likes Jessica so much , if I successfully have the cosmetic surgery , I think he will continue to be with me .
If he decides to not be with me , I can only give up .
I did so much , and did whatever I could and took so much effort , if he is still the same , I will choose to give up .

Ceara Sturgis , a top student at Wesson Attendance Center in Mississipi , has been purged from the yearbook .
She attended the school for 12 years , but she 's also a lesbian , and so they made her an un-person .
" They did n't even put her name in it , " Sturgis ' mother Veronica Rodriguez said .
" I was so furious when she told me about it .
Ceara started crying and I told her to suck it up .
Is that not pathetic for them to do that ?
Yet again , they have crapped on her and made her feel alienated . "
Sturgis and her mother commissioned the Mississippi ACLU to protest officials '
October 2009 decision not to allow Sturgis ' photo to appear in the senior yearbook because she chose to wear a tuxedo instead of a dress .
The ACLU wrote an October letter demanding officials use Sturgis ' submitted photo in the yearbook , but Copiah County School District officials refused .
Rodriguez said she expected the yearbook to at least contain a reference to her daughter on the senior page .
What she discovered on Friday , when the yearbook came in , was that the school had refused to acknowledge her entirely .

WE all know that racists - especially South African ones - are white .
We also know that ending apartheid in South Africa in 1994 was a happy - ever - after story .
Now welcome to the brutal truth .
South Africa is sliding back into a new racial divide , perhaps even a new apartheid .
And this time most of the racists and thugs are black .
What 's more , it is also sliding into an anarchy so terrible that already almost 20,000 South Africans are murdered each year - a killing rate three times higher , pro rata , than Iraq's .
Have your say at Andrew 's blog
Between 1000 and 3000 of the dead were white farmers , who now number just 40,000 in a population of 47 million .
Eugene Terre ' Blanche became one of them two weeks ago , and for once this murder made our news , since he was the South African racist from central casting , leading the Afrikaner Resistance Movement and being farewelled with Nazi salutes .
Police even said he'd been killed by black workers he had n't paid .
Bastard .
This week that story changed .
Now it was leaked that he'd been killed while apparently trying to sodomise a boy .
This seemed an attempt to discredit anyone who'd point to his death as a sign of something more troubling than the deserved death of a creep .
Yet it 's significant that just two days before Terre ' Blanche 's killing , the leader of the ruling African National Congress 's youth wing , Julius Malema , performed at a rally the infamous apartheid anthem Shoot the Boer .
" Kill the Boer , kill the farmer , " he cried , along with many hundreds of supporters .
" Shoot to kill . "
Malema is the protege of President Jacob Zuma , but his six million members give him a power base of his own .
This seems to have allowed this badly educated 28 - year - old , who says he hates " whiteness " , to get his hands on a lot of wealth , including two houses , cars and a Breitling watch .
He 's also grown powerful enough to allegedly threaten Cabinet minister Jeremy Cronin , a white Communist : " Wait to see what 's coming to you . "
And last week he visited bankrupted Zimbabwe , which he loudly praised for having seized white farms and reached for foreign - owned mines .
" In South Africa , we are just starting .
Here you are already very far . "
All this might be dismissed as the ravings of a pet fool , and , indeed , Zuma this week told him to shut up .
He was scaring investors and panicking the country 's five million whites , who not only grow most of the country 's food , but pay most of the taxes that keep 13 million workless blacks going .
But the respected South African Institute for Race Relations , which fought apartheid , this week warned of worse than Malema .
Racial tensions were fast worsening , it said , " chiefly as a result of incitement by the ( ANC ) to ' shoot and kill ' the Afrikaner ethnic minority " .
This seemed to be a deliberate tactic , it suggested .
The ANC had largely failed to ease black poverty , while its leaders used their power to get rich themselves .
Violent protests against the ANC by poor blacks were now " commonplace " , and " in order to shore up support in the black community , the ANC increasingly appears to be seeking to shift the blame for its delivery failures on to the small white ethnic minority ... "
Stoking racism to keep power can be a murderous game , one which may soon play out catastrophically in the land of Nelson Mandela .
Already many whites are leaving , especially Jews .
They 've seen this kind of thing before .

Valve has stopped with the teasing and has officially announced that its online gaming service Steam is coming to the Mac .
As a bonus , the company also plans to make the Mac a " tier - 1 " platform , promising simultaneous release of games on Mac OS X , Windows , and Xbox 360 .
Valve has developed a Mac-native version of its Source engine , using the cross-platform OpenGL .
" We looked at a variety of methods to get our games onto the Mac and in the end decided to go with native versions rather than emulation , " John Cook , Director of Steam Development , said in a statement .
" The inclusion of WebKit into Steam , and of OpenGL into Source gives us a lot of flexibility in how we move these technologies forward . "
Beginning in April , Mac users will be able to access games via Steam , including Left 4 Dead 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Counter - Strike , Portal , and the Half - Life series .
The Mac Steam client is based on the latest version for Windows that is currently in beta , which is where the first hints of Mac OS X compatibility were discovered .
That version includes a new Steam Play API that will allow users to access and play games from either a Windows PC or a Mac .
Progress on one platform is automatically updated and synced when using the other , meaning all the fragging you do on your work PC ( on your lunch break , of course ) will be reflected when you log in from your Mac at home .
Playing games on either platform wo n't cost extra .
The Mac compatibility extends beyond Steam Play , however .
All future games , beginning with Portal 2 , will be available for the Mac the same day as the Windows version .
" We are treating the Mac as a tier - 1 platform so all of our future games will release simultaneously on Windows , Mac , and the Xbox 360 , " Cook said .
Players on all platforms will be able to play each other in online multiplayer setups , as well .
" We fully support a heterogeneous mix of servers and clients . "
These announcements are surely music to Mac gamers ' ears .
Besides Steam and Valve 's own titles , making Source cross-platform also means other developers using Valve 's engine can easily create Mac - compatible versions of games without much additional effort .
All those Android smartphone owners who have been wondering when they can ditch the outmoded Opera Mini 4.2 browser in favor of the latest beta can now unfold their pouts , stop that kicking , and remove their pounding fists from the floor .
Opera Mini 5 beta for Android has arrived .
On Thursday , Opera Software pushed out the Android version of its Mini 5 browser that improves the browser experience for Java phones by leaps and bounds .
The beta build is equipped with an updated interface that includes a new " speed dial " start screen featuring thumbnails of most - visited sites .
The browser also supports tabs , a first for Mini but old hat on Opera Mobile .
Opera Mini 5 beta ( beta 2 , actually ) and the nearly identical Opera Mobile 10 beta ( for Symbian and Windows phones ) have been making the mobile rounds since September .
We 're fans of the latest advances to come to the free browser , and we 're looking forward to Opera making those changes final and retiring Opera Mini 4.2 ( and Opera Mobile 9.6 , while they 're at it . )
We just wish that Opera had submitted Mini 5 beta to the Android Market sooner .
Opera Software
There 's no confirmation from Opera , but we 're speculating that Opera could officially flip the switch on at least one of the Opera Mini 5 variants at the CTIA trade show later in March .
To download Opera Mini 5 beta for Android , check the Android Market from your smartphone or point to mobile browser to www.opera.com/mini/next/.
There 's a new leech king of the jungle .
The new species — dubbed Tyrannobdella rex , or " tyrant leech king " — was discovered in the remote Peruvian Amazon , according to a new study .
Puzzling scientists from the start , the up - to - three - inch - long ( about seven - centimeter - long ) bloodsucker has large teeth , like its dinosaur namesake Tyrannosaurus rex .
The T. rex leech uses its teeth to saw into the tissues of mammals ' orifices , including eyes , urethras , rectums , and vaginas .
What 's more , the newfound critter 's " naughty bits are rather small , " said study co-author Mark Siddall , curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City .
Most leech genitalia account for large proportions of their bodies , which " makes sense , because your reproductive success is important , " he said .
But for a reason still unknown , the new species ' genitalia are only about half a millimeter long — smaller than their nerve cords and only a tenth the size of most leech privates .
" We did n't say the large teeth were compensating for that , but it did come to mind , " he quipped .
T. Rex Leech Shakes Up Family Tree
The leech was first recognized from a specimen plucked from the nose of a girl in Peru 's central Chanchamayo Province in 2007 .
A local doctor sent the specimen to Siddall and colleagues , who were unable to place the toothy predator into established leech families .
After two years of field research , the team discovered the leech belongs to a globally scattered group of leeches that all suck on mammalian mucus membranes , according to the study , published April 14 in the online journal PLoS One .
This relationship , which shakes up the leech family tree , suggests that the mammal - loving leeches ' common ancestor probably lived during the late Jurassic period ( 199.6 million to 145.5 million years ago ) , when the continents were lumped together into a single landmass called Pangaea .
Although the T. rex leech — which people encounter while swimming in rivers and lakes — usually is n't deadly , it can stay in a person 's body forweeks , and could cause choking , Siddall said .
T. Rex Leech May Save Lives
Ironically , the ferocious leech may one day help people .
Siddall and his team study leeches to develop anticoagulants — treatments that stop patients ' blood from clotting .
Medicinal leeches have been used for more than a century for various medical therapies .
Finding a new leech helps scientists better understand the molecules that make leech saliva so beneficial .
The discovery of the presumably rare leech also highlights how species can be lost to the " incredible threat " that is Amazon deforestation , Siddall noted .

When Dan Clowes went to Hollywood and started making movies with Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi I wondered if he would ever do another serious graphic novel again .
Its been a decade since David Boring came out in book form !
But this week Drawn and Quarterly release the full length graphic novel Wilson .
It was worth the wait .
( click on images for larger size )
Wilson is an odd bird .
He tries to befriend stranger after stranger in coffee shops and bars , and later in prison - but he really does n't like anybody .
Mostly he just talks to himself .
Its a sort of introspective misanthropy .
Clowes draws Wilson in a variety of styles , but Wilson 's awkwardness and our discomfort remains constant .
The individual pages are all moments of one epic pathetic story .
After his father dies Wilson sets out to find his ex-wife ( who now has the tattoo " Property of Sir D.A.D.D.Y. Big - Dick " on her back ) .
They hunt down their teenage daughter , born after the marriage ended and given up for adoption .
Wilson believes they can make it as a family .
Huh .
Check out the D&Q blog for the Clowes tour dates ( he will be at the STRAND next Wednesday .
So what is masculinity , anyway – a hairy chest and the ability to change the oil in your car yourself ?
Being congenitally unable to ask for directions when lost ?
Can you be “ too masculine ? ”
Is being a top somehow more masculine than being a bottom ?
Gay men have an ambivalent attitude towards masculinity .
The word comes up all the time in personal ads – you know , “ masculine guy seeks same . ”
We often equate masculine with sexy .
At the same time , many gay men privately worry they are somehow deficient in the manliness department , no matter how much time they spend at the gym .
One of the ways homophobes misunderstand gay men is in assuming we secretly want to be women .
Gay men sometimes respond with camp humor , calling one another “ girl ” or “ she . ”
This is a funny way of defusing hate directed toward us , but it can cause us to become confused in relation to how we feel about being men .
Growing up , gay boys are sometimes taunted with words like “ sissy , ” that imply they are deficient in the masculinity department .
Many of the images of gay men in the media are unmanly in way that ’s supposed to be funny – La Cage aux Folles , Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .
Small wonder that one of the things that so upset the ‘ phobes about Brokeback Mountain was the image of two virile men with their lips locked on one another .
More than one right wing critic has speculated that John Wayne must have been spinning in his grave .
What characteristics do you associate with the word masculine ?
It ’s easy to over - generalize about gender roles , but it ’s clear that some qualities are positive and some are negative .
On the plus side , being masculine is often associated with strength and competence , as well as secondary sexual characteristics like big muscles and lots of body hair .
On the negative side , manly men often seem over - aggressive , stubborn , close - minded … perhaps not too bright .
Since gay men are attracted to other men – duh – a certain amount of testosterone is inherently attractive to gay guys .
A gay man is a man ’s man !
Not a problem unless we fetishize hyper- masculinity .
Many of the qualities that lead us to see a man as manly may make him a great sexual fantasy , but a questionable candidate for a flesh - and - blood relationship .
Successful relationships typically require an ability to empathize or support your partner when he needs it – qualities that are more often associated with women than lumberjacks or fighter pilots .
Sometimes our first choice for a sweaty fantasy is n’t our best choice for a partner .
We gay men wound ourselves when we learn to think of masculinity as something that resides outside of our own selves when we see other men as masculine , but not our selves .
This is more likely to happen when our view of masculinity has become too narrow and too focused on physical parts ( the size of this or the amount of that ) .
A broader sense of what it means to be a man can allow us to cultivate other masculine qualities in ourselves : the ability to take action , for instance , to master tasks that are important to us ( regardless of whether that task is changing a tire or cooking a fabulous coq au vin ) , to pay at least as much attention to developing our inner strength as to inflating our pecs .
Men are sometimes advised to get in touch with their “ inner feminine . ”
Maybe gay men need to get in touch with their “ inner masculine ” instead .
Identifying those aspects of being a man we most value and then cultivate those parts of our selves can lead to a healthier and less distorted sense of our own masculinity .

Like a videogame mix of Dungeons & Dragons and improv comedy , an innovative new indie game lets players create their own plots on the fly .
Sleep
Is Death , a multiplayer storytelling game released Tuesday , was developed by Jason Rohrer .
He 's the man behind 2007's intriguing Passage , a five - minute exploration of life that Wired.com columnist Clive Thompson called more poem than game .
Rohrer 's latest creation lets two players improvise a story over the internet , pairing constantly evolving story lines with crude graphics and comic book - style speech and thought bubbles .
It can be hard to get the hang of at first , but the trade - off is a game that lets players have more control over their story than almost any other game allows .
Here 's how Sleep Is Death works :
One person takes the role of " controller , " who steers the story and creates the assets the story will use .
The other person , known as the " player , " can either go along with the story the controller has set up or try to subvert it to their own intentions .
The controller and the player take turns performing their actions , with each having a 30 - second time limit per turn .
Game|Life writer Gus Mastrapa and I took the game for a spin and crafted a few stories of our own .
In the spirit of Sleep Is Death , we took alternating turns expressing our thoughts and observations about the new game – sans the time limit , of course .
Gus Mastrapa : Jump into a game of Sleep Is Death cold and you 'll feel totally out of sorts .
The controller is faced with a fairly complex tool set that allows them to change the scenery , add props and characters , and change the background music .
Dig deeper and those tools allow for all these details to be edited and saved .
But all this power is little consolation when you 've got a timer ticking and an impatient gamer on the other end of the line waiting for their turn to contribute to the story .
John Mix Meyer : Sleep
Is Death 's controller interface is a tough nut to crack .
Your first session as a controller ( and your second , and your third , and your fourth ... ) will have you fumbling with the mouse , looking for which one of the vague , illustrated icons will do what you want .
The game 's website features several tutorial videos ( the first one is embedded above ) , but having to view almost an hour 's worth of clips before you can fully understand the game is n't very appealing .
Mastrapa :
But that 's no different than Dungeons & Dragons , really .
You 've got to read a manual or two to really get up to speed with any tabletop role - playing game .
Heck , lots of indie games ( Dwarf Fortress comes to mind ) require a major time investment before getting started .
But even without much preparation , it 's easy to see the appeal of Sleep Is Death .
The game allows two players ( one with slightly more power ) to riff back and forth with quite a bit of freedom .
Meyer :
That 's true .
I think a lot of Sleep Is Death 's appeal , at least for me , comes from the fact that you do n't need to play by any rules .
There is n't any pre-established lore , as is the case in Dungeons & Dragons .
I really enjoy the fact that the two players are left entirely to their own devices to come up with a wholly original story .
Some players will be content to just crib plots off episodes of NCIS ( and that 's cool , too ) , but there 's also nothing stopping anyone from going completely hog - wild with their story ideas .
Mastrapa :
There is one rule in Sleep Is Death :
The one that forces player and controller to take turns .
It 's what , I believe , makes this a game and not merely a storytelling tool that borrows sprites from the visual language of videogames .
And , interestingly , you can change that one rule .
During our play sessions , we found that the time limit was going by too fast for us to make our moves , so we changed a value in a simple text file to give us 30 more seconds to take our turns .
Meyer : Exactly .
The implementation of turns transforms the game into something resembling an improv comedy show .
In fact , the strict time limit makes for some pretty funny stories more often than not .
It 's kinda like Whose Line Is It Anyway ? in videogame form .
Rather apt considering the segments in the TV show are called " games . "
Mastrapa :
If the notion of videogame improv sends chills down your spine , you 're probably not going to uncover a masterly told tale created with Sleep Is Death .
A gallery of recent stories at Sidtube paints a pretty good picture of the kind of scenarios that unravel while playing the game .
Many are filled with vulgar non sequiturs and quite silly .
Come to think of it , they 're not all that different from the stories in most videogames .
Meyer : I think one of the most unique things , and possibly my favorite thing , about the game is the amount of control the player has .
Provided the controller is willing to play along , the player has the power to steer the entire story around in a direction the controller never saw coming .
Being able , as a player , to beat the storyteller at his own game is something that is completely absent in most videogames and it's something that Sleep Is Death is all the better for .

The early reviews for the iPad are in , and they 're certainly going to make Steve Jobs happy .
Apple handed out iPads to a few select publications a couple of days early , and the critical consensus is overwhelmingly positive .
The usual reviewers from The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , USA Today , as well as a few surprising newcomers to the Apple early reviews circuit , all praised the iPad for its epically long battery life ( more than 12 hours ) , impressive speed and beautiful touchscreen .
Priced between $ 500 and $ 830 , the iPad is hitting stores Saturday .
Excerpts from the eight early reviews are as follows :
Walt Mossberg , The Wall Street Journal :
I believe this beautiful new touch - screen device from Apple has the potential to change portable computing profoundly , and to challenge the primacy of the laptop .
It could even help , eventually , to propel the finger - driven , multitouch user interface ahead of the mouse - driven interface that has prevailed for decades .
....
All in all , however , the iPad is an advance in making more - sophisticated computing possible via a simple touch interface on a slender , light device .
Only time will tell if it ’s a real challenger to the laptop and netbook .
David Pogue , The New York Times :
And the techies are right about another thing : the iPad is not a laptop .
It ’s not nearly as good for creating stuff .
On the other hand , it ’s infinitely more convenient for consuming it — books , music , video , photos , Web , e-mail and so on .
For most people , manipulating these digital materials directly by touching them is a completely new experience — and a deeply satisfying one .
Andy Inhatko , Chicago Sun Times :
In fact , after a week with the iPad , I ’m suddenly wondering if any other company is as committed to invention as Apple .
Has any other company ever demonstrated a restlessness to stray from the safe and proven , and actually invent things ?
Ed Baig , USA Today :
The first iPad is a winner .
It stacks up as a formidable electronic - reader rival for Amazon 's Kindle .
It gives portable game machines from Nintendo and Sony a run for their money .
At the very least , the iPad will likely drum up mass - market interest in tablet computing in ways that longtime tablet visionary and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates could only dream of .
Tim Gideon , PCMag.com :
Aside from Apple enthusiasts , many of us wondered who would drop hundreds of dollars for this not - quite - computer .
But having used the iPad for some time , I can tell you that the device just makes sense .
When you combine basic - but - essential work tools with iWork , an improved browser , e-mail , iPod , and photo applications , a well - executed e-Book platform with iBooks , and throw in thousands of downloadable apps and games , and package it all in a gorgeous , slim slate with a beautiful 9.7 - inch touch screen , you have yourself a winner .
Bob LeVitus , Houston Chronicle :
It turns out the iPad is n't as much a laptop replacement as I thought ( though it could easily be used as one ) .
Instead , it 's an entirely new category of mobile device .
For example , now when I want to surf the Web from the couch or back deck , the iPad is the device I choose .
Starbucks ?
Same thing .
Think of the iPad as a new arrow in your technology quiver , an arrow that will often be the best tool for a given task .
Xeni Jardin , Boing Boing :
Just as the iPhone , Palm Pré and Android phones scratched an itch we did n't know we had — somewhere between cellphone and notebook — the iPad hits a completely new pleasure spot .
The display is large enough to make the experience of apps and games on smaller screens stale .
Typography is crisp , images gem - like , and the speed brisk thanks to Apple 's A4 chip and solid state storage .
As I browse early release iPad apps , web pages , and flip through the iBook store and books , the thought hits that this is a greater leap into a new user experience than the sum of its parts suggests .
Omar Wasow , TheRoot.com :
The techie obsession with specs and obscure features completely misses how most consumers will actually use the iPad .
A small percentage of power users will be disappointed that the iPad does n't , say , have an HDMI video - out port or that it currently lacks the ability to run multiple applications simultaneously or that it fails to address some other esoteric concern .
The rest of us ( even most techies ) will be thrilled that doing what we want to do on the iPad is generally effortless .

Government appeals currency redesign WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
An effort to force a redesign of the nation 's currency so paper money could be more easily used by the blind would be too expensive and could cause undue hardships on the vending machine industry , the Bush administration says .
The administration asked an appeals court on Tuesday to overturn a ruling that could require the introduction of such features as Braille lettering , micro-perforations or varying the sizes of denominations to aid the blind and visually impaired .
Justice Department attorneys representing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson filed the appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , asking that a Nov. 28 decision by U.S. District Judge James Robertson be overturned .
Robertson ruled that the nation 's currency as currently designed violates the Rehabilitation Act , a law that prohibits discrimination in government programs on the basis of disability .
Robertson ordered Treasury to come up with ways for the blind to recognize the different denominations of paper currency , finding in favor of a lawsuit brought by the American Council for the Blind , which has waged a four - year court battle over the issue .
In his ruling , Robertson had said the United States was the only nation out of 180 issuing paper currency that printed bills that were identical in size and color in all their denominations .
He cited the successful use of such features as varying sizes , raised lettering and tiny perforations used by other nations as evidence such changes were feasible .
But in their petition to the appeals court , government lawyers argued that varying the size of denominations could cause significant burdens on the vending machine industry and cost the Bureau of Engraving and Printing an initial investment of $ 178 million and $ 37 million to $ 50 million in new printing plates .
" Even placing these figures in the context of the $ 420 million the BEP has spent annually on average in producing currency over the last 10 years , the additional costs proposed to modify the currency are not easily dismissed , " the government argued in its petition to the appeals court .
The government lawyers also argued that blind people were not being denied " meaningful access " to currency transactions because there were portable readers that could identify denominations and they also could use credit cards for transactions rather than cash .
Jeffrey Lovitky , an attorney for the American Council of the Blind , said he would ask the appeals court to reject the government 's arguments and allow the case to go forward with a January hearing where the government is scheduled to provide testimony to aid Robertson in deciding what remedies should be adopted .
Christopher Gray , president of the council , said that while his group has been lobbying for changes to help the blind since 1995 , the government has yet to conduct any feasibility studies of what those changes might cost and has instead moved ahead with a number of design changes to thwart counterfeiters .
" We would be happy to wait until the next change in the bills and build accessibility in at that time , " Gray said .
" Surely , if you did it that way , the costs can't be anything like what is being claimed by Treasury . "
Tara Cortes , president of Lighthouse International , another advocacy group for the blind , said the government 's decision to fight making changes in the currency could end up being harmful to millions of Americans .
There are 1.3 million people in the United States currently who are legally blind , but it is estimated that number will double by 2030 and millions more will have vision problems as the baby boom generation ages and more people fall victim to macular degeneration and other diseases , such as diabetes , that can affect vision .
" While the government may argue that changing the dollar bill will cost billions , it will pale in comparison to the costs of the vision loss epidemic , " Cortes said .

Windows 7 supports an astounding number of legacy printer drivers , but the process may require a few extra clicks .
You can even share an old printer on your home network through HomeGroup .
Justin Korelc and Ed Tittel share their experience with Windows 7 and a 20 - year - old workhorse .

Backward compatibility would be unnecessary were it not for the staggering amount of outdated ( but not necessarily obsolete ) computer equipment still in use .
Not everyone has the luxury of upgrading or replacing aging hardware , and some simply lack the impetus to displace " perfectly good " old equipment with newer stuff .
Recognizing that many users still expect to run their ancient artifacts hooked up to modern PCs , Microsoft supports surprisingly deep catalogs of legacy drivers .
So , for those of you who can't give up your legacy printers just yet , you 're in luck when you pick up or migrate to Windows 7 .
Making the Legacy Last
Case in point : I have an HP LaserJet 4 still kicking around the office .
The HP LJ4 series was manufactured in the era of Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11 and then discontinued in the late 1990s .
I acquired my unit way back in 1993 .
To further verify its antiquity , this HP LJ4 sports a Centronics parallel interface ( along with a 25 - pin parallel port ) .
If you 're not familiar with the Centronics connector , that 's because it 's a one - hit de facto standard that retired in the 1990s in favor of parallel connections , now being nudged out by USB connections in contemporary gear ( PCs and printers ) .
My Windows 7 workstation has neither a Centronics nor a parallel port interface , so I was forced to use a Centronics - to - USB adapter ( retail price : $ 20 ) .
As a true representative of old - school computing , the LJ4 also produces a magnificent sound that resembles commercial jet turbines spinning up to taxi down the runway .
It 's nothing like the modernistic whirs and whinesor total silence of a more up - to - date printer during warm -up .
Despite its age , the LJ4 is still available online through resellers , and it remains a steady workhorse for small and medium - sized business environments .
Windows 7 includes a new Devices and Printers applet that displays icons for all the peripheral components connected to your PC .
The Devices and Printers applet allows you to view , utilize and troubleshoot those external physical devices .
Expect to find icons for displays , flash drives , keyboards , mice , battery backups , headsets , webcams , and ( of course ) printers located there .
What you wo n't find are devices that connect through any other means than ports or network interfaces .
At first , the only thing Devices and Printers reported about my new connection was a generic device listing labeled " IEEE - 1284 Controller " under the Unspecified category heading .
After clicking the information bar that appears at the top of the window pane ( see Figure 1 - 1 ) and allowing Devices and Printers to display enhanced icons and information from the Internet , the connection was correctly identified as an ATEN UC - 1284 Printer Cable yet still no printer !
You may have already noticed the Add a device and Add a printer buttons in the Devices and Printers applet : I selected Add a printer .
The Add Printer wizard appeared with drivers for a wealth of printer makes and models , but not mine .
Believing persistence would rule the day , I chose Add a local printer .
When prompted to select a printer port , I chose to use an existing port labeled USB001 ( Virtual printer port for USB ) and clicked Next .
Here 's where I encountered my second problem : there was apparently no driver listing for my legacy printer .
I knew there 'd be little chance of finding a Windows 7 driver for a Windows 3.1 printer from the manufacturer 's website , but fortunately for me , there was a Windows Update button on this wizard screen .
I clicked the button and waited .
After a moment of pulling older driver information from the Internet and scrolling through make and model listings , the HP LaserJet 4/4M PS driver appeared .
My proof is shown in Figure 1 - 2 .
I figured it would n’t show up , yet there it was , defying the odds .
After selecting the driver entry , I clicked Next and proceeded through the remaining Add Printer Wizard prompts , such as naming the printer and choosing to share it on the network .
Finally , the HP LaserJet 4 was specified as the default printer and , just to remove any doubt that this was a fluke , I successfully printed a test page .
I was excited for the trade deadline when I assumed the Leafs would receive a bag full of second round picks for their “ assets ” .
Thankfully , Brian Burke aims a little higher than that .
Pulling off the first trade is very impressive , especially in a cap world .
The Calgary Flames trade Dion Phaneuf , Fredrik Sjostrom ( pronounced shoe - strom ) , and prospect Keith Aulie to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Matt Stajan , Niklas Hagman , Ian White , and Jamal Mayers .
Wow .
First , anytime when you can add a player of Dion ’s calibre you have to like the trade .
Dion has fallen a little bit over the past two years ( 47 points and - 11 in 2008 - 2009 and 22 points and +3 so far this year ) after an absolutely monstrous 2007 - 2008 ( 17 goals , 60 points , +12 ) .
The addition of Jay Bouwmeester , combined with Phaneuf and Calgary ’s recent woes has made him expendable .
However , this is a 24 - year - old who has the potential to be a legitimate Norris Trophey candidate in his career ( especially now that the Lidstrom monopoly is about to end ) .
He throws devastating open ice hits ( although they sometimes leave him out of position ) and he has a cannon of a shot .
He adds a much - needed dimension to the Leafs powerplay that is very Kessel - centric at this point .
Teams now need to respect Phaneuf ’s shot on the powerplay , which will open plays for Kessel down low and off the boards .
He can also kill penalties .
I really like this addition by the Leafs .
If Phaneuf can bounce back and play at the high level that he is capable of then the Leafs have done extremely well today .
The only downside to this trade is that if the Leafs pair Pheneuf and Schenn then I do n’t think Pierre McGuire will be able to handle himself .
He might start masturbating on air .
Keith Aulie , the prospect in the deal , is more than just a throw in .
According to Hockey ’s Future , he ’s Calgary ’s 3rd ranked prospect ( behind Mikael Backlund and Greg Nemisz ) and was a fourth round selection in 2007 .
Canada also selected him for their 2009 World Junior Hockey Championship team and correct me if I ’m wrong , but I believe he was a part of the team ’s shutdown unit .
He ’s a big boy , standing at 6 ’ 6 and 208 lbs ( obviously needs to add some weight to that frame ) and is currently playing in the AHL .
In Burke ’s press conference he said that Aulie will be sent to the Marlies so he can log big minutes .
I think Aulie is a great part of the deal .
The other player is Fredrik Sjostrom and seems like a throw - in .
Burke says they wanted him and he can really help their penalty kill .
Sure , why not .
When your penalty kill operates at less than 70 % efficiency then pretty much anyone can help it .
I guess the Leafs also get Elisha Cuthburt thrown into the deal .
What I really like about this deal is that the Leafs did n’t have to sacrifice much for the players they received .
Although , in reality , I would willingly trade almost anyone on the roster not named Kessel , Schenn , Bozak , Stalberg , Monster , or Kadri .
Stajan , a UFA at season ’s end , was definitely going to be traded and I thought his return would be a 2nd round pick .
Mayers did n’t actually want to play here anymore and his return would have been a very low round pick or a bag of old pucks ( maybe some new ) .
These players were already off the roster in my mind .
The two more significant pieces of the deal , White and Hagman , were players I thought would be around for a little longer .
I 'm sad White is going because he 's been my favourite Leaf this year .
He has been the Leafs most consistent player this year , but was going to be a RFA at season ’s end and maybe Burke found out his price was too rich for the Leafs .
Hagman 's deal is for two more years at a modest $ 3 million and looks like a consistent 20 - 30 goal scorer that works hard and has some moves .
But really , this Leafs team is so bad that almost the entire forward group is replaceable with Marlies .
It ca n't be much worse .
They ’re in 29th for a reason , it ’s not like the departure of these four players will torpedo the season .
Although what the Leafs sacrificed was n’t very much , what the Flames gain is actually quite significant ( if that makes sense ) .
There is something seriously wrong in Calgary and they desperately needed to make a deal .
The main problem with Calgary is a lack of depth surrounding Jarome Iginla .
On too many nights the burden to create offense falls on Iginla ( similar to Kessel in Toronto ) .
Jokinen was supposed to alleviate this pressure , but he looks absolutely lost in Calgary .
Stajan has shown an ability to play well anywhere from the first line to the third .
He probably settles in nicely as Calgary ’s third line centre , behind Jokinen and Langkow , a position he is better suited to .
Stajan works hard and has shown some grit that will go over well in Calgary .
Mayers did nothing in Toronto , but could become a useful fourth line player in Calgary .
Trading Phaneuf leaves an obvious hole on the Calgary blueline , but signing Bouwmeester in the offseason and having Robyn Regehr make it acceptable .
Adding
White to this group that also include Corey Sarich and Mark Giordano is a good fit .
White wo n’t be forced to play the excessive minutes he was in Toronto and can be an adequate replacement for Phaneuf on the powerplay .
Hagman was probably the key to this deal being done .
He will be an excellent compliment on Calgary ’s second line and gives their offense more balance .
I originally thought his 27 goals in Dallas were an aberration , but watching him play in Toronto makes it clear that he has the skills and the work ethic to consistently score around 25 goals in the NHL .
It ’s never fair to judge a trade upon its inception , but at this time it looks like it could work well for both teams .
Calgary gets the depth it sincerely needs ( plus some long - term cap relief ) and Toronto adds a potential star player that is still very young ( along with a decent prospect ) .
I think this trade makes Calgary a for sure playoff team and the Leafs make a major shakeup which was long overdue .
As if this blockbuster was n’t enough , Burke goes out and makes another deal .
I suggested the Leafs should take a look at J.S. Giguere and I guess Burke is an avid reader .
The Leafs trade Vesa Toskala and Jason Blake to the Anaheim Ducks for J.S. Giguere .
While the Calgary - Toronto trade was a pure hockey trade , this trade was strictly money related , with a little hockey element .
The Ducks get out from Giguere ’s $ 6 million salary , which is enormous for someone who they do n't play , and can now re-sign Bobby Ryan .
They save about $ 2 million in cap space next season ( about $ 4 million in real payroll ) .
I was following this trade on twitter and at first it looked like the Ducks were adding a first round pick to the deal .
I was ready to run around the neighbourhood like a lunatic .
Too good to be true .
Thankfully , the Leafs still unload Jason Blake , who has 2 more years left at $ 4 million while ridding Vesa Toskala who has become a shell of a goalie .
That was just the price of business for the Ducks who will play Jonas Hiller the majority of the games .
Toskala is a UFA at year ’s end , so there is no burden to the Ducks .
Maybe Blake can even re-find his scoring touch in a less intense market .
He certainly works hard enough , but never recovered in Toronto after his first dismal season .
Adding Giguere to the Leafs is n’t as much of a salary move as it may seem .
I think Giguere still has some good hockey left in him and with only one more season on his contract the deal is n’t too bad for the Leafs cap .
He can serve as a mentor to the Monster , convince him to fully buy into former Duck goalie coach Francois Allaire ’s goaltending system , and reduce the load of Gustavsson .
I think this can be a good goaltending tandem .
I ’ve always been a Giggy fan ever since he stonewalled the opposition during the Mighty Ducks Cup finals run in 2003 .
In terms of the salary cap , at the end of the day the Leafs shed close to $ 15 million and take on about $ 13.250 .
So they save a bit of money this year .
Add a lot next year .
With the likes of Ponikarovski , Stempniak , Exelby , and Kaberle still on the Leafs roster it ’s nice when I hear Brian Burke say , “ we ’re still open for business ” .
You 've started a business .
You 've built a great product .
Now you 're trying to get the word out .
You do n't have the budget to buy ads or to retain a PR agency .
You 'd like to hire a salesperson , but the experienced salespeople are smart enough not to work for you .
Well , there 's always blogging .
These days , it seems like just about every start - up founder has a blog , and 99 percent of these bloggers are doing it wrong .
The problem ?
They make the blog about themselves , filling it with posts announcing new hires , touting new products , and sharing pictures from the company picnic .
That 's lovely , darling -- I 'm sure your mom cares .
Too bad nobody else does .
Most company blogs have almost no readers , no traffic , and no impact on sales .
Over time , the updates become few and far between ( especially if responsibility for the blog is shared among several staff members ) , and the whole thing ceases to become an important source of leads or traffic .
There were far fewer blogs when I set up mine , Joel on Software , 10 years ago ( even before I started my company ) .
The site quickly became a popular hub for programmers who wanted to discuss all sorts of things -- how to write elegant code , how to deal with unreasonable deadlines , how to get paid more .
As the blog grew -- eventually , it surpassed one million unique visitors a month in traffic -- it also drove interest in my start - up , Fog Creek Software , and our products .
So , what 's the formula for a blog that actually generates leads , sales , and business success ?
I did n't even understand it myself until last year at the Business of Software conference , when one of the speakers , a well - known game developer and author named Kathy Sierra , blew me away with an incredibly simple idea that explains why my blog successfully promoted my company while so many other blogging founders foundered .
To really work , Sierra observed , an entrepreneur 's blog has to be about something bigger than his or her company and his or her product .
This sounds simple , but it is n't .
It takes real discipline to not talk about yourself and your company .
Blogging as a medium seems so personal , and often it is .
But when you 're using a blog to promote a business , that blog can't be about you , Sierra said .
It has to be about your readers , who will , it 's hoped , become your customers .
It has to be about making them awesome .
So , for example , if you 're selling a clever attachment to a camera that diffuses harsh flash light , do n't talk about the technical features or about your holiday sale ( 10 percent off ! ) .
Make a list of 10 tips for being a better photographer .
If you 're opening a restaurant , do n't blog about your menu .
Blog about great food .
You 'll attract foodies who do n't care about your restaurant yet .
If you make superior , single - source chocolate , do n't write about that great trip you took to the Dominican Republic to source cocoa beans .
That 's all about you .
Instead , write the definitive article about making chocolate - covered strawberries .
For the next 10 years , whenever a gourmand or a baker searches Google for a recipe on how to make chocolate - covered strawberries , he or she will find your post .
Helping your users make awesome chocolate - based confections is likely to attract readers who might buy fancy chocolate , and that 's the point of a successful blog .
Writing about trips to the Dominican Republic is going to attract only people who might want to travel to the Dominican Republic .
Unless you 're selling that , you should n't be blogging about it .
In retrospect , Joel on Software was essentially a small , perfectly targeted magazine for programmers with a certain pragmatic philosophy toward software development .
It was also free advertising for my company , but the advertising actually looked a lot more like editorial content than anything else ; the most popular post I ever wrote , for example , was about how technology companies should never , ever rewrite their code from scratch .
Once I had built an audience among programmers , enough of them turned into customers that I was able to get my bootstrapped company off the ground .
The audience was so precisely defined that products we tried to make that were n't specifically for programmers pretty much flopped .
They were great products , but they just were n't for programmers , and we did n't have a way to market them effectively to nonprogrammers .
Of course , blogging took a ton of my time :
It is a manual , labor - intensive , homemade way to reach customers .
All told , the work I 've put into the website and related books , training videos , conferences , and even this column has probably accounted for about a third of the total work I 've put into Fog Creek Software over the past decade .
That 's three or four years of my work life .
Was it worth it ?
Should you blog ?
Well , it worked brilliantly for me , but the more I 've looked around , the more I 've noticed that plenty of start - ups have managed to get customers and grow nicely without devoting a huge chunk of their early years to building a cool blog .
What 's more , I have trouble pointing to other successful entrepreneurs who have used the same formula and reaped the same dividends I have .
The big - hit technology companies from the past 10 years tend to have pathetic blogs .
Twitter 's blog , like Facebook 's and Google 's , is full of utterly boring press releases rewritten to sound a little bit less stuffy .
Apple 's employees produce virtually no blogs , even though the company has introduced several game - changing new products in the past decade .
Meanwhile , hundreds of Microsoft 's employees have amazing blogs , but these have done nothing to stave off that company 's slide into stodginess .
So , having become an Internet celebrity in the narrow , niche world of programming , I 've decided that it 's time to retire from blogging .
March 17 , the 10th anniversary of Joel on Software , will mark my last major post .
This also will be my last column for Inc .
For the most part , I will also quit podcasting and public speaking .
Twitter ?
" Awful , evil , must die , CB radio , sorry with only 140 chars I can't tell you why . "
The truth is , as much as I 've enjoyed it , blogging has become increasingly impossible to do the way I want to as Fog Creek has become a larger company .
We now have 32 employees and at least six substantial product lines .
We have so many customers that I can't always write freely without inadvertently insulting one of them .
And my daily duties now take so much time that it has become a major effort to post something thoughtful even once or twice a month .
The best evidence also suggests that there are many other effective ways to market Fog Creek 's products -- and that our historical overreliance on blogging as a marketing channel has meant that we 've ignored them .
I realize now that blogging made me , and Fog Creek , a big fish in a very small pond .
As a result , we have the undisputed No. 1 product among the 5 percent to 10 percent of programmers who regularly read blogs about programming .
Meanwhile , we 're almost unknown in every other demographic .
My hope is that giving up blogging and the rest of it will be the equivalent of making a cross-eyed kid wear an eye patch on his good eye for a while :
The weaker eye will grow stronger .
My company needs to get better at what every other company already knows -- how to promote and market products without depending on one single channel .
We 've completely saturated a small slice of the target market , and now we have to go after a much larger group of potential customers .
To my readers :
Thank you for your attention over the past 10 years .
I could n't have done it without you , and the nice e-mails , comments , tweets , and blog replies have made it a joyous journey .
I enjoyed meeting you virtually , and I look forward to meeting many of you in person in the next phase of my company 's life .

Faces were analysed and mapped with a computer programme
We already have iris and fingerprint scanning but noses could be an even better method of identification , says a study from the University of Bath , UK .
The researchers scanned noses in 3D and characterised them by tip , ridge profile and the nasion , or area between the eyes .
They found 6 main nose types : Roman , Greek , Nubian , hawk , snub and turn - up .
Since they are hard to conceal , the study says , noses would work well for identification in covert surveillance .
The researchers say noses have been overlooked in the growing field of biometrics , studies into ways of identifying distinguishing traits in people .
" Noses are prominent facial features and yet their use as a biometric has been largely unexplored , " said the University of Bath 's Dr Adrian Evans .
" Ears have been looked at in detail , eyes have been looked at in terms of iris recognition but the nose has been neglected . "
The researchers used a system called PhotoFace , developed by researchers at the University of the West of England , Bristol and Imperial College , London , for the 3D scans .
The face is modelled by computer so the nose can be analysed in detail Several measurements by which noses can be recognised were identified and the team developed recognition software based on these parameters .
" This initial work is nowhere as good as iris identification but the nose has pros and cons , " said Dr Evans .
" There 's no magic biometric that solves all your problems .
Irises are a powerful biometric but can be difficult to capture accurately and can be easily obscured by eyelids or glasses .
People can easily cover up their ears , with their hair for example .
" Of course you can have a broken nose or wear a false nose or have plastic surgery but to have nose surgery to change your identity is fairly drastic .
" Irises are very good for recognition but you can put in dilation drops which change the iris completely .
No technique is infallible , " he said .
The research is based on a study of 40 noses and the data base has now been expanded to 160 for further tests to see if the software can pick out people from a larger group and distinguish between relatives .
Dr Evans hopes the method can be proven to be effective on this larger sample .
" The technique certainly shows potential , perhaps to be used in combination with other identification methods , " he said .

If coffee tends to do a number on your stomach , but you love the brew too much to give it up , switch to a darker roast for less digestive woes and more cup - of - joe enjoyment .

Photo by eclectic echoes .
Scientists at the University of Vienna are conducting research on the effects of coffee in its various forms on the lining of the stomach and stomach acidity .
So far the results weigh strongly in favor of darker roasts causing less disruption of the stomach 's natural balance .
To explore the science behind these gentler brews , Somoza and her colleagues used water and three other solvents to extract compounds from regular commercial coffee blends .
Each solvent extracted a different profile of compounds , including caffeine and N - methylpyridinium , a ringed compound that does n't appear in green coffee beans but is created in the roasting process .
Stomach cells exposed to each suite of compounds upped their acid secretion , except for the cells exposed to the extract containing NMP .

In addition to switching to a darker roast , just switching to a higher quality coffee can help .
Cheap coffee is almost always made with Robusta beans which have a higher caffeine content than higher quality — and pricier — Arabica beans .

Why Dark Coffee Is Easier on Your Stomach [ Wired ]
Ah yes – St. Patty ’s Day !
The Snake - Hater ’s Holiday !
For most people it ’s a day for wearing green , drinking beer and kissing rocks … but for me , as of three years ago , it ’s a different memory .
Three years ago today , I was with my brother , Chris Quimby and Hoopachoo ( a comic from NYC ) FREEZING in line outside waiting to audition for Last Comic Standing .
It was a blast – I / we did n’t appear on the show ( well , I / we could be seen in line for a second – as seen in this blurry photo )
.
Which is probably a good thing ( I / we was n’t good enough to be on… which is bad ….
but I / we was n’t bad enough to be on either ) .
Good times .
We documented the trip via video – someday maybe my brother will break it out of the archives and edit it ( * hint - hint * ) .
Physicsists find a way to see through paint , paper , and other opaque materials
( Nanowerk News ) Materials such as paper , paint , and biological tissue are opaque because the light that passes through them is scattered in complicated and seemingly random ways .
A new experiment conducted by researchers at the City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution ( ESPCI ) has shown that it 's possible to focus light through opaque materials and detect objects hidden behind them , provided you know enough about the material .
The experiment is reported in the current issue of Physical Review Letters , and is the subject of Viewpoint in APS Physics by Elbert van Putten and Allard Moskof the University of Twente .
Knowing enough about the way light is scattered through materials would allow physicists to see through opaque substances , such as the sugar cube on the right .
In addition , physicists could use information characterizing an opaque material to put it to work as a high quality optical component , comparable to the glass lens show on the left .
In order to demonstrate their approach to characterize opaque substances , the researchers first passed light through a layer of zinc oxide , which is a common component of white paints .
By studying the way the light beam changed as it encountered the material , they were able to produce a numerical model called a transmission matrix , which included over 65,000 numbers describing the way that the zinc oxide layer affected light .
They could then use the matrix to tailor a beam of light specifically to pass through the layer and focus on the other side .
Alternatively , they could measure light emerging from the opaque material , and use the matrix to assemble of an image of an object behind it .
Simple Ajax with cherrypy and jQuery
All the cool kids these days are putting Ajax into their web applications .
Ajax is great for when you want to update data on a page without reloading the entire page .
Most of the Ajax tutorials use PHP , so I want to show here how easy it is to do Ajax with cherrpy .
Ajax stands for " asynchronous JavaScript and XML , " but these days json is often used as a lighter - weight alternative to XML .
In this tutorial , I 'm therefore going to show how to use the python simplejson library to enable communication between python and JavaScript using json .
What you will need for this tutorial :
You can get cherrypy and simplejson from pypi via easy_install ; there 's a copy of jQuery in my sample project .
The sample project consists of three files , in the following structure :
ajax_app.py media / + jquery - 1.4.2.min.js | index.html
First , I 'll show the HTML file :
< head >
< title > AJAX with jQuery and cherrypy < / title >
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " /media/jquery-1.4.2.min.js " ></ script >
< script type =" text / javascript " >
$ ( function ( ) {
// When the testform is submitted …
$ ( " #testform " ) .submit( function ( ) {
// post the form values via AJAX …
var postdata = {name : $ ( " #name " ) .val ( ) } ;
$.post ( ' / submit ' , postdata , function ( data ) {
// and set the title with the result
$ ( " #title " ) .html ( data [ ' title ' ] ) ;
} ) ;
return false ;
} ) ;
} ) ;
</script >
</head >
< body >
< h1 id =" title " > What 's your name ?</h1 > AJAX with jQuery and cherrypy $ ( function ( ) {//
When the testform is submitted … $ ( " #testform " ) .submit( function ( ) {// post the form values via AJAX …var postdata = {name : $ ( " #name " ) . val ( ) } ; $.post ( '/ submit ' , postdata , function ( data ) {// and set the title with the result $ ( " # title " ) .html ( data [ ' title ' ] ) ; } ) ; return false ; } ) ;} ) ;
What 's your name ?
< form id =" testform " action= " # " method= " post " >
< p >
< label for =" name " >
Name :</ label >
< input type =" text " id =" name " /> < br /> < input type =" submit " value = " Set " />
</ p>
</ form >
</ body >
</html >
Let 's see what this is doing .
In the body , you 've got a title tag , and bog standard HTML form , which asks for a name .
In the head , you 've got an include to the jQuery library , and the following JavaScript code :
$ ( function ( ) {
// When the testform is submitted …
$ ( " #testform " ) . submit ( function ( ) {
// post the form values via AJAX …
var postdata = { name : $ ( " #name " ) . val ( ) } ;
$. post ( ' / submit ' , postdata , function ( data ) {
// and set the title with the result
$ ( " #title " ) . html ( data [ ' title ' ] ) ;
} ) ;
return false ;
} ) ;
} ) ;
The initial $ ( function ( ) statement is a jQuery construct that says , " When the page loads , execute this anonymous function . "
That function then creates a callback for the submit event of the element with id " testform " ( the form ) .
When the form is submitted , the jQuery post function is executed , which is where the magic happens .
j Query .post is an Ajax method .
The first argument is the URL to post to ( " / submit " ) ; the second argument is the data to send in the post ( the " name " value from the form ) ; and the third argument is the callback to call with the data we receive from the post .
The function then takes this data , and uses its " title " element to update the title of the page .
Next , here 's the ajax_app.py file :
import cherrypy
import webbrowser
import os
import simplejson
import sys cherrypysimplejson MEDIA_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.abspath ( " . " ) , u" media " ) class AjaxApp ( object ) :
@cherrypy.expose
def index ( self ) :
return open ( os.path.join( MEDIA_DIR , u'index.html ' ) ) @cherrypy .expose
def submit( self , name ) :
cherrypy.response.headers [' Content - Type ' ] = ' application/json '
return simplejson. dumps( dict( title = " Hello , %s " % name ) ) config = {' / media ' :
{'tools.staticdir.on ' :
True ,
' tools.staticdir.dir ' : MEDIA_DIR ,
}
} def open_page ( ) :
webbrowser.open ( " http://127.0.0.1:8080/ " )
cherrypy.engine.subscribe(' start ' , open_page )
cherrypy.tree.mount( AjaxApp( ) , '/' , config=config )
cherrypy.engine.start ( )
First , the AjaxApp class is our application .
It 's pretty simple , having only two methods : index and submit .
When the index method is called , the app opens the index file and returns it .
The submit method is our Ajax method ; when it is called with the form data , we use the information to create a new title , and pass that back as json data using simplejson .
dumps .
The JavaScript function that called this method can then use the data to update the page content .
This little piece of code is a convenience for development ; when you run the cherrpy app , it loads the index page in your web browser .
def open_page ( ) :
webbrowser . open ( " http://127.0.0.1:8080/ " )
cherrypy .
engine .
subscribe ( ' start ' , open_page )
Finally , the last two lines mount the app , and start up the server .
The " config " dict tells cherrpy to serve up static files from the " media " dir in the script 's home directory .
If you download the sample project , unzip it , and run ajax_app.py , you should get the following screen ( shown here with the name filled in ) :
Here it is after filling in the name and clicking Set :
When to use Ajax
Ajax is useful when you want to update the page content without reloading the entire page .
This is useful for CRUD apps when you want to do things like edit items in place , delete items , or add items .
When not to use Ajax
Since Ajax actions do n't correspond to URIs , you can't bookmark Ajax actions , send links to friends , or use the back and forward buttons to navigate like in a normal website .
For this reason , avoid Ajax if you want certain application states to be navigable as URIs .
For example , if you have a calendar application , and use Ajax to show all the data , the user wo n't have any way to bookmark an event on December 12th , 2011 .
Likewise , if you use an Ajax data grid to show tables of data , you wo n't be able to email your data views to your colleagues .
One middle way is to offer a " permalink " for each Ajax view , which allows for bookmarking , sending links , etc .
This still breaks the back - button functionality , but may be worth the trade - off .
Video : Animations sense real world
Pulling at the fabric of reality ( Image : Takumi Yoshida )
POWERPOINT presentations are about to get a sprinkle of fairy dust .
A hand - held projector can now create virtual characters and objects that interact with the real world .
The device – called Twinkle – projects animated graphics that respond to patterns , shapes or colours on a surface , or even 3D objects such as your hand .
It uses a camera to track relevant elements – say a line drawn on a wall – in the scene illuminated by the projector and an accelerometer ensures it can sense the projector ’s rapid motion and position .
“ The device projects animations that respond to patterns , shapes or colours on a surface ”

Software then matches up the pixels detected by the camera with the animation , making corrections for the angle of projection and distance from the surface .
The device could eventually fit inside a cellphone , says Takumi Yoshida of the University of Tokyo .
A prototype which projects a cartoon fairy that bounces off or runs along paintings on a wall or even the surface of a bottle ( pictured ) was presented at the recent Virtual Reality 2010 meeting in Waltham , Massachusetts .
Yoshida and his colleagues are also developing a way for graphics from several projectors to interact , which could be used for gaming .
Anthony Steed of University College London is impressed .
Many researchers have been attempting to create virtual graphics that can interact with a real surface , he says , but Twinkle can cope with a much greater range of environments .
MELBOURNE , Florida –
In a sparsely decorated office suite two floors above a neighborhood of strip malls and car dealerships , former oncologist Douglas Jackson is struggling to resuscitate a dying dream .
Jackson , 51 , is the maverick founder of E - Gold , the first - of - its - kind digital currency that was once used by millions of people in more than a hundred countries .
Today the currency is barely alive .
Stacks of cardboard evidence boxes in the office , marked " U.S. Secret Service , " help explain why , as does the pager - sized black box strapped to Jackson 's ankle : a tracking device that tells his probation officer whenever he leaves or enters his home .
" It 's supposed to be jail , " he says .
" Only it 's self - administered . "
Jackson , whose six - month house arrest ends this month , recently met with Wired.com for his first in - depth interview since pleading guilty last year to money laundering - related crimes , and to operating an unlicensed money transmitting service .
His tale is one of countless upstarts and entrepreneurs who approached the internet with big dreams , only to be chastened by sobering realities .
But his rise and fall also offers a unique glimpse at the web 's frontier halcyon days , and the wilderness landscape that still covers much of the unregulated and un-policed web , where fraud artists prospect for riches alongside pioneers , and sometimes stake , and win , a claim on their territory .
Despite the shackle , Jackson 's conviction is n't black and white .
In a twist still unacknowledged by prosecutors , Jackson turned E - Gold for a time into one of law enforcement 's most productive honey pots , providing information that helped lead to the arrest and conviction of some of the web ’s most wanted credit card thieves and hackers .
He ’s now working with regulatory agencies to try to bring back E - Gold , steps he says he would have taken voluntarily years ago if authorities had given him a chance .
Following his story , the picture that emerges of Jackson is not a portrait of a calculating criminal .
Rather it is one of a naive visionary who thought his dream was bigger than any financial regulations , who got in over his head , and who finally struggled , too late , to make up for his missteps .
" There was no indication at all that anyone had a problem with what he was doing , " says Richard Timberlake , a former economics professor at the University of Georgia and author of several books on U.S. banking .
Timberlake visited Jackson at his E - Gold office in 1997 and vouches for Jackson 's innocent intentions .
" He was always very honest and very forthright in what he was trying to do as a business .
Even the Federal Reserve believed it was legitimate . "
—
The story of the first digital currency backed entirely by gold and silver began in 1995 , while Jackson was still treating cancer patients .
A longtime student of economic history , Jackson was convinced that gold was a superior currency to paper money , despite the consensus among professional economists that a gold - standard prevented governments from responding quickly to monetary crises ; when an economy faltered , treasuries could n't easily manufacture gold bars to stimulate it .
The United States dropped its reliance on gold in 1971 , but Jackson doubted the wisdom of this move .
" Many a paper currency has spun out of orbit in a calamitous trajectory , " he once wrote .
" There has never been an instance of gold or silver being discarded as worthless . "
It was time , Jackson mused , for a radical rethink of money .
Had he been born in another era , he could scarcely have acted on his beliefs .
But the nascent internet changed everything .
The international , 24 - hour churn of e-commerce cried out for a monetary system that transcended borders and time zones .
So in early 1996 , Jackson began programming a back - end system for a new electronic currency , practicing medicine by day , and coding by night .
He hired a software engineer to create the user interface , and four months later launched E - Gold .
As Jackson envisioned it , E - Gold was a private , international currency that would circulate independent of government controls , and stand impervious to the market 's highs and lows .
Brimming with evangelical enthusiasm , Jackson proclaimed it a cure for the modern monetary system 's ills and described it at one point as " an epochal change in human destiny " and " probably the greatest benefit to humanity that 's ever been thought of . "
Though E - Gold would fail to change the world , libertarians and privacy - conscious netizens liked the service , which allowed them to open accounts anonymously .
And international sellers appreciated the ease with which they could transact across borders
Over the next few years , Jackson drained his retirement accounts , sold his medical practice and charged credit cards to raise more than $ 1 million to nurture the fledgling venture .
Cynics might have considered him just another internet hustler looking to strike it rich , but those who knew him say he was a true believer .
" He truly thinks that having a gold - backed currency is what 's needed in the world , " says James Clement , a libertarian attorney who met Jackson in 2003 .
" I do n't think anyone would have stuck with it ... other than that he thinks it 's extremely important and somebody has to do this . "
Jackson drew his inspiration from economist Vera Smith 's influential 1936 treatise The Rationale of Central Banking and the Free Bank Alternative , which challenged the tenets of banking .
" She wrote in the depths of the Depression , and poses some of the most compelling questions about central banking systems , " Jackson says .
" Central banks should attenuate monetary disorder and prevent fluctuations , but ironically they sometimes amplify it . "
His commitment started to pay off in 2000 , when some 50,000 transactions suddenly passed through his system in just two months – more than the previous three and a half years combined .
By that November , E - Gold , now with 20 employees , had processed 1 million transactions , and Jackson 's business reputation was growing .
He was invited to speak at the prestigious World Gold Council conference in Rome , the gold mining industry 's leading event .
In 2001 , the growth continued , with customer accounts expanding from 134,000 to nearly 288,000 , holding about $ 16 million in value .
Initially , Jackson stored the company 's reserves of sovereign coins and ingots in safety deposit boxes in banks around town .
When this proved inconvenient for auditing , the company bought an office safe to hold the gold and platinum .
" The silver was just stacked around the office , " Jackson says .
Ultimately , he converted the sovereigns and ingots to bars and moved them to bank vaults in London and Dubai .
At E - Gold 's peak , the currency would be backed by 3.8 metric tons of gold , valued at more than $ 85 million .
Continued from page 1
Despite the sudden burst of success , the venture was plagued with setbacks .
E- Gold 's servers buckled under the growing traffic load , hanging transactions and frustrating users .
Copycat entrepreneurs erected their own gold - backed systems – e-Bullion , GoldMoney and OSGold – and poached E - Gold customers .
When Jackson finally scaled up his infrastructure in 2003 , solving the performance problems , cyber scammers entered the scene , launching a sortie of phishing attacks against users , tricking thousands of them into disclosing their E - Gold passwords , then draining the accounts .
Eventually Jackson deployed an anti-phishing remedy , and business rebounded in September 2004 .
A year later , customer accounts numbered about 3.5 million in 165 countries , with 1,000 new accounts opening every day .
Millions of dollars were zipping through E - Gold 's system 24 - hours - a- day , bouncing between the U.S. and Europe , South America and Asia .
E - Gold collected 1 percent of every transaction , with a cap at 50 cents .
E - Gold was now second only to PayPal in the online payment industry .
At last , Jackson says , he felt relief .
" We had been stuck year - in and year - out on whatever crisis - du - jour required our immediate attention , " he says .
Now " we felt like we 'd finally achieved a turning point . "
But E - Gold 's increasing popularity with customers drew less - welcome attention as well .
The federal government began to take notice in 2003 , when the Secret Service launched an undercover operation against a website called Shadowcrew – a legendary forum for " carders " who trafficked in stolen credit and debit card numbers .
Cyber crooks in Eastern Europe were stealing millions of card numbers in phishing and skimming scams , then passing the data to accomplices around the world .
The low - end cashers coded the numbers onto blank cards , then siphoned money from ATMs and transmitted the bulk of proceeds back to the former Soviet bloc .
When authorities monitored the criminals ' communications , they discovered that E - Gold was among the carders ' preferred money - transfer methods , because the system allowed users to open accounts and transfer funds anonymously anywhere in the world .
When the Shadowcrew investigation wrapped in October 2004 with the shuttering of the site – and the arrest of more than a dozen members – the Justice Department turned its sights on E - Gold .
Its goal was to force the service to comply with regulations governing money - transmitting services like Western Union and Travelex .
Federal regulations required those businesses to register with the Treasury Department 's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) , to be licensed in states that required it , to diligently authenticate the identity of customers and to file suspicious activity reports on shady - looking customers .
But E - Gold was n't doing this .
Jackson believed E - Gold was exempt from regulation because it was a payment system not a money transmitter .
And although it did transfer money , customers could park balances in their accounts , as with a bank .
But Jackson insisted E - Gold was n't a bank , either .
It was something new – something the world and the U.S. government had n't seen before .
He was n't alone in this view .
Many internet - based payment services , including PayPal during its early years , believed they were exempt from regulation .
They mostly flew under the radar of prosecutors until something brought them into the spotlight .
Jackson says he got the first inkling of the rampant , organized crime in his system when he read a June 2005 New York Times story about the growth of the carding forums .
" To my horror ... E - Gold is mentioned in this ghastly , horrible way of it being , you know , the bitch of criminals , " he says .
He concedes he knew that Ponzi schemers and other scammers sometimes used his system , but he 'd always responded to government subpoenas for information about suspicious customer accounts .
So he contacted the Secret Service to ask why the agency had n't sought his help to track the crooks in the Times story .
The agency , which was already secretly targeting E - Gold , ignored him .
( The Secret Service did n't respond to interview inquiries for this story . )
The hammer dropped on E - Gold around 5 p.m. on a mild day in mid-December 2005 .
A herd of Chevy Suburbans wheeled up to Jackson 's house and expelled more than a dozen FBI and Secret Service agents .
Simultaneously across town , the Justice Department 's " Operation Goldwire " unfolded with more agents raiding the offices of Gold and Silver Reserve , the company that operates E - Gold .
A third group descended on a co-location facility in Orlando where E - Gold Limited , a holding company for E - Gold 's assets , racked its database servers .
The feds carted away more than 100 boxes of electronic records and paper files , including birth certificates , photos and a deed to the Jackson family burial plot .
The gold and silver reserves remained safe overseas , but the government froze the company 's domestic bank accounts .
Jackson 's venture was dissolving around him .
Jackson was n't sure what the feds hoped to find in all those records ; once E - Gold got its systems back online he turned to his database for answers .
Continued from page 2
He scoured the system for suspicious transactions using key words like " cvv , " dumps " and " cob , " and the names of carders he'd read in the Times .
He quickly discovered the disturbing truth about what his libertarian dream had become .
" I found out there was quite a bit of stuff going on which law enforcement knew about , but was n't asking us about , " he says .
" I found , holy smokes , there is a continuing pattern of these so - called carders .
There 's , like , a ring that I can distinguish . "
One user named " Segvec " received more than half a million dollars from four others , including a Ukrainian named " Maksik " who sent a rapid stream of cash totaling $ 300,000 .
In the " memo " field of the transactions – where the sender can state a reason for the payment – Maksik noted that $ 17,000 was " for beer . "
Another three transactions totaling $ 89,000 sent over a week 's time were supposedly for Sony Vaio computers .
A New York account - holder named " Potluck " had a pattern of buying $ 6,000 in postal money orders twice a month , then exchanging them for e-Gold to send to Ukraine .
Over a year , he 'd transmitted about $ 150,000 .
Jackson had uncovered a constellation of shady accounts doing business with one another .
He watched in amazement as the criminal activity expanded before his eyes , and balances in several accounts ballooned , with no sign that the account holder intended to move it out .
Segvec alone amassed more than $ 700,000 in digital gold .
" They were n't just using us as a good vehicle to trade their data , they were parking value in our system , " Jackson says .
E- Gold had unwittingly become banker to the underworld .
Because users could sign up for E - Gold with aliases , there was no easy way for Jackson to determine the real identity of many of his suspects .
But the criminals became vulnerable the moment they converted their virtual currency to local cash .
This required them to do business with an E - Gold money exchanger – the online equivalent of currency exchangers at international airports – who'd ask for valid ID and contact information .
Sometimes the criminals wanted their cash loaded to a debit card and mailed to a drop address , or wired to a traditional bank account ; exchangers would have this data , too .
Jackson reached out to about a dozen exchangers in Europe and elsewhere with the account names he was tracking .
Some criminals had provided the exchangers with fake credentials , but a surprising number had given their real names or addresses .
Jackson soon had the identities of some of the most wanted figures in the underground .
One money exchanger in Northern Ireland revealed that " Segvec " routinely had packages sent to a Tokyo remailer , who forwarded them to a " Stephen Ceres " in Miami .
The same exchanger also sold " Stephen Ceres " a Card One debit card with a daily load limit of $ 9,500 .
Jackson obtained a list of transactions on the card that linked it to a slew of ATM withdrawals in Miami suburbs .
A storm of withdrawals during one five - minute period yielded the cardholder $ 8,000 in cash .
Jackson , who had been snubbed by the Secret Service and FBI , took the information he uncovered to the U.S. Postal Inspector Service , providing investigators with names , addresses and transaction histories .
The postal inspectors passed the information to overseas allies , the FBI , and eventually to the Secret Service as well .
It was a devil 's bargain .
Once the feds got a taste of what Jackson could provide , the postal agents began peppering him with requests for more data on other accounts , promising Jackson they 'd follow up with a formal court order or subpoena later .
He cooperated fully , despite the fact that it violated his user agreement with customers .
" We never did get any legal cover whatsoever , " he says ruefully .
" We never got our trap - and - trace .
We never got our pen register . "
In March 2006 , inspectors asked him for information on a carder named " Jilsi , " whom Jackson traced to a money exchanger in the United Kingdom .
The exchanger gave him a real name – Renu Subramaniam – a 2 - year - old confirmed phone number and the time and location of deposits Subramaniam had made to two London banks .
Jackson passed the information to inspectors who told him that the phone number , if correct , would be " the break in the case we have been waiting for , for quite a long time . "
It was n't long before carders were being taken down .
In May 2007 , Markus Kellerer , aka Matrix 001 , was arrested in Germany .
In July 2007 , Subramaniam , who had been an administrator on a carding site called DarkMarket , was arrested in Britain .
That same month , authorities in Florida arrested Julio Lopez , aka Blinky , who was connected to a ring of Cuban carders .
And last year in Miami , authorities arrested Albert Gonzalez , aka Segvec , allegedly one of the masterminds behind the hack of TJX and other businesses .
Jackson had provided authorities with information on all of them .
An FBI agent who was involved in the arrest of a number of carders , but asked not to be identified because he was n't authorized to speak , acknowledged that information Jackson provided was " instrumental in helping track people down . "
A year after he began his probe , Jackson began blocking the accounts responsible for the suspicious activity , preventing suspected crooks from getting their loot .
E- Gold was on its way to becoming clean , relatively speaking .
As far as the feds were concerned , however , it was too late .
A few months later , in April 2007 , the Justice Department wrapped up its four - year - long investigation by indicting Jackson and his colleagues on federal charges of money laundering , conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business .
" Douglas Jackson and his associates operated a sophisticated and widespread international money remitting business , unsupervised and unregulated by any entity in the world , which allowed for anonymous transfers of value at a click of a mouse , " said U.S. Attorney Jeffrey A. Taylor for the District of Columbia in a press release .
" Not surprisingly , criminals of every stripe gravitated to E - Gold as a place to move their money with impunity .
As alleged in the indictment , the defendants in this case knowingly allowed them to do so and profited from their crimes . "
Clement , the attorney , disputes the government 's depiction of Jackson .
" They automatically assume that E - Gold somehow made it easy for these people involved in money laundering , or [ sought criminals ] as clients , " says Clement .
" But that 's completely the opposite of Doug 's attitude toward any kind of illegal behavior .
It would be crazy for somebody to seek out that kind of business . "
Jackson , who'd hocked his future to start E - Gold , now faced the potential of a federal prison term .
He was frustrated and confused .
" It never crossed my mind that anyone could seriously want people like us in prison , " he says .
" But I guess my bigger fear was that we would go bankrupt , and there would be a train wreck of people that had trusted value to us who could n't get their money . "
Timberlake , the economics professor , is convinced that Jackson 's radical dream , his goal of upsetting the economic status quo and overturning the government 's monopoly on money , is what really got E - Gold targeted .
" No matter how innocent a person is you can always find a law that government agents can use to convict him of something , " Timberlake says , " And this is a perfect example of it .
Any time anybody tries to produce money , the federal government is going to be on their tail . "
Continued from page 3
After a year - and - a - half of court wrangling and negotiations , Jackson pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting service and conspiracy to commit money laundering .
In November he was sentenced to 36 months of supervised released – including six months of house arrest and electronic monitoring , and 300 hours of community service .
In addition to forfeiting about $ 1.2 million to the government , his two companies – Gold and Silver Reserve and E - Gold Limited – were fined $ 300,000 , to be paid in $ 10,000 monthly installments beginning last month .
The plea agreement is conditional on Jackson revamping his business to comply with regulations governing money - transmitting services – a goal that , Jackson concedes , faces many hurdles .
To begin the process of compliance , he suspended the creation of new accounts .
Existing customers are now required to submit a government - issued photo ID and proof of residence to authenticate their name , address and other details , and are limited to $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 a month in transactions until they pass muster .
Customers in high - risk countries – such as Nigeria , Russia and Ukraine – are suspended from making any transactions at all for now .
Their money is locked indefinitely in E - Gold 's servers .
Jackson , who always considered himself one of the good guys , acknowledges today that he might have done a better job of policing his system from the start .
" In hindsight there 's any number of things that would have been a smarter or better way of approaching things , " he says .
Back in his Melbourne office , the blinds are drawn against the harsh sun , and a wall calendar serves as the room 's sole decor .
A belt and freshly dry - cleaned dress shirt , still swathed in plastic wrap , hang from a metal shelf .
A one - pound plastic jug of protein powder on Jackson 's desk serves as a reminder of the weight he 's lost since his legal troubles began .
When asked what toll the trouble has taken on his family – Jackson and his wife are currently living in different states – there 's a long silence before he clears his throat .
" It 's been a source of distress , " he says finally .
" Ten years ago I was an affluent physician . "
Although E - Gold was occasionally profitable , Jackson only drew a salary , like his employees .
The two upscale homes he once owned with his wife are long gone .
Now his wife and 12 - year - old son occupy half a duplex in Pennsylvania near her family , and Jackson lives in a one - bedroom apartment in Melbourne with his 17 - year - old son , while the latter finishes high school , and Jackson and his staff attempt to rebuild the business .
Jackson has finally registered E - Gold with FinCEN , and has begun applying to states for money transmitting licenses .
The company is also blocking people who appear on the Treasury Department 's list of Specially Designated Nationals and plans to follow bank procedures for verifying customer income and sources of transmitted funds .
There are other plans in works to clean up the system as well .
There 's a daunting hill to climb before E - Gold will be operational again , and it remains to be seen whether there will be a market for a scrubbed - down , government - compliant E - Gold .
But Jackson seems relieved to be headed in this direction .
" One of the biggest results of this is that we 're getting to the place we wanted to be anyway , which is to have some sort of an explicit set of standards to build against , " he says .
He maintains that he would have done what authorities now want him to do , if they 'd just worked with him to devise a plan , instead of treating him like a criminal .
Now , after all of E - Gold ups and down , Jackson has n't lost his optimism for the venture , or his knack for florid prose .
As he wrote on his blog last year , he looks forward to transforming E - Gold from a marginal player to a respected institution – one , he says , that will serve to " advance the material welfare of mankind . "

The key to unlocking accessible concurrent programming lies in controlling interactions : to run a program in parallel we have to understand the interactions between the parallel tasks .
Many of the better concurrent programming models rely on reducing interactions .
In message passing , for example , interactions only occur through messages .
Haskell is a pure functional lanugage , which means that the default is zero interaction , and access to state is tightly controlled by the type system .
So it should come as no surprise that Haskell is establishing itself not only as a testbed for concurrent programming models , but also as a realistic platform for multicore programming .
In this talk I 'll give a tour of concurrency from the Haskell viewpoint through various practical examples .
I 'll explain why we believe there is no " one size fits all " concurrent programming model .
Haskell provides thread - based concurrency with a choice of synchronisation mechanisms for situations where those models fit best , but also pure parallel programming models that are often a better choice when the goal is to parallelise a compute - intensive task .
But he also said he was not second - guessing the decision to suspend the trial .
He said a canonical trial would be “ useless if the priest were dying . ”
“ Have you ever been to a trial ?
Do you know how long they take ? ” he said .
“ If the man had had a miraculous recovery and doctors said he ’d live another 10 years , I ’m sure a letter would say fine , ‘ Start the trial . ’ ”
Sitting in a receiving room at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith with a view of Saint Peter ’s out the window and an oil portrait of Cardinal Ratzinger on the wall , Cardinal Levada expressed pain at the case of Father Murphy .
“ I think the evidence is clear from the documents that he was a serial abuser of children , helpless children often times , he had no respect for the sacrament of confession , even using that to accomplish his abuse , ” he said .
“ It ’s one of the saddest and the most egregious cases I ’ve seen . ”
At that point a canon lawyer who sat in on the interview but declined to speak on the record intervened about the nuances of the unfinished trial , effectively deflecting questions about why it had been suspended .
Cardinal Levada said that although Father Murphy never faced judgment in a criminal or canonical court , the priest had not evaded it altogether .
“ As a believer , ” he wrote in his statement , “ I have no doubt that Murphy will face the One who judges both the living and the dead . ”
Cardinal Levada said Benedict had played a “ very significant role ” as the “ architect ” of the Vatican ’s 2001 norms that sent sexual abuse cases directly to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and streamlined procedures for bishops to report sexual abuse cases .
Those norms ushered in a flood of abuse trials , many of which are still unresolved .
The body of a climber who fell into the crater at Mt. St. Helens in Washington state has been recovered , reports the Oregonian .
Rescuers were holding out hope that Joseph Bohlig , 52 , from Kelso , Wash . , was still alive after the ledge of snow he was standing on gave way , sending him sliding about 1,500 feet into the crater Monday afternoon .
Overnight temperatures at the crater fell into the 20s , and dense fog and rain shrouded Mt. St. Helens this morning , hampering rescue efforts , said David Cox , Skamania County undersheriff .
Witnesses said Bohlig 's body , which was discovered at 2:40 p.m. on a steep slope on the south crater wall , was nearly buried in the snow , and rescuers had to use shovels to uncover it before loading it into the Navy helicopter used for the rescue effort .
Simply Freesia
I went to Green Thumb Nursery yesterday with the intention of buying a few onion plants and a trellis for the beans that will eventually climb up the fence on the side of the house .
I picked up 2 kinds of onions , White Sweet Spanish and Walla Walla , which will go into 1 of the 3 planting beds – probably companion planted with the tomatoes and lettuce .
But I should have never walked in the store with their “ spend $ 50 , and get $ 10 off ” because that ’s just what I did .
Ugh .
They had these chic planting containers on sale , as well as most of their annuals and perennials .
I ended up picking up way more than I had originally planned , and ended up with a tray full of hollyhock , spring cactus , freesia , salvia , oxalis , white clover , and , of course , the very cool ceramic planting container .
The container is now filled with the freesia taking center stage and the oxalis and white clover filling in on the sides .
It looks beautiful by the front door , giving the sparse ( but awesome ) front porch a little bit of personality .
In a few weeks , the freesia should be in full bloom and the oxalis and clover should spread and fill in the empty space .
Seriously , the chic-ness level has noticeably gone up .
Well this is embarrassing !

For four years , Officer A lived a secret life among anti-racist activists as they fought brutal battles with the police and the BNP .
Here he tells of the terrifying life he led , the psychological burden it placed on him and his growing fears that the work of his unit could threaten legitimate protest
An officer from a secretive unit of the Metropolitan police has given a chilling account of how he spent years working undercover among anti-racist groups in Britain , during which he routinely engaged in violence against members of the public and uniformed police officers to maintain his cover .
During his tour of duty , the man – known only as Officer A – also had sexual relations with at least two of his female targets as a way of obtaining intelligence .
So convincing was he in his covert role that he quickly rose to become branch secretary of a leading anti-racist organisation that was believed to be a front for Labour 's Militant tendency .
" My role was to provide intelligence about protests and demonstrations , particularly those that had the potential to become violent , " he said .
" In doing so , the campaigns I was associated with lost much of their effectiveness , a factor that ultimately hastened their demise . "
His deployment , which lasted from 1993 to 1997 , ended amid fears that his presence and role within groups protesting about black deaths in police custody and bungled investigations into racist murders would be revealed during the public inquiry by Sir William Macpherson into the death of south London teenager Stephen Lawrence .
His decision to tell his story to the Observer provides the most detailed account of the shadowy and controversial police unit that has provided intelligence from within political and protest movements for more than four decades .
He believes the public should be able to make an informed decision about whether such covert activities are necessary , given their potential to curtail legitimate protest movements .
Officer A – with a long ponytail , angry persona and willingness to be educated in the finer points of Trotskyist ideology – was never suspected by those he befriended of being a member of the Special Demonstration Squad ( SDS ) , a secret unit within Special Branch , whose job is to prevent violent public disorder on the streets of the capital .
Known as the " hairies " due to the fact that its members do not have to abide by usual police regulations about their appearance , the unit consists of 10 full - time undercover operatives who are given new identities , and provided with flats , vehicles and " cover " jobs while working in the field for up to five years at a time .
The unit has been credited with preventing bloodshed on numerous occasions by using intelligence to pre-empt potentially violent situations .
Unlike regular undercover officers , members of the SDS do not have to gather evidence with a view to prosecuting their targets .
This enables them to witness and even engage in criminal activity without fear of disciplinary action or compromising a subsequent court case .
Officer A joined the SDS in 1993 after two years in Special Branch .
It was a time of heightened tension between the extreme left and right and almost every weekend saw clashes between the likes of the Anti-Nazi League , Youth Against Racism , the British National party and the National Front .
The SDS is believed to have infiltrated all such organisations .
During Officer
A's time undercover , all 10 covert SDS operatives would meet to share intelligence about forthcoming demonstrations .
The information was used to plan police responses to counter the threat of the demonstration getting out of control .
A key success for Officer A came just two weeks into his deployment during a demonstration against the BNP - run bookshop in Welling , south - east London .
His intelligence revealed that the protest was to be far larger than thought and that a particularly violent faction was planning to storm the bookshop and set fire to it .
As a result of intelligence provided by Officer A , police leave was cancelled for that weekend and , despite violent clashes , the operation was deemed to be a success for the Met .
The then commissioner , Sir Paul Condon , met the members of the SDS to thank them .
• In this video , Rodney King is referred to as an ' innocent motorist '
but we should clarify that he was driving while under the influence of
alcohol and had led the police on a high - speed chase because he was on
parole for a previous robbery conviction .
None of this justifies the
beating he received .
California continues to forge a solar future for itself .
The latest is the approval of rules that require new houses and low - rise apartment buildings to have some form of solar power .
While some cities in the state already have this requirement ( and other states have considered such legislation , ) the Golden State becomes the first in the United States to codify solar requirements in its building code .
The California Energy Commission approved the changes to the building code on May 9
The requirements will apply to any building permits issued after Jan. 1 , 2020 .
A solar panel on every roof
The new requirements are in step with other laws on the books regarding energy consumption in California .
For instance , by 2030 , 50 percent of the state 's energy electricity must come from noncarbon - producing sources , and solar has been one of the primary sources California has invested in to achieve that goal .
Additionally , the goal is expected to further boost the state 's solar industry , which is already getting plenty of attention .
" This is a very large market expansion for solar , " Lynn Jurich , co-founder and co-chief executive of Sunrun , a leading solar installation company , told The New York Times .
" It 's very cost effective to do it this way , and customers want it . "
" There 's also this real American sense of freedom of producing electricity on my rooftop , " she added .
" And it 's another example of California leading the way . "
California plans to have 50 percent of its electricity generated by alternative energy sources by 2030 .

It 's not only an issue of producing the electricity , of course .
Residents also have to be able to use it .
The new rules encourage builders to install home batteries as well , giving residents the option of using the energy directly instead of funneling it to the grid .
Having a battery will also help residents save on their utilities under the new rate structure , which rolls out next year and charges customers based on the time of day they use electricity .
Having it stored in a battery will help residents avoid higher costs during prime usage times .
Pierre Delforge , senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) called the new rules " groundbreaking " in a statement and and that they will help Californians save money and reduce their carbon footprint
The new rules will " save Californians more than $ 1.7 billion in net energy savings over the next 30 years and reduce carbon pollution statewide by 1.4 million metric tons , " Delforge wrote .
" This is equivalent to the emissions from the annual electricity use of all households in the city of San Francisco . " .
The new regulations also require other energy - efficiency measures , including insulation and better windows .
Too much green to be green ?
Of course , those savings wo n't be immediately apparent to new home buyers .
The commission acknowledged that the solar panel installation will result in an increased cost in home prices , with estimates ranging anywhere from $ 8,000 to $ 12,000 in additional cost , according to The Times .
C.R. Herro , vice president of environmental affairs for Meritage Homes , told Consumer Affairs he estimates the new energy standards could add between $ 25,000 and $ 30,000 to construction costs .
Increasing housing costs are a legitimate concern in the state .
Four of the nation 's five most expensive housing markets in the fourth quarter of 2017 were in California , according to the National Association of Realtors .
San Jose topped the list , with the median cost of an existing family home at $ 1.27 million .
The lowest of the four , San Diego - Carlsbad , was $ 610,000 .
Installing solar panels on new homes could increase the cost of homes by $ 10,000 , if not more .

" The state 's housing crisis is real , " State Assemblyman Brian Dahle told USA Today .
" California 's affordability problem is making it more and more difficult for people to afford to live here . "
The commission and the construction industry , which is generally positive on the new rules , say the increased costs will be offset by the energy savings residents see over the course of the home 's lifetime .
The Energy Commission estimates the new standards will add about $ 40 to an average monthly payment on a 30 - year mortgage but will also save consumers $ 80 on monthly heating , cooling and lighting bills , per The Times .
Additionally , the NRDC argues that the new rules will still help low - income residents .
They spend twice as much on energy per dollar of income than the statewide average , the NRDC says , and these efficiency improvements will " provide relief " from expensive energy bills .
Supervisors directed the county 's auditor controller , its CEO , William T Fujioka , and county counsel to explore the legality of withholding money -- including reimbursements and property and sales tax revenue -- from the state .
The board plans to reconsider the option during closed session next week .
“ We ’re declaring our own Boston tea party , ” Supervisor Gloria Molina said at this morning ’s board meeting , adding that withholding money from the state would send a message to state legislators to take immediate action and " make their pain more acute . ”
Grappling with a state budget stalemate that has left them $ 105.6 million in the hole this month , Los Angeles County supervisors this morning threatened to withhold tax revenues from the state to pay for local social services .
“ It ’s a delicious idea , ” Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said .
“ It may be deliciously illegal , but I think the state ’s action may also be illegal . ”
The state controller delayed $ 105.6 million in health and human services payments to Los Angeles County for at least a month , and the supervisors voted to cover those payments with reserves .
Supervisors have said they will be unable to cover the shortfall if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger follows though with plans to defer an estimated $ 1.4 billion in state payments to the county for welfare and other social services over the next seven months .
The county already had to transfer $ 29.1 million from county reserves last month to cover an upsurge in welfare and construction costs , and supervisors have said they may have to cut services and jobs next month if state lawmakers do not take action .
Molina and other supervisors said they are not receiving any new information about budget negotiations from Sacramento and have few answers for worried constituents and officials at agencies such as county - funded day - care centers .
“ If they can defer our money , why ca n’t we withhold theirs ? ” Supervisor Don Knabe , who chairs the board , said of the state .
Knabe and Supervisor Michael Antonovich said the county should try to withhold the money to cover programs the state has delayed funding .
“ If it ’s legally possible , we ought to use all resources possible to protect the public safety of Los Angeles residents , ” Antonovich said .
County Counsel Ray Fortner said he has been researching the legality of the county withholding money “ for some time ” but could not say yet whether it would be legal for supervisors to do so under the circumstances .

The Internet has surpassed newspapers as a primary way for Americans to get news , according to the Pew Internet and American Life Project .
That makes the Internet the third most popular news platform overall , with many connected users taking advantage of nontraditional consumption methods such as social media postings , personalized news feeds , and getting their news on - the - go .
National and local TV stations still dominate the news cycle for most Americans , but the Internet now stands third in the list , ahead of national and local newspapers .
Additionally , the majority of news consumers say they use two to five websites per day to get their fix — a number we think sounds about right — but a surprisingly high number ( 21 percent ) rely on that one favorite site to get everything they need .
Pew points out that consumers who do n't just rely on newspapers and TV are much more interactive with their news , too .
A full third of those with cell phones said that they get their news while mobile , and 37 percent of those with Internet access reported having contributed to the creation of news themselves , commenting on it , or disseminating it via Facebook or Twitter .
And even though not everyone participates in commenting or sending it out , these methods are still quite effective in getting the general population involved .
Three - quarters of people who consume news online said they do so thanks to e-mails or posts on social media sites .
Those " e- mail a friend " or " post to Facebook " links apparently work well .
Still ,
Pew 's data shows that 59 percent of those surveyed get their news both online and offline .
CNN and CBS were quite popular among the sample , as well as various local stations , and these two categories remain highly popular among Americans ( 73 percent and 78 percent , respectively ) .
Only 17 percent said they read the print version of a national newspaper , however , and 50 percent said they read local papers .
According to Pew , newspapers were most likely to be read by people who were over 50 or those who do n't own cell phones — yikes .
The data clearly reflects print media 's continued decline , though Pew pointed out that the online versions of newspapers ( such as the New York Times or USA Today ) were just as much a part of an online news consumer 's day as any other website .
Now if only the papers could figure out how to stop bleeding money .

What ’s the nutritional difference between beef from animals raised on grass compared with animals fattened in feedlots ?
New research from California State University in Chico breaks it down , reviewing three decades of research comparing the nutritional profiles of grass - fed and grain - fed beef .
Over all , grass - fed beef comes out ahead , according to the report in the latest Nutrition Journal .
Beef from grass - fed animals has lower levels of unhealthy fats and higher levels of omega - 3 fatty acids , which are better for cardiovascular health .
Grass - fed beef also has lower levels of dietary cholesterol and offers more vitamins A and E as well as antioxidants .
The study found that meat from animals raised entirely on grass also had about twice the levels of conjugated linoleic acid , or CLA , isomers , which may have cancer fighting properties and lower the risk of diabetes and other health problems .
While the analysis is favorable to grass - fed beef , it ’s not clear whether the nutritional differences in the two types of meat have any meaningful impact on human health .
For instance , the levels of healthful omega - 3s are still far lower than those found in fatty fish like salmon .
And as the study authors note , consumers of grain - fed beef can increase their levels of healthful CLAs by eating slightly fattier cuts .
Grass - fed beef has a distinctly different and “ grassy ” flavor compared with feed - lot beef and also costs more .
A recent comparison in The Village Voice cooked up one - pound grass - fed and grain - fed steaks .
The grass - fed meat tasted better , according to the article , but at $ 26 a pound , also cost about three times more .
Today all cattle are typically raised on grass in the early months of their lives .
But in the 1950s , cattle raisers hoping to cut costs and improve efficiency of beef production began to ship the animals to feed lots , where they could be fattened more quickly on inexpensive and high - calorie grains .
Grain feeding also increased intramuscular fat in the animals .
The result was a marbling effect that made meat more flavorful and tender but also raised fat and cholesterol levels .
Advocates of pasture - raised beef say the reasons to switch go beyond nutrition .
The animal is raised in a more humane fashion that is also better for the environment .
And 100 - percent grass - fed animals typically are n’t given hormones or antibiotics .
The Web site EatWild.com has more information about the environmental effects of commercial farming and ranching practices and the benefits of pasture - raising .
The New York Times writer Marian Burros explored the taste difference in “ There ’s More to Like About Grass - Fed Beef . ”
Labels on grass - fed beef can be misleading , and some meat carrying a “ grass - fed ” label was still “ finished ” on grains at a feed lot .
Meats carrying a U.S. Department of Agriculture “ process verified shield ” adhere to specific standards for grass feeding , although Mother Earth News reports that a label from the American Grassfed Association is better .
To learn more about labeling on grass - fed meat read the full Mother Earth article , “ The Label Says Grass - Fed , But Is It ? ” or go to the American Grassfed Association Web site .

Recently Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter and V.F. contributing editor Michael Lewis sat together onstage in front of an intimate crowd at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and discussed Lewis ’s new book , The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine , which tackles the question of what caused the U.S. economy to tank .
( It was excerpted in the April issue . )
Among those who attended the event were writers Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese , New York City police commissioner Ray Kelly , and Time Inc. ’s John Huey .
Now you too can hear the entire conversation between Carter and Lewis — just click here .
But be careful visiting that link .
You will probably get sucked into Lewis ’s hour - long talk , just as the House Republican book group became engrossed in a lecture Lewis gave about the financial collapse .
“ I was supposed to be there for an hour , ” says Lewis in the clip above , referring to his visit with the Hill staffers .
“ I was there for almost three .
And nobody left .
And their questions were increasingly : ‘ Oh my God , Goldman Sachs did what ?
A.I.G. did what ?’
They did n’t understand it ...
The minute they started to understand , they were outraged .
And I think the more things are explained , the more outraged people will get . ”
( This guest post originally appeared at The Senator 's website )
Mr. President , last Thursday , the bankruptcy examiner for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. released a 2,200 page report about the demise of the firm which included riveting detail on the firm ’s accounting practices .
That report has put in sharp relief what many of us have expected all along : that fraud and potential criminal conduct were at the heart of the financial crisis .
Now that we ’re beginning to learn many of the facts , at least with respect to the activities at Lehman Brothers , the country has every right to be outraged .
Lehman was cooking its books , hiding $ 50 billion in toxic assets by temporarily shifting them off its balance sheet in time to produce rosier quarter - end reports .
According to the bankruptcy examiner 's report , Lehman Brothers ’ financial statements were " materially misleading " and its executives had engaged in " actionable balance sheet manipulation . "
Only further investigation will determine whether the individuals involved can be indicted and convicted of criminal wrongdoing .
According to the examiner ’s report , Lehman used accounting tricks to hide billions in debt from its investors and the public .
Starting in 2001 , that firm began abusing financial transactions called repurchase agreements , or “ repos . ”
Repos are basically short - term loans that exchange collateral for cash in trades that may be unwound as soon as the next day .
While investment banks have come to over - rely upon repos to finance their operations , they are neither illegal nor questionable ; assuming , of course , they are clearly accounted for .
Lehman structured its repo agreements so that the collateral was worth 105 percent of the cash it received – hence , the name “ Repo 105 . ”
As explained by the New York Times ' DealBook , “ That meant that for a few days – and by the fourth quarter of 2007 that meant end - of - quarter – Lehman could shuffle off tens of billions of dollars in assets to appear more financially healthy than it really was . ”
Even worse , Lehman ’s management trumpeted how the firm was decreasing its leverage so that investors would not flee from the firm .
But inside Lehman , according to the report , someone described the Repo 105 transactions as “ window dressing , ” a nice way of saying they were designed to mislead the public .
Ernst & Young , Lehman 's outside auditor , apparently became “ comfortable ” with , and never objected to , the Repo 105 transactions .
And while Lehman never could find a U.S. law firm to provide an opinion that treating the Repo 105s as a sale for accounting purposes was legal , the British law firm Linklaters provided an opinion letter under British law that they were sales and not mere financing arrangements .
And so Lehman ran the transactions through its London subsidiary and used several different foreign bank counterparties .
Mr. President , the SEC and Justice Department should pursue a thorough investigation , both civil and criminal , to identify every last person who had knowledge that Lehman was misleading the public about its troubled balance sheet – and that means everyone from the Lehman executives , to its board of directors , to its accounting firm , Ernst & Young .
Moreover , if the foreign bank counterparties who purchased the now infamous " Repo 105s " were complicit in the scheme , they should be held accountable as well .
Returning the Rule of Law to Wall Street
Mr. President , it is high time that we return the rule of law to Wall Street , which has been seriously eroded by the deregulatory mindset that captured our regulatory agencies over the past 30 years , a process I described at length in my speech on the floor last Thursday .
We became enamored of the view that self - regulation was adequate , that “ rational ” self - interest would motivate counterparties to undertake stronger and better forms of due diligence than any regulator could perform , and that market fundamentalism would lead to the best outcomes for the most people .
Transparency and vigorous oversight by outside accountants were supposed to keep our financial system credible and sound .
The allure of deregulation , instead , led to the biggest financial crisis since 1929 .
And now we ’re learning , not surprisingly , that fraud and lawlessness were key ingredients in the collapse as well .
Since the fall of 2008 , Congress , the Federal Reserve and the American taxpayer have had to step into the breach – at a direct cost of more than $ 2.5 trillion – because , as so many experts have said : " We had to save the system . "
But what exactly did we save ?
First , a system of overwhelming and concentrated financial power that has become dangerous .
It caused the crisis of 2008 - 2009 and threatens to cause another major crisis if we do not enact fundamental reforms .
Only six U.S. banks control assets equal to 63 percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product , while oversight is splintered among various regulators who are often overmatched in assessing weaknesses at these firms .
Second , a system in which the rule of law has broken yet again .
Big banks can get away with extraordinarily bad behavior – conduct that would not be tolerated in the rest of society , such as the blatant gimmicks used by Lehman , despite the massive cost to the rest of us .
The Lessons of Lehman Brothers and Other Examples
Mr. President , what lessons should we take from the bankruptcy examiner ’s report on Lehman , and from other recent examples of misleading conduct on Wall Street ?
I see three .
First , we must undo the damage done by decades of deregulation .
That damage includes financial institutions that are “ too big to manage and too big to regulate ” ( as former FDIC Chairman Bill Isaac has called them ) , a “ wild west ” attitude on Wall Street , and colossal failures by accountants and lawyers who misunderstand or disregard their role as gatekeepers .
The rule of law depends in part on manageably - sized institutions , participants interested in following the law , and gatekeepers motivated by more than a paycheck from their clients .
Second , we must concentrate law enforcement and regulatory resources on restoring the rule of law to Wall Street .
We must treat financial crimes with the same gravity as other crimes , because the price of inaction and a failure to deter future misconduct is enormous .
Third , we must help regulators and other gatekeepers not only by demanding transparency but also by providing clear , enforceable “ rules of the road ” wherever possible .
That includes studying conduct that may not be illegal now , but that we should nonetheless consider banning or curtailing because it provides too ready a cover for financial wrongdoing .
The bottom line is that we need financial regulatory reform that is tough , far - reaching , and untainted by discredited claims about the efficacy of self - regulation .
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act
When Senators Leahy , Grassley and I introduced the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act ( FERA ) last year , our central objective was restoring the rule of law to Wall Street .
We wanted to make certain that the Department of Justice and other law enforcement authorities had the resources necessary to investigate and prosecute precisely the sort of fraudulent behavior allegedly engaged in by Lehman Brothers .
We all understood that to restore the public 's faith in our financial markets and the rule of law , we must identify , prosecute , and send to prison the participants in those markets who broke the law .
Their fraudulent conduct has severely damaged our economy , caused devastating and sustained harm to countless hard - working Americans , and contributed to the widespread view that Wall Street does not play by the same rules as Main Street .
FERA , signed into law in May , ensures that additional tools and resources will be provided to those charged with enforcement of our nation 's laws against financial fraud .
Since its passage , progress has been made , including the President ’s creation of an interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force , but much more needs to be done .
Many have said we should not seek to " punish " anyone , as all of Wall Street was in a delirium of profit - making and almost no one foresaw the sub - prime crisis caused by the dramatic decline in housing values .
But this is not about retribution .
This is about addressing the continuum of behavior that took place – some of it fraudulent and illegal -- and in the process addressing what Wall Street and the legal and regulatory system underlying its behavior have become .
As part of that effort , we must ensure that the legal system tackles financial crimes with the same gravity as other crimes .
When crimes happened in the past ( as in the case of Enron , when aided and abetted by , among others , Merrill Lynch , and not prevented by the supposed gatekeepers at Arthur Andersen ) , there were criminal convictions .
If individuals and entities broke the law in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis ( such as at Lehman Brothers , which allegedly deceived everyone , including the New York Fed and the SEC ) , there should be civil and criminal cases that hold them accountable .
If we uncover bad behavior that was nonetheless lawful , or that we cannot prove to be unlawful ( as may be exemplified by the recent reports of actions by Goldman Sachs with respect to the debt of Greece ) , then we should review our legal rules in the US and perhaps change them so that certain misleading behavior cannot go unpunished again .
This will not be easy .
As the Wall Street Journal ’s “ Heard on the Street ” noted last week , “ Give Wall Street a rule and it will find a loophole . ”
Systemic issues in Uncovering and Prosecuting FraudThis confirms what I heard On December 9 of last year , when I convened an oversight hearing on FERA .
As that hearing made clear , unraveling sophisticated financial fraud is an enormously complicated and resource - intensive undertaking , because of the nature of both the conduct and the perpetrators .
Rob Khuzami , head of the SEC ’s enforcement division , put it this way during the hearing :
“ White - collar area cases , I think , are distinguishable from terrorism or drug crimes , for the primary reason that , often , people are plotting their defense at the same time they 're committing their crime .
They are smart people who understand that they are crossing the line , and so they are papering the record or having veiled or coded conversations that make it difficult to establish a wrongdoing . ”
In other words , Wall Street criminals not only possess enormous resources but also are sophisticated enough to cover their tracks as they go along , often with the help , perhaps unwitting , of their lawyers and accountants .
Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer and Khuzami , along with Assistant FBI Director Kevin Perkins , all emphasized at the hearing the difficulty of proving these cases from the historical record alone .
The strongest cases come with the help of insiders , those who have first - hand knowledge of not only conduct but also motive and intent .
That ’s why I ’ve applauded the efforts of the SEC and DOJ to use both carrots and sticks to encourage those with knowledge to come forward .
At the conclusion of that hearing in December , I was confident that our law enforcement agencies were intensely focused on bringing to justice those wrongdoers who brought our economy to the brink of collapse .
Going forward , we need to make sure that those agencies have the resources and tools they need to complete the job .
But we are fooling ourselves if we believe that our law enforcement efforts , no matter how vigorous or well funded , are enough by themselves to prevent the types of destructive behavior perpetrated by today ’s too - big , too - powerful financial institutions on Wall Street .
Is Lehman Brothers an Isolated Example ?
Mr. President , I ’m concerned that the revelations about Lehman Brothers are just the tip of the iceberg .
We have no reason to believe that the conduct detailed last week is somehow isolated or unique .
Indeed , this sort of behavior is hardly novel .
Enron engaged in similar deceit with some of its assets .
And while we do n’t have the benefit of an examiner ’s report for other firms with a business model like Lehman ’s , law enforcement authorities should be well on their way in conducting investigations of whether others used similar “ accounting gimmicks ” to hide dangerous risk from investors and the public .
The Case of Greece
At the same time , there are reports that raise questions about whether Goldman Sachs and other firms may have failed to disclose material information about swaps with Greece that allowed the country to effectively mask the full extent of its debt just as it was joining the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) .
We simply do not know whether fraud was involved , but these actions have kicked off a continent - wide controversy , with ramifications for U.S. investors as well .
In Greece , the main transactions in question were called cross-currency swaps that exchange cash flows denominated in one currency for cash flows denominated in another .
In Greece ’s case , these swaps were priced “ off - market , ” meaning that they did n’t use prevailing market exchange rates .
Instead , these highly unorthodox transactions provided Greece with a large upfront payment ( and an apparent reduction in debt ) , which they then paid off through periodic interest payments and finally a large “ balloon ” payment at the contract ’s maturity .
In other words , Goldman Sachs allegedly provided Greece with a loan by another name .
The story , however , does not end there .
Following these transactions , Goldman Sachs and other investment banks underwrote billions of Euros in bonds for Greece .
The questions being raised include whether some of these bond offering documents disclosed the true nature of these swaps to investors , and , if not , whether the failure to do so was material .
These bonds were issued under Greek law , and there is nothing necessarily illegal about not disclosing this information to bond investors in Europe .
At least some of these bonds , however , were likely sold to American investors , so they may therefore still be subject to applicable U.S. securities law .
While “ qualified institutional buyers ” ( QIBs ) in the U.S. are able to purchase bonds ( like the ones issued by Greece ) and other securities not registered with the SEC under Securities Act of 1933 , the sale of these bonds would still be governed by other requirements of U.S. law .
Specifically , they presumably would be subject to the prohibition against the sale of securities to U.S. investors while deliberately withholding material adverse information .
The point may be not so much what happened in Greece , but yet again the broader point that financial transactions must be transparent to the investing public and verified as such by outside auditors .
AIG fell in large part due to its credit default swap exposure , but no one knew until it was too late how much risk AIG had taken upon itself .
Why do some on Wall Street resist transparency so ?
Lehman shows the answer : everyone will flee a listing ship , so the less investors know , the better off are the firms which find themselves in a downward spiral .
At least until the final reckoning .
Who ’s Responsible ?
The Role of Congress , Regulators , Accountants and Lawyers
Who ’s to blame for this state of affairs , where major Wall Street firms conclude that hiding the truth is okay ?
Well , there ’s plenty of blame to go around .
As I said previously , both Congress and the regulators came to believe that self - interest was regulation enough .
In the now - immortal words of Alan Greenspan , “ Those of us who have looked to the self - interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder 's equity -- myself especially -- are in a state of shocked disbelief . ”
The time has come to get over the shock and get on with the work .
What about the professions ?
Accountants and lawyers are supposed to help insure that their clients obey the law .
Indeed , they often claim that simply by giving good advice to their clients , they ’re responsible for far more compliance with the law than are government investigators .
That claim rings hollow , however , when these professionals now seem too often focused on helping their clients get around the law .
Experts like Professor Peter Henning of Wayne State University Law School , looking at the Lehman examiner ’s report on the Repo 105 transactions , are stunned that the accountant Ernst & Young never seemed to be troubled in the least about it .
Of course , the fact that a Lehman executive was blowing a whistle on the practice in May 2008 did not change anything , other than to cause some discomfort in the ranks .
While saying he was confident he could clear up the whistleblower ’s concerns , the lead partner for Lehman at Ernst & Young wrote that the letter and off - balance sheet accounting issues were " adding stress to everyone . "
As Professor Henning notes , one of the supposed major effects of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act was to empower the accountants to challenge management and ensure that transactions were accounted for properly .
Indeed , it was my predecessor , then - Senator Biden , who was the lead author of the provision requiring the CEO and CFO to attest to the accuracy of financial statements , under penalty of criminal sanction if they knowingly or willfully certified materially false statements .
I do n't believe this is a failure of Sarbanes - Oxley .
A law is not a failure simply because some people subsequently violate it .
I am deeply disturbed at the apparent failure of some in the accounting profession to change their ways and truly undertake the profession 's role as the first line of defense ( the gatekeeper ) against accounting fraud .
In just a few years time since the Enron - related death of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen , one might have hoped that " technically correct " was no longer a defensible standard if the cumulative impression left by the action is grossly misleading .
But apparently that standard as a singular defense is creeping back into the profession .
The accountants and lawyers were n't the only gatekeepers .
If Lehman was hiding balance sheet risks from investors , it was also hiding them from rating agencies and regulators , thereby allowing it to delay possible ratings downgrades that would increase its capital requirements .
The Repo 105 transactions allowed Lehman to lower its reported net leverage ratio from 17.3 to 15.4 for the first quarter of 2008 , according to the examiner 's report .
It was bad enough that the SEC focused on a misguided metric like net leverage when Lehman 's gross leverage ratio was much higher and more indicative of its risks .
The SEC 's failure to uncover such aggressive and possibly fraudulent accounting , as was employed on the Repo 105 transactions , provides a clear indication of the lack of rigor of its supervision of Lehman and other investment banks .
The SEC in years past allowed the investment banks to increase their leverage ratios by permitting them to determine their own risk level .
When that approach was taken , it should have been coupled with absolute transparency on the level of risk .
What the Lehman example shows is that increased leverage without the accountants and regulators and credit rating agencies insisting on transparency is yet another recipe for disaster .
Conclusion
Mr. President , last week ’s revelations about Lehman Brothers reinforce what I ’ve been saying for some time .
The folly of radical deregulation has given us financial institutions that are too big to fail , too big to manage , and too big to regulate .
If we have any hope of returning the rule of law to Wall Street , we need regulatory reform that addresses this central reality .
As I said more than a year ago : " At the end of the day , this is a test of whether we have one justice system in this country or two .
If we do n’t treat a Wall Street firm that defrauded investors of millions of dollars the same way we treat someone who stole 500 dollars from a cash register , then how can we expect our citizens to have faith in the rule of law ?
For our economy to work for all Americans , investors must have confidence in the honest and open functioning of our financial markets .
Our markets can only flourish when Americans again trust that they are fair , transparent , and accountable to the laws . "
The American people deserve no less .

The US ranks 15th in the world for providing access to high - speed internet A plan to help the US lead the world in providing its citizens with super - fast internet has been officially released .
The Federal Communications Commission , FCC , aims to ensure every American in the country has broadband connections by 2020 .
It claims a third of all US households - 100 million Americans - do not have a broadband connection .
Congress will now consider whether to introduce legislation to enact some parts of the 360 - page plan .
Some of the 200 recommendations will be decided on by other government agencies such at the Federal Trades Commission and Homeland Security department .
The FCC 's five commissioners did not vote to approve the document because not all agree on its recommendations .
Instead they gave their backing to a statement of support for some of the plan 's goals .
These include ensuring every American has access to affordable high - speed internet and shifting airwaves to mobile services .
" We finally have a clear objective and a considered strategy aimed at ensuring that everyone in this country has equal opportunities in this new Digital Age , no matter who they are , where they live , or the particular circumstances of their individual lives , " said Michael Copps , a Democratic FCC commissioner .
' Critical question '
The broadband plan comes at a time when the internet is playing an increasing role in the lives of individuals , businesses and government .
The FCC has called this the " greatest infrastructure challenge of the 21st century " and said it represents a " foundation for economic growth , job creation , global competitiveness and a better way of life " .
Wide differences in broadband access are revealed by statistics
The plan aims to increase internet speeds from the average 4 mbps ( megabits per second ) to 100 mbps .
One thorny issue will be the cost of implementing the plan which has been estimated at $ 350 bn ( £ 231bn ) .
Who will pay and how much will undoubtedly be fiercely debated .
" It is an important question , but I think the critical question we have to ask is what is the cost of doing nothing ? " said Dean Garfield , the chief executive officer of the Information Technology Industry Council .
" We have to ask where do we want to be globally ?
The internet , and broadband by extension , can lay the foundation for the growth of a brand new economy and the public sector can't do this alone .
The private sector , and really the country in general , needs to be a part of this , " Mr Garfield told BBC News .
' Opportunity '
Another issue that is likely to result in a major fight is how the FCC will wrest spectrum from TV companies to wireless carriers .
Mobile companies like AT&T and Verizon have said they will need more spectrum in future to provide super - fast , reliable internet connections to every customer .
The problem is that most of the spectrum is occupied by someone else .
Republican FCC commissioner Robert McDowell has called for the commission to encourage broadcasters to lease their spectrum to broadband providers rather than using " coercive " action .
The Centre for Democracy and Technology , CDT , is also gearing itself up for a tough time ahead to ensure that strong privacy rules are weaved into everything the plan enacts .
" We have a real opportunity here because so far we have had this patchwork of privacy rules and regulations that do n't work as well as we need them to , " said Leslie Harris of CDT .
" WE do n't have the comprehensive privacy framework you see in Europe .
We have old rules that apply to government and how government uses information and laws that have been outstripped by technological advances .
" The more people are connected to the network the greater the potential for data being collected and misused , " Ms Harris told the BBC .

KFC diner told ' you can't have bacon in your burger here - we 're now halal '
A diner was left fuming after a KFC restaurant took his favourite meal off the menu because it breached their new halal regulations .
Alan Phillips was told he would have to travel five miles to another branch if he wanted the Big Daddy , a chicken burger , topped with bacon , cheese and salad .
The branch , in Burton - on - Trent , Staffordshire , is one of 86 KFC restaurants which is running trials of a scheme where they sell nothing other than halal meat .
Trial :
This KFC in Burton - on - Trent is one of five reverting to the old non-halal menu after poor sales
The company has taken the burger off the menu because Islamic dietary law forbids Muslims to eat anything which has been prepared on the same premises as pork , which is itself strictly forbidden .
It said it was responding to ' increased demand ' for a halal menu in the areas of Britain with growing Muslim populations .
Mr Phillips said he found the change ' extremely unfair ' on non-Muslim customers .
' I can't believe a chain like this has taken this stance , ' he said .
' Staff told me that due to the dietary laws halal meat could not be prepared in the same place as other meats , so I could n't have my bacon .
It was like they were saying I could n't buy bacon because it might offend people . '
Mr Phillips was told he would have to travel to another KFC five miles away to buy his bacon burger .
He protested that this was too far for him to travel .
' It is getting silly , ' he said .
' I have many friends who are black , white and Muslim but they would n't be forced to eat non-halal meat .
Banned :
The Big Daddy was taken off the menu at KFC branches participating in the halal trial
' I have no problem with them selling halal meat , but I would like the choice . '
Traditionally , halal meat must be slaughtered by hand , although KFC , which has more than 750 restaurants in the UK , said its chickens are not killed in this way .
The meat must also be blessed in the name of Allah and cannot be kept on the same premises as banned substances including pork and alcohol .
KFC spokesman Nina Arnott said the halal trial was expected to last ' a few months ' .
She said : ' We 've responded to requests to provide halal food in some parts of the UK and the Middleway Park restaurant in Burton is one of the restaurants taking part in our trial .
' The Big Daddy is the only product we 've taken off the menu at our trial stores and we 're using exactly the same ingredients and exactly the same tasting chicken as before . '

A California lawmaker has stepped into a growing gun rights debate by introducing legislation that would essentially outlaw what 's called the " open carry " of unloaded weapons on public property .
The measure , which was first introduced last month but is not expected to have its first hearing until April , is meant to address the growing “ open carry ” movement , in which some gun owners have taken to meeting in coffee shops , parks , and restaurants while wearing holstered weapons to raise awareness about gun rights .
“ People should be free from the fear and the potential for violence firearms represent , ” said Democratic Assembly Member Lori Saldaña of San Diego , in a statement .
“ These displays of firearms can create potentially dangerous situations . ”
IN PICTURES : States with the strictest gun laws
Assembly Member Saldaña said she was compelled to introduce the bill to limit the open carry law in California , which is one of at least 38 states that allows the display of unconcealed weapons , following a gathering of some 60 armed open carry advocates at a southern California beach .
“ People were understandably concerned , ” she said .
“ The police were called and the situation became frightening for the families simply enjoying a day at the beach . ”
In recent months , members of the grass - roots open carry movement have been turning up at many Bay Area cafes .
In addition to bringing attention to gun laws , which allow unconcealed and unloaded weapons to be carried without a permit , the groups are also making a statement about the difficulty of obtaining concealed weapons permits .
In a Monitor interview last month , Bay Area open carry advocate David LaTour said that unless someone is “ well connected ” politically , concealed weapons permits are essentially unobtainable .
Following gatherings at Peet ’s Coffee & Tea and California Pizza Kitchen , both chains opted to ban guns from their premises .
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has called on Starbucks to follow suit .
But the coffee chain , which has been thrust uncomfortably in the middle of this gun debate , said that it would abide by local laws and that the issues surrounding open carry should be decided in legislatures and courts .
While the bill proposes placing limits on openly displaying weapons in public , it does not propose limits within businesses .
Stanford University law professor Robert Weisberg , an expert on gun laws , says it 's unlikely that the California legislature would endorse Saldaña ’s bill .
“ The great majority from both political parties do n’t want to cross the gun lobby , ” he says .
While the National Rifle Association , the nation ’s most influential gun rights group , appears to have distanced itself from the open carry movement , it probably would back efforts to defeat any move to limit California 's open carry law , says Professor Weisberg .
“ The safest course for the NRA would be to say it 's unconstitutional and provide some legal assistance ” to stop the measure , Weisberg says .
He says the NRA is uncomfortable with the permissiveness of the open carry movement and may worry it could endanger laws that protect carrying concealed weapons .
In some ways , Weisberg says , provoking a Democratic California lawmaker to go after open carry laws is a boon for the movement .
“ They wanted a generic California liberal to attack them , " he says , " and they have succeeded in that regard . ”

HONG KONG —
Air pollution in Hong Kong , one of the perpetual banes of living and working in this Asian financial hub , reached record levels on Monday and remained intense on Tuesday , setting off an official government warning to avoid outdoor activities and physical exertion .
Pollution levels have been elevated in the city for days , casting a gray pall over the harbor and obscuring views of Hong Kong ’s famed skyline .
But by Monday , Hong Kong ’s official air pollution index rose further still , to the worst levels since records started being kept in 1995 , said a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Department .
Air pollution index levels at several measurement stations soared above the top end of the government ’s 500 - point air pollution index by Monday evening .
Pollution levels were 12 to 14 times the amount recommended by the World Health Organization , estimated the Clean Air Network , which campaigns to inform the public on Hong Kong ’s pollution issues , on Monday .

The recent deaths of two teens have been blamed on the legal drug mephedrone , which is marketed as plant fertilizer , and causes " headaches , palpitations , nausea , high blood pressure , a burning throat , nose bleeds and purple joints , weight loss and insomnia . "
A report in the Guardian says :
" The drug , which comes in the form of a powder , tablets , crystals or liquid , is often sold cheaply via the internet , where it can be marketed as plant food , another name for the substance . "
The BBC says that the drug , nicknamed " meow meow " , was due to come under review last year by health officials , but a fight over the classification of other drugs put the review on hold :
" The work of the committee on legal highs stopped following the dismissal of its chief drugs adviser Professor David Nutt last October .
He was sacked after publicly disagreeing with the government 's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug and not to downgrade ecstasy . "
For possession of Class B drugs , like weed and amphetamines , a person can do up to five years in prison .

The weather was nice yesterday , and one of my favorite places to take in the sun on such a day is the National Mall .
There 's plenty of wide open spaces for my two sons to run until they get tired and conk out for a nap .
The splendor of all the monuments , and museums , and people , and assorted stuff just makes this a great place to burn a few hours .
So , I packed the kids in the SUV , and headed downtown , giving my wife an empty house for the afternoon .
Not long after we found our usual parking space near the Union Station did I realize there was something a bit different going on .
Sure , protests are a regular occurrence on the Mall , but there were more people carrying signs than usual .
I took a glance at one which read " Liberty Over Tyranny .
Take your damn hands off my healthcare ! "
And then it hit me : I had accidentally ended up at a Tea Party !
Sure , I 'm acutely aware that with HC Reform nearing a vote this weekend , folks would be gearing up for a last ditch effort .
But I had n't banked on these opponents of the bill taking over the Capitol and ruining what would otherwise be a great day out with my kids .
Since I was out there on Daddy Time , and not as a blogger , it would have been quite easy to just pack up and leave , or head in the other direction toward the museums .
But of course , morbid curiosity and general amusement about TeaBaggers overrode common sense .
I pointed that double stroller toward the Capitol .
We were joining the Tea Party !
Here 's some totally random , mostly unrelated observations from the 30 of so minutes I could tolerate before taking my impressionable children elsewhere :
" Go Back To Africa ! " -
As we were crossing Constitution headed toward the Capitol where the " rally " was taking place , the Obama motorcade just so happened to be headed up to the Hill for what I found out later was a well publicized meeting with Congressional Democrats .
So , as the 20 deep delegation of black Tahoes sped by , TeaBaggers quickly ran to the curb ( seriously , imagine a few hundred people running and wielding signs . ) to serenade the most hated Negro this side of Barry Bonds .
And like magic the " Go Back To Africa ! " chants just materialized out of thin air .
It was totally predictable , but still a little freakish .
Crowd Control -
The crowd , as you might guess , was overwhelmingly white , and by appearances , not very well to do financially .
Lots of mullets .
Lots of misspelled signs .
Lots of American Flag dress shirts .
Lots of West Virginia license plates .
I 'm not saying this looked like a casting call for Deliverance 2 : Revenge Of The MouthBreathers , but it was pretty damn close .
It also was n't all that big , when you consider the stakes .
Perhaps the TeaBaggers have just resigned themselves to the fact that they 're going to have to accept not getting denied coverage for pre-existing conditions , and not having their healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket .
Either that , or it was simply too pretty a day to be worried about ObamaCare .
Despite what Fox News might say to the contrary , there were no more than a couple thousand people there at best .
Not Many Black Folks -
I know what you 're thinking : how many other black folks did you see amongst the TeaBaggers ?
Honestly , I only saw one person whom I would consider a protester , because she had a sign .
There were lots other black folks just milling about , taking the whole thing in just like I was , but it was pretty easy to tell they were also locals who stumbled upon this spectacle and wanted to observe out of morbid curiosity .
I fact , I 'd say at least 1/ 4 of the folks on the Hill were either clueless tourists , locals , or gawkers .
" We 're Not Here For This , Lady . " -
Just because I was there with my kids out of curiosity did n't mean the TeaBaggers could tell .
A black man pushing two kids in a double stroller on the Capitol lawn probably does look like a protester to a casual outsider , and as such , I was frequently given thumbs up , smiled at , and otherwise looked at as a welcome token .
For a brief moment , I wondered if this was what it felt like to be Ward Connerly .
Once I unpacked the kids , and we sat down for our picnic on the Capitol grounds , a real - life Peggy Hill looking woman who was sitting under a tree behind us waved her hands to get my attention .
She motioned to my toddlers , and asked me " Do they know what they 're here for ? "
I was a little puzzled at first , then I realized she was asking me if I 'd explained to my kids that I was also against the tyranny of ObamaCare .
I said , " We 're not for this , lady .
We live here .
I 'm not for this protest .
I think these protesters are misinformed and voting against their own self - interests . "
She looked at me like I 'd just entered her puppy in a dogfight .
She did n't speak to me anymore .
Her loss .
" Kill The Bill ! ! ! " -
When we finished eating and were ready to go , I decided to roll up closer to the steps of the Capitol , where the actual protest was taking place .
No sooner than we approached the crowd , they in unison started chanting " Kill The Bill ! " and the protesters started marching toward the other side of the Capitol , presumably near where Obama was meeting with Congress .
I 'm no punk , but when a couple thousand angry folks are marching towards you yelling " KILL ! KILL ! KILL ! " , it 's probably time to leave .
So we did .
Despite reports that members of Congress were spat on , and called n*ggers and f*ggots , I did n't witness any of this firsthand .
For the most part , the Tea Party protesters I encountered were mostly courteous , and gladly moved out the way as I maneuvered my stroller through the crowd .
And while I completely disagree with these folks , and find them comically misinformed , reality is , what they 're doing is as American as apple pie .
Lets face it : is n't it great that we live in a country where folks can be manipulated by millionaire talk hosts to vote against their own economic self - interests ?
But that 's the way the founding fathers and the slaves who cooked their pancakes would have wanted it .
One man 's Tea Party is another man 's anti-war protest , is another man 's pro-immigration rally .
It 's all Democracy , whether or not you agree with the intent .
Instead of making fun of these folks , we should be grateful we live in a country where they 're allowed an opposing opinion , no matter how idiotic it might sound .
God Bless America .
Question : Assuming HealthCare reform passes , will we have heard the last of the TeaBaggers , or is this just the start of a full - blown American revolution ?!?
Here 's an offer no girl can refuse :
Show your boobs or the snake eats the baby bird !
It works .
Every single time .
Or maybe not every time , but there are plenty of chickens .
The sophistication level of Chatroulette is bottomless .
Aufregung um Treffen in Istanbul Erdogan umgarnt deutsch - türkische Politiker
Ein feudales Essen in Istanbul , Anreise inklusive : Aus ganz Europa lud Premier Erdogan türkischstämmige Politiker ein , um sie zu mehr politischer Aktivität in ihrer neuen Heimat zu ermuntern - gegen eine Assimilierung der Türken .
Teilnehmer aus Deutschland reagierten empört .
The Tyranny of Reifying COWs explained how fixing an overzealous memory copy in Parrot made Rakudo Perl 6 use much less memory .
Unfortunately , it also slowed Rakudo substantially .
My favorite tool for profiling is the combination of Callgrind and KCachegrind .
Callgrind emulates a CPU running the actual binary and gives reports about the number of instructions executed , branches taken , and call paths through a program .
KCachegrind provides multiple ways to visualize and display this information .
The visualization is perhaps the most important part ; I often compare two or more runs through a program to see where optimizations have the most effect .
( I 'll never return to wallclock - based benchmarks — they 're laughably irrelevant in their inaccuracy . )
Some focused profiling with this combination revealed that the big difference before and after the memory fix came from the code path when concatenating two strings .
This is in the Parrot function Parrot_str_concat ( ) .
If both strings exist and have contents ( if neither string is empty ) , the code copied the first string into a result string , then appended the second string to the result .
That copy operation performed a reified copy on write .
I was familiar with that code , as that 's where Vasily and I found and fixed the first bug .
After digging into the mess that is Parrot_str_append ( ) , the slowdown was obvious .
Before our change , reifying a COW string copied the entire buffer .
If a substring pointed to five characters in the 90kb buffer representing the entire source code of a program , the copied string would get a new 90 kb buffer .
Appending another few characters to that string requires only copying a few bytes into the new buffer and changing the buffer length used member of the string header .
After our change , the copied string 's buffer was large enough only for the contents of the string itself .
If that were five characters from the 90kb file , the copied string 's buffer would be five characters in length .
Here 's the problem : appending anything else to that string meant reallocating that buffer immediately .
That immediate reallocation slowed Rakudo measurably , perhaps by a factor or four .
Vasily and I had the same reaction when we realized what was happening .
Now instead of creating and immediately reifying a COW string , we create a new , empty string with the proper buffer size , then append both strings to it .
Avoiding that reallocation — a completely unnecessary operation , as we have all of the information necessary to allocate a buffer of the proper size — sped up Rakudo once again , this time even faster than before all of these memory shenanigans .
These two commits reinforce two lessons .
First , optimization is the art of avoiding expensive recalculations of data you already know .
Second , go faster by moving less memory around .
People using Parrot and Rakudo should n't have to know the internals of how Parrot manages memory , but a healthy understanding of the philosophy of its mechanisms can help you write faster , leaner programs .
These two commits also argue for an internals change I 've long considered useful in Parrot , and Vasily has already begun to experiment with it .
It should be invisible to users of Parrot , except that your programs should run faster and use less memory .
I 'll explain that next time , in the conclusion of this series .
Once again , every Republican to appear on a Sunday talk show made it clear that above all else , they see their mission as saying " no " to President Obama 's agenda .
Of course , there 's nothing inherently wrong with the minority party opposing the majority party -- but the fact that they are willing to use the Senate 's filibuster rule to block progress on any of our nation 's priorities is bad .
And the fact that even so - called " moderate " Republicans like Scott Brown think Sarah Palin is presidential material is just plain crazy .

Fue por pura casualidad que hoy la Marina está en aprietos .
El hombre de la camiseta café con logo naranja en el pecho fue captado por las cámaras de Milenio Televisión el domingo en la tarde en el municipio de Santa Catarina , Nuevo León .
Había sido detenido por presunto narcomenudeo y entregado a los marinos tras una refriega .
En las imágenes se ve cuando es subido a una camioneta de la Marina y transportado a bordo de un helicóptero de la misma institución .
Casualmente , a la mañana siguiente , sus jefes comisionaron al mismo reportero para que recogiera la imagen de un “ encobijado ” que apareció en San Nicolás .
Al llegar , el reportero identificó sorprendido al mismo hombre .
La cara estaba muy golpeada pero la camiseta era inconfundible .
Así por casualidad , y por primera vez , los periodistas tenemos evidencia de que una persona detenida por las autoridad es después encontrada muerta y abandonada en el más puro estilo del crimen organizado .
Denuncias en este sentido habíamos recibido antes , pero eran imposibles de verificar .
El caso del hombre de la camiseta café , cuyo nombre ayer se supo es José Humberto Márquez , no prueba la veracidad de esos casos , ni es por sí misma una prueba de que se trate de una práctica tolerada o promovida dentro de ciertas corporaciones , pero despierta dudas legítimas .
La respuesta de los involucrados ha sido la de siempre : negar los hechos .
El procurador del estado dice que están investigando .
¿ Qué les toma tanto tiempo ?
Sólo se necesita un dato : ¿a quién le entregó la Marina , si es que lo hizo , la custodia del detenido ?
Todo apunta , incluso la falta de información precisa , a que a alguna de las dos corporaciones “ se les pasó la mano ” en un interrogatorio y no están dispuestos a reconocerlo .
Y es el segundo caso en sólo cinco días en la zona de Monterrey que se trata de ocultar “ un error ” de las fuerzas armadas .
La explicación que dan algunos en privado es que se quiere evitar a toda costa que se deslegitime el rol de la Marina y el Ejército en la lucha contra el crimen .
Pero ¿será mintiendo y encubriendo la mejor manera de preservar esa legitimidad ?
No lo creo .
En el caso del Ejército pasan las horas y nadie ha visto los resultados de la autopsia que le fue practicada a los jóvenes estudiantes asesinados en el Tec el pasado sábado .
¿ Qué balas los mataron ?
¿ Cómo se dieron los hechos : fue confusión o fuego cruzado ?
Pedir cuentas de estas muertes no es estar del lado de los narcotraficantes , como algunos afirman buscando así acallar las quejas y denuncias .
Efectivamente son ellos los enemigos de la sociedad , pero el Estado pelea en nuestro nombre y lo debe hacer dentro de la legalidad y de forma transparente .
Por el bien de todos .
Poor Joffrey .
Just kidding - but at last Jaime now knows who killed his spoilt , pathetic , cowardly , psychopathic ( I could go on , but you get the general idea ) son .
Revealing that she was the mastermind behind Joffrey ’s demise , Olenna ’s big speech at the end of Game of Thrones season 7 episode 3 is the only way her character could have died .
Now that the Tyrell house is extinct what better way to commemorate them than with a run-through of precisely how Olenna and her accomplice assassinated Joffrey ?
First thing ’s first : the poison used is called ‘ the strangler ’ .
Unlike traditional poison , it ’s not in liquid form - instead it ’s solidified into a pale purple crystal .
Looks pretty , right ?
Pretty enough to go in a necklace , certainly … just like the one Ser Dontos gives to Sansa Stark before Joffrey ’s wedding to Margaery .
Ser Dontos - as in the drunken nobleman who Littlefinger enlisted to carry Sansa to his ship ( and to safety ) after Joffrey ’s death .
Funny , that .
During the wedding , Sansa is understandably feeling quite downtrodden .
Seeing your former betrothed marrying a noblewoman who showed you kindness and being in a sham marriage to his uncle will do that to you .
Seeing her solemn face , Olenna comes up to Sansa and comforts her , expressing her condolences at Robb ’s death .
Fiddling with her necklace , she contemplates how awful it is for someone to be killed at their own wedding … as she removes one of the stones .
Spoilers : it ’s not a stone .
It ’s crystallised poison , all ready to slip into Joffrey ’s cup .
Littlefinger says it himself .
When Tyrion pours the drink we get a shot of Olenna ’s face , implying that she ’s got her eyes on it .
Seeing as she ’s sitting close to the main table , she must have found an opportunity to slip it into Joffrey ’s drink .
Need more evidence ?
When she confesses discreetly to Margaery she fiddles with her necklace in exactly the same way she did to Sansa as a subtle hint to us that she ’s telling the truth .
So there you have it .
Olenna and Littlefinger paired up to execute the tyrant , with it being a show of Littlefinger ’s loyalty to the up - and - coming Tyrells .
As he puts it : “ nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a friendship grow strong ” .
ATLANTA — North Korea recently threatened to “ mercilessly destroy ” its foes .
That did n’t elicit much reaction abroad .
After all , the terms were similar to threats uttered countless times during and since the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
“ Pundits describing the North Korean threat often downplay it because it appears obvious that North Korea ’s military — despite its large size — is unlikely to be able to unify the peninsula , ” said Bruce Bechtol , professor of international relations at the Marine Corps Command and Staff College and an expert on the North Korean military .
This time , though , the regime added that it might employ its nuclear weapons in the process .
And there are other reasons , including a newly reported change in the North ’s war plans , why outsiders should not assume that the blowhard Kim Jong
Il and his generals are all bluff .
“ Those who downplay the evolving North Korean military threat do so not at their own peril but that of the Republic of [ South ] Korea , ” Bechtel said in an email .
The Northerners “ have adapted their military — and their military planning — to changing times . ”
Author of the excellent " Red Rogue : The Persistent Challenge of North Korea , " Bechtel was commenting on a Tuesday article in the Seoul daily JoongAng Ilbo .
The paper quoted an unnamed high - ranking military source in South Korea as saying the North had relinquished its old plan , in case war should occur , of occupying all of the South within a week .
The North ’s new war plan , JoongAng Ilbo said , is to quickly grab control of Seoul and the surrounding area just across the border from the North and then decide whether to proceed farther south — or simply stop and negotiate a cease - fire .
In the latter case — holding hostage the most populous and developed Korean region by far , the capital and nerve center of the South — the North would have enormous bargaining power with the South and its U.S. ally .
According to Bechtel , “ the North Koreans do n’t need to unify the peninsula .
They just need to take Seoul .
Once they take Seoul , they have the overwhelming advantage . ”
Indeed , with their missiles , special operations forces and maneuver forces “ poised on the invasion corridors , ” he said , the Northern forces “ are built and trained to do just that .
For years I have been saying this .
Now it comes out in the open press — and this is important — that that is exactly what their war plan is . ”
The JoongAng Ilbo article quotes its unnamed source as speculating that the North changed its war plan “ to better deal with the upgraded weapons systems of the U.S. and South Korean forces . ”
And it quotes an unnamed military expert as explaining that the 2003 Iraq
War convinced the North Koreans they would lose if they tried to slog it out over time using their outdated mechanized forces against U.S. weapons systems equipped for precision targeting .
The new plan , it says , has added light infantry divisions at the front line to increase the speed with which the North could achieve a fait accompli by taking Seoul .
The JoongAng Ilbo article noted that South Korean military officials think North Korea has acquired late - model torpedoes from Iran , in exchange for submarines , and plans to use them to prevent a U.S. - South Korean landing behind the front lines .
Reports increasingly point to a North Korean torpedo as the cause of a mysterious recent explosion that sank a South Korean warship .
With defector reports saying the North has trained zealous military men to pilot manned torpedoes in suicide runs , comparisons to imperial Japan are tempting .
For Americans with tens of thousands of troops stationed in South Korea and a commitment to defend the South against renewed attack , 1941 Japan is a troubling precedent of an enemy that by most objective analysis lacked the power to take on the United States but attacked anyhow and hoped to prevail thanks to guile and guts .
( The Confederacy with its attack on the union ’s Fort Sumter is another such precedent . )
The comparisons to wartime Japan have also received a boost from the recent publication by North Korea propaganda expert B.R. Myers of a fascinating book " The Cleanest Race : How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters . "
“ The assumption prevails that the worst Pyongyang would ever do is sell nuclear material or expertise to more dangerous forces in the Middle East , ” Myers writes .
“ All the while the military - first regime has been invoking kamikaze slogans last used by imperial Japan in the Pacific War . ”
Baby girl survives after being shot in the chest in parents ' ' global warming suicide pact '
Survivor :
The seven - month - old baby girl is recovering in hospital after she was shot by her parents
A seven - month - old baby girl survived three days alone with a bullet in her chest beside the bodies of her parents and toddler brother .
Argentines Francisco Lotero , 56 , and Miriam Coletti , 23 , shot their children before killing themselves after making an apparent suicide pact over fears about global warming .
Their son Francisco , two , died instantly after being hit in the back .
But their unnamed daughter cheated death after the bullet from her dad 's handgun missed her vital organs .
Paramedics rushed her to hospital covered in blood when police alerted by worried neighbours discovered the massacre three days later .
The youngster is recovering in hospital in the town of Goya in the northern Argentine province of Corrientes , where doctors say she is out of danger .
Her parents said they feared the effects of global warming in a suicide note discovered by police .
Climate change is sometimes presented in simple black and white terms .
You either believe it or you do n't .
Perhaps after the recent controversies over email leaks and melting Himalayan glaciers , some may have decided to change camp .
But this is a false dichotomy .
Indeed the notion of " belief " plays no role at all in science , whether about climate change or anything else .
The Royal Society , the UK 's national academy of science , was founded 350 years ago on this very basis , with the motto Nullius in verba , or " take nobody 's word for it " .
The founders took nothing for granted and chose to investigate observations and search for the conclusions that best fit them .
The notion that these conclusions can never be considered certain and immutable , underpinned both their actions and those that came after them .
As James Gleick wrote about the great 20th century theoretical physicist Richard Feynman ; he believed in the primacy of doubt , not as a blemish on our ability to know , but as the essence of knowing .
Modern day weather prediction is inherently uncertain .
Every day , weather forecast centres will generate an ensemble , typically of 50 individual weather predictions , in order to assess uncertainty in the weather up to a week or more ahead .
The individual predictions have very slightly different starting conditions , reflecting the fact that the weather observations which generate a forecast 's initial state are neither complete nor wholly accurate .
When the atmosphere is in a predictable state , all 50 predictions are more or less identical for the coming week and the forecaster can say with great confidence what the weather will be like .
On the other hand , when the atmosphere is in a chaotic state , the best the forecaster can talk about are probabilities of different outcomes .
Some , perhaps those without scientific training , may see probabilistic predictions as an evasion of responsibility .
However , in reality , probabilistic predictions embody the scientific method .
In any case , what is better for decision making , a forecast with some realistic measure of uncertainty , or some grossly overconfident prediction with no hint of uncertainty ?
Worldwide , probabilistic weather forecasts are now used by those making decisions to evacuate people exposed to river flooding , or to intense storms .
For better or for worse , they are also central to who trade on future energy prices and other weather - sensitive commodities .
Similar " ensemble " methods are used to predict climate change , except here it is also critical to vary uncertain parameters in the climate models as well as uncertain estimates of how greenhouse gas emissions will change over the course of the century .
As with the weather forecasts , contemporary climate predictions are essentially probabilistic .
Hence for example , based on the ensemble of the world 's climate models , we can estimate that over the Asian monsoon region , a season that was so wet it would only have a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in the 20th century , could have a 1 in 3 chance of occurring by the end of the 21st century .
We do n't have to believe that our house will burn down in the coming year to take out insurance .
Similarly we do n't have to believe that dangerous climate change will occur to take action to cut emissions .
A key question that everyone concerned by the climate change issue should ask , particularly those who are sceptical , is this .
How large does the probability of serious climate change have to be before we should start cutting emissions ?
To be specific , how large does the probability have to be that by the end of this century , large parts of Bangladesh will under water because of sea level rise and a substantially more intense monsoon system ?
Or that the Amazonian rainforest will die because of shifts in rainfall patterns over South America ?
Or that the type of drought that plagued sub -Saharan Africa in the 1980s will become a quasi- permanent feature ?
0.1 % , 1 % , 10 % , 50 % ?
Considered this way , it 's clear that the dichotomy between the " climate believers " vs " climate sceptics " is indeed a false one .
The scientific method is sometimes described as " organised scepticism " , and this , rather than some logical progression from one certainty to the next , characterises the inherently uncertain path of scientific progress .
As one leading climate scientist put it : " In truth , we are all climate sceptics . "
However , despite the climate scientists ' best efforts at scepticism , it simply has not been possible to rule out the risk of the sort of climate changes discussed above .
Handling uncertainty is key to the scientific method , but , conversely , the existence of uncertainty is not itself cause for inaction .
• Tim Palmer is a Royal Society 2010 Anniversary Research Professor at the Unversity of Oxford , and is organiser of a two - day discussion meeting at the Royal Society ( 22 - 23 March ) on Handling Uncertainty in Science .
The meeting includes speakers as diverse as Professor Sir Roger Penrose , eminent cosmologist and theoretical physicist , and Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England .

… it ’s driven by the same old media love affair with distribution lock in .
I ’ve been on about this ever since I studied Google in 2001 : Media traditionally has gained its profits by owning distribution .
Cable carriage , network airwaves , newsstand distribution and printing presses : all very expensive , so once you employ enough capital to gain them , it ’s damn hard to get knocked out .
The web changed all that and promised that economics in the media business would be driven by content and intent : the best content will win , driven by the declared intent of consumers who find it and share it .
Search + Social was the biggest wave to hit media since the printing press .
And the open technology to make better and better experiences has been on a ten year tear : blogging software , Flash , Ajax , HTML 5 , Android , and more and more coming .
But the iPad , just like the iPhone , is designed for vertical integration and distribution lock in .
Apple is building its own distribution channel , just as it did with iTunes , and media companies are falling over themselves to make an app for that .
Why ?
Well sure , for once , it ’s sexy and cool and hip .
That ’s why everyone loved the Wired demo .
But the real reason media companies love the iPad is the same reason I do n’t :
It ’s an old school , locked in distribution channel that does n’t want to play by the new rules of search + social .
Sure , you can watch a movie on it .
Sure , you can read a book on it .
And sure , you can read a publication on it .
But if you want to use the web natively , with all the promise that the web brings to media ?
Not so much .
Apple will include a browser , of course .
But will media you find through that browser be able to interact with the iPad platform so as to bring full value to you , the consumer ?
Nope .
Not unless that same media is approved by Apple and makes it into the iPad app store .
And that ’s why I do n’t like the iPad .
Do n’t tell me , as a media maker , what I can make and how I can leverage the technology in my audience ’s hands .
And do n’t tell me , as a media consumer , what ’s OK for me to interact with , and how .
Yep , I really do n’t like what the iPad augurs .
And I hope , in the end , it ’s consigned to what it should be : A sexy version of a portable DVD player - cum - Kindle .
Nice to have .
Not a game changer .
Certainly not revolutionary .
Unless you ’re longing for yesteryear , when owning distribution meant owning audiences .
Oh , and by the way , Traditional Media Folk :
This time Apple owns that distribution channel , not you .
Harumph .
Jewish World Review March 17 , 2010 / 2 Nissan 5770 The Warmers Strike Back By Walter Williams
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com | Stephen Dinan's Washington Times article " Climate Scientist to Fight Back at Skeptics , " ( March 5 , 2010 ) tells of a forthcoming campaign that one global warmer said needs to be " an outlandishly aggressively partisan approach " to gut the credibility of skeptics .
" Climate scientists at the National Academy of Sciences say they are tired of ' being treated like political pawns ' and need to fight back … "
Part of their strategy is to form a nonprofit organization and use donations to run newspaper ads to criticize critics .
Stanford professor and environmentalist Paul Ehrlich , in one of the e-mails obtained by the Washington Times said , " Most of our colleagues do n't seem to grasp that we 're not in a gentlepersons ' debate , we 're in a street fight against well - funded , merciless enemies who play by entirely different rules . "
Professor Thomas Sowell 's most recent book , " Intellectuals and Society , " has a quote from Eric Hoffer , " One of the surprising privileges of intellectuals is that they are free to be scandalously asinine without harming their reputation . "
Environmentalist Professor Paul Ehrlich , who 's giving advice to the warmers , is an excellent example of Hoffer 's observation .
Ehrlich in his widely read 1968 book , " The Population Bomb , " predicted , " The battle to feed humanity is over .
In the 1970s , the world will undergo famines .
Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now .
Population control is the only answer . "
Ehrlich also predicted the earth 's then - 5 billion population would starve back to 2 billion people by 2025 .
In 1969 , Dr. Ehrlich warned Britain 's Institute of Biology , " If I were a gambler , I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000 . "
Despite these asinine predictions , Ehrlich has won no less than 16 awards , including the 1980 Crafoord Prize , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ' highest award .
Stanford University professor and environmentalist activist Stephen H. Schneider is another scientist involved in the warmer retaliation .
In a 1989 Discover Magazine interview , Professor Schneider said , " We have to offer up scary scenarios , make simplified dramatic statements , and make little mention of any doubts we may have .
Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest . "
Former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth , now president of the United Nations Foundation , in 1990 said , " We 've got to ride the global warming issue .
Even if the theory of global warming is wrong , we 'll be doing the right thing , in terms of economic policy and environmental policy . "
Environmental activist predictions have been dead wrong .
In National Wildlife ( July 1975 ) , Nigel Calder warned , " … the threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind . "
In the same issue , C.C. Wallen of the World Meteorological Organization warned , " The cooling since 1940 has been large enough and consistent enough that it will not soon be reversed . "
George Woodwell 's , founder of the Woods Hole Research Center , comments suggest that the warmers are gearing up for a big propaganda push .
In one of his e-mails , Woodwell said that researchers have been ceding too much ground .
He criticized Pennsylvania State University for their academic investigation of Professor Michael Mann , who wrote many of the e-mails leaked from the Britain 's now disgraced Climate Research Unit .
Stephen Dinan's Washington
Times article reports , " In his e-mail , Mr. Woodwell acknowledged that he is advocating taking ' an outlandishly aggressively partisan approach ' but said scientists have had their ' classical reasonableness ' turned against them , " adding , " ' We are dealing with an opposition that is not going to yield to facts or appeals from people who hold themselves in high regard and think their assertions and data are obvious truths . ' "
Fortunately , for the American people , Sen. James M. Inhofe , R- Okla. , is considering asking the Justice Department to investigate whether climate scientists who receive taxpayer - funded grants have falsified data .
He has identified 17 taxpayer - supported scientists who have been major players in the global warming conspiracy .

Editor ’s Note : Please see LD ’s update to this fascinating story just published on Tuesday evening February 2nd at 10:02 PM .
With friends like these , who needs enemies ?
I have written previously on the importance of strong relationships while working on Wall Street .
While the Wall Street numbers and dollars are voluminous , ultimately Wall Street is a ‘ people business . ’
I have also written previously how ‘ information is everything ’ on Wall Street .
Traders work tirelessly to determine what is moving or what will move the market .
Utilizing this information , millions of dollars can be made or lost in the course of a very short time span .
Combining these two critically important factors , it should be no surprise how some will use – but then abuse – these two primary cornerstones of our financial industry .
Folllowing this line of reasoning , are you ever shocked when a guy who cheats on his wife also then cheats on his girlfriend ?
Where am I going with this ?
Let ’s enter the world of David Slaine , the government ’s mole in the insider trading scandal currently rocking Wall Street .
I will profess , I am truly shocked this morning reading how Slaine ’s identity and story are reported in The Wall Street Journal ’s Wired on Wall Street : Trader Betrays a Friend :
For more than a year , Mr. Slaine , a senior Wall Street trader , was a government mole who wore a wire strapped to his torso , helping prosecutors to build the biggest insider - trading case in two decades .
Using extensive contacts developed over a 27 - year Wall Street career , Mr. Slaine has provided leads on possible insider trading by others not yet implicated in a sprawling case involving hedge fund Galleon Group , people familiar with the matter say .
That case has rocked Wall Street and Silicon Valley and raised questions about the integrity of the nation ’s financial markets .
Mr. Slaine ’s identity as an informant is being revealed by The Wall Street Journal for the first time .
In a brief telephone interview Thursday night , Mr. Slaine said : “ You got the wrong guy . ”
He said he has “ nothing to do with that case . ”
He declined to provide a lawyer ’s name .
A criminal complaint filed in a New York federal court in November describes in detail the involvement of a cooperating source dubbed “ CS - 1 . ”
The Wall Street Journal has confirmed that Mr. Slaine is that cooperating source .
This story of his involvement in the case was pieced together from information contained in the complaint and from interviews with Wall Street traders , lawyers and government officials involved the case .
Mr. Slaine ’s saga demonstrates how the U.S. has used Wall Street players to go undercover and turn on their colleagues .
Mr. Slaine , 50 years old , has told prosecutors , among other things , that his friend and weight - lifting partner , Craig Drimal , traded on inside information .
In November , Mr. Drimal was arrested at his Weston , Conn. , home .
Mr. Drimal declined to comment .
The insider trading scandal and investigation is unique in the fact that informants like Slaine are wearing a wire to collect information and implicate co-conspirators .
That said , why is The Wall Street Journal revealing Slaine ’s identity and story at this point ?
Is the government sacrificing his identity in order to send a message to others within the industry or did the WSJ actually compromise the investigation with this story ?
Do you think Slaine will be looking over his back ?
Do you think others within the industry are now wondering who else is wearing a wire ?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer .

SQL Server 2008 : Accessing Audit Details
By Muthusamy Anantha Kumar aka The MAK
Learn how to use the SQL Server 2008 catalog view and dynamic management view to access the audit details of existing server and database level audits .
Previous articles have illustrated the Auditing feature of SQL Server , namely creating a server level audit , database level audit and granular level database level audit .
This article illustrates how to use the SQL Server 2008 catalog view and dynamic management view to access the audit details of existing server and database level audits .
The first and foremost information that any database administrator needs to know is what audits are defined on the server .
You can find that by using the following catalog view .
[ Refer Fig 1.0 ]
select Name , is_state_enabled , type_desc from sys.server_audits
Fig 1.0
The column Type_Desc gives you the target information of the audit defined .
Here we see that Compliance_Server_audit goes to the Windows Application Log and the other two audit 's targets are pointing to a file .
You can also view this information from SQL Server Management Studio under the Security \Audit folder as shown below .
[ Refer Fig 1.1 ]
Fig 1.1
The next level of detail that a database administrator should know is the location of the target , size and status of the audit itself .
You can find that by using the following Dynamic management view .
[ Refer Fig 1.3 ]
select name , status_desc , audit_file_path , audit_file_size from sys.dm_server_audit_status
Click for larger image
Fig 1.3
From the result , you can see that the target for both compliance_database_audit and MyDB_Database_Granular_Audit points to C: \SQLAudit and the file size are shown as 5MB .
We can verify the location and size using windows explorer as shown below .
[ Refer Fig 1.4 ]
Click for larger image
Fig 1.4
This information can also be viewed from the SQL Server Management studio using Audit properties .
[ Refer Fig 1.5 ]
Click for larger image
Fig 1.5
More detailed information about the auditing with FILE as target can be found using the following catalog view .
[ Refer Fig 1.6 ]
select name , on_failure , max_file_size , max_rollover_files , log_file_path , log_file_name from sys.server_file_audits
Fig 1.6
Details of a database audit specification of an individual database audit can be retrieved using the following two catalog views .
[ Refer Fig 1.7 ]
select * from sys.database_audit_specification_details where database_specification_id in ( select database_specification_id from sys.database_audit_specifications where name =' MyDB_Database_Granular_Audit_SPEC ')
Fig 1.7
The information can be retrieved using SQL Server Management studio under database MyDB\Security \Database Audit Specification .
[ Fig 1.8 ]
Fig 1.8
You can check the extended events that are created by SQL server related to this audit using the following dynamic management view command .
[ Refer Fig 1.9 ]
select s.name as [ session name ] , se.event_name as [ event name ] , p.name as [ package name ] , t.target_name as [ target name ] from sys.dm_xe_sessions s join sys.dm_xe_session_events se on s.address = se.event_session_address join sys.dm_xe_packages p on se.event_package_guid = p.guid join sys.dm_xe_session_targets t on s.address=t.event_session_address
Fig 1.9
There are other metadata information about the audit that can be retrieved using dynamic management views .
They are ;
sys.dm_audit_actions :
This view contains information about every audit action that can be reported in the audit log and every audit action group that can be configured as part of SQL Server Audit .
sys.dm_audit_class_type_map :
This dynamic management view maps the class_type field in the audit log to the class_desc field in sys.dm_audit_actions view .
Example :
Select top 10 action_id , name , class_desc , parent_class_desc from sys.dm_audit_actions
Result :
action_id , name , class_desc , parent_class_desc
----------------------------------------------
R , REVOKE , DATABASE , SERVER D , DENY , DATABASE , SERVER G , GRANT , DATABASE , SERVER GWG , GRANT WITH GRANT , DATABASE , SERVER RWG , REVOKE WITH GRANT , DATABASE , SERVER RWC , REVOKE WITH CASCADE , DATABASE , SERVER DWC , DENY WITH CASCADE , DATABASE , SERVER R , REVOKE , OBJECT , DATABASE D , DENY , OBJECT , DATABASE G , GRANT , OBJECT , DATABASE
Example :
select top 20 * from sys.dm_audit_class_type_map
Result :
class_type , class_type_desc , securable_class_desc
------------------------------------------------
DB , DATABASE , DATABASE OB , OBJECT , OBJECT TY , TYPE , TYPE SC , SCHEMA , SCHEMA SX , XML SCHEMA COLLECTION , XML SCHEMA COLLECTION AS , ASSEMBLY , ASSEMBLY US , USER , USER RL , ROLE , ROLE AR , APPLICATION ROLE , APPLICATION ROLE MT , MESSAGE TYPE , MESSAGE TYPE CT , CONTRACT , CONTRACT SV , SERVICE , SERVICE BN , REMOTE SERVICE BINDING , REMOTE SERVICE BINDING RT , ROUTE , ROUTE FC , FULLTEXT CATALOG , FULLTEXT CATALOG FL , FULLTEXT STOPLIST , FULLTEXT STOPLIST SK , SYMMETRIC KEY , SYMMETRIC KEY CR , CERTIFICATE , CERTIFICATE AK , ASYMMETRIC KEY , ASYMMETRIC KEY SR , SERVER , SERVER
Last but not least is getting the actual data from the target files .
This can be retrieved using the following function .
SELECT session_server_principal_name , database_name , schema_name , Object_name , statement FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file ( 'C:\SQLAudit\MyDB_Database_*.sqlaudit' , default , default ) ;
Result :
session_server_principal_name , database_name , schema_name , Object_name , ---------------------------------------------------------------------- statement ----------

SELECT @1 MyLogin , MyDB , dbo , mytable , INSERT INTO [ mytable ]
SELECT @1 MyLogin , MyDB , dbo , mytable , INSERT INTO [ mytable ]
SELECT @1 MyLogin , MyDB , dbo , mytable , UPDATE [ mytable ] set [ id ] = @1 WHERE [ id]=@2
Conclusion
Part 1 through part 4 of this series illustrated the various components involved in SQL Server auditing as well as demonstrates how to create server level , database level and audit level audit using action and action group specification provided by Microsoft SQL Server 2008 .

Infinity Ward Has Not Received Royalties for Modern Warfare 2
Activision 's sudden dismissal of Infinity Ward co-founders Jason West and Frank Zampella and locking out IW employees from their own offices has raised a lot of questions .
As new information becomes clear , some of these questions are being answered .
According to anonymous statements given to Binge Gamer 's James Walker , Activision has yet to pay Infinity Ward so much as a dime in royalties for ' Modern Warfare 2 ' , which has earned Activision over one billion dollars in revenue .
Additionally , a separate source has suggested that Activision 's reasoning for firing West and Zampella for " breaches of contract " may be tied to what Infinity Ward was intending to do after their contract with Activision expires in October , 2010 .
A Scottish whisky firm has unveiled bottles of what it claims is the oldest single malt whisky in the world .
Gordon and MacPhail 's Mortlach 70 - Year - Old Speyside was sampled at a launch party in Edinburgh Castle , where it was escorted through the doors by pipers and a military escort .
" It matured for 70 years in the cask and that is what makes it the oldest whisky in the world , " a spokeswoman for Gordon and MacPhail said .
The whisky was filled into its cask on October 15 , 1938 , by the grandfather of the company 's managing directors David and Michael Urquhart .
There will only be 54 full - size bottles priced at 10,000 pounds each ( $ 16,450 ) , with another 162 smaller bottles on sale for 2,000 pounds .
The limited edition malt was matured in a former sherry hogshead cask made from Spanish oak .
It has been bottled in a " tear shaped , hand - blown " crystal decanter with a silver stopper .
Whisky taster Charles MacLean described the single malt as " a delicate , fresh , vital , fruity whisky , with unusual attributes of waxiness and smokiness " .
" It 's the oldest cask of whisky that , in my knowledge , has ever been bottled , " he said .
" The spirit and the wood have inter - reacted beautifully over this long period of time . "

The collision in early February of the 60 - mile - long B - 9B iceberg with the protruding tongue of the Mertz Glacier in East Antarctica is captured here in a series of satellite radar images .
The crash created a second massive iceberg nearly 50 miles long and 25 miles wide , named C - 28 .
The name means that it's the 28th glacier since 1976 that has broken off from the quadrant of Antarctica that faces Australia .
The two icebergs have since drifted into a polynya , which is an area of open water that 's surrounded by sea ice but stays unfrozen for much or all of the year .
The bergs are obstructing the ocean circulation created by the polynya , and could deprive local marine life of oxygen if they do n't move .
The images were taken by the synthetic - aperture - radar instrument aboard the European Space Agency 's Envisat satellite .

Let 's face it : any script kiddie with a pair of pliers can put Red Hat on a Compaq , his mom 's toaster , or even the family dog .
But nothing earns you geek points like installing Linux on a dead badger .
Your first step is to find the proper dead badger .
A specimen from a zoo is ideal , but most people can find suitable badgers as roadkill along highways in many parts of North America , the British Isles , Europe , and Asia .
When you find a dead badger , check it carefully for spinal , skull , and leg damage .
A dead animal wo n't heal , and a badger with broken legs will have limited mobility .
Brain and spinal cord damage is likely to interfere with the Linux installation and render any successfully - installed system unstable .
Be certain to wear latex or polyurethane gloves when handling your dead badger as a precaution against becoming infected with diseases it might carry ; it 's also a good idea to wash the carcass with a decent flea - killing shampoo .
You 'll minimally need :
a pocketknife a computer with : a CD drive
USB , Ethernet , or a free slot for a wireless networking card
a Telnet or SSH client installed
a cyberspiritual controller program like FleshGolem ( MacOSX and Linux ) , Phranken ( Windows 98 , ME , 2000 ) , or ItzaLive ( MacOS 8.1 - 9.x and Amiga ) .
a Duppy card ( available in CardBus and PCI models ) or a SpiritInTheSky external adapter ( available in ethernet and USB models ) a copy of VüDü Linux ( available from Twisted Faces Software ) a screwdriver to install the new card a 3 ' x3 ' fireproof surface privacy -- your Friday night LAN party is not a good environment to try this
For my test installation , I used a 400MHz clamshell iBook and did my work on the concrete floor of my garage .
My first step was to visit the Apple software site and download a copy of FleshGolem from their utilities section .
Installation is pretty straightforward , but be sure to read the readme .
txt file .
The program works with both Duppy cards and SpiritInTheSky adapters .
Next , I put my Duppy card into my iBook .
Duppy cards work best if you 're using a Mac with an Airport slot ; I found the response on the external SpiritInTheSky adapter to be sluggish .
The card has a hinged lid and a clear cover over what looks like a small , shallow ivory box .
You pop the cover open , and then you take some hair and blood from the badger and put it in the compartment .
You do n't need much tissue , really .
If one were to try this with a human corpse one would want to use pubic hair pulled out by the root .
( But one really , really does n't want to mess with human corpses , does one ?
That kind of thing leads to excommunication and long prison sentences , even if it is a terribly entertaining way to spend a quiet evening in the cemetery .
But I digress . )
After I 'd loaded and closed the card , I installed it in my iBook 's Airport slot by unlatching the small white tabs at the top of the keyboard .
I lifted the keyboard assembly off , being careful of the wires , and put the card in the slot .
Once I had the keyboard back in place , I was ready to install the Duppy card 's security antenna in the badger .
Every cyberspiritual card should come with such an antenna , so if you purchase a package that does n't have one , take it back and get a replacement .
You can run your badger without it , but it'd be pretty easy for someone to hack your badger if they could get close and get some blood and hair for their own card .
Duppy makes sure that each card and antenna are uniquely coded to each other , so when the antenna 's installed properly , the badger will only respond to a computer with the card that matches the antenna .
To install the antenna , I made a small incision with my pocketknife at the nape of the badger 's neck .
Then , I shoved the antenna down the badger 's back under the hide .
You need to get the antenna to lie as flat as possible along the spine , or your security wo n't be optimal .
You can also cut the badger 's back skin open , but that 's a lot messier and requires you to sew the thing up afterward .
Next came the fun part : installing Linux on the badger .
I first installed the software components on my iBook .
VüDü is compatible with all operating systems , and that part of the installation is pretty straightforward .
VüDü is a cool little SuSE port .
Some of the German software engineers who worked on SuSE moved to Jamaica and started up Twisted Faces Software .
Excellent product , I highly recommend it .
The default partitioning is pretty simple ; / boot goes in the spinal cord , the root partition goes on the left hemisphere of the brain , and the swap files go on the right .
If you 're working with a badger with damage to one of those areas , you can repartition one or the other brain hemisphere , but it 's a pain .
Read the manual before you try it .
Your system configuration information and the spiritual components of the package come on a small , rolled - up piece of parchment .
There 's room for you to write in your password , plus any auxilliary programs like NecroNull .
The VüDü package comes with two scrolls , but you can use your own blessed parchment if you know a voodoo priest or priestess .
When modifying the scroll , be sure to use chicken blood - based ink , and write neatly -- if you can't read it , the ambient spirits probably can't , either !
You do n't need to get every last little big of information in -- you can Telnet into your badger later to change the configuration .
The language on the scroll is fairly flexible -- VüDü is written in Soulscript , but I 've seen successful additions in Latin and Hebrew .
After I had my parchment written up , I rolled it up and stuck it down the badger 's throat , all the way into the stomach .
Use your screwdriver or a pencil to get it all the way in .
The next step was to install VüDü itself .
In your box , you 'll find a large square of herb - scented paper .
This is the entire code behind VüDü .
You must fold this paper into an origami shape resembling the animal you 're installing VüDü on .
There are folding directions for common animals in the box , but if you need more , visit any origami site on the web .
Do n't lose the paper ; replacements are expensive .
There are recipies for homemade paper out on the Web , but even if you get the herbs right , getting all the information written down is a huge task .
I folded my paper into a badger shape , making a hollow inside where I put more blood and hair from the animal .
I put the badger in the middle of the garage floor , then used the creature 's blood to smear a foot - wide pentagram on the concrete around its body .
I set the origami code badger at the top point of the pentagram , and lit the paper while making the boot incantation :
Suse vivo vixi victum reduco is ea id creatura absit decessus a facultas Linux !
Dev root , dev root !
The paper should burn with green flames -- black or gray means the herbs are all wrong and the whole thing 's a wash .
Purple means you should run for your life .
The smoke should flow over your badger and into its mouth and nose .
After you 've completed your incantation , you should see your badger shudder awake .
If so -- congratulations !
You 've got your very own Linux - controlled zombie badger !
My badger woke up pretty angry ( reanimation puts most creatures in a foul mood ) so I had to quickly launch FleshGolem to get the beast under control .
So , it 's best to have your computer close at hand when you 're making your incantation .
If the badger is n't responding correctly , you may need to make some configuration adjustments via Telnet ; instructions are in the VüDü manual .
If your badger still appears dead after you 've made your incantation -- call Twisted Faces ' tech support .
You get two calls free when you buy your software ( after that , tech support will cost you an arm and a leg ... or somebody else 's arm and leg ; Twisted Faces wo n't care where you ship the parts from , as long as they get them before they spoil . )
Good luck , and happy badgering !

The Pookah project does this all automatically , it 's on soulforge and is listed on freshermeat .
/ me replies :
Well , sure , but first you have to install GaelOS , and there 's just not a good build for Macs and Amigas yet .
And I 've found the HarveyTheRabbit utilities that come with Pookah create an awful lot of invisible files , making it hard to manage hard drive space .
Also , NecroNull just wo n't run right on Pookah .

On Friday of last week , and Monday and Tuesday of this week , I presented the following posts :
Further Feedback From Kevin Trenberth And Feedback From Josh Willis On The UCAR Press Release
Comments On Two Papers By Kevin Trenberth On The Global Climate Energy Budget
Is There “ Missing ” Heat In The Climate System ?
My Comments On This NCAR Press Release
My son had the post
The Missing Heat
I want to summarize today what are the main conclusions from this exchange of perspectives :
First , when colleagues who differ can interact in a constructive manner , we all benefit by an improved understanding of the science issues and the way forward to resolve remaining uncertainties .
In terms of climate science , a very substantive conclusion from this interchange of perspectives is that we do not need to continue to use the global average surface temperature trend ( with its unresolved biases and uncertainties ) to diagnose global warming .
The trends in the upper ocean heat content , which has been accurately measured since at least 2005 , and will for the foreseeable future , should be adopted as the primary metric to monitor global warming .
This second finding does not mean continued analyses of surface temperatures and their anomalies are not needed [ they certainly are for length of growing season , heating degree days , etc ] , but for the specific metric of global warming ( and cooling ) , it is an inadequate metric compared with ocean heat content changes .
We need near - real time plots of the ocean heat content changes over time , such as given in the figure in
Pielke Sr. , R.A. , 2008 : A broader view of the role of humans in the climate system .
Physics Today , 61 , Vol. 11 , 54 -55 .
Four - year rate of the global upper 700 m of ocean heat changes in Joules at monthly time intervals .
One standard error value is also shown .
( Figure courtesy of Josh Willis of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) .
It will be illuminating and informative to see how NCDC ( Tom Karl ) , GISS ( Jim Hansen ) , and CRU ( Phil Jones ) respond to this recognition that it is time to move past the surface temperature trend as the “ gold standard ” of global warming .
“ Patricia was a soulful artist , mature and poised , ” Mr. Maazel wrote from Europe in a recent e-mail message .
“ One did n’t think of her as a child prodigy . ”
If the young Ms. Travers was “ reticent and somewhat withdrawn , ” as Mr. Maazel recalled , onstage she came alive with a fire that drew praise from most critics .
Writing in 1939 , when she was 11 , the journal Violins and Violinists rhapsodized , “ We feel sure that the prophecy that Patricia Travers is to become known as one of the great women violinists will be fully realized . ”
But with such prophecies comes great pressure , and many prodigies eventually undergo a psychological crisis .
“ It hits at adolescence , ” said Professor Winner , the author of “ Gifted Children : Myths and Realities ” ( Basic Books , 1996 ) .
“ That ’s when they say : ‘ Who am I doing this for ?
My parents or me ? ’ ”
At that point , prodigies often stop playing .
Ms. Travers , however , appeared to make it through her teenage years .
She became a specialist in modern American music at a time when few performers gave it much thought .
She recorded work by Ives , Roger Sessions and Norman Dello Joio .
In 1947 , at Carnegie Hall , she gave the premiere of “ Incantation and Dance , ” written for her by the Hawaiian - born composer Dai-Keong Lee .
But when she was in her early 20s , her notices , once glowing , grew more measured .
In 1951 The Christian Science Monitor reviewed a performance of the Brahms Violin Concerto by Ms. Travers , then 23 , with the Boston Symphony :
“ Miss Travers at present appears to be in an intermediate position between two extremes , ” the review said .
“ On the one hand her foundational studies are well in the past ; she is obviously a professional who is competing very well among her peers .
On the other hand she is not yet either a brilliant technician nor a compelling interpreter . ”
The Boston engagement appeared to have been her last with a major orchestra .
“ She gradually dropped from sight , ” Mr. Maazel recalled .
“ Do n’t know why .
Probably , as happens in most early - career artists , she just lost motivation and perhaps went in quest of the proverbial lost childhood . ”
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Five more states are joining a Florida - led group of states in a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama ’s overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system , Florida ’s attorney general said on Wednesday .
The joint lawsuit led by Florida and now grouping 18 states was filed on March 23 by mostly Republican attorney generals .
It claims the sweeping reform of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system , pushed through by Democrats in the Congress after months of bitter partisan fighting , violates state - government rights in the U.S. Constitution and will force massive new spending on hard - pressed state governments .
While some legal scholars think the suits will reach the Supreme Court , many agree that the supremacy clause of the Constitution , which puts the powers of the U.S. government above those of the states , will trump the states ’ arguments .
“ We welcome the partnership of Indiana , North Dakota , Mississippi , Nevada and Arizona as we continue fighting to protect the constitutional rights of American citizens and the sovereignty of our states , ” Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said .
He is seeking the Republican nomination to run for Florida governor .
South Carolina , Nebraska , Texas , Utah , Louisiana , Alabama , Colorado , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Washington , Idaho , and South Dakota had previously joined Florida ’s lawsuit .
All of these states ’ attorneys general are Republicans , except for Louisiana , where the post is held by a Democrat .
Another state , Virginia , has filed a separate suit , arguing the new law ’s requirements that most Americans buy health insurance clash with a state law that exempts Virginians from federal fines to be imposed for not owning health insurance .
The filings have touched off political debates in many states on whether the U.S. government should be sued .
The Justice Department , which is responsible for defending U.S. law in court , has said in response to the March 23 filing that it will vigorously fight any challenges to the new healthcare law , which it insists is constitutional .
The White House has also said it believes the suits will fail .
PLAGUED BY POLITICS
Analysts at the Harvard School of Public Health predicted partisan politics would not only complicate implementation of healthcare reform , but also make it an influential factor in the congressional elections in November .
“ While the bill has been signed into law , the critical details of its implementation are far from fixed , ” said HSPH ’s Robert J. Blendon , Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis , citing a study of opinion polls on the health issue .
“ Partisan differences in views about what should happen to this law remain so great that a Republican victory in either House could change the direction of the current reforms , ” Blendon said in a statement .
While many potential voters wanted the law to be scaled back , many others wanted the law changed to expand government ’s future role , the HSPH study found .
The Florida - led lawsuit says the health overhaul -- which expands government health plans for the poor , imposes new taxes on the wealthy and requires insurers to cover people with preexisting medical conditions -- violates the Constitution ’s commerce clause by requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance .
“ On behalf of the residents in Florida and the states joining our efforts , we are committed to aggressively pursuing this lawsuit to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to prevent this unprecedented expansion of federal powers , impact upon state sovereignty , and encroachment on our freedom , ” McCollum said in a statement released by his office .
When he announced the joint lawsuit last month , McCollum said the healthcare reforms would add $ 1.6 billion to Florida ’s spending on the Medicaid health program for the poor .
Beyond raising Medicaid costs for Florida , McCollum argued in the 22 - page lawsuit that the healthcare reforms added up to an unconstitutional power grab by the federal government that would force broad reorganization of state governments and massive hirings in order to comply with the new law .
The lawsuit asks the trial court to declare that the federal government is violating the sovereignty of the states and to bar federal agencies from enforcing the new law .
A scheduling hearing is set for April 14 , 2010 , at the federal courthouse in Pensacola .
What does the @ symbol mean to you ?
New York 's Museum of Modern
Art has decided the time is right to honour the ' at ' , by officially adding the concept to its architecture and design collection .
Writing on Moma 's blog , senior curator Paola Antonelli said " physical possession of an object as a requirement for an acquisition is no longer necessary " and that that acknowledgement " sets curators free to tag the world " whether objects too large to bring into the museum , or abstract concepts .
The @ symbol , says Antonelli , has become part of the fabric of life around the world .
" Germans , Poles , and South Africans call @ ' monkey 's tail ' in each different language .
Norwegians see a pig's tail , Chinese a little mouse , and Italians and the French , a snail .
For the Russians @ symbolizes a dog , while the Finnish know @ as the ' miukumauku ' , meaning the ' sign of the meow , ' and believe that the symbol is inspired by a curled - up sleeping cat .
The @ symbol has become so significant that people feel they need to make sense of it ; hence it has inspired its own folkloric tradition ...
Tracing the history of the symbol , Antonelli explains that it dates back to the 6th or 7th century , according to some linguists , and by 16th century Venice it referred to an amphora , a measurement vessel .
It first appeared on a typewriter keyboard in 1885 and was eventually reappropriated by engineer Ray Tomlinson in 1971 - who can take credit for " imbuing it with new meaning and elevating it to defining symbol of the computer age " .
" Its potential for such succinct negotiations ( whether between man and machine , or between traditional gender classifications and the current spectrum ) and its range of application continue to expand .
It has truly become a way of expressing society 's changing technological and social relationships , expressing new forms of behavior and interaction in a new world . "
Moma has added @ to its collection as a design icon .

If you 've ever wrangled a user interface , you 've probably heard of Fitts ' Law .
It 's pretty simple – the larger an item is , and the closer it is to your cursor , the easier it is to click on .
Kevin
Hale put together a great visual summary of Fitts ' Law , so rather than over - explain it , I 'll refer you there .
The short version of Fitts ' law , to save you all that tedious reading , is this :
Put commonly accessed UI elements on the edges of the screen .
Because the cursor automatically stops at the edges , they will be easier to click on .
Make clickable areas as large as you can .
Larger targets are easier to click on .
I know , it 's very simple , almost too simple , but humor me by following along with some thought exercises .
Imagine yourself trying to click on ...
a 1 x 1 target at a random location
a 5 x 5 target at a random location
a 50 x 50 target at a random location
a 5 x 5 target in the corner of your screen
a 1 x 100 target at the bottom of your screen
Fitts '
Law is mostly common sense , and enjoys enough currency with UI designers that they 're likely to know about it even if they do n't follow it as religiously as they should .
Unfortunately , I 've found that designers are much less likely to consider the opposite of Fitts ' Law , which is arguably just as important .
If we should make UI elements we want users to click on large , and ideally place them at corners or edges for maximum clickability – what should we do with UI elements we do n't want users to click on ?
Like , say , the " delete all my work " button ?

once , and their consequences are significant and irreversible .
Applications must have ejector seat levers so that users can " occasionally " move
persistent objects in the interface , or dramatically ( sometimes irreversibly ) alter the function or behavior of the application .
The one thing that must never happen is accidental deployment of the ejector seat .
The interface design must assure that a user can never inadvertently fire the ejector seat when all he wants to do is make some minor adjustment to the program .
I can think of a half - dozen applications I regularly use where the ejector seat button is inexplicably placed right next to the cabin lights button .
Let 's take a look at our old friend GMail , for example :
I can tell what you 're thinking .
Did he click Send or Save Now ?
Well , to tell you the truth , in all the excitement of composing that angry email , I kind of lost track myself .
Good thing we can easily undo a sent mail !
Oh wait , we totally can't .
Consider my seat , or at least that particular rash email , ejected .
It 's even worse when I 'm archiving emails .
While there were at least 10 pixels between the buttons in the previous example , here there are all of ... three .
Every few days I accidentally click Report Spam when I really meant to click Archive .
Now , to Google 's credit , they do offer a simple , obvious undo path for these accidental clicks .
But I can't help wondering why it is , exactly , that these two buttons with such radically different functionality just have to be right next to each other .
Undo is powerful stuff , but would n't it be better still if I was n't pulling the darn ejector seat lever all the time ?
Would n't it make more sense to put that risky ejector seat lever in a different location , and make it smaller ?
Consider the WordPress post editor .
Here , the common Update operation is large and obviously a button – it's easy to see and easy to click on .
The less common Move to Trash operation is smaller , presented as a vanilla hyperlink , and placed well away from Update .
The next time you 're constructing a user interface , you should absolutely follow Fitts ' law .
It just makes sense .
But do n't forget to follow the opposite of Fitts ' law , too – uncommon or dangerous UI items should be difficult to click on !
New York City startup Image Space Media is one of a handful of companies working to monetize the last largely ad - free square inches on the web : images .
Display ads have long surrounded the content on most web pages .
More recently , ads have worked their way into the content itself , with in - text ads from networks like Vibrant and Kontera and transparent in - video ads on services like YouTube .
But , oddly , the vast majority of images on the web are ad - free .
ISM lets publishers place ads that appear on images when users mouse over them ; the ads , like the one shown below , are essentially the same as what you see in many YouTube videos : a transparent overlay which can be X'ed out .
ISM uses data about the image , its tags , and the surrounding content to match images with ads that are contextually relevant .
ISM had been running largely under the radar until relatively recently , relying on word of mouth for its growth .
In January , the company announced $ 2.9 million in series a funding from New Atlantic Ventures and Limelight 's Mike Gordon .
In February , it brought on former Sphere / AOL exec Jeff Yolen to head up sales , before relaunching itself publicly at SXSW last month .
ISM generated over 570,000 clicks last month , and now serves ads to 46 million unique monthly visitors , according to Quantcast .
Growth has been strong , and companies in this space have room to expand quickly , since they 're buying up unmonetized space , rather than competing with existing networks .
The big concern here , of course , is that if the biggest ad networks , especially Google , get into this space .
They could probably do a lot of damage to ISM 's growth in a hurry .
There has n't been any firm sign of this yet , but Google invested in Pixazza , an ISM competitor , last year .
Jesse Chenard , ISM 's CEO , says there is plenty of market to go around .
But margins and growth will no doubt start to look a little bleaker once the biggest players get involved , so ISM 's best shot is to get very big very soon .
With a bold and passionate show of force for education , tens of thousands of protesters took to streets and campuses across California on Thursday in a day of action :
They shut down UC - Santa Cruz , interrupted lectures with megaphones at UC - Berkeley , filled high school auditoriums in San Jose and daringly blocked rush - hour freeway traffic in Oakland .
The rallies , held from Humboldt to San Diego , drew enormous but mostly peaceful and diverse crowds — from kindergarten kids to Ph.Ds — united by a single message : Save public education .
They decried budget cuts that have forced fee hikes at the state ’s universities and crowded classrooms at all grade levels .
“ It ’s the death of the future success of our children , ” said San Mateo seventh - grade teacher Aura Smithers , who carried a symbolic coffin through the throngs marching in San Francisco ’s Civic Center Thursday evening .
“ I know it ’s a real tough economic time , but cutting education is just going to be more detrimental to our communities , to our society and to our state as a whole .
Enough is enough . ”
To cut costs , schools have truncated the number of classes offered , furloughed teachers and cut everything from clubs to counseling .
Even more severe financial trouble is on the horizon as schools drain federal stimulus money .
“ We ’re losing classes , ” said San Jose State student Lauren Gray , 22 , who protested during lunch hour and then rushed off to a psychology lecture .
“ I ’m a senior and I wo n’t be able to graduate in time . ”
Experts — confirming protesters ’ concerns — say the long - term effect of the current funding crisis could be far more expensive to the state if California loses its educated work force .
Continued cuts , according to a recent report by the California Postsecondary Education Commission , will threaten the future of a state that has long prided itself on brains and innovation .
“ Public education drives a society ’s ability to progress and to prosper , ” UC President Mark Yudoff said in support of the rallies .
Thursday ’s March 4 Day of Action was organized at UC - Berkeley but then expanded nationally with similar rallies in states across the nation where the economic downturn is also stressing state budgets and triggering education cuts .
While boisterous rallies last fall raised the call for college funding , Thursday ’s protest included new faces .
A group of six San Jose State Unified School District classified workers joined the protest in San Francisco to make sure the voices of support staff were heard .
The decline of bus drivers , cafeteria workers , classroom aides and secretaries have created real hardship for children in poorer districts , said Robin Hill , a San Jose office technician .
Cristina Ruotolo , associate professor of humanities at San Francisco State University , said she is teaching 75 students in classes that once had 55 .
The increase means less participation in classroom discussions and fewer graded assignments .
“ Sometimes there are n’t even enough chairs in the room , ” Ruotolo said .
At state universities , students fees have grown almost 50 percent higher since 2007 , while thousands fewer classes are being offered , according to the California Faculty Association .
But with record numbers of applicants , this year , Ruotolo said , coming together on Thursday felt gratifying .
“ A lot of us used furlough days to be here , ” Ruotolo said .
At San Jose State University students squeezed in their protest during lunch hour , so they would n’t miss classes .
Their theme — “ Keep The Doors Open ! ” — focused on reductions in classes and teachers , causing students to worry that they wo n’t be able to get their degree .
Students first gathered at City Hall , where professor Jonathan Karpf addressed the crowd : “ Here are the ground rules :
There will be no vandalism .
There will be no confrontation .
We will stay on sidewalks .
We will be orderly , civil — and loud . ”
Then a crowd of 650 marched along sidewalks to San Jose State ’s Tower Lawn , stopping by Room 206 at the Paseo De San Antonio Walk .
There they covered the office door of Sen.
Abel Maldonado — a moderate Republican who could be influential — with “ Please Support Education ! ” letters and chanted “ Abel Maldonado , We Need Your Support ! ”
Protests were more raucous in Oakland , Santa Cruz and Davis .
During rush hour more than 150 people were taken to jail for blocking the I -980 and I - 880 freeway , Oakland police said .
Northbound and southbound Interstate 880 were clogged as officers removed protesters who hopped onto the freeway earlier .
One protester was taken to the hospital after falling from a tree .
At Davis , protesters clashed with police , who fired bean bags , tear gas and pepper spray , as protesters locked arms and tried to block Interstate 80 , according to The California Aggie , the campus newspaper .
In Sacramento , students , teachers , parents and school employees from across California rallied at the Capitol to urge lawmakers to restore funding to public schools .
In Southern California , the largest event was in downtown Los Angeles ’ Pershing Square , where busloads of demonstrators arrived from across the region .
Police estimate 500 people gathered at UCLA ’s Bruin Plaza .
University leaders praised the movement but warned that sustained pressure on Sacramento will be needed .
“ These are students or union workers who have a stake in the game , ” UC spokesman Peter King said as he watched the downtown Oakland demonstration .
“ The greater movement will be when you see Californians who do n’t yet know they have a stake participating . ”
Hundreds packed San Jose ’s Independence High School , where Assemblyman Joe Coto said he will seek more new taxes on oil , entertainment , soda pop , golf , skiing and chartered private jets .
He also supports an initiative to overhaul the two - thirds majority needed for new taxes .
“ California is not a tax - heavy state , ” he told the Mercury News .
“ We need to broaden the tax base , look at corporate loopholes and maintain the vehicle license fee .
There are a number of ways to approach the issue . ”
California ’s pain is n’t unique .
Nationally , state support for higher education is falling and federal subsidies in many states will soon be exhausted .
Protesters rallied in Alabama , Texas and Wisconsin , where they threw punches and ice chunks .
More than 25,000 students there have been put on a waiting list after the state ’s premier financial aid program ran out of money .
As San Jose State students ended their protest , SJSU administrator Fred Najjar assigned some homework : “ We ’re not done .
Go to Sacramento .
Go write letters to our elected representatives .
It is not just about today , it is about the future of our work force and economy . ”
Then , the crowd dissolved — and students hurried to class .
Mercury News staff writers Lisa Fernandez , Mark Gomez , Bay Area News Group reporters Matt Krupnick , Neil Gonzales , Megha Satyanarayana , the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times contributed to this report .

WASHINGTON / PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Senate Democratic leaders unveiled on Thursday a “ framework ” for overhauling the country ’s “ broken ” immigration system as protests mounted against Arizona ’s crackdown on illegal immigrants .

With an estimated 10.8 million people in the United States illegally , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and fellow Democrats said the first step toward reform must be bolstered U.S. border security .
They also called for creation of a high - tech identification card for immigrant workers , a process to admit temporary workers , “ tough sanctions ” against U.S. employers who hire illegal immigrants , and , eventually , a path toward U.S. citizenship for people in the country unlawfully .
The Democratic proposal would also “ require those here illegally to register with the government , pay taxes , learn English , pass criminal background checks and go to the back of the line to earn legal status , ” Reid said .
Critics and backers of Arizona ’s controversial immigration law attribute the state ’s action to Washington ’s failure to stem the flow of illegal immigrants to the United States .
The state ’s measure , signed into law last Friday , makes it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally .
It requires state and local police to determine a person ’s immigration status if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” they are in the United States illegally .
Republican backers say the law is needed to curb crime in the desert state , which is home to some 460,000 illegal immigrants and a major corridor for drug and migrant smugglers from Mexico .
Critics say the law opens the door to racial profiling .
Although polls show broad support for Arizona ’s law both in the state and nationally , it has sparked an outcry among Latinos , civil rights activists and organized labor before planned May Day rallies this weekend .
President Barack Obama Obama welcomed the Senate Democratic plan and said , “ What has become increasingly clear is that we can no longer wait to fix our broken immigration system . ”
The president said he would work with both Democrats and Republicans on a plan for reform .
The action at the U.S. Capitol came as the first legal and political challenges to the new Arizona law were filed in the state and a small group of activists turned out to protest the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team at a game in Chicago .
Obama ’s administration said it was considering a court challenge , and Obama has called the law “ misguided . ”
But Obama said on Wednesday that Congress , having dealt with a crush of volatile issues this year , may not have “ the appetite now ” to tackle immigration reform .
‘IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN ’
Reid and fellow members of the Senate Democratic leadership made it clear they were ready to try .
Reid acknowledged he would need at least some Republican support to clear any Senate procedural roadblocks .
“ Democrats and Republicans can all agree that our immigration system is broken , ” Reid said , adding bipartisan cooperation was needed to fix it .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Immigration reform , one of the most incendiary issues in U.S. politics , is seen as unlikely to pass the Congress this election year .
Republicans have accused Reid , who faces an uphill battle for re-election in November , of calling for reform merely in a bid to rally the support of Hispanic voters in his home state of Nevada .
The Democratic “ framework ” is based largely on an outline drafted earlier by Democratic Senator Charles Schumer and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham .
But Graham has complained that Congress is not yet ready to move on it .
Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said the Democratic effort should focus more on border security .
“ Instead of fixing our broken borders , Washington politicos are playing a cynical game of introducing so - called immigration reform that I fear will turn into nothing more than amnesty ” for illegal immigrants , Hatch said .
LAWSUITS
In Arizona , a group of activists filed a petition with the secretary of state seeking a measure on the November ballot that would put the law before voters .
The group , One Arizona , has until late July or early August to submit the more than 76,000 signatures needed to get the initiative on the ballot .
The first two lawsuits challenging the law were filed in federal courts in Arizona -- one by a Tucson police officer and the other by the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders .
“ It is an attempt by Arizona to regulate immigration and that is a responsibility and authority that belongs exclusively to the federal government under our constitution , ” Thomas Saenz , president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , told a news conference and rally outside the state capitol in Phoenix .
Saenz ’s organization , and the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center said they also planned legal challenges .
Despite the outcry , a Rasmussen Reports poll on Wednesday found nearly two - thirds -- 64 percent -- of Arizona voters favored the statute .
A telephone survey this week showed 60 percent of voters nationwide backed such a law .
Diving with giants :
The extraordinary shots that capture the gentleness of nature 's largest predator
These incredible pictures shows the gentleness of giant sperm whales as they play near the surface .
Taken in Dominica in the Caribbean , the pod even allows snorkellers to touch and interact with them .
Hunted for their oil and demonised as savage brutes in fiction such as Herman Melville 's Moby Dick , these pictures show a gentler side to one of the planet 's largest mammals .
They were taken by Dr Peter G Allinson , from Florida , who specialises in Underwater and Hyperbaric Medicine who travels to Dominica on a regular basis to highlight these magnificent creatures .
Diving with predators : Divers swim with giant sperm whales in the warm waters off Dominica in the Caribbean
Dr Allinson , 61 , said : ' When they interact with us they approach us very closely , rolling over again and again , trying to get us to rub their abdomens and bodies .
' When you start getting close to them you feel nervous , intimidated and then as they interact with you pleasure - you realise they are intelligent . '
Dr Allinson said that although there are about 150 off the coast of Dominica , they are hard to find .
Boats use sonar and spout sightings to locate them , but it is quite rare to find them in a relaxed and playful mood .
They only use snorkels when they swim with them , as the air bubbles from scuba tanks disturbs them .
He added : ' Generally I spend four days to a week trying to photograph the whales .
Gentle giants :
The whales are so relaxed they allow the swimmers to pet and interact with them
' There are about 150 whales living offshore of Dominica , but they are not always there or easy to find .
' Most of the boats we have used utilise a hydrophone to locate the general area they are in and visual sightings of their spouts to pinpoint their location .
' The whales come to the surface to breathe and socialize .
They stay on the surface anywhere from about 15 minutes to over an hour .
' They are truly beautiful creatures and I photograph them in the hopes of helping to save the whales .
' The more people who understand these wonderful animals the better . '
Sperm whales have the largest brain of any animal , are the largest toothed animal and the largest living predator .
Hold that pose : Sperm whales are the largest living predator on the planet
Diving to depths of three kilometres to feed on giant and colossal squid also makes them the deepest diving mammal .
The clicking sound they make is also the loudest sound made by any animal .
Male whales can grow up to 20.5 metres or 67 feet long and can weigh up to 57,000 kilos .
The species was named after the oily white spermeceti found in its head and used in candles , cosmetics , soap and machine oils .
From the mid 18th century until last century the whale was also hunted for its oil used in specialized lubricants , lamp oil , pencils , crayons , leather waterproofing , rust - proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds .
Ambergris , a waxy substance found in the whale 's stomach was also used as a fixative in perfumes .
Due to hunting the species is listed as vulnerable but has also gone down in folklore .
In 1820 an American whaling ship , the Essex , was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale , which inspired Herman Melville to pen the classic tale Moby Dick .
It is believed that there were more than a million sperm whales when hunting began and today with a ban their numbers are back in the hundreds of thousands .
So , this took way too long .
Also , it ’s very disorganized and I ’m not thrilled with a lot of the transitions , but I comfort myself with the thought this is not an actual comic , merely a theoretical comic .
Anyways , let us not loose sight of what ’s really important , which is , WE WON THE HOCKEY .
On to The Organist Part 4 !
TOO MANY NOTES MY DEAR MOZART !
— The tableau of exploding street musicians is a wee tribute to Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom , possibly the greatest animated short of all time .. it ’s also notable ( Babbage includes this important information in some of his little charts of the street music menace ) that a large portion , or at least a visible one , of the street musicians of London were foreigners .
With that in mind , a little 2dgoggles soundtrack for you :
Hurdy Gurdy :
Tabla :
Erhu :
— The modest lineup of scientist there waiting for the Difference Engine includes George Airy , Babbage ’s real - life nemesis , who I ’m happy to say looks suitably Scrooge - like in his caricatures ( centre of the 3rd row down ) .
Also Michael Faraday , there ’s some sort of thing where he was supposedly bad at math that I ’m totally running with , at the very least he told told Babbage that he ‘ could not understand his great work ’ .
Next to Faraday is Mary Sommerville , if anyone in the history of science ever screamed ‘ KNITTER ’ it was she .. she was a good friend of both Lovelace and Babbage and there ’s plenty I could write about her but geez these notes are already huge .
And next to her is Darwin ( good call on the beard there Darwin ) , I could n’t resist that quote of his because it ’s the most freaking ’ adorable quotation ever :
I have been much amused with an account I have received of the wars of Don Roderick & Babbage — what a grievous pity it is that the latter should be so implacable , & if one might so call the calculating machine , so very silly .
The only possible response to that is , :D !!!!!!
— You would n’t think that quote would be toppable but check out this letter from Brunel to some poor bastard :
“ Plain gentlemanly language seems to have no effect upon you .
I must try stronger language and stronger measures .
You are a cursed , lazy , inattentive , apathetic vagabond , and if you continue to neglect my instructions and to show such infernal laziness , I shall send you about your business .
I have frequently told you , amongst other absurd , untidy habits , that that of making drawings on the backs of others was inconvenient ; by your cursed neglect of that you have again wasted more of my time than your whole life is worth , in looking for the altered drawings you were to make of the station they wo n’t do . ”
HAHAHA
If I worked for Brunel I would be SO FIRED .
— ‘ confound you all ’ is from source for all goodness in this comic , Babbage ’s autobiography , the quotation on the frontsipiece is “ I ’m a philosopher .
Confound them all —
Birds , beasts , and men ; but no , not womankind . ”
From , as fate would have it , Byron ’s Don Juan .
— Just a reminder for those using the comic as a source for their history papers , the Prime Minister during the 1830s and 40s was actually Robert Peel , helpfully pre-caricatured for me by various Punch cartoonists ( which is good because he ’s not very funny looking as Victorians go ) .
Robert Peel is most famous for founding the first ( non-mathematical ) police force , which is why the London Constabulary are known as “ Bobbies ” or “ Peelers ” .
I guess Babbage and Lovelace are therefore referred to as “ Wellies ” .
Wellington ’s explanation of being more prominent in this comic on account of being ‘ cooler ’ shows his rudimentary understanding of the physics of the Pocket Universe– our current advanced understanding of this subject can best be expressed by the well - known equation that applies also to our own universe :
E=mc2
except in the Pocket Universe the ‘ E ’ represents ‘ Entertainment Value ’ .
It is thus not surprising that the massiest objects in the PU are Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace , because they are really , REALLY entertaining .
Incidentally this provides an explanation for what some of you may be wondering , viz. , what has become of Lovelace ’s husband , Lord Lovelace .
After exhaustive investigations I have determined that his Entertainment Value or E is precisely zero .
Hence , according to the above equation , either his mass , or the speed of light , must therefore also be zero , and if the speed of light was zero then you would n’t be able to see the comic .
Work is picking back up so comic production remains MOST INEFFICIENT and full of ERRORS , but then you all knew that did n’t you ?
But at some point , we finally meet The Organist :
On to The Organist Part 4 !
As the COVID - 19 public health emergency began to develop , The Mockingbird Foundation , a non-profit organization dedicated to improving access to music education , began fundraising efforts to grant money to programs that were actively developing strong responses to challenges presented by the pandemic .
In the past , the Foundation had issued Emergency Response Grants on a regional basi s , such as in the aftermath of a natural disaster .
But the pandemic presented a national - level crisis with both immediate and long - term effects , and we knew it would cause seismic shifts not only in musical teaching techniques , but also in governmental and charitable funding of music programs nationwide .
Mockingbird announced the COVID - 19 Relief fundraising effort at the end of May .
We allocated $ 25,000 of existing funds to launch this effort , while asking the Phish fan community to donate $ 25,000 , which we pledged to match , totaling $ 75,000 .
Not only did the community help us reach the goal within only two months , their collective donations were double that goal !
We are thus able to fund $ 100,000 in grants for this round of emergency giving .
We can not thank all of our donors enough for your amazing support of music education !
Hundreds of individual donations were made through our fundraising channels over the summer .
Many of the donations were exceptional and substantial , and there were sizable donations not only from new donors but from long - time donors as well .
Among the donations , sadly , were numerous tributes to family members and friends lost to COVID - 19 , dramatizing its impact on our community and the communities of many other music fans nationwide .
Our community ’s spectacular fundraising response inspired us to promptly identify needy programs that were facing new challenges arising from the pandemic .
We developed different criteria to review previous applicants and grantees , and also examined inquiries submitted for our 25th Round of annual giving within approximately the last year , the application period for which concluded on August 1st .
In addition , we researched outside our customary channels for organizations that were creatively providing - or seeking funds to try to provide - musical education to students in this time of unprecedented challenges .
Mockingbird announced our first COVID - 19 Relief Response grant to Girls Rock Detroit on June 25th , one month after launching the campaign .
The $ 5,000 grant helped their summer camp to continue virtually after they lost the ability to host in - person fundraising events .
One week later , we announced that Heartbeat Music Project in Crown Point , New Mexico , would receive $ 5,000 to support their music education program for Navajo ( Diné ) children living in the Navajo Nation , which suffered COVID - 19 related illnesses and deaths disproportionately to other regions .

Some customers stranded by a flawed BitDefender antivirus update that crippled their computers have demanded refunds and compensation for money spent fixing their PCs , according to messages on the company 's support forum .
The Saturday update quarantined hundreds , sometimes thousands , of legitimate files on Windows 64 - bit systems , including those with .exe , and .dll extensions , making it impossible to boot affected computers once they had been powered off .
BitDefender acknowledged the problem the same day , and released a patched update and workaround instructions Sunday .
Among the workarounds was a complicated procedure that required users to download a repair disk and burn it to a CD or DVD that would then be used to boot the PC so that the owner could reverse the rogue quarantining of critical files .
Users were understandably angry at BitDefender 's foul - up , and some demanded compensation for the time , money and trouble it took them to regain control of their machines .
They kicked off a thread on BitDefender 's support forum that as of mid-day Tuesday ran 14 pages , and included more than 270 messages .
Several asked for extensions to their current BitDefender licenses , but most dismissed that as insufficient , and instead demanded a full refund or more .
" I just want a refund .
Why would I want a free license key when the program that was supposed to be protecting my computer infected it ?
That would be stupid , " said a user identified as " jimwhite99 " in a message Saturday .
" I would like my money back at least , " added " ahumpage " on the same thread .
" I have removed BitDefender from my PC and will never use one of their products again .
This error is inexcusable .
Exactly how was this update tested before it was sent to unsuspecting customers ? "
Some users defended BitDefender , but they were clearly in the minority .
" I am NOT saying they are not responsible , " said " L.o.D. " yesterday .
" But the fact remains that a lot of you are coming off as if they did it on purpose . "
" I think at the very least there should be a number of remedies available to affected users , " said " NesralNeets " Monday before ticking off three possible remedies : compensate users for the money they spent fixing their PCs , offer a full refund , or extend users ' licenses by at least a year .
" BitDefender needs to take corporate responsibility seriously to restore confidence in its product / company .
They can do that by treating and compensating their customers fairly . "
Vitor Souza , BitDefender 's global marketing director , said that is what the company is trying to do .
" We 're really looking for a solution , " he said in an interview today when asked whether BitDefender would compensate affected users , and if so , how .
" Each case is different and unique , and we 're addressing each individually . "
Later in the conversation , he acknowledged that BitDefender had offered refunds and license extensions to users who asked for them .
" The number of affected users is very small , a few hundred worldwide , " Souza claimed .
" We have reached out to the customers and answered their requests , " he added .
But according to users , BitDefender has n't yet reached everyone .
" I [ am ] still waiting for BD response to my complaint on the refund , " said " lorddraco " earlier today .
" Nearly 24 hours ... no response . "
BitDefender is also still trying to puzzle out the root of the problem , acknowledged Souza .
" We 're coming very close to understanding it , " he said , adding that a mistake in the process BitDefender uses to prep an antivirus update was apparently to blame .
" In the short term , today , this week , there will be some negative , " Souza admitted , referring to the backlash over the snafu .
" But we can definitely bounce back . "
BitDefender is n't the first antivirus company to issue a damaging update , or to compensate its users .
In 2005 , Trend Micro released a flawed signature update that slowed PCs to a crawl .
Within days the company announced it would reimburse users for all repair costs .

Expect chaos in Ann Arbor on Saturday .
Expect streets to be closed , either partially or entirely .
Expect traffic jams .
Expect areas where parking is normally available to be blocked off .
And expect security to be tight - really tight .
Barack Obama
" For us here in Ann Arbor who are n't used to it , this will be an unprecedented amount of security , " said Mayor John Hieftje .
" We have n't had a sitting president in town for some time . "
Barack Obama will be the first sitting president in Ann Arbor since George H.W. Bush was here in 1991 .
Obama arrives Saturday to deliver a commencement address to a crowd of 80,000 at Michigan Stadium .
And with a presidential visit comes a unique set of logistical challenges .
The U.S. Secret Service has been in town this week , talking with Police Chief Barnett Jones and other law enforcement officials from the University of Michigan and Michigan State Police to work out a game plan .
Naturally , the details remain confidential .
Hieftje has some advice , though .
" If you 're going , get there early , and do n't expect to be able to drive through that section of town any more quickly than you would on football Saturday , " he said .
Michigan Stadium gates will open at 6:30 a.m.
Guests are urged to arrive no later than 9 a .m .
The ceremony begins at 11 a.m .
The university has made efforts to put almost all of the information anyone needs to know about commencement day on its website .
The site includes detailed maps of commencement activity locations , parking , shuttles and more .
University officials say the enhanced security means several roads and parking lots near the stadium wo n't be available for use .
In addition , the number of graduates participating this year has increased dramatically , so there will be even more congestion than normal .
Jim Kosteva , a U - M spokesman , said the university is establishing a secure area around Michigan Stadium - bordered by Stadium Boulevard to the south , Hoover Avenue to the north , Main Street to the west and the railroad tracks to the east .
" We 're certainly used to being able to conduct the major events in and around the Big House and we 're certainly used to accommodating large crowds , " he said .
" This sort of combines all those unique elements into one .
So I would say there 's a very good , well - organized team in place that 's working with the federal officials and working through our staff and working in cooperation with city police as it relates to security . "
The City Council last week approved a plan to close streets and placed limitations on activities during commencement .
Existing peddler / solicitor permits and sidewalk occupancy permits will not be valid in areas around the stadium .
University Planner Susan
Gott said the following street closures will be in effect from midnight Friday to 2 p.m. Saturday :
â€¢ Kipke Drive — closed to all vehicles and pedestrians .
â€¢ South Main Street — closed to all vehicles ( between Pauline Boulevard and East Stadium Boulevard ) , open for pedestrians .
â€¢ Keech Avenue — restricted vehicle access ( between South Main Street and Greene Street ) for shuttle bus traffic , open for pedestrians .
â€¢ Greene Street — restricted vehicle access ( between Hoover Avenue and Keech Avenue ) for shuttle bus traffic , open for pedestrians .
â€¢ East Stadium Boulevard — restricted vehicle access on one lane of westbound East Stadium Boulevard ( from Stadium Way to South Main Street ) for shuttle bus traffic , open for pedestrians .
Traffic will be detoured around the South Main Street section closure onto Pauline Boulevard , South Seventh Street and Scio Church Road .
Signage will be posted directing drivers .
Due to increased security , some lots that are closer to the stadium are closed or are for restricted parking only .
These include : SC2 , SC3 , SC4 , SC5 , SC6 , SC7 , SC11 , SC32 , SC35 , SC38 and SC41 .
All vehicles must be removed from those lots by Friday at midnight or they will be towed .
Most other parking lots and structures will be open to serve commencement guests on Saturday .
Normal U - M bus service will be limited to the spring / summer Northwood route .
This map shows parking areas that will be restricted on Saturday .
Drivers are urged to plan routes with alternatives in mind .
If traffic is re-routed to accommodate the arrival of the president ’s motorcade — Â which likely will happen sometime after 9 a.m. — police will instruct drivers on alternative routes .
Residents living in the vicinity of the stadium will be afforded game - day parking privileges on Saturday , meaning vehicles can park in any legally marked on - street space as well as private lawns and driveways .
However , there may be pedestrian or parking restrictions imposed near the stadium .
" There 's going to be a real shortage of parking in and around the stadium , " Kosteva said .
" But we are planning to implement a very aggressive set of shuttles coordinating and working from most all the area hotels as well as a number of different locations and parking structures on the Central Campus . "
University officials expect a crowd of about 80,000 inside the Big House .
Nearly 60,000 of those seats are reserved for graduates and their families .
Leftover tickets will be available to other U - M students , faculty and staff starting today .
Anyone with a university ID can request up to two tickets .
If there are additional tickets , they will be available to the general public starting at 9 a.m. Friday at the ticket office in the basement of the Michigan Union .
The commencement address will be broadcast live on the Big Ten Network and streamed live on the web starting at 10:30 a.m .

" Binary analysis " license compliance tool released
[ Development ] Posted Apr 15 , 2010 16:31 UTC ( Thu ) by corbet
Armijn Hemel and Shane Coughlan , who have written about license compliance on LWN , have released a version of the tool they use to look for GPL - licensed software in device firmware .
The Binary Analysis Tool digs through binary blobs and attempts to identify the software contained therein .
" One advanced feature of the tool is users can build a customized knowledgebase .
This can contain information about products and / or code like upstream suppliers , chip-sets , offsets , file systems and application strings .
The tool can read the knowledgebase , open compiled code , and check if the specified data is included . "

Cell phones , texting , IM , email , Facebook , MySpace — kids are interconnected today in ways hardly imagined two decades ago .
But these technology - based communication platforms also enable new forms of an age - old parenting strategy : monitoring your kids .
Who are they talking to ?
What are they talking about ?
Are they going where they said they are going ?
Most of us with children think about this stuff .
But parents who work by day as security professionals live in a heightened state of risk awareness , and also have the expertise and the tools to monitor kids ' behavior and communication in many ways .
Is it any easier to put the proper measures in place to ensure your child 's security since you already have an expertise in this area ?
Or do you go overboard because of you are hyperattuned to risk ?
And what is the right balance of freedom and guidance to provide for kids ?
Turns out it was tricky issue before social networking , and remains tricky now .
Here are views and strategies collected from an array of security professionals .
' Spying ' on your kids ?
Martin McKeay , a CISSP and security consultant who maintains a popular network security web site and blog , recently found out how divided security professionals are on the issue of monitoring children .
McKeay , the father of two boys aged 8 and 10 , received an intriguing message recently from someone on a mailing list who wanted his opinion .
" It asked ' What kind of software can I use to spy on my children and read their every email ? ' " said McKeay , who was slightly taken aback by the wording and the person 's obvious , no - bones - about - it attitude that they intended to pry into their kids ' lives without warning or limit .
" I consider that going over the top .
So I went on Twitter and asked other people : ' How do you think this should be handled ?
Is it through monitoring software , or parental relationships ? ' "
McKeay recounted .
" With rare exceptions , most people said both .
But there were some strong opinions about monitoring what your kids do . "
McKeay said he was surprised that his responses , mostly from other security professionals , revealed many were willing to do at least some covert monitoring with software programs without the kids ' knowledge or consent .
The majority felt open and frank discussion , along with some disclosed parental control with products such as Net Nanny , and other similar programs that block web sites and monitor activity , was the best approach .
But he estimates about 25 percent of those who answered his question thought monitoring all actions without telling their kids they were doing so was OK .
" I kind of expected in the security community that more people would realize some of the dangers of that kind of secret monitoring .
But I guess when it comes to your kids , most people seem to be more concerned with keeping them safe online than the potential impact on the relationship . "
By danger , McKeay means loss of trust when the child realizes he is being " spied on , " as he puts it .
He believes secret , and also open - but - excessive , monitoring of a child 's activities infringes on a kid 's privacy rights and will set parents up for potential damage to the relationship with their children in the future .
He also thinks leaving them no room to make mistakes means they wo n't learn the security skills they need when navigating the dangers of the internet .
" If kids do n't learn how to live on the internet when they are at home when they are safe , they are never going to learn it , or they will learn it the hard way when they go out on their own . "
The connections kids make using technology that set them up for security risks will only increase , and technology is making that easier than ever .
Even if they do n't have a smartphone yet , most teens are using Facebook on their computer at home .
But Microsoft this month is unveiling new phones aimed at younger users that have special social networking capabilities .
And as social networking , where plenty of questionable and even dangerous communication can take place , becomes more mobile , the ability to supervise becomes even more difficult , according to Insite Security 's Christopher Falkenberg , a former Secret Service agent .
" Mobility will restrict parents ' ability to supervise as opposed to the home computer which can be reviewed by parents , " he said .
" Also there are not programs to help control content on mobile devices like there are for computers .
As a parent you can be no less vigilant of a child 's online associations and whereabouts than you can their physical location and friends .
If you would n't let them see someone or go someplace in the physical world you should not let your kid go there through the internet . "
But despite what many parents might put into place to keep an eye on their kids , children , as they often do , usually find ways around it .
According to a poll conducted in 2008 by Harris Interactive and McAfee , 16 percent of kids have created private e-mail addresses or social networking profiles to hide what they do online from their parents .
And 63 percent of teens said they know how to hide what they do online from their parents .
Additionally , 11 percent have unlocked or disabled parental filtering controls .
Instead of trying to block her kids from questionable or dangerous content and communication , Dena Haritos Tsamitis , head of the Information Networking Institute and director of outreach for Carnegie Mellon CYLAB , approached the security and safety issue by trying to change behavior .
Her older kids , now 23 and 21 , were her so called ' guinea pigs ' when she was developing MySecureCyberspace , an online educational resource that provides families with free materials for staying safe online .
" I was able to see firsthand the kind of risk they were taking knowingly , " said Tsamitis .
" They knew better but were taking risks anyway .
I was thinking : " This is a challenge , because I have to modify their behavior , and kids do n't listen to their parents too easily . "
Through the kids , Tsamitis said she explored strategies for dealing with that age group and helping them understand the real world consequences of their actions in order to shape the informational content on the MySecureCyberspace site .
The site also includes free games for kids of varying ages that helps them develop the skills to spot spam and avoid saying dangerous things in front of strangers in chat rooms .
Tsamitis ' youngest daughter is now 13 and just starting to use social networks .
As with her older kids , Tsamitis is not blocking content , but instead trying to get her daughter to understand the consequences of her actions online through education .
" If I walk into the room and my daughter is online , I 'll be peeking over her shoulder without hovering .
If I see she posts something inappropriate , I 'll ask her if she thought about what she was doing before she posted .
I 'm trying to teach her to think about things more than just react . "
And in the physical world ...
Of course , security risks are n't just online .
Security pros still have the old - fashioned worries about kids ' whereabouts and the company they keep when they are out of the house .
Physical security veteran Daniel Finger , who once served as a security director at several large hospitals around the country , now heads a consultancy in Jacksonville , Florida .
When his son was in school , Finger wanted to give him the space to learn things on his own , but at one point made the decision to change his own life around in order to ensure his son was safe .
Finger 's son , who faced a bus ride each day that required him to transfer to a second bus in order to get to school outside his district , was witnessing fights every day while he awaited the second bus .
" For a while , I thought the interaction of taking the bus would be good , but it did n't work out that way , " said Finger .
" After hearing about the fights he was seeing , I finally said ' You do n't need that . '
So for last two years of high school I rearranged my morning schedule so I could drop him off myself . "
Finger 's son graduates from college in a few weeks , and Finger admits he was fortunate to have had a teenager who did n't get into a lot of trouble .
" We never had a situation where we had to go to the police , or smelled alcohol or marijuana .
And as a former security director I would have picked up on that stuff . "
But he and his wife kept an eye on his son and his school by getting involved .
Finger 's wife was on the PTA .
Both made a point of volunteering often at school events in order to get to know the teachers and other families .
It 's this kind of vigilance that he thinks gives parents an advantage : Monitoring that is n't too invasive , but is also informative .
As for McKeay , he admits that he has n't had to worry much yet about his sons looking for objectionable , and even dangerous , content because they are still so young .
He has put some controls in place .
The computers are all in the family room .
Some sites are blocked , but , like a true tech security guy , McKeay has turned the roadblock into a challenge .
" I 've blocked YouTube with disclaimer that if they can figure out how I did it , they can have it back until they give me reason to take it away again . "
In the right circumstances , this kind of tactic offers a possible way to make monitoring and blocking feel less adversarial .
Going forward , McKeay hopes he and his wife can continue their policy of allowing freedom coupled with open lines of communication with the kids .
" My wife and I have had numerous talks with them to say ' If you get on a bad site , you need to leave it .
If you see anything that makes you uncomfortable , come and tell us . "
They liked us .
In fact , they liked us so much that they would sometimes invite people on to their ships , take them for rides around the universe , tell them all about their alien technology and culture , then insert large probes into their bottoms for reasons that are probably none of our business .
These guests were not selected at random and typically had several crucial features in common : they were always from the country ; they had very few friends ; they were never in possession of any sort of camera ; and they never remembered anything until they were either under deep hypnosis or on television , preferably both .
But it has been a very long time since we 've had a decent UFO sighting .
Indeed , it 's been so long that many people have forgotten what UFOs look like .
This has had a deleterious effect on UFO sighting statistics , which have fallen with alarming alarmingness over the past few decades .
It 's no doubt happened that people have seen large , perfectly smooth metallic saucers hovering in their back paddock , surgically removing the stomach lining from cattle , and not realised that it was , in fact , a bona fide UFO and not a reminder to finally say no to cold pizza just before bed .
The reasons for the drop - off in UFO sightings are many and complex .
Extensive studies by the Institute for Making Up Statistical Trends have established a distinct inverse correlation between alien visitation and the development of human photographic technology .
That is , the better we got at taking sharp , high - resolution pictures of things , the fewer aliens spaceships we saw .
Support for this is a matter of record .
Back in prehistoric times when all people could do was paint pictures into cave walls and chisel images into stone slabs , the Earth was positively teeming with aliens .
They helped us build pyramids and temples , and also formed some of civilisation 's earliest executive management teams , with much of their unintelligible language still very much in evidence today .
Once cameras were invented , however , the aliens seemed less willing to show themselves .
As cameras became cheaper and more plentiful , the aliens seemed even more reluctant to drop in , and now that digital cameras are about as common as teenagers with severe eardrum damage , visits from our alien friends appear to have dropped off altogether , if not totally .
The key question we now face at this point in our ongoing investigation into alien culture is : what does this teach us about the aliens ?
Here are several important notes : ( 1 ) Despite their advanced intelligence , the aliens are extraordinarily shy and self - conscious about their appearance .
This supports the long - held theory that their visits to Earth are on the urging from a more self - confident and attractive alien civilisation who just want them to get out and meet people , otherwise they 're going to end up as the unmarried alien civilisation who lives all alone on the corner in the large house with all the cats .
(2) That human civilisation was a science project by some alien students whose report has been assessed with a passing mark , so there 's no need for them to return .
( 3 ) That the last person the aliens abducted had just been to an all - you - can - eat Mexican restaurant , and there 's no way they 're going to travel 50 billion light years to put themselves through that again . ( 4 ) It 's just God messing with our heads again .
Infinitely more disturbing is a fifth theory .
This holds how the aliens have not stopped visiting us at all .
The Government may want us to think they have , but it 's far more likely that the aliens walk among us posing as normal Earthlings , trying hard to understand our culture , our society and why we keep buying gym memberships when we almost never go .
What is their plan ?
Do they come in peace ?
And should they bring a plate ?
Will they want to take over our beloved planet , or just rent ?
All we can do is wait , watch and make absolutely sure that should one of their gleaming spaceships appear before us , to take a nice , sharp photo of it with our phone before passing out .
