It 's all white on the night as new mum Christina Aguilera blazes back into the spotlight
Singer Christina Aguilera may have been out of the spotlight for nearly a year after having her first child , but she sure knows how to return to it .
Ten months after giving birth to her son Max , the Dirrty singer made her return to the stage in a series of eye - catching outfits at London 's Albert Hall .
Including a Bianca Jagger style white suit and fedora hat , albeit accessorised with a bra top .
Lady in white :
After arriving in her loud Pucci dress , Christina blazed onstage in a figure - hugging white bustier and trousers in her comeback performance
The 27 - year - old singer guaranteed all eyes were on her as she arrived in a Harlequin - esque Pucci tunic .
The blonde singer teamed her $ 2,095 turtleneck , silk dress with leather - look leggings and $ 700 Yves Saint Laurent purple Tribute heels as she arrived at the Africa Rising Festival at London 's Royal Albert Hall .
Later she changed into a racy leopard - print leotard and cropped tuxedo , showing she 's lost none of her pre-motherhood sex appeal .

The event marked Christina 's first performance since taking time out for motherhood late last year .
She shared the stage with African supermodel Alek Wek and former US Secretary of State and retired general Colin Powell , who entertained the crowds with his funky dance moves .

The Africa Rising event aims to raise awareness of African issues , such as poverty and trade and hopes to find ' sustainable solutions ' .
She revealed she was loving motherhood and was looking forward to having more children with her music executive husband Jordan Bratman .
She said : ' Absolutely , we 'll definitely have more kids .
' I do n't know ( when ) .
We 'll play it by ear . '
Want to know what presidential candidate Barack Obama will do to make the U.S. a great nation for science again ?
Among other changes , he promises to create a position of " chief technology officer " for the country , and to recreate a space advisory council that reports directly to the president .
In addition , he claims the rDNA Advisory Committee will have his administration 's ear .
Obama discussed his science policies in detail for Science Debate 2008 , a group of thousands of scientists , engineers , and science - oriented groups like the AAAS , who are working to keep the public educated about presidential candidates ' science policies .
Here are the highlights .
Obama promises that the space council will report directly to the president , meaning this group will have direct access to him during policy decisions about space and the skies .
He said :
Between 1958 and 1973 , the National Aeronautics and Space Council oversaw the entire space arena for four presidents ; the Council was briefly revived from 1989 to 1992 .
I will re-establish this Council reporting to the president .
It will oversee and coordinate civilian , military , commercial , and national security space activities .

In an interesting move , Obama promises to create a " Chief Technology Officer " position — unclear where , or what kind of power the appointee will have .
Will this be a cabinet position ?
Will the CTO actually be able to do anything helpful if he or she is merely doing " interagency " liason stuff ?
Here 's Obama 's description of the job , which sounds pretty thankless :
The nation 's first Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) [ will ] ensure that our government and all its agencies have the right infrastructure , policies and services for the 21st century .
The CTO will lead an interagency effort on best - in - class technologies , sharing of best practices , and safeguarding of our networks ;
One of the best pieces of news I 've heard about Obama is that he plans to recreate the post of science advisor to the president , a position that disappeared during the Bush Administration .
Obama says :
[ I will ] strengthen the role of the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ( PCAST ) by appointing experts who are charged to provide independent advice on critical issues of science and technology .
The PCAST will once again be advisory to the president .

And here 's a weird one .
Broadband internet for everybody ?
A router in every pot ?
He says :
My proposals for providing broadband Internet connections for all Americans across the country will help ensure that more students are able to bolster their [ science , technology , engineering and math ] achievement .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Really ?
How is he going to provide internet connections for " all Americans " ?
Is he talking about the free wifi at McDonalds ?
Obama is still claiming he supports environmentally - friendly energy and emissions - reduction :
Specifically , I will implement a market - based cap - and - trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary : 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
I will start reducing emissions immediately by establishing strong annual reduction targets with an intermediate goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 .

It 's great that Obama says that he supports nuclear energy .
Also :
I will also work closely with utilities to introduce a digital smart grid that can optimize the overall efficiency of the nation 's electric utility system , by managing demand and making effective use of renewable energy and energy storage .

What the hell is a " digital smart grid " ?
Maybe Obama should have consulted with his CTO before using terms like " digital smart grid . "
I love Obama 's weirdly wonky comments about rDNA .
Did the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee help him with this one ?
He says :
The promise of rDNA is its ability to sidestep potentially harmful intermediaries that could have a pathogenic effect .
Some forms of gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with functional copies - in comparison have encountered safety issues that arise from how the functional gene is delivered .
As a result , the NIH established the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee , which now provides advice and guidance on human gene therapy as well as other ethical concerns or potential abuse of rDNA technology .
Until we are equipped to ascertain the safety of such methods , I will continue to support the activities and recommendations of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee .

Also , not surprisingly , Obama will lift the ban on federal funding for most stem cell research :
As president , I will lift the current administration 's ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem cell lines created after August 9 , 2001 through executive order , and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight . . .
I believe that it is ethical to use these extra embryos for research that could save lives when they are freely donated for that express purpose .

Holly and Hef Break Up : Holly Madison Myspace Confirmation
confirmed rumors that she andhave split via a blog on her Myspace .
Speculation of a Holly and Hef break up has been building for months , and Monday night Hef 's former # 1 girlfriend told TMZ cameras that she has moved out of the Playboy mansion .
Holly then blogged about the break up on her Myspace page .
From Holly Madison 's Myspace :
Tuesday , October 07 , 2008
What ’s Going on . . . .
Current mood : lonely Hef and I care about each other immensely and will always be best friends . . .
I do have my own place , but I am still at the Mansion , too , right now . . .
I ’m too busy to move even if I wanted to !
hahaha . . .
Bridget , Kendra and I are all still best friends and plan on doing several projects together in the future . . . even though Bridget is in Europe right now and I am sad and lonely without her . . .
You will see how it all happens in Season 5 . . .
Sunday nights on E ! . . .
How lame , I just turned that into the most shameless plug ever . . . lol !
Love - Holly
Rumors of a romance between Holly and magician Criss Angel began circulating after the two were spotted getting cozy in Las Vegas .
Hefner even acknowledged a transition in the relationship , saying , “ I love very much , but she wants very much to get married and have children , but that is n’t in the cards for me , ” noting , “ So there has to be a certain reality there .
And I ’m sure the time will come when she ’ll be dating others .
That ’s part of the transition . ”
There is no word on whether Hefner 's other girlfriends , Kendra Wilkinson and Bridget Marquardt , will remain in the mansion , although rumors have been swirling that Wilkinson is romantically involved with Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Hank Baskett .
Tensions were running high among The Girls Next Door over the summer , and Holly and Kendra blew off steam via their Myspace blogs in July .
In August it was reported that Hef had taken up with Ukranian model Dasha Astafieva , and there was speculation that she was on track to become his new girlfriend .
I find it interesting and noteworthy that the split comes on the heels of rumors that Playboy is facing bankruptcy .
If you 're an 82 - year - old man , you better have something besides Viagra to keep those pretty young things around .
If you missed any of the drama leading up to the split , you can check out the related links below to get up to speed .
Hacking the Amazon S3 SLA
The Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) provided by Amazon comes with a Service Level Agreement :
If the Monthly Uptime Percentage is between 99 % and 99.9 % , you get a 10 % refund ; if the Monthly Uptime Percentage is below 99 % , you get a 25 % refund .
The Monthly Uptime Percentage is computed in a fairly straightforward manner : Divide the month into 5 - minute intervals and compute the Error Rate ( failed requests divided by total requests , treating 0/0 as 0 ) for each interval ; compute the average Error Rate over all the 5 - minute intervals in the month ; and subtract this value from 100 % .
If the probability of a request failing during the n th 5 - minute interval is p(n ) , and the number of requests issued during the n th interval is determined solely by p(n ) , the expected value of the Monthly Uptime Percentage is 100 % minus the average value of p(n ) over all the intervals ; put another way , you can't cheat by waiting for a high p(n ) and then quickly running up the failure count by issuing lots and lots of requests .
However , this uncheatability applies only if the number of requests issued is independent of the success or failure of individual requests ; if we can see whether one request succeeded before issuing the next one , we can cheat the SLA -- quite extravagently , in fact .
Consider a hypothetical attacker who has a very large amount of data stored on S3 , but does n't need to access it ( perhaps said data is a backup of his world domination plans ) .
Consequently , he does n't have to issue any requests ; but if issuing requests will allow him to get a refund via the SLA , said refund will be large enough that the cost of performing the requests does n't matter in comparison .
Furthermore , assume for the purpose of simplicity that S3 has a constant failure rate p for the entire month , and the attacker knows what p is ( if necessary , he can figure it out quickly by sending a very large number of requests ) .
Finally , assume that the attacker can issue as many requests as he likes within each 5 - minute interval , and that he can see if each request succeeds or fails before deciding whether to issue another request .
What should this attacker do to maximize the chance that he will get a refund ?
Well , at the beginning of each 5 - minute interval , he should issue a request .
There 's no point not doing this -- if he does n't issue any requests , he 'll get an Error Rate of zero for the interval .
Suppose that request fails ; should he issue any more requests ?
Absolutely not :
If his first request fails , the attacker has achieved a 100 % Error Rate for that 5 - minute interval .
Suppose the request succeeds ; should he issue any more requests ?
Absolutely : Zero failed requests out of one request means an Error Rate of zero , and issuing more requests can't make that any worse .
In fact , no matter how many requests he has made , if he has n't seen any failures yet , he should issue more requests -- they can't decrease the Error Rate , and they might increase it .
This provides a very simple strategy to the attacker : Keep issuing requests until at least one failure occurs .
He can do better than this .
Suppose he sees his first error after making 2 / p requests ; if he stops at that point , he will have an Error Rate of p / 2 for the interval , much less than the expected p if he issues a very large number of requests .
The value i - pj for increasing values of j , where i , j are the number of failed requests and the total number of requests respectively , behaves as a random walk , and it is well known that a balanced random walk will take positive values infinitely many times with probability one ; so no matter how many successful requests he has encountered , if the attacker issues enough requests he will eventually ( with probability one ) be able to stop with an Error Rate of more than p .
This provides a better strategy to the attacker : Keep issuing requests until the Error Rate i/j is greater than p .
Can the attacker do any better than this ?
Yes .
Suppose p = 0.01 and the attacker 's 99th request fails .
He now has i/j = 0.0101 > p ; but suppose he decides to continue making requests .
If he gets lucky and encounters another failure within the next 98 requests -- an event with probability 63 % -- he will increase his Error Rate .
In fact , he has a 50 % chance of encountering his second failure within the next 69 requests -- which would give him an Error Rate of 0.0119 or more , which more than balances the less than 50 % chance that he will end up with an Error Rate of less than 0.0101 .
With a bit of thought , we can see that for any p there must be a sequence x [ 1 ] , x [ 2 ] , x [ 3 ] ... such that the optimal strategy is to stop issuing requests if the i th failure is encountered when less than x[ i ] total requests have been made .
How can we determine these x[ i ] ?
With great difficulty .
We can , however , approximate them by considering a continuous limit .
Defining F( i , j ) as the expected Error Rate if there are currently i failures out of j requests and the optimal strategy is followed , we can define G[ i ] ( x ) for positive x as the limit , as p tends to zero , of F ( i , x / p ) * exp ( - x ) / p , and define X [ i ] as the limit as p tends to zero of x[ i ] / p. ( Yes , the limits do exist . )
This provides us with a series of differential equations :
For each i , G [ i ] ( x ) = exp ( - x ) * i /x for x <= X [ i ] , and G ' [ i ] ( x ) = - G[ i+1 ] ( x ) for x > X[i ] .
These differential equations do n't appear to have any closed - form symbolic solution , but they can be solved numerically .
The first few values X [ i ] are approximately X [ 1 ] = 0.507 , X [ 2 ] = 1.197 , X [ 3 ] = 1.950 , X [ 4 ] = 2.740 , X [ 5 ] = 3.554 , X [ 6 ] = 4.386 , X [ 7 ] = 5.232 , X [ 8 ] = 6.089 , X [ 9 ] = 6.956 , X [ 10 ] = 7.830 .
Assymptotically , X [ i ] appears to be approximately i - sqrt ( i/2 ) ; this should n't be surprising , since with probability 1 - epsilon the attacker will encounter i + O( sqrt( i ) ) failures if he performs i/p requests ( where the implicit constant depends on epsilon ) .
Given these values , the attacker 's limiting strategy for small p is to stop issuing requests as soon as he has seen i failures out of less than X [ i ] / p requests within the current 5 - minute interval .
How large an expected Error Rate do these strategies produce ?
Much larger than the p which might be expected .
Strategy Expected Error Rate Minimum p to get a 25 % refund Minimum p to get a 10 % refund
One request per 5 - minute interval p 1 % 0.1 % Stop after 1 failure p ln( 1 / p ) / ( 1 - p ) 0.154 % 0.0110 % Stop when Error Rate > p p ln( 1/p ) + 0.191 p ( approximately ) 0.149 % 0.0107 % Optimal strategy p ln( 1/p ) + 0.292 p ( approximately ) 0.147 % 0.0106 %
Put another way , in order to avoid giving a refund to our hypothetical attacker , Amazon has to maintain a failure rate almost 10 times lower than what might be naively assumed from reading the SLA .
Speaking of failure rates , what are the request failure rates for S3 ?
The failure rates for GETs and DELETEs are very low -- on the order of one failure per 100,000 requests according to my logs .
PUTs , however , are far more prone to failure :
In the last six months , I 've seen PUT failure rates of 0.030 % , 0.449 % , 0.089 % , 0.085 % , 0.192 % , and 0.178 % respectively .
None of these are below the 0.0106 % rate needed to avoid paying a 10 % refund to our hypothetical attacker , and in three of these months , the error rate was high enough that our attacker would have received a 25 % refund .
S3 is a great service ... but if Amazon wants to avoid paying refunds under the SLA , they 've got some work to do .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The blogs are alive with the sound of Sarah .

Republican candidate John McCain ’s staffers may deplore the online rumor mill that forced them to announce the pregnancy of newly minted running mate Sarah Palin ’s 17 - year - old daughter .
But experts have some perhaps unwelcome advice :
Get used to it .
“ It used to be that a rumor would float across your desk and you ’d say , ‘ That ’s just so outrageous we ’re not even going to respond to it , ’ ” said Republican strategist Todd Harris , a former McCain spokesman .
“ But nowadays you really have to push back forcefully against almost every single bit of gossip and rumor . ”
Palin ’s announcement disrupted the campaign ’s carefully orchestrated plan to introduce the little - known governor to the public in a high - profile speech on Wednesday .
Instead , it prompted reporters and bloggers to dig further into Palin ’s background and question the wisdom of McCain ’s pick .
“ It probably let the cat out of the bag before they intended to let that information out , ” said Republican communications consultant David All .
Palin announced her daughter ’s pregnancy to knock down speculation that her five - month - old son is actually the teenager ’s child .
McCain ’s rival in the November 4 election race , Democrat Barack Obama , has also battled the online rumor mill .
Obama ’s campaign has set up a Web site to knock down false reports , spread via e-mail , that he is Muslim or harbors anti-American sentiments .
Blogs played a significant role in the 2004 election , but the 2008 race has seen even newer types of communications play a significant role .
Obama has reached young voters through text messaging and social - networking sites like Facebook , while incendiary speeches by his former preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright were viewed widely on the YouTube video site .
As Republicans absorbed the news about Palin ’s daughter inside the convention hall , rock - throwing protesters outside coordinated their movements via the Twitter “ micro - blogging ” service .
Across the river in Minneapolis , the libertarian - leaning former Republican candidate Ron Paul prepared to rally 10,000 of his tech - savvy followers , who have used specialty news services like Digg to promote his views .
The new media amplify , and strengthen , what might previously have been simple comments shared by neighbors over the back fence , and make them too dangerous to ignore , said Andrew Rasiej , a Democratic strategist and founder of Personal Democracy Forum , a grass - roots politics website .
“ The McCain campaign I believe had no choice but to respond to the buzz that was churning on the Internet , ” Rasiej said .
“ To ignore it any further would have ceded the hill to the revolutionaries who were demanding answers online long before the mainstream media even opens its mouth to ask the question . ”
HALTOM CITY —
An internal investigation is under way after a Haltom City police officer fatally shot a Jack Russell terrier Monday afternoon while officers were serving a search warrant .
The officer , who was not identified , remained on duty , police said Friday .
But family members at the house where the shooting occurred said Friday that Willy , the 40 - pound terrier , never attacked the officer .

Cynophobia is the clinical name for an abnormal fear of dogs , i.e. , a specific phobia related to dogs .
The dog is a domesticated superpredator ; this in combination with increasing media coverage of dog attacks could be contributing factors for development of this fear .
A 1992 study of cynophobia among children and adults [ 1 ] reported that actually experiencing dog attacks does contribute to cynophobia .
[ Wikipedia ]
This is getting really out of hand .
What kind of cop is scared of a Jack Russell terrier ?
Ok , obviously there ’s some sort of major misunderstanding going on here , because the number of household pets being killed by police has gone from alarming to inconceivably , mindblowingly outrageous and intolerable .
Of course , police are heroes who would never kill animals just to be mean ( only sociopaths are cruel to animals ) , so the answer must be that police are disproportionately terrified of dogs .
So if your job often involves going around yelling and stomping your way into people ’s houses , you ’re disproportionately at risk for unpleasant dog encounters .
Horror stories of rookies getting their nuts bit off are surely passed down within the ranks , resulting in a climate of hostility towards the canine species .
So , at the risk of sounding condescending , let ’s just clarify a few things :
1 . Dogs bark at everyone .
It does n’t mean they ’re challenging your authority .
2 .
Many species of dogs are really weak .
These can usually be identified by their small size .
Do n’t assume that all dogs are as vicious as the ones at the police station .
3 .
No police officer has ever been killed by a dog ( I tried googling it and mostly just found stories of dogs being killed by police ) .
4 . Dog bites can be effectively treated through the miracles of modern science .
Shooting guns indoors is generally much more dangerous .
I apologize to the many brave men and women in law enforcement who are n’t terrified of small dogs .
This is embarrassing , I know , but we ’ve got to get this out in the open so we can move on .

Part 1 Part 2
This talk was delivered at the Rally for the Republic in Minneapolis , Minnesota , on September 2 , 2008 .
Sometimes people say that Americans are cynical about politics .
Looking at the way the Bush administration has used and abused its power for the last eight years , is it really surprising ?
You would have to be sedated not to be cynical .
It should be clear why the Ron Paul movement took the country by storm .
It represents something different , something hopeful .
Some commentators talk about how the Paulians have a dark view of American society .
Actually , the opposite is true .
That people worked so hard to save this country from the regular politicians speaks very highly of their outlook .
On the other hand , it is true that Paulians do n’t have a high regard for existing political structures .
Consider Bush .
He has not only broken election promises and trampled on American liberties , he has n’t done a single decent thing for this country .
And what he has done contradicts all of the values he said he would uphold both times he tricked people into voting for him .
I wish I could report that this was n’t his intention .
And yet even from his first day in office , he spoke to aides about his priority of going to war on Iraq — a country hardly mentioned during his first presidential campaign .
Here ’s another example .
Just after Bush took office , David Frum , then a White House speechwriter , was part of a policy meeting with the new president .
They were discussing the energy policy of the new administration .
Recall that in those days , gasoline cost less than a dollar a gallon .
Frum had the idea that it would be a political victory to drive down the price .
He suggested the Bush use the phrase “ cheap energy ” to describe his goal .
Frum writes in his memoirs about what happened next .
Bush “ gave me a sharp , squinting look , as if he were trying to decide whether I was the very stupidest person he had heard from all day . "
He might have added that profits in the oil business — which is the business that this government cares most about — were growing thinner .
Cheap energy , he answered , was how we got into this mess .
What mess ?
Bush explained to Frum that regular Americans were buying too many SUVs and using too much gasoline and not paying enough for it .
His answer was not to make energy cheaper , but to make it more expensive .
Congratulations , Mr. President .
Your wars , your regulations , your disruption of the international economy , and your failure to open up the industry to anyone other than your friends has resulted in quadrupling the price of gasoline !
Of course , Bush ’s success comes at our expense .
All of his successes have come at our expense .
In fact , that last sentence might as well be the theme of his entire presidency .
Of course , he did n’t campaign on the promise of making our lives more miserable .
Let ’s take a look back and see what his slogans were .
Do you remember the phrase “ compassionate conservatism " ?
He said in an early speech that the phrase came from his insight that broken lives can only be rebuilt by another caring , concerned human being .
From this he developed what he called a “ bold new approach . ”
He would use government to care for us and to love us and to fix our broken lives .
He alone would do this as head of state .
Few knew at the time that this simple phrase " compassionate conservatism " masked a dangerous , Messianic ambition .
Some wires had gotten crossed in his brain .
He began to see himself as God ’s instrument on earth .
Here is another phrase from early in his presidency .
Bush was going to create “ an ownership society . ”
Some commentators were stupid enough to believe that this meant that he would privatize things and give back control to the people .
To those who bought this line , I have only this to say : You Got Owned .
Remember the phrase , “ humble foreign policy " ?
Coming from Bush , that sounds about as ridiculous as the phrase “ peaceful war , ” except that he seems to believe in that too .
His delirium is like an infection .
It spreads .
After all , Bush supporters are the people who continue , even to this day , to talk about their amazing tactical successes in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Another former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson , in his new book , calls Iraq a “ swift and humane success . ”
If such claims do not qualify as Orwellian , I do n’t know what the word means .
Many people say that the Bush administration has departed from conservative principles .
There was a time when I might have said that too , if by conservatism we mean the constitutionalism of Robert Taft and Ron Paul .
But consider that Ron is the only Republican in the whole Congress or anywhere inside the Beltway to stand up to Bush ’s attempt to create a totalitarian state .
Only he has consistently opposed Bush ’s wars , regulations , spying , and shredding of the Constitution .
He alone warned against Bush ’s monetary policies , his trade policies , his diplomatic misadventures , and his crazed , megalomaniacal arrogance .
You might say that many have opposed this administration privately .
You might say the same thing about the Stalin , Hitler , and Mao administrations .
Those who could speak out against the wickedness , and did not do so , are morally culpable .
What does this tell us ?
It tells us that conservatism as we once knew it is hopelessly corrupted .
You can detect it at cocktail parties , where self - identified conservatives sneer at the very idea of liberty .
Clearly , in the age of Bush , conservatism now constitutes as great or even greater threat to American liberty than the left and left - liberalism .
It is long past time for every right - thinking American to reject the term conservative as a self - description .
I for one no longer believe that Bush has betrayed conservatives .
In fact , he has fulfilled conservatism , by completing the redefinition of the term that began many decades ago with Bill Buckley and National Review .
Think of it realistically .
What does conservatism today stand for ?
It stands for war .
It stands for power .
It stands for spying , jailing without trial , torture , counterfeiting without limit , and lying from morning to night .
There comes a time in the life of every believer in freedom when he must declare , without any hesitation , to have no attachment to the idea of conservatism .
After immigrating to the U.S. , Ludwig von Mises was aghast to find himself described as a conservative .
He denounced that term in 1956 .
F.A . Hayek in 1960 announced very clearly that he was not a conservative .
Murray Rothbard wrote thousands of words of protest against the term .
Frank Chodorov went further .
He said that anyone who called him a conservative would get a punch in the nose .
Now , the leaders of the Republican party are telling us that the only real alternative to the socialism of the Democrats is the fascism of the Republicans .
They do n’t call it that , of course , but that ’s the traditional name for the combination of nationalism , militarism , and right - wing collectivism .
They have a heritage , and it dates from the interwar period when certain European politicians took power amidst economic crisis .
Having their confreres in power in our time represents the gravest danger facing our country .
Yet Ron Paul has been campaigning for liberty and against this danger since he first read Hayek and Mises in medical school , since he first encountered an immoral war ’s severed limbs and crippled souls as a flight surgeon in the Air Force , since he first decided , on August 15 , 1971 , to dedicate his life as a public intellectual and a public official to free markets and sound money , against Nixonian economic controls and the unlimited money creation that has brought us even more booms and busts , and led us to the current crisis .
Indeed , since Ron Paul says he was born a libertarian , we can say he has been fighting for freedom his entire life .
To do all this , Ron Paul had to buck Republican conservatism .
Look at the peerless , shining example he has set .
And look what he has done , look at this historic event , and dream of what he will do in the future .
To those who have lingering attachments to conservatism , I will close with the words that Murray Rothbard had for the Young Americans for Freedom , spoken in 1960 .
" Why do n’t you get out … breathe the clean air of freedom , and then take your stand , proudly and squarely , not with the despotism of the power elite and the government of the United States , but with the rising movement in opposition to that government ?
Then you will be libertarians indeed , in act as well as in theory .
What hangover , what remnant of devotion to the monster State , is holding you back ?
Come join us , come realize that to break once and for all with statism is to break once and for all with the [ Buckleyite ] right - wing .
We stand ready to welcome you . "
Today , Ron Paul stands ready to welcome you .
Like the many thousands at this historic event , we say to all who yearn to breathe free : Join us !
Join Ron Paul !

This post is a guide to understanding the GDP deflator , which the government uses to arrive at the economic growth numbers we all hear on TV or read about in the newspaper .
This post is the product of a lot of background research and some good confirmatory side conversations on the topic with Jake at EconomPic Data .
In essence , the GDP deflator is an inflation statistic .
And it has wide - ranging consequences in terms of how ‘ real ’ the real GDP numbers actually are .
However , because it is not a ‘ true ’ measure of inflation , the GDP deflator can create an inaccurate picture of the economy .
Recently , we saw just such an inaccuracy because of the last two quarters ’ oil prices .
When we were paying all that money for imported oil in Q2 , you would think this would have left less over for consumption and decreased GDP .
Nope !
That ’s not how the statistics work .
And , in the past quarter with prices falling dramatically , we had more to spend — that increased GDP .
Wrong again .
Actually , the increasing oil prices in the Spring perversely increased real GDP in Q2 .
And , then yesterday in the Q3 GDP numbers , we saw that falling oil prices in the Summer decreased GDP .
How is this possible ?
Well , now , before I rush in here with an explanation , let me warn you up front that this post will be heavy math - oriented — so get ready .
Back to the question : how can spending more on imports possibly increase GDP ?
This is so because GDP is not always a true and accurate reflection of domestic economic growth .
Gross Domestic
Purchases might actually be a better indicator of true domestic economic growth .
This is a problem because of how exports and imports are calculated .
Price and Quantity
You see , the price deflators in the GDP numbers are used primarily to disaggregate quantity and price , not to measure true inflation .
Thus the deflators can distort the final numbers .
This disaggregation allows government ’s statisticians to report nominal GDP as a pure ‘ quantity ’ statistic and real GDP as the final number by simply deflating it according to the price deflator , which is a pure ‘ price ’ statistic .
The whole exercise actually goes straight back to Econ 101 .
Remember when they taught you that quantity times price equals revenue ?
Well , that is basically what the GDP is all about on a grand scale — revenue .
And the statisticians are trying to measure quantity times price to arrive at that revenue number .
Hence the need to find a pure quantity measure and a pure price measure .
The UK and the U.S. use the same general methodology here and Her Majesty ’s Treasury does a pretty good job at explaining this :
What is the GDP deflator ?
The GDP deflator can be viewed as a measure of general inflation in the domestic economy .
Inflation can be described as a measure of price changes over time .
The deflator is usually expressed in terms of an index , i.e. a time series of index numbers .
Percentage changes on the previous year are also shown .
The GDP deflator reflects movements of hundreds of separate deflators for the individual expenditure components of GDP .
These components include expenditure on such items as bread , investment in computers , imports of aircraft , and exports of consultancy services .
Uses of the GDP deflator series
The series allows for the effects of changes in price ( inflation ) to be removed from a time series , i.e. it allows the change in the volume of goods and services to be measured .
The resultant series can be used to express a given time series or data set in real terms , i.e. by removing price changes .
What is going on here is that the statisticians are trying to use the nominal numbers to measure changes in the quantity of things sold in the economy and they use the deflators to measure changes in the price of things sold .
For example , if one looked at Q2 nominal durable goods purchases and compared it to Q3 nominal goods purchases , the proportion represents growth in the amount sold , not in the price of the goods sold .
The durable goods price deflator takes care of the price changes in durable goods .
So , if washing machines became less expensive in Q3 than in Q2 say , this price decline would be reflected only in the price deflator and not in nominal GDP .
Example :
Here are the real numbers :
$ 1.059 trillion of durable goods in Q2 versus $ 1.0183 trillion in Q3 represents an absolute decline in the amount sold of 14.6 % on an annualized basis .
However the price deflator for Q3 was - 0.6 % ( meaning prices declined at an annualized 0.6 % rate ) .
Put these two together and it leads to a real decline of 14.1 % in durable goods on an annualized basis .
This last real number — the 14.1 % — is the one most people hear and care about .
Imports and Exports
Where things get tricky are imports and exports .
If you remember from Econ 201 , Gross Domestic Product is measured as Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Exports minus Imports .
Remember the minus because that is the crux of the problem .
The equation is :
GDP = C + I + G + ( EX – IM )
The problem here is that the imports have a negative number on them .
All the other numbers are just fine but the negative number on imports has perverse effects .
Let me give you a live example .
In Q1 of 2008 , the United States imported a nominal $ 2.1180 trillion of goods .
In Q2 , we imported more , a nominal $ 2.2255 trillion amount .
That means imports were rising — we were buying a higher quantity of imported goods in Q2 than in Q1 .
But if you recall , import prices were rising like crazy in Q2 — oil went to $ 147 a barrel .
As a result , the Price Deflator for imported goods was 31.2 % in Q2 .
To get the GDP deflator , one must multiply each of the price deflators times the ratio of the deflator to the whole .
For example , in the case of the goods imports we have 31.2 % .
But , since you have to subtract imports , you are actually decreasing the deflator massively ( remember C + I + G + EX – IM ) .
This leads to the perverse effect of high import inflation decreasing the deflator and thus INcreasing GDP .
However , in Q3 , when import prices came off the boil , the effect was the opposite — to decrease the GDP inflator by MUCH less than in Q2 .
So lower import prices meant a higher deflator and thus a lower GDP .
Gross Domestic Purchases
If you think the preceding examples sound crazy , you will have no quarrel here .
I think the whole thing is nuts ( see my other posts below ) .
This is one reason a lot of economists have been looking askance at the GDP deflator and the GDP numbers themselves recently .
Instead , a lot of economists have turned to Gross Domestic Purchases , which is the C + I + G without the imports and exports .
Gross Domestic Purchases equal Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending — and that ’s it .
The chart for Gross Domestic Purchases looks a lot more like the world we are living in — with the numbers at zero or below every quarter since 2007 Q4 .
As for GDP , there are lies , damn lies and statistics .

Wreckage found today in California has been identified as the aircraft piloted by adventurer Steve Fossett .
A pilot 's licence and a second identification document featuring Fossett 's details , which were found by a hiker , were also confirmed as authentic today , Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said .
Sir Richard Branson said he expects the body of his " great and extraordinary " friend to be found soon .

The NTSB said the crashed plane was found yesterday and a team of investigators were sent to California to investigate .
" The Bellanca 8KCAB ( N240R ) has been missing since September 3 , 2007 , when the pilot departed Yerington , Nevada , for a local flight , " the statement said .
" The wreckage was located at about 10,000 feet of elevation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the vicinity of Mammoth Lakes , California . "
The discovery came after a hiker found three identification cards bearing Fossett 's name in a bush just west of Mammoth Lakes .
Preston Morrow said he found a Federal Aviation Administration identity card , a pilot 's licence , a third ID and £ 558 in cash on Monday but saw no sign of a plane or of any human remains .
He handed the items to police yesterday after failing to contact Fossett 's family directly .
Mammoth Lakes is around 90 miles south of hotel magnate Barron Hilton 's Flying M Ranch where Fossett , 63 , was last seen alive as he set off in the single - engine aircraft on 3 September last year .

Sir Richard , who backed some of Fossett 's record attempts and unsuccessfully tried to circumnavigate the globe by balloon with him , said : " It looks very much like we 're close to finding Steve .
" Hiker Preston Morrow needs to be thanked for alerting the authorities , helping them with satellite co-ordinates and being good enough to turn in the 1,000 dollars cash . "
Until this week , no trace had been found of Fossett and there has been speculation that he faked his own death .
Sir Richard 's statement added : " This should now lay to rest the frivolous stories about Steve and give everyone close to him the chance to pay the right tributes to a truly great and extraordinary man . "
Virgin Atlantic , one of Sir Richard 's companies , sponsored GlobalFlyer , the plane used by Fossett in 2005 to become the first person to fly a plane solo around the world without refuelling .
Sir Richard told Sky News : " It 's likely he will be found in the next few days and they will be able to find out what went wrong .
" He was flying into a perilous mountain area - whether the engine gave out on him or whether he had a heart attack or some other medical problem , you do n't know . "
Fossett , who made millions as a commodities broker in Chicago , was looking for suitable sites to attempt a new landspeed record when he disappeared .
Sir Richard said Fossett had led " a most extraordinary life but died doing something quite mundane " and added that his friend 's death would not put him off taking on dangerous challenges .
" I do n't think what happened to Steve should deter people from pushing themselves .
There 's no question he would have wanted people to see what they were capable of and see if technology could be pushed further . "
Andy Green , who lives in London , has held the landspeed record for 11 years and was helping Fossett prepare for his attempt to break it .
" I really want to know what happened to my friend Steve , " RAF fighter pilot Mr Green said .
" His widow has found it very hard , as anyone would , when your husband of many years just disappears .
" For all of them , I 'm hopeful that finally we will have some closure on this . "
Don Cameron , of Cameron Balloons in Bristol , got to know Fossett when the firm made hot - air balloons for his record attempts , including the first solo non -stop round - the - world trip in 2002 .
He said it was sad that a man who had survived crash - landing a balloon in shark - infested waters off Australia seemed to have died in a simple plane crash .
" He certainly knew how to fly an aeroplane .
If they do find something , maybe the investigators will be able to figure out what happened .
" I think for his family it 'll be better if they do know the truth and if they recover remains and can have a funeral .
" It 's probably better than leaving it unknown although I do n't think there was much doubt it was an air accident .
" I never believed for a moment all the stuff about him faking it .
I never thought he was that sort of chap . "
Mr Cameron added : " He was the opposite of the brash American .
You could know him for years and suddenly discover things he'd done that were amazing .
" He was a great character .
He was brave and had tremendous stamina . "
Fossett was declared legally dead in February by Illinois judge Jeffery Malak .
Fossett 's widow Peggy said in a statement yesterday that she hoped the search would locate her husband 's remains and added : " I am grateful to all of those involved in this effort . "
The hiker who found the documents which sparked the search near Mammoth Lakes , said he did not know who Mr Fossett was initially but a colleague recognised the name .
" It was just weird to find that much money in the backcountry , and the IDs , " he said .
" My immediate thought was it was a hiker or backpacker 's stuff , and a bear got to the stuff and took it away to look for food or whatever . "
Mr Morrow said he returned to the scene with his wife and three friends on Tuesday and found a black Nautica pullover fleece in the same area but could not be sure it was linked .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican candidate for vice president , has urged Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to veto a fee on cargo containers going through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach , setting off a wave of criticism from California environmentalists .
Palin ’s letter to Schwarzenegger is dated Aug. 28 -- one day before presidential candidate and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) announced that he had picked her as his running mate .
The letter argues that both consumers and the economy in California and Alaska would suffer as a result of the fee .
Though the issue might otherwise be viewed as a relatively parochial port matter , Palin ’s newfound status as a national political figure has raised the stakes in what state environmentalists consider to be their most important pollution reduction effort this year .
They say Palin has no business getting involved in the California issue .
“ Why should Gov. Schwarzenegger take into account what out - of - state interests are saying ? ” said Lisa Warshaw , a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Clean Air .
“ It ’s unfortunate that she is using her popularity to push her agenda on this state . ”
Advertisement
The bill ’s author , state Sen. Alan Lowenthal ( D - Long Beach ) , said Palin appears not to appreciate how important the proposal is for the health of Californians .
“ She certainly displays a lack of understanding , ” Lowenthal said .
Palin ’s missive attacks Senate Bill 974 , which has been approved by the state Legislature but needs Schwarzenegger ’s signature to become law .
The bill would create a $ 60 fee for each 40 - foot cargo container moving through the ports of Los Angeles , Long Beach and Oakland , which together handle more than 40 % of the nation ’s goods .
Advertisement
The fees would raise $ 400 million annually for such pollution - reduction projects as installing cleaner - burning truck and train engines and building roadways under or over railroad tracks to avoid long lines of idling vehicles .
“ Enactment of Senate Bill 974 will have negative impacts on both Alaska and California , ” Palin wrote .
“ For Alaskans , a very large percentage of goods [ 90 % or more ] shipped to Alaska arrive as marine cargo in a container . ”
Palin said many Alaskan communities lack road access and depend entirely on goods shipped by container , something that has significantly increased in cost in recent years .
Many of those containers pass through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports before arriving in Alaska , and Palin argues that the fee will add even more to the cost of goods shipped to her state .
“ This tax makes the situation worse , ” Palin wrote .
“ Similarly , the tax may harm California by driving port business away from its ports . ”
Advertisement
The letter concludes by requesting that “ due consideration be given to our state and that you not sign Senate Bill 974 . ”
Schwarzenegger has not yet responded to Palin ’s letter , nor has he made a decision about whether to sign or veto the legislation , said spokeswoman Rachel Cameron .
“ The governor will take it into consideration , ” she said of Palin ’s letter .
But she said Schwarzenegger has warned that he will not sign any bills until the state ’s overdue budget is approved by the Legislature .
Advertisement
“ Right now the governor ’s top priority is getting a responsible budget approved , ” Cameron said .
Schwarzenegger has had concerns about the port fee and threatened to veto it last year unless Lowenthal met with retail and shipping representatives to address their complaints that it will harm business .
Lowenthal said he offered to amend the bill this year to address Palin ’s concerns by cutting the fee in half for containers loaded from one ship to another without leaving California ports by rail or truck .
Schwarzenegger ’s staff did not agree to the proposed change , the senator said .
Advertisement
On Thursday , with the Palin letter hitting the Internet , Lowenthal invited the Alaskan governor to travel to the Southern California ports to see first - hand why the fee is needed .
“ We are losing about 3,400 Californians each year because of pollution , ” Lowenthal said .
“ No matter what Gov. Palin would like to see happen , the impact is killing Californians .
I do n’t think Gov. Palin truly understands the impacts going on here . ”
John Casey , a spokesman for Lowenthal , added : “ Maybe Sarah Palin does n’t care about Californians . ”
Palin ’s office in Juneau did not return calls late Thursday seeking comment .
Advertisement
Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has endorsed McCain for president , but Lowenthal said he hopes that politics will not play a role in the decision on the legislation .
“ I ’m hoping the governor sees above it .
He says he is an independent .
This will be a test , ” Lowenthal said .
Cameron denied that the governor ’s support for McCain will play a role .
“ The governor is committed to doing what ’s best for Californians , ” Cameron said .

JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDES RISING JUSTIFIABLE
HOMICIDES RISING
The number of justifiable homicides committed by police and private citizens has been rising in the past two years to their highest levels in more than a decade , reflecting a shoot - first philosophy in dealing with crime , say law enforcement analysts .
The 391 killings by police that were ruled justifiable in 2007 were the most since 1994 , FBI statistics show .
The 254 killings by private individuals found to be self - defense were the most since 1997 .
The FBI says a homicide committed by a private citizen is justified when a person is slain during the commission of a felony , such as a burglary or robbery .
Police are justified , the FBI says , when felons are killed while the officer is acting in the line of duty .
Rulings on these deaths are usually made by the local police agencies involved .
Some law enforcement analysts say the numbers represent changing attitudes on the streets , where police have felt more threatened by well - armed offenders , and citizens have taken greater responsibility for their own safety .
Northeastern University criminal justice professor James Alan
Fox describes an emerging " shoot - first " mentality by police and private citizens .
For several years , police departments have armed their officers with higher - powered weapons to keep pace with criminal gangs .
" Clearly there is a message out there that citizens may be able to defend themselves " as well , he says .
Alfred Blumstein , a Carnegie Mellon University criminologist , says the gun " legalization movement " also may have helped create a " greater willingness " among citizens to act in self - defense .
Forty - eight states provide various rights to carry firearms .
Illinois and Wisconsin do not , according to the National Rifle Association .
In a landmark decision , the Supreme Court in June carved out a right to individual gun ownership , ruling that the Second Amendment allows citizens to keep guns in their homes for self - defense .
The NRA and other analysts say most laws allowing gun possession have existed for years and would not likely account for a recent spike in self - defense killings .
Instead , Wayne LaPierre , the NRA 's executive vice president and chief executive officer , says the Sept. 11 attacks and the widespread looting and violence after Hurricane Katrina spurred some people to take more responsibility for their own safety .
Immediately after those events , LaPierre says the group 's gun-safety trainers reported " big increases " in NRA - sponsored courses .
" Americans are simply refusing to be victims , " he says .
Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck says the FBI underestimates self - defense killings by citizens because the ones that are not precipitated by felony crimes may not get counted .
" Less than a third of ( citizen killings ) are reported , " he says .

The US authorities are so desperate to extradite my son that they have changed the law .
Now he faces 60 years in jail
Any day now , my son , Gary McKinnon , could face extradition from Britain to the United States , where he would stand trial for hacking into US government computers and could face a sentence of up to 60 years .
Gary has recently been diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome , which is why I and his family and his many friends and supporters around the world are arguing that he should be allowed to stay in the UK and face the courts in the country where the offence – if offence there was – was committed .
The US authorities waited two years to call for Gary 's arrest because of a then - unratified , unsigned extradition treaty between the two countries , which would make it easier for them to have a British citizen sent for trial in the US .
Yet , when he was first arrested in London , six years ago now , Gary was told he would probably get a sentence of community service for his hacking activities .
He naively admitted computer misuse before he had engaged a lawyer and without a lawyer even being present .
We were still unaware at that time that he had Asperger 's syndrome .
Gary gained no leniency for his honesty and on the contrary , his extradition has been relentlessly pursued by the British and American authorities , despite the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) declining to prosecute him in Britain .
This attitude will hardly encourage British citizens to come clean regarding any crimes they may have committed .
If no leniency or consideration is given when a person accused of a crime immediately and openly tells the truth , there is little point in them admitting to anything .
The CPS 's decision not to prosecute Gary here was clearly made to allow the Americans to arrest him two - and - a - half years later , once the one - sided extradition treaty was introduced and then made retrospective .
In addition , in order to indict Gary , the US authorities had to claim a specific amount of financial damage .
Gary has always denied causing damage and without proof of such , the US could not prosecute him .
Just a month ago the US prosecutors stated in an interview that once Gary was extradited , the most difficult thing to prove would be the damage !
Several weeks ago the goalposts were moved yet again when the US introduced a new law whereby no proof of damage was required where military computers were concerned .
For the American law to then have been conveniently changed at such a crucial time does little to give us any faith in such a legal system .
There is a London demonstration outside the US embassy , scheduled for 4 pm on September 28 in Grosvenor Square .
See the campaign website for more details .
As reported by Americans United , thirty - three religious right churches endorsed Republican politicians from the pulpit on Sunday .
This event was planned and orchestrated by the Alliance Defense Fund , a religious right legal group , which hopes to use it as a test case to have laws against church politicking declared unconstitutional .
Let ’s emphasize at the outset something that religious - right spokesmen , in the coming weeks , will be working their hardest to deceive everyone about .
There are no laws forbidding churches from endorsing political candidates .
What we do have are laws forbidding churches from endorsing candidates if they want to retain their tax exemption .
This is not a unique and onerous burden placed only on religious groups ; rather , it is the same generally applicable law that applies to all bona fide non-profit organizations .
In exchange for the privilege of tax exemption , such groups are expected to abstain from explicitly partisan political activity .
The churches that endorsed candidates are not protesting an unjust law designed to oppress them .
Rather , they are arrogantly and greedily trying to have their cake and eat it too .
They want the privilege of tax exemption without having to play by the rules that apply to tax - exempt groups .
In reality , the ban on church politicking is little more than a formality .
The IRS code permits discussion of “ issues ” , which means that even churches that obey the letter of the law can very easily convey to their followers which candidate they are expected to vote for .
I have little doubt that most of these churches ’ members were already planning to vote for John McCain .
After all , white evangelicals are one of the most consistently Republican voting blocs in the country .
But this latest stunt is a demonstration that they do n’t feel themselves obligated to obey even the minimal restrictions set by the law .
If churches truly wish to endorse candidates from the pulpit , then they should relinquish their tax exemption .
AU has helpfully aided them in this by reporting six of the violators to the IRS .
( One was the church run by Wiley Drake , whom you may remember was last seen urging his followers to pray God to kill advocates of church - state separation . )
AU has said it will report the remaining churches if it acquires sufficient evidence , although the people behind this effort have said that they intend to submit the text of their sermons to the IRS themselves , which will be a nice saving of time .
Although the IRS has in the past been cautious to sanction violators , a sign of the undue respect paid to religion in this country , we can hope that they ’ll recognize this deliberate attempt to undermine their authority for what it is and take appropriate action .
This is likely to be an expensive and embarrassing lesson for these churches in the meaning of the First Amendment – and , hopefully , a disincentive for others to listen to schemers like the Alliance Defense Fund in the future .
Given America ’s financial chaos and the budget deficits that are certain to result , the taxes that I hope these churches will soon be paying are much - needed .
That money can be put to more appropriate use , like funding public schools or repairing our decaying infrastructure , rather than supporting wasteful sectarianism .

Physicists of the University of Granada and the University of Valencia ( Spain ) have developed a proceeding to analyse specific data sent by the Huygens probe from Titan , the largest moon of Saturn , proving " in an unequivocal way " that there is natural electric activity in its atmosphere .
The scientific community thinks that there is a higher probability that organic molecules precursors to life could form in those planets or satellites which have an atmosphere with electric storms .
Researcher Juan Antonio Morente , from the Department of Applied Physics of the University of Granada , has informed the SINC that Titan is considered to be " a unique world in the Solar System " since 1908 , when Spanish astronomer José Comas y Solá found out that it had an atmosphere , something non-existent in other satellites .
" In this moon there are clouds with convective movements and therefore there can be static electric fields and stormy conditions " , he explains .
" It significantly increases the chance that organic and prebiotic molecules get formed , according to the theory of Russian biochemist Alexander I. Oparín and Stanley L. Miller 's experiment " , who managed to synthesize organic compounds from inorganic ones by using electric shocks .
" Therefore , Titan has been one of the main objectives of the Cassini - Huygens combined mission of the NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) " , said the researcher .
An enormous resonant cavity
Morente says that , in order to detect the natural electric activity of planets such as Earth or satellites such as Titan , it is necessary to measure the so - called " Schumann resonances " , a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency ( ELF ) portion of the Earth 's electromagnetic field spectrum .
Such peaks occur because the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere .
The limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves , which present two basic components : a radial electric field and a tangential magnetic field , together with a weak tangential electric field un campo ( one hundred times smaller than the radial component ) .
The electric field was measured by the sensor of mutual impedance ( MIP ) , one of the instruments transported by the Huygens probe .
The MIP consisted of four electrodes , two transmitters and two receptors , and there was a couple of transmitter - receptor in each of the pull - down arms en of the probe .
The MIP sensor was preferably used to measure the atmospheric electric conductivity , but it also acted as a dipole antenna , measuring the natural electric field in the atmosphere .
" In a stable descent , without rolling , the MIP sensor would have been able to measure the peak tangential component of the electric field " , says Morente , " but unfortunately a strong wind made the probe to roll and the electrodes measured a superposition of such tangential and radial component " .
Flat spectrum
Despite this , the electric field spectrums directly received from Huygens were not due to the standards expected by scientists , as they were relatively flat and no Schumman resonances were observed .
The Spanish research team , however , manage to design a proceeding to reveal Schumman hidden resonances , base don the separation of temporary signals so - called " early " and " late - time " , which allowed them to obtain " the irrefutable proof " of that there is natural electric activity in the atmosphere of Titan .
This work , which has been subsidized by the former Ministry of Education and Science , the Andalusian Council and the European Union , also explains that the atmosphere of this moon of Saturn is an electromagnetic environment with high losses , and that its resonant cavity is less idean than that of the Earth .

Paulson & Bernanke : The New American Fascists ( September 23 , 2008 )
It 's fashionable to toss the word " fascist " at one 's political opponents , but I am deadly serious in accusing Paulson and Bernanke of attempting a fascist coup d'etat in which the central authority of the U.S.
Treasury rules uncontested , with no judicial or legislative counter - balance or authority - - not even for oversight .
In a constitutional system which carefully counterbalances Federal powers between judicial , legislative and executive , how can the Treasury department claim extra-legal powers and banish oversight by both the courts and Congress , and not be blatantly unconstitutional ?
Yet here is the bill 's key point : Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
Lest you think I indulge in hyperbole , let 's go through the definition of fascism and Paulson 's power - grab step by step .
Definitions of fascism :
Most scholars agree that a " fascist regime " is foremost an authoritarian form of government .
Note that Paulson 's Power - Grab Bill claims total authority for the Treasury , and specifically excludes Congressional or court oversight .
What else is that but authoritarian ?
Sure , it " reports " to Congress , but that is meaningless since Congress has no authority to question or over - rule Treasury 's disbursements of taxpayer funds .
Several scholars have inspected the apocalyptic , millennial and millenarian aspects of fascism .
And here we have Paulson and Bernanke squealing that Congress has to grant them virtually unlimited powers to borrow and spend taxpayer funds immediately or a financial Apocalypse is at hand .
Nice , but where have they been for the last year ?
Bleating at every opportunity how " sound " the U.S. banking system is .
They had the responsibility and the opportunity for over one year to address the fundamental rot at the heart of the U.S. financial system , and they did nothing but cover the tracks of their banker pals and loan out hundreds of billions to failed banks .
They should both be fired immediately for gross incompetence and Treason .
Our dithering President is also grossly incompetent and fortunately he will be replaced in January .
But the damage he wrought in appointing and pandering to these two incompetents has already been done .
Here is President Franklin Roosevelt defining fascism in 1942 as the U.S. was in a literal fight to the death with three fascist regimes in World war II :
The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself .
That , in its essence , is fascism - - ownership of government by an individual , by a group , or by any other controlling private power .
Note that the Federal Reserve is a private bank , and that the " group " F.D.R. warned us against resides in the office of Treasury Secretary Paulson , who will have sole power to disburse trillions of dollars to whomever he pleases , without recourse , oversight or control by the courts or Congress .
That is fascism , pure and simple .
Here is the best single analysis of the Power - Grab Bailout Bill : The Mother Of All Frauds ( Karl Denninger )
You probably read Mish and Denninger already , so you know what needs to be done : email , call and write your elected representatives in Congress and demand they vote against any and all iterations of this caving in to Fascism Bill .
Regarding the power of language :
Let me make an additional suggestion : that just as President Reagan correctly identified the U.S.S.R. as an " Evil Empire , " then clearly identify the Paulson Bill as fascist , and identify Paulson and Bernanke as fascists bent on grabbing extra-legal unconstitutional powers and authority under the phony guise of an " emergency . "
Hitler used this same tactic again and again , loudly declaring an " emergency " and grabbing what he wanted as the bleating , frightened sheep ran about in disarray .
Paulson and Bernanke have torn a page from the Hitler playbook and are working the fear and hysteria to perfection , demanding an " immediate approval " of their power - grab .
It 's not considered " polite " to label someone a fascist , but the time for politeness is long past .
The toothless mainstream media stood idly by for the past year like a drooling village idiot mesmerized by the brightly colored tinfoil Paulson and Bernanke waved in their faces .
Now they cravenly report the " emergency " without a shred of skepticism ; Goebbels would have been delighted by their complete spinelessness in the face of a truly Evil danger to the Republic .
How about we go one step further and call this plan and its perpetrators Evil with a capital E .
Anyone who purposefully tries to ban legislative and judicial oversight via a phony " emergency " is essentially a traitor , for they are attempting to destroy the very essence of our republic and our constitution .
So let 's stop pandering to a propaganda machine all too willing to wag its finger in disapproval at anyone stating the truth : Paulson and his Bill are fascist .
Just look up the word , read the bill , and then tell me it is n't a match .
In Christianity , that 's called " speaking truth to power . "
The first step to rooting out Evil is to correctly identify it with the proper words .
If it is n't fascist to strip the courts and elected officials of any and all powers over a small unelected groups ' secret actions in the Treasury , then what the heck is it ?
It certainly is n't American democracy .
So let 's call this Power Grab and Paulson and Bernanke by their proper identities : fascists , all .
I know , the bill " expires " in two years -- but since they can spend $ 700 billion , offload whatever toxic assets they bought , draw down another $ 700 billion , then rinse and repeat , they could easily saddle our children and grandchildren with $ 3 - 4 Trillion in debt and in the meantime enrich their buddies and pals in the process .
If you 're still unconvinced , then just start reading .

" How , given these changes , can the administration and Federal Reserve believe they are being forthright in their unrevised expectation of future losses ? "
Lies From Paulson Keep Stacking Up : What You Can Do About It ( Mish Shedlock ) Bottom line : contact your congresspeople and demand they vote against this bill or any permutation of it .
Otherwise , Welcome to the Fascist States of America , where a small group in Treasury will be acting in secret , giving away your tax money and your children and grandchildren 's money , with essentially unlimited authority to blow trillions of our future tax payments bailing out their buddies and pals .
You want to get tough , Hank ?
Then ask Congress for the authority to sue all CEOS of failed banks for civil damages ( for fraud , collusion , etc. ) equal to their salaries and bonuses from 2001 - 2008 .
Oh , and do n't forget to authorize suing yourself , too ; how much did you rake off as head of Goldman ?
$ 400 million ?
Or was it $ 1.2 billion , if you count stock options and all the other goodies ?
Remind me again why Paulson is qualified to be Treasury Secretary .
Because nobody understands a con like a con-man ?
Footnote : Just as a reminder of how much Federal ( taxpayer ) money has already been thrown down the rathole : Paulson Bailout ( thanks to Craig M. for the link )
By my count , the Federal Reserve has already extended something on the order of $ 455 billion in loans collateralized by some of these same troubled assets , namely $ 125 billion in repos , $ 150 billion in the term auction facility , $ 50 billion in " other loans " , $ 30 billion from the Bear Stearns deal , and $ 100 billion in " other Federal Reserve assets " .
That $ 455 billion total does not include this week 's $ 85 billion loan to AIG , nor the $ 180 billion in reciprocal currency swap lines .
That 's $ 720 billion , plus Fannie and Freddie and shadow loans to Merrill , Lehman , etc .
Shall we round it up to $ 1 Trillion and counting ?
New essay by Chris Sullins : The McRib Is Back !
Reader Commentaries : Harun I . I would like to congratulate you on another excellent post .
Einstein said , " No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it . "
As Paulson fans the flames of urgency I wonder if the members of Congress and the general populace find in him , or Bernanke for that matter , any measure of credibility or competence ?
If so , I would certainly like to hear the reasoning behind any such confidence .
If we are to believe that they never saw this coming then obviously they are incompetent and therefore not qualified for their posts and should be summarily dismissed .
If they knew what was happening all along then they have manipulated us with deceit into an almost inflexible and potentially ruinous position and cannot be trusted , and should be summarily dismissed and criminally indicted .
Instead we are entertaining solutions with the same level of consciousness that created the problem .
Our Congress who is handsomely compensated and highly privileged failed miserably in its duties to prevent this catastrophe .
With the exception of a few the whole of Congress should be removed from office but for the moment I will focus on Paulson and Bernanke .
Bernanke with his Ph. D and vast knowledge of the Great Depression has seen his hypothesis empirically debunked .
Paulson who has been around Wall St. all of his life and was CEO of was one of the most respected investment banks has proven inadequate to the task of Treasury Secretary .
These men ( Paulson and Bernanke ) , who have failed in every sense of the matter are now urging us to embark posthaste down a course of action with a proven track record of failure .
Bernanke has essentially thrown away all of his theories and decided to fall back on Depression era policies that failed .
Should Congress be listening to anything these men have to say ?
Let me be clear : Every American should be writing and calling their representatives in Congress to slow down this process before we do more harm than good .
If your representative are unresponsive then they should not get your vote in the next election .
I am fond of saying that we get what we deserve .
But that is future tense .
We have what we deserve .
Results equal intentions .
We must examine the result to understand the thinking that produce it and do our best to focus on the desired outcome and act accordingly .
Liar Nation was a post that should be studied by all for some time to come as it details the thinking ( intention ) that has produce the present ruinous and calamitous result .
Before our representatives in Congress act on our behave in a way that may cause even greater problems we must examine our intent and what actions are likely to give us the desired result .
It was also Einstein who said , " Insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . "
Before we give carte blanche powers to the Treasury remember that we have a Constitution .
Had it been followed we would not find ourselves in our current circumstances .
It is mistake to stay on the path to its irrelevance .
Once again I defer to the wise Einstein who said that " Intellectuals solve problems , geniuses prevent them . "
The architects of the Constitution of the United States were such geniuses .
Our intellect has failed to prevent or solve problems that reoccur with the cyclical precision of an atomic clock .
It should be clear now what they gave us was to prevent the problems we are experiencing today .
Bernanke and Paulson have been either lying or wrong about everything .
We must ask ourselves , before we give them powers that place them above the law of the land , what if they are wrong or lying now ?
Michael Surkin
The more I hear about the US government plans to accumulate bad loans and " toxic " assets from financial institutions the more it sounds like an astronomical phenomena : a black hole .
Pomp & Surkanstance 1
The US governments decision to step in and acquire hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bad loans at above market prices pretty much guarantees that what was already looking like a dismal economic future will be an out and out disaster .
I do not use the word lightly , when I describe the virtually certain outcome as a depression .
As much as policy makers have attempted to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past ( e.g. Messr Bernanke is an expert on the 30s depression ) they have wound up following the script of past catastrophes to a T.
Just as Hoover and FDR fell over themselves to attempt to bail - out the economy as dark clouds mounted , the global governments are doing the same thing today .
In the feverish effort to stop the immediate pain , we are actually making it increasingly harder to come out the other side .
Pomp & Surkanstance 2 Michael Goodfellow Mish and CR both have text of this bailout bill .
I have to say I 'm disgusted by the thing .
It 's basically " give Paulson a blank check to buy all the ' mortgage - related assets ' in the U.S. "
It 's a completely thoughtless abdication of any responsibility by Congress , and shows absolutely no respect for or understanding of the economy .
It 's an " oh , just fix this and do n't bother us with the details " piece of legislation .
If they had said they were going to wait for banks to go under , then seize their assets and debts , to avoid counterparty risks and spreading defaults , I could see the logic of it .
Weak banks and funds would fail as normal , stockholders and CEOs would take their medicine , and the Feds would just keep it from turning into a series of dominoes .
That would be similar to the old RTC .
What they are proposing now just makes no sense .
I really think it will fail within months and then they will be left with no plan , no money and no credibility .
I really do n't think a selective bailout of U.S. banks is going to fly with the public or with overseas investors .
We are in effect saying " yes , you lost your shirts on American real estate investments , but just give us another $ 700 billion in Treasury purchases .
That will work out fine ... "
The pundits today are saying things like " stopping the decline of housing prices will solve this economic problem . "
From the perspective of California , where there are huge amounts of foreclosures and unsold inventory , stopping the decline is a complete fantasy .
And it should be a fantasy , since we are still above historical multiples of income and rent .
Housing prices need to come down .
After 9/11 , the U.S. responded in a thoughtless fashion -- start wars , throttle the borders , turn the airports into armed checkpoints , monitor all phone calls / email , and torture a few suspected terrorists .
It was mindless " get tough " actions without any respect for American tradition or any coherent view of what we were trying to accomplish .
And they spent money like it was going out of style .
This strikes me as more of the same .
I hope we come through this with some kind of intact financial system , but I do n't see how .
We all piss and moan about how corrupt the system is , and how idiotic the government is , but I tend to take that with a grain of salt .
We 've all been pessimistic for years , and nothing terrible has happened .
Seeing something like this bailout seriously considered , and probably passed into law in a week , just makes you realize how far the rot has gone .
If Congress balks at this , it will be because there 's no " stop the foreclosures " measure in there .
I know you think that after this system collapses , something good will come in its place .
Can you really write a convincing scenario of that happening ?
Are you basing that on your " faith in the American people " , or what ?
My response :
If all the banks which took on too much risk for quick profits folded and all the owners of the toxic debt and derivatives simply took their losses , there would be survivors : Wells Fargo , for instance , which more or less avoided all the toxic crud sinking their competitiors .
Plus there are people like Warren Buffett who could launch a new bank tomorrow with a billion of his own money and I am confident his new bank would quickly attract tens of billions in cash seeking a safe , well - managed institution .
We really need to let capitalism 's " creative destruction " work its magic and not be so fearful of the consequence .
Stupid players get eliminated , that 's Natural Selection .
Ryan Leatherbury
I noticed that you wrote a letter to your representative on the bailout , so that prodded me to do the same .
So I thought I 'd share .
The direct act is surely an exercise in futility to be sure ... but indirectly , after violating my personal policy on mass emails , it seems more family and friends have taken notice of the actual situation and perhaps are more skeptical of the soundbytes from talking hairdoos .
Take care and please keep up the good work - what you do is very important .
Ryan 's blog *** Letter to Senator / Representative ***
I implore you to not support any bailouts of financial institutions , at the expense of the American tax payer .
This is the most flagrant example of socializing costs and privatizing wealth in human history , one which primarily benefits the rich and well - connected .
This is the most socialist government intervention since the formation of the Soviet Union and Communist China .
Years of completely reckless monetary policy under the guise of " free market " by the Federal Reserve , deficit spending establishment , fractional reserve banking system , and deregulated financial environments have come to roost and we need to deal with this crisis responsibly and not cure the problem with solutions that will only make matters worse .
I am appalled that we are enabling the same people , who stoked the flames and threw the American public on the pyre of the greatest ever asset and credit bubble , to construct ad hoc crises interventions that push the envelope to and beyond the bounds of the extremely ambiguous Federal Reserve Act .
The sad Greenspan - Bernanke - Paulson legacy is the latest and most unfortunate chapter in the economic history of our proud country and these men should be left to their shame and not allowed to do more damage to the well - being of our nation .
It is unacceptable that investors , many of whom are foreign , can earn better returns on government sponsored ( read : sponsored not backed ) agency debt than US treasuries without facing actual credit risks , even after default , because the American public is being forced to provide a financial backstop , which we can not by any means afford .
Likewise , it is unacceptable that debt holders in failed agencies and financial institutions were made whole and in fact profited on the nickel of the hard - working American taxpayer due to these interventions .
Further , it is unacceptable to provide a government - backed auction mechanism that purchases assets above their market value , which in many cases is zero .
Yes , purging the economic system of its greater ills will be extremely painful to everyone but history tells us that you cannot renew credit and economic growth through these types of interventions which only postpone even greater problems .
Is it not enough that we have saddled our future with a legacy of debt and national insolvency at every level , which can only be reckoned with through a combination of 3 unfortunate realities :
Debt defaults , taxation beyond what we could ever hope to produce and continued currency devaluation to try and stem off the great gorge of deflation ?
This is the time to reject our failed ways of debt creation to beget more debt , and embrace a more responsible economic policy that favors thrift and hard work and not financial shenanigans and shell games .
I will not support your bid for re-election if you take Congressional measures to support and condone these un-American bailouts .
E.R.M. A FINANCIAL DICTATORSHIP !
Riley Thorpe Great article tonight .
Especially the explanation of the use of shorting to protect your long position .
I believe the same good idea comes to all smart people .
This seems as if they did the worst possible thing they could do .
No one likes turmoil , what the heck is going to happen in the next week or two with this financial services bail out .
Odds seem good that the stock price of these companies will not benefit from what will come , with the inability to protect long positions with shorts or puts , I think that the holders of financial services stock have no alternative but to sell .
Greed is a wonderful motivator but fear works much faster .
( Emphasis added , CHS ) I think every one will be watch the markets starting in Asia but the real deal starts in the morning .
interesting times ....
C.N.F .
My letter to my congressional representatives :
This national banking crisis was self - generated , motivated and created by fundamental greed guised and heralded as " creative financing " ( while money was being reaped ) .
This was a new way for banks to make money by changing and lowering their time - tested responsible guidelines for lending money .
In essence they irresponsibly introduced huge risks to the system , and then passed these high risk loans down the financial investment chain like a hot potato , happy to make money with their slice of fees and hoping no one would ask for a " refund " down the line .
Well , the potato has rotted and been dropped into the lap of the government by the pleading financial system calling for help .
As a taxpayer , I want you to represent me by saying NO -- not bailing out the banks who knowingly created this crisis from their greed .
The banks and the investment system of selling / buying mortagages made unprecedented sums of money with their " creative financing " scam and now they want to keep the money they pocketed and shovel the cost of their failed risk onto the taxpayer to make it all allright again for themselves .
I do not want to pay for this , and ask you not to support this bailout .
Is there no consequence and justice to blatant irresponsibility and deceit ?
A bailout rewarding rather than punishing the banks for something they created is outrageous .
To make matters worse , the proposed bailout has no oversight .
Is congress actually considering handing more money to the banking system expecting them to now " do the right thing " ?
Where was the oversight of Congress -- you , the President , Vice - President , Federal Reserve Chairman and Secretary of the Treasury ?
No one publically recognized and warned the public about the subprime loans being a great risk to the entire banking system .
All the " checks " in the system look the other way because huge sums of money was being made .
The banks caused this financial crisis and they are responsible for the " effects " -- not the taxpayers .
I will not support you in the next election if you support the bankers .
Zeus Y . A 70 Trillion Dollar Counterfeiting Ring According to several sources the market for so - called credit default swaps  last year alone was nearly equal to the total global GDP , around 70 trillion dollars by some estimates .
Yet these derivatives have no discernible origin or value .
People arent sure whether they are capital vehicles , insurance vehicles , investment vehicles , all three , or none of the above .
However , what is becoming very clear to me is that they , along with many of the other creative financial vehicles are nothing more than a bold mass counterfeiting scheme based on a very simple premise and set of conditions that are not at all complex .
The problem is not that their values are unknowable ,  but that we know what their value is worthless .
Our problem is that were not willing to contemplate socially or personally the ramifications of what we know .
This is why big lies work -- the bald truth is harder for most to bear .
What if you used cash to pay your groceries , and you found out the money was phony ?
You provided of labor , goods , etc. and you got worthless paper in return .
You offered something that had real value in return for something you thought had value but did not .
Either you swallow the rip - off and lose real value or someone covers for you the government , insurance etc .
What happens if this worthless scrip you receive takes the form of digital funny money , concocted out of thin air , without any real assets or capital to back it up ?
What happens if the global market for this worthless scrip exceeds the worlds GDP ?
Oops , there is no one who could possibly cover that .
No bailout can buy up tens of trillions of dollars of counterfeit currency or phantom assets .
If I promise to ensure you against loss , and I have no actual resources to back it up other than a contract that says I will , I have produced a counterfeit document .
My promise has to be backed by an ability to pay , and I dont have it .
What I have is phony assets , marked to model ,  acquired by selling my guarantee off to someone else , who in turn does the same .
I take your money and leverage it into risky investments including more exotic vehicles that have no value , but that I think / pretend have value .
This is not gambling .
This is simple theft .
In gambling , money comes and goes , but is essentially conserved somewhere .
In this system of massive counterfeiting , I do the equivalent of flooding the monetary system with fraudulent promissory notes , passed off as assets , while skimming off huge fees with each transaction .
Yes , debt has now magically become an asset because it can ostensibly generate interest payment income and fees .
So we lower the monthly minimum on credit cards and jack up the interest rate to keep up the charade of huge returns .
We allow negative amortization .
We promote balloon payments .
There is no real value there BY DESIGN .
There cant be .
No one can possibly pay off a mortgage that is ten times their income with a principal that actually increases over time .
But if you can pass off the personal or institutional liability ( there is no risk here ; risk assumes some possibility of solvency ) you may be able to escape accountability and profit from this scam .
As a system , however , this will inevitably fail , and as we are seeing with both ecological and financial environments that we are all part of a system where even externalized liabilities will return to bite us .
What happens when a country floods its own monetary system with currency or makes money far too cheap through low interest rates .
At first rampant inflation in things like stocks or house prices , as demand for goods is driven up .
Anyone can buy anything with his or her own credit leverage and a lack of fear of consequences .
Then devaluation and deflation emerge as fundamentals catch up , followed by a liquidity crisis due to exposed ( fraudulent ) leverages  leverages which have an essentially infinite multiplication of pseudo value in exotic financial vehicles .
What happens when you flood the global market with toxic debt that far exceeds the ability of any country , and even consortiums of companies or countries to address the issue ?
You have a global meltdown , or you try to stave off the inevitable reckoning with 700 billion dollar band - aids that have within their conduct of use no provisions for transparency , because that transparency would expose the far deeper and more widespread fraud under the symptoms .
( This is all , of course , to help with an orderly unwinding of fraudulent assets . )
In the end what you will see , no matter the route , is worthless garbage .
Weve been here before .
Weve been told that terrorists flying planes into buildings was unthinkable ,  requiring complex planning and massive funding .
It was not unthinkable or complex .
It was simple , needing only a coordinated plan to destroy , exploited vulnerabilities , flight training , boxcutters , and navigation skills .
Regarding Iraq , we were warned of a mushroom cloud ,  bio-weapons and all those other complex threats that would get us if the president was not extended unlimited military powers .
It wasnt true or complex .
In fact , we have solid testimony from sources to Pulitzer Prize - winning reporter Ron Suskind , that the government actually forged documents to make that case for war .
People lied to gain power , plain and simple , making us all pay again .
Now we have counterfeiting to the tune of trillions of dollars , and were being asked to give 700 billion dollars to be used without any transparency , oversight , or accountability by Paulson and Bernanke .
Well we know one thing it will be used to do -- shroud the underlying core financial and moral crises until past the election and the January 2009 changing of the presidential guard .
This is again a very simple move to pay off the worlds financial elite , and help them retain power while avoiding accountability .
If you know someone is going to break up with you , do you want them to let you down easy , sweet talk you , still be your friend ,  screw around on you behind your back while keeping the relationship going , or simply make a clean honest break .
I prefer the clean honest break .
I like my pain straight up , so I can deal with the reality , assess the damage , and make a new start as more informed person .
Apparently too many like to be led along .=
Shah of Plano Dear Securities & Exchange Commission , I am requesting that you Investigate for Market Manipulation the following individuals : Hank Paulson , Chris Cox and Ben Bernanke .
This is not a joke .
It is obvious that these three so - called Government Officials are targeting the Values of particular companies in the stock and bond markets using their government authority to prop up their values .
As these Privileged Companies such as Goldman Sachs lose value in the market place these so - called Government Officials get to work on their behalf with Liquidity Grants , Rule Changes and intimidation of their critics .
I will be contacting my elected officials in Texas and pursuing this matter in every way I can .
Lastly , I am also requesting that the S.E.C. review the planed One Trillion Dollar Bailout that Hank Paulson has announced by investigating all e-mails , phone logs and other meetings to ascertain if the Treasury is working at the behest of Wall Street Firms or the American Tax Payer .
Please update me with your inquiry .

The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) is on a fast - track process as rich nations hope to wrap it up by the end of the year .
Unfortunately for everyone who cares about the outcome , it 's midway through September , and no draft text has yet emerged .
The secrecy and the delay have inspired many conspiracy theories , none helped by leaked sets of corporate " wish lists " and public comments making outrageous demands .
A worldwide group of public interest organizations has now banded together to call on ACTA negotiators to open the process up to scrutiny and public comment .
The letter , signed by more than 100 groups , has tough words for ACTA negotiators .
" The lack of transparency in negotiations of an agreement that will affect the fundamental rights of citizens of the world is fundamentally undemocratic , " it says .
" It is made worse by the public perception that lobbyists from the music , film , software , video games , luxury goods and pharmaceutical industries have had ready access to the ACTA text and pre-text discussion documents through long - standing communication channels . "
Seven specific concerns are cited , all based on leaked documents or public comments from various trade groups , many of which seem bent on turning an anti-counterfeiting agreement into something more wide - ranging .
It 's unclear what the negotiators themselves think of most such requests , but that 's part of the problem .
According to the letter , ACTA might :
Require Internet Service Providers to monitor all consumers '
Internet communications , terminate their customers '
Internet connections based on rights - holders ' repeated allegation of copyright infringement , and divulge the identity of alleged copyright infringers possibly without judicial process
Interfere with fair use of copyrighted materials
Criminalize peer - to - peer file sharing
Interfere with legitimate parallel trade in goods , including the resale of brand - name pharmaceutical products
Impose liability on manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ) , if those APIs are used to make counterfeits
Improperly criminalize acts not done for commercial purpose and with no public health consequences
Improperly divert public resources into enforcement of private rights
Signatories of the letter include everyone from the EFF to the Australian National University to the Canadian Internet Policy & Public Interest Clinic to Korea 's Christian Media Network to the Dutch Consumentenbond to Thailand 's Drug Study Group ( DSG ) to the Ecologist Collective from Guadalajara , México to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights .
It 's a dizzying list with worldwide backing , but the more important question is whether it will have any effect .
To date , ACTA negotiators have proved themselves supremely resistant to involving stakeholders in the process , and many of these groups are from countries not even involved in the negotiations .
Different national negotiators have followed different strategies , though , and credit has to be given to the office of the US Trade Representative , which requested ( and then published ) a lengthy series of public commentary on the treaty .
Without much to go on apart from some leaked documents , though , the comments became a set of " we like / we hate " lists .
Because of the secrecy , it remains unclear which of the suggestions USTR is pushing in its negotiating sessions .
However , up in Canada , news over the summer suggested that the recording business , movie studios , and video game makers were welcome to advise ACTA negotiators in private .
Meanwhile , privacy groups , NGOs , and other stakeholders are forced to wait in the hallway .
The human brain could become a battlefield in future wars , a new report predicts , including ' pharmacological land mines ' and drones directed by mind control
Rapid advances in neuroscience could have a dramatic impact on national security and the way in which future wars are fought , US intelligence officials have been told .
In a report commissioned by the Defense Intelligence Agency , leading scientists were asked to examine how a greater understanding of the brain over the next 20 years is likely to drive the development of new medicines and technologies .
They found several areas in which progress could have a profound impact , including behaviour - altering drugs , scanners that can interpret a person 's state of mind and devices capable of boosting senses such as hearing and vision .
On the battlefield , bullets may be replaced with " pharmacological land mines " that release drugs to incapacitate soldiers on contact , while scanners and other electronic devices could be developed to identify suspects from their brain activity and even disrupt their ability to tell lies when questioned , the report says .
" The concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market .
It is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects , " the report states .
The report highlights one electronic technique , called transcranial direct current stimulation , which involves using electrical pulses to interfere with the firing of neurons in the brain and has been shown to delay a person 's ability to tell a lie .
Drugs could also be used to enhance the performance of military personnel .
There is already anecdotal evidence of troops using the narcolepsy drug modafinil , and ritalin , which is prescribed for attention deficit disorder , to boost their performance .
Future drugs , developed to boost the cognitive faculties of people with dementia , are likely to be used in a similar way , the report adds .
Greater understanding of the brain 's workings is also expected to usher in new devices that link directly to the brain , either to allow operators to control machinery with their minds , such as flying unmanned reconnaissance drones , or to boost their natural senses .
For example , video from a person 's glasses , or audio recorded from a headset , could be processed by a computer to help search for relevant information .
" Experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on , " Kit Green , who chaired the report committee , said .
The report warns that while the US and other western nations might now consider themselves at the forefront of neuroscience , that is likely to change as other countries ramp up their computing capabilities .
Unless security services can monitor progress internationally , they risk " major , even catastrophic , intelligence failures in the years ahead " , the report warns .
" In the intelligence community , there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that it 's going to be impossible to predict surprises .
This is a black hole that needs to be filled with light , " Green told the Guardian .
The technologies will one day have applications in counter - terrorism and crime - fighting .
The report says brain imaging will not improve sufficiently in the next 20 years to read peoples ' intentions from afar and spot criminals before they act , but it might be good enough to help identify people at a checkpoint or counter who are afraid or anxious .
" We 're not going to be reading minds at a distance , but that does n't mean we can't detect gross changes in anxiety or fear , and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see what 's upsetting them , " Green said .
The development of advanced surveillance techniques , such as cameras that can spot fearful expressions on people 's faces , could lead to some inventive ways to fool them , the report adds , such as Botox injections to relax facial muscles .

How did we make the leap from ancient hunter - gatherers to modern consumers and traders ?
Why do people get so emotional and irrational about bottom - line financial and business decisions ?

The JREF Welcomes New Foundation President
Dr. Philip Plait
The James Randi Educational Foundation ( JREF ) is pleased to announce that Dr. Philip Plait – renowned astronomer , author , and skeptic – will be taking on the role of President of the JREF effective immediately .
The goals of the JREF are to bring critical thinking to the public , expose pseudoscientific frauds , and promote real science and rationality .
“ Phil is a skeptic , a scientist , and a colleague , and his ideas and vigor will take the JREF very far indeed .
We ’re pleased and proud to have him take the reins , ” said James Randi , internationally known magician and critical thinker , who is the founder and outgoing president of the JREF .
“ I will now be dedicating much of my time to completing my next two books , Wrong ! , and A Magician in the Laboratory . ”
Dr. Plait has a long affiliation with the JREF .
He has been a speaker at all of The Amazing Meetings – a JREF - sponsored annual conference series and the largest gathering of critical thinkers in the world – and over the years has provided valuable advice and support for the JREF in scientific and other matters .
During that time he has grown to be a strong part of the Foundation .
Before joining the JREF , Dr. Plait spent ten years performing scientific research using the Hubble Space Telescope , much of it as a contractor at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center .
It was at this time that he created the Bad Astronomy website , where he critically ( and humorously ) analyzes various astronomical myths and misconceptions .
His debunking of the Moon Hoax ( people who think NASA faked the Apollo Moon landings ) became an Internet favorite , bringing in tens of millions of views .
His award - winning Bad Astronomy
Blog is one of the largest and most popular scientific blogs in the world .
In July 2008 it was acquired by Discover Magazine , where his audience continues to grow .
Plait is an internationally sought - after lecturer and has given numerous interviews on national TV , radio , and podcasts .
He has written two popular - level science books : Bad Astronomy ( Wiley and Sons , 2002 ) , and the upcoming Death from the Skies ! ( Viking 2008 ) , which deals with cosmic catastrophes .
It was his first book that brought him to the attention of Mr. Randi , who asked him to speak at the JREF ’s 2003 conference .
In fact , Plait attributes his current stature in the skeptical community to James Randi .
“ When I was young , I believed in all sorts of antiscientific silliness like the Bermuda Triangle , astral projection , and the like .

The US space agency needs to have better consideration for the sexual needs of their astronauts during long missions in space .
Also , more research needs to be done to investigate human embryo development in zero - gravity or low - gravity environments , especially if NASA is serious about setting up a colony on Mars in the next 30 years .
These warnings have been issued by a NASA advisor at a time when the agency does n’t have enough funds allocated for human space physiology .
These concerns are by no means trivial , basic human needs and the ability to procreate beyond Earth may be critical for missions lasting years …
At a time when the question “ Can we have sex in space ? ” is becoming more and more popular by the future space tourists hoping to become a member of the 100 - mile high club , a serious issue is beginning to surface for our long - term presence in space .
Humans have needs , and although the astronauts selected by NASA , ESA and the other international space agencies are highly professional individuals , Dr Jason Kring , a NASA advisor and assistant professor at Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida , has pointed out that sexual desire is as potent as the need for water and food .
“ But the bottom line is that , like hunger and thirst , sex is a basic biological motive , ” he said in an interview with the UK ’s Sunday Telegraph .
“ The potential round - trip mission to Mars could take three years .
It doesnâ€™t make sense to assume that these men and women are going to have no thoughts of it for three years .
Nasa and other space agencies should address this in their training and in crew selection . ”
Kring suggests our future long - term space explorers should replicate what the early polar explorers did and take a colleague as a lover to minimize sexual frustration .
It is difficult to predict the stresses long - term missions into space and to other planets may cause , but there is a very practical reason for this worry .
Heightened stress on a spaceship will create an increased risk of confrontations , lack of focus and mission failure .
When considering a possible 3 - year mission to Mars , mission scientists will want the crew to be as calm and stress - free as possible .
Kring adds that future manned spacecraft to the Moon and Mars should be designed to optimize the privacy of astronauts so relationships can be consummated .
This basic human need was recognized by explorers here on Earth where South Pole expedition members took on “ expedition spouses ” as sexual partners for the duration .
When the expedition was over , the explorers would return home to their families and spouses .
Pairing up with a colleague therefore sidesteps the biological issues of the possibility of “ going without ” for months , or years at a time .
There are obvious questions surrounding the psychological effect of taking on “ expedition spouses ” ( especially the effect on the partners waiting here on Earth for the astronauts return ! ) , but the biological question will at least have an answer .
The fact remains however , that we are naive of the effects of sex in space , let alone if it is even a pleasurable experience .
The mechanics of “ human docking procedures ” ( as described by tests carried out by the Russian space agency ) are a lot more complicated when in zero gravity .
NASA researchers have pointed out that additional problems include motion sickness , increased sweating and a drop in blood pressure – all of which are big problems for astronauts in space .
There are also huge ethical questions hanging over possible pregnancies in space .
Zero -G tests on rat embryos produced decreased skeletal and brain development , the effects on a human embryo will remain a mystery .
Also , even if astronauts are having sex for purely recreational reasons , the effectiveness of oral contraception has been brought into question , making the whole procedure highly problematic , risking accidental pregnancies ( something no space agency is prepared for , especially during missions to the Moon or Mars ) .
The fact remains that NASA continues to cut back biological research in favor of future Moon missions , so much about human sexuality in space will remain a mystery .
This point is highlighted by a NASA spokesperson who stated , “ We do n’t study sexuality in space . ”

In December , New York City became the first metropolis to regulate the presence of trans fats - such as vegetable shortening , margarine , and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil - in restaurants .
Commonly used for frying and in baked goods , trans fats raise LDL , or " bad " cholesterol , and lower HDL , or " good " cholesterol .
Since the New York Department of Health passed the measure , restaurants and bakeries have been phasing out trans fats , replacing them with healthier fats such as olive oil and safflower oil ; restaurants must be trans fat - free by July 1 , 2008 .
Other cities , such as Boston , Philadelphia , and Seattle , have followed suit and also banned trans fats .
" I made a conscious decision early on to prepare our food as healthily as possible , a decision I made for the health of my guests , " says Kenneth Wood , co-owner and chef at Sylvia 's , a famed soul - food restaurant in Harlem .
" So the ban did n't affect me like it did some other businesses who had n't made that choice .
But overall , I think the ban has been a positive thing : trans fat is unhealthy , and it does n't affect the quality or the taste of the food . "
Thirteen campaign workers for Barack Obama yesterday yanked their voter registrations and ballots in Ohio after being warned by a prosecutor that temporary residents can’t vote in the battleground state .
A dozen staffers – including Obama Ohio spokeswoman Olivia Alair and James Cadogan , who recently joined Team Obama – signed a form letter asking the Franklin County elections board to pull their names from the rolls .
The letter – a copy of which was obtained by palestra.net , a Fox News affiliate – came a day after prosecutor Ron O’Brien publicly urged out - of - state campaign workers for both Obama and John McCain to “ examine your conscience ” before the elections board beings begins opening absentee ballots today .
Earlier in the week , O’Brien spoke with lawyers for both camps and urged them to make sure their staffs met permanent - residency rules , or face possible felony charges .
Also pulling his ballot yesterday was Hofstra University grad Jake Smith , an Obama volunteer who had voted in Knox County , Ohio .
On Thursday , O’Brien cut a deal with 13 out - of - staters , including four from New York , who tossed out their already - cast ballots and admitted they did n’t meet residency requirements .
He can't help himself :
" I am grateful for the fact that I have a wonderful life , " McCain said .
" I spent some years without a kitchen table , without a chair , and I know what it 's like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation . "
Jeez .
This is clinical .
He 's responding to middle class economic anxiety by referring to the Hanoi Hilton ?

Watch Sarah Palin ’s sportcast below .
Now imagine her staring down the likes of Vladimir Putin .
This has nothing to do with Sarah Palin ’s gender .
I ’m all for a woman president – while we preferred Obama , Hillary would have been a fine commander in chief .
But Hillary spent her life in jobs preparing her for sitting in “ the ” chair .
Sarah Palin did not .
The more we learn about Sarah Palin , the more she comes across as just goofy .

Do n't get cocky , Obama warns supporters as he surges even further ahead of McCain after final TV debate
Barack Obama has warned his supporters not to be overconfident as he surged even further ahead in the U.S. Presidential race .
The Illinois senator sounded increasingly optimistic about his White House chances at a fundraiser in New York today .
He said : ' We are now 19 days not from the end , but from the beginning .
The amount of work that is going to be involved for the next president is going to be extraordinary . '
Barack Obama looked unruffled during the final TV showdown with John McCain
But he told supporters : ' Two words for you : New Hampshire .
I 've been in these positions before where we were favored and the press starts getting carried away , and we end up getting spanked . '
Obama won the Iowa caucuses , only to lose to Hillary Rodham Clinton in New Hampshire in the primary .
The Democrat nominee is now the runaway favourite to become America 's first black president after fending off a fusillade of attacks from John McCain in their final TV showdown .
A pugnacious Mr McCain threw everything he had at his unruffled Democrat opponent - but he still failed to land the knock - out blow he desperately needed to lift his flagging campaign .
And although Republican pundits gave the agitated Republican senator top marks for effort , a flurry of post - debate polls voted the unflappable Mr Obama the clear winner on points .
By passing his crucial test under the scrutiny of the nation in the third and last televised debate , Mr Obama can see the path opening up for a historic victory .
The latest opinion polls have him ahead by as much as 14 points and every indication suggests that a swathe of staunch Republican strongholds will fall to the Democrat front - runner .
The two candidates pose with their wives Cindy McCain , left , and Michelle Obama at the end of the debate .
Polls after the broadcast put Mr Obama decisively ahead
But with just 18 days to the November 4 election , there was growing speculation last night over whether the U.S. was really ready to vote for a black president .
The race factor was only mentioned fleetingly in the debate at Hofstra University on New York 's Long Island and has barely figured in the campaign .
But it is certain to loom large over the final weeks of electioneering as the Obama campaign focuses on consolidating support among white voters .
The very real concern among Mr Obama 's inner circle is that a decisive percentage of white supporters may tell pollsters they will vote for a black president - but fail to follow through in the privacy of the ballot booth .
Political analysts insist that if he were white , Mr Obama would already be picking out wallpaper for the White House .
Harold Ickes , who was the Rev Jesse Jackson 's advisor when he ran for president , said he shaves off a point or two from poll numbers to account for hidden racial prejudices .
' If he were white , this would be a blowout , ' Mr Ickes told the New York Times .
' I think the country has come a long , long , long way since the 1960s .
I think everybody would agree with that .
' But if you talk to people in certain states , they will say there are impulses that do not benefit Barack Obama because of the colour of his skin . '
Protesters and police clashed outside Hofstra University , where the final debate was held , leaving some injured
The phenomenon of voters lying about their prejudices to pollsters is known as the ' Bradley effect ' in the U.S. , after Tom Bradley , an African American who narrowly lost the 1982 California governor 's election despite leading in polls .
His defeat surprised observers who concluded many white voters had not been honest about their intentions .
Ever since , pollsters have tried to factor in the Bradley effect in elections featuring black candidates .
The chief focus of concern is America 's deep south , where scars of segregation are most recent .
In the debate , Mr Obama complained about reports that Republican supporters jeered ' terrorist ' and ' kill him ' when his name was mentioned at rallies for vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
Mr McCain said comparisons of the slurs with the racial tension surrounding civil rights battles against segregation in the south during the 1960s was ' very unfair ' and ' deeply hurtful ' .
But it was a small part of the most explosive of the three presidential debates .
With an edgy mix of impatient eye - rolling and sidelong glares bordering on contempt , Mr McCain , 72 , treated the 47 - year - old Illinois senator like a naughty schoolboy , peppering him with jibes over the economy , abortion rights , healthcare and taxes .
He even went toe - to - toe with Mr Obama over his links to William Ayers , whom he described as an ' old , washed - up terrorist ' , a subject that was taboo in their two previous debates .
Polls put Obama as much as 14 points ahead of his Republican rival with just 18 days to go of the contest , but supporters are warning against being over confident because of ' racial prejudices ' in the U.S .
But polls later showed an overwhelming majority of U.S. viewers thought Mr Obama won out by generally remaining above personal attacks .
A CNN survey gave Mr Obama the verdict by 58 per cent to 31 per cent and uncommitted voters taking part in a CBS News / Knowledge Networks poll gave him an even more emphatic edge by 53 per cent to 22 per cent .
The sparks began to fly after Mr Obama followed through with one of his main campaign mantras , linking Mr McCain with ' eight years of failed Bush policies . '
Bristling , Mr McCain immediately retorted : ' Senator Obama , I am not President Bush .
If you wanted to run against President Bush you should have done so four years ago . '
' If I 've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush 's policies , it 's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people - on tax policy , on energy policy , on spending priorities - you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush , ' hit back Mr Obama .
Mr McCain 's short fuse almost blew when , as expected , he launched into a personal attack on Mr Obama over his connections to William Ayers , a Chicago university professor who was a founder member of the Weather Underground activist group that was blamed for a string of bombings in Washington during the 1960s Vietnam War protests .
Mr Obama replied by saying he was eight - years - old when Ayers carried out his ' despicable acts ' .
' The fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign , Senator McCain , says more about your campaign than it says about me , ' he added .
Indias Runaway  Growth : Distortion , Disarticulation , and Exclusion
IV .
How Distortion , Disarticulation , and Exclusion Are Built into Indias Runaway  Growth 
The Indian economy has no doubt been undergoing very rapid GDP growth for the past few years .
However , the nature of this growth is such that it accentuates all the existing distortions in India ’s pattern of development , to an extreme .
Who can miss the most visible manifestations of these distortions – the grotesque gap between the rich and the poor , the metropolises and the countryside , the performance of the stockmarket and that of agriculture ?
Where views differ is on what , if anything , needs to be done about these disparities .
An important section of ‘ opinion - makers ’ , well - represented in the media , believe nothing at all need be done : economic growth is generating jobs and prosperity , and poverty is vanishing on its own .
All that remains is to do away with the remnants of State intervention in the economy in order to give full latitude to the dynamic private sector .
No doubt a section of people suffer in the course of this development , but that is part of the pain that accompanies all progress .
Another influential section is less crass , and more sensitive to the turbulent political realities of India – even as they share certain fundamental premises with the first section .
These humanitarians emphasise the need to make development more ‘ inclusive ’ by sharing some of the revenues of the current boom with the disadvantaged – through the expansion of public employment schemes , child welfare and nutrition schemes , public expenditure on education , health and other services , measures to uplift the socially disadvantaged , and so on .
In the last few years the country ’s rulers have picked up on these themes and have included higher ‘ social sector ’ allocations in the Eleventh Plan .
Hardly anyone can argue against larger expenditures on employment schemes , welfare , nutrition , education , and health .
If carried out , they would partly reverse the damage done by more than 16 years of fiscal retrenchment and straitjacketing .
But this ‘ welfarist ’ approach essentially views the process of bettering the lives of people as separate from the process of economic ‘ growth ’ ; the sphere of distribution divorced from the sphere of production .
The only link it makes between the two is that some funds for people ’s welfare can be raised thanks to the growth of the economy .
The limitations of such a theoretical frame are particularly apparent in a country like ours , where the majority of people are in a pitiable condition .
Demanding greater expenditure on people ’s basic needs should not divert us from examining the underlying economic processes which generate and reproduce disparities , exclusion , disarticulation and distortion on an ever larger scale .
It should not divert us from tracing these processes to basic social relations , in order to change them .
The argument in brief
In the first chapter we argued that we cannot attach much meaning to the phrase ‘ economic growth ’ .
Rather , we must investigate the pattern of development to know what it means for people .
In order to understand that pattern , we need to approach it historically .
Thus we briefly sketched the pattern of capitalist growth in Europe , characterised by a complex of linked developments in the economic and social spheres .
We proceeded to describe the distinct course of colonial development of India : how colonialism used its political hold to drain surplus from India ’s economy , and for this purpose ruptured important linkages between ( and within ) sectors of India ’s economy .
These were the linkages through which in the ‘ normal ’ course – that is , the course taken by the original capitalist countries – capital accumulates , expands itself over and over , and transforms every sector of an economy from within .
While certain internal linkages were broken , certain external ones were strengthened out of proportion .
This prevented accumulation in some sectors , and diverted surplus to others for the purpose of the drain , stunting growth in large sectors and exaggerating it in select sectors .
This pattern of development fostered certain native classes whose interests were linked with imperialism , and it is these classes that ascended to power with the departure of the British .
Maintaining their grip on political power , these classes perpetuated a pattern of development along the same course , under the tutelage of the ‘ developed world ’ , that is , the imperialist countries .
There have been many obvious changes since the end of British rule , and these changes appear to have accelerated in the last decade ; yet the economy is in crucial ways still shaped by the legacy of colonialism and the continuing hold of imperialism .
As a result , the spectacular growth celebrated by the rulers is restricted to islands of the economy ; the vast mass of people are trapped in miserable economic conditions and face unbearable social oppression .
With this we reach our subject proper , namely , the current pattern of private corporate sector - led growth .
First , we sketch the extremely distorted structure of the economy .
The bulk of the workforce is crammed into sectors with very low income ; a tiny section of the workforce is in the booming sectors .
The links between the different sectors ( and within the each sector ) are missing or weak , allowing islands to flourish in a sea of backwardness and poverty .
The gaps between these sectors and sub-sectors are expanding with the growing capital - intensity of the private corporate sector .
Secondly , we link the current spell of rapid growth in India to certain developments in the world economy and large inflows of speculative capital from the developed countries .
That is , the current high ‘ growth ’ is not essentially an internally generated phenomenon , but an externally induced one .
Moreover , the increasing financialisation of capital in the imperialist economies has brought some changes in the operation of imperialism here .
Among the by - products of the changes in the world economy is the emergence of Indian firms as ‘ multinationals ’ , powered partly by foreign capital .
However , the increased integration of the Indian economy with the highly financialised global economy implies that the impending crisis in the latter , and particularly the long - term downturn in the trajectory of the leading imperialist power , may transmit both shocks and stagnation here .
Thirdly , we sketch the pattern of growth of the private sector in this period of boom .
We showed how foreign inflows have generated a boom in credit , which , given the structure of the economy , fueled a consumerist surge concentrated among the better - off ; this in turn spurred growth in a range of industries catering to this demand .
However , this market necessarily remained narrow .
Inevitably , the push for rapid growth on such a narrow base took the form of ‘ enclaves ’ catering to export or the elite : the software and BPO industries , the SEZs , and ‘ infrastructure ’ projects fenced off from the requirements of the rest of economy .
Fourthly , we describe a significant element in the economy ’s ‘ growth ’ : the large - scale capture of natural resources by the private corporate sector , using the State machinery .
As this pattern of resource capture progresses , it results in large - scale destitution of the already depressed sections of the rural population – even as it shows up as growth in GDP .
Fifthly , we illustrate the manner in which various flourishing industries – health care , real estate , organised retail , luxury industries – either caused or required economic exclusion of the working people as an essential part of their growth .
Sixthly , we show how , while neo-liberalism talks of the need for the State to retreat from economic intervention , it actually requires active State intervention in order to transfer surplus to the private corporate sector on a massive scale .
Here we talk of various forms of privatisation and the array of subsidies provided to the corporate sector .
Seventhly , as a natural outcome of this pattern of growth , extreme inequalities have developed in Indian society .
They have progressed to the point where among ruling class circles , and even within international financial institutions , some have raised the alarm , pointing to the threat of grave social disorder .
Yet these alarms have little meaning ; the present order is quite incapable of moderating inequalities .
Finally , we discuss the extraordinary growth of the financial sector within a small enclave of the Indian economy – a necessary consequence of integration with global financial markets even as the internal economy remains disarticulated .
This integration has yielded foreign investors breathtaking returns ; it has also placed the Indian economy on a precipice .
The impending troubles of the world economy now will have a more direct impact here .
Further , even in the absence of a crash , the demands of foreign speculative capital – such as the introduction of capital account convertibility and the transformation of Mumbai into an international financial centre – require the further subordination of the productive economy of the vast majority to the financial - speculative island .
An alternative path of development must be based on transforming agrarian relations :
This would be the prerequisite for accumulation in the vast agrarian sector , and in turn would create scope for generating manifold internal linkages in the economy – between sectors , within sectors .
Growth rates would not seem so spectacular , but the growth would be meaningful for the people and be more reliable , because based on an internal dynamic .
Moreover , the process of transforming agrarian relations would bring to the fore long - suppressed social forces capable of pursuing a development path in favour of the vast mass of people – whose productive energies too would be progressively unleashed in this course .

Obama slams McCain for sordid attacks amid economic peril Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This ASHEVILLE , North Carolina ( AFP ) â Barack Obama 's White House campaign hammered Republican John McCain Sunday for wanting to " turn the page " on the US economic crisis and engage in low - blow personal attacks a month away from election day .
The Democrat hit back with a new television spot after McCain 's running mate Sarah Palin accused Obama of consorting with " terrorists , " in an attack on his ties in Chicago to former anti-Vietnam war militant William Ayers .
Obama , campaigning here before the second presidential debate on Tuesday , was also accusing McCain of planning to deprive 20 million more workers of their employer - funded health insurance at a time of mounting job losses .
McCain , who was preparing for the debate near his ranch in Arizona , is down in the polls including in some all - important states , and is retooling his message ahead of the November 4 vote to portray Obama as unfit to lead .
The new Obama ad featured footage of a shuttered factory , a panicked financial trading floor and a family struggling to make ends meet .
It juxtaposed those images with remarks from top McCain adviser Greg Strimple , who said the campaign was " looking forward to turning a page on this financial crisis " and attacking Obama 's " aggressively liberal record . "
" Three quarters of a million jobs lost this year .
Our financial system in turmoil .
And John McCain ?
Erratic in a crisis .
Out of touch on the economy , " the ad's narrator said .
" No wonder his campaign 's announced a plan to ' turn a page on the financial crisis ' -- distract with dishonest , dishonorable assaults against Barack Obama , " it said , closing with an image of McCain with President George W. Bush .
" Struggling families can't turn the page on this economy -- and we can't afford another president who 's this out of touch . "
After Congress approved a 700 - billion - dollar financial bailout plan last week , the McCain campaign hopes to refocus attention away from the reeling economy and back to Obama 's comparative inexperience and liberal associates .
Alaska Governor Palin , at two campaign stops in Colorado and California Saturday , raised the Ayers connection after a New York Times report on the professor of education and former member of a group of 1960s radicals .
That group , the Weathermen , carried out a series of bombings on the Pentagon and other government buildings .
The Times report backed up Obama 's assertions that he is only loosely connected to Ayers in the Chicago milieu .
But Palin accused the Illinois senator of " palling around with terrorists " and said the Democrat was therefore " not a man who sees America as you and I do , as the greatest force for good in the world " .
Obama aides called the one - term governor 's remarks " shameless , " and said the Democrat would never go down to the kinds of " Swift Boat " attacks that helped to sink 2004 nominee John Kerry 's campaign against Bush .
Republican attacks portray Ayers as part of a shadowy network of Chicago backers that includes convicted fraudster Antoin " Tony " Rezko , a property tycoon who used to be a top fundraiser for Obama .
It is also unlikely that voters have heard the last about Obama 's fiery former pastor , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , who exploded into the campaign with videotaped sermons urging his parishioners to sing " God damn America . "
But the Obama campaign said it would not be distracted from voters ' anxieties as crisis sweeps through Wall Street and Main Street -- and it has the polling numbers to back up its confidence .
Based on current polls in the state - by - state battle , the website RealClearPolitics estimates that Obama has 264 Electoral College votes to 163 for McCain .
That leaves the Democrat just six votes short of victory .
Yes , we 're gay !
Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Ronson finally confirm Hollywood 's worst kept secret
After months of speculation about their relationship Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Ronson have finally confirmed they are a couple .
The pair were talking to an American radio DJ who asked them how long they had been together .
' A very long time , ' replied 22 - year - old actress Lohan , who has been living with the 30 - year - old DJ since May .
So in love : Lindsay Lohan hugs her more casually - attired girlfriend Samantha Ronson , who the actress confirmed has been her partner for ' a very long time '
The couple had rung the show to speak to DJ Stryker on Sunday about the plane crash in which their close friend Adam ' DJ AM ' Goldstein was badly burned on Friday night .
He told them : ' I hope you guys stay together , you 're a very lovely looking couple . '
Lohan then thanked him .
The couple are rumoured to be buying a house together in New York .
They have been inseparable since the start of 2008 , stirring rumours that they were secret lovers .
They made their affection for each other public on numerous occasions .
Bottoms up : Lohan leans in for a tender moment with Ronson
Earlier this month , they shared a tender moment on a street in New York .
After shopping in Soho they were seen kissing outside the Mercer Hotel .
London born Ronson , the sister of Mark Ronson , also visited Lohan on the set of Ugly Betty , as she filmed her guest appearance for the hit show .
Meanwhile , Lohan 's father has hit out at Ronson again .
Just one month after Michael Lohan publicly criticised Ronson for ' using my daughter ' , an email in which he slams the DJ as a ' disgusting representation of humanity ' has reportedly come to light .
In the email , published by entertainment news agency X17 , Michael allegedly writes : ' There is a lot more to Samantha than meets the eye !
Not that what we see is sooo pleasing anyway !
Glamour girl : Lohan poses during a fashion magazine photo shoot in the Hollywood Hills
' I mean , what ’s with this … “ person ” ???
Look at the way she “ dresses ” ?
Once more , she uses her middle finger more that she uses words !
Personally , I think she is dark , hideous and a disgusting representation of humanity !
' I heard and know more about Samantha than you can imagine .
Yet , while I have n't exposed her , I know that God will .'
Following several years of estrangement , Lohan reunited with her father after checking into rehab last year .
The happy couple joke around during a night out
But last month , Lohan rebuked her dad after the born - again Christian accused Ronson of passing alcohol to the young Hollywood star .
Lohan wrote on her MySpace page : ' It really hurts , because I have tried - after all that my mother and siblings have gone through , I really tried to make things work .
' For the hope of having a father again - wanting things to change - even though people have said , some people will forever remain the same .
' Having said that - the people were right , and he is yet to change - but this time , without his daughter by his side .
' He has become a public embaressment [ sic ] and a bully . '
It turns out that that “ overhead projector ” John McCain claimed Barack Obama tried to get a $ 3 million earmark for was actually money to rebuild Chicago ’s Adler Planetarium , the oldest planetarium in the United States .
McCain ’s “ overhead projector ” is the apparatus that runs the planetarium , which is a bit like calling the Palomar Observatory a new set of glasses .
REYKJAVIK , Sept 11 ( Reuters ) - Support in Iceland for joining the European Union and adopting the euro currency is at its highest in five years , according to a new poll released on Tuesday .
According to the survey by Capacent Gallup for the Federations of Icelandic Industries ( FII ) , 48 percent of Icelanders back joining the EU and 53 percent favour adopting the euro .
Recent volatility in the crown currency has given new life to the long - standing debate over EU membership and the bloc ’s currency .
Some analysts and politicians have gone so far as to speculate about the possibility of joining the euro unilaterally .
Aspirants to the 13 - nation euro club must meet strict inflation , debt and budget deficit criteria set out under the Maastricht Treaty .
The debate over whether to peg to or adopt the euro has been fuelled by recent wild swings in the crown as well as the advent in May of a more Europe - friendly coalition government .
“ The conclusion of the poll is no surprise to me , ” said University of Iceland political scientist Eirikur Bergmann .
“ Support for adopting the euro always strengthens when the ( crown ) is depreciating and fluctuating like now , ” he added .
The crown has weakened more than 12 percent since a July slide sparked by global credit concerns .
SHIFTING CORPORATE LANDSCAPE
Economist Jon Bjarki Bentsson at Glitnir Research said changes in the island nation ’s business landscape have also made the euro a more attractive option .
“ The Icelandic economy is getting more and more global and Icelandic companies are increasingly expanding their operations abroad , ” Bentsson said .
Last week , Straumur - Burdaras STRB.IC , Iceland 's biggest investment bank , and seafood firm Alfesca A.IC both announced their shares would be listed in euros instead of crowns .
The companies are among the several Icelandic firms that have shifted to the euro as their accounting currency .
Sigurdur Einarsson , chairman of Kaupthing KAUP.IC , Iceland 's largest bank , said his bank would soon do the same .
“ The ( crown ) has become too small for Kaupthing and for the Icelandic economy , ” he told the Icelandic Financial News .
Still , central bank head David Oddsson said the euro would not guarantee economic health in a country that has struggled with rapid inflation and big imbalances in recent years .
“ I find it hilarious to discuss the unilateral adoption of the euro as something realistic and giving the euro status as a solution to all our problems , ” he told reporters last week .
Bentsson at Glitnir agreed that the euro was not a prescription for Iceland ’s economic ills .
“ Before discussing our options , we need to achieve stability in the economy and maintain it , ” he said .
“ Then we should turn to next task and assess whether the euro is what we need or not . ”
He said regardless of the economic reasoning , any decision on euro adoption must be a political one .
The new coalition government , a union between the right - leaning Conservatives and the Social Democrats formed in May , is considered the most Europe - friendly government to take power in Iceland for decades .
Foreign Affairs Minister and Social Democratic party leader Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir is an avowed EU supporter .
Coalition partner the Conservatives Party , long leery of closer ties with Europe , is growing less sceptical under Prime Minister Geir Haarde , political scientists say .
“ The key to any political development on this issue is the Conservative party , ” Bergmann said .
“ The Conservatives are the biggest political force in Iceland and before they put their approval on applying for membership nothing will happen . ”

Finally , the networks face the bullies down :
TVNewser has learned all the networks were prepared to ban the use of pictures and video from Gov. Sarah Palin 's meetings at the UN today .
The ban was in protest of the McCain campaign 's restriction on editorial presence .
We hear the networks had arranged for a pool camera to cover all the meetings , and at least three journalists were to be present as well ( one print , one radio , one TV ) .
Earlier today , the McCain campaign said it would allow just one editorial person inside .
Later , the campaign limited it to a camera only .
Within the last few minutes , the campaign reversed course and will allow a CNN producer in to the meetings .
The press is beginning to resist the incredibly sexist handling of Palin by the McCain campaign .
There is a simple point here : any candidate for president should be as available to press inquiries as humanly possible .
Barring a press conference for three weeks , preventing any questions apart from two television interviews , one by manic partisan Sean Hannity , devising less onerous debate rules for a female candidate , and then trying to turn the press into an infomercial for the GOP is beyond disgraceful .
Fight back , you hacks !
Demand access .
Demand accountability !
It 's our duty .
If we can not ask questions of a total newbie six weeks before an election in which she could become president of the country , then the First Amendment is pointless .
Grow some !
We want to hear what you think about this article .

I was reminded ( again ) this morning on a TV commercial that Senator John McCain has voted with President Bush 90 % of the time .
Over the past few days , I ’ve also heard some Democrats increase that ‘ genuine approximation ’ to 95 % .
Senator Obama has clearly put his education to good use and strategically inversed the 90 % figure to say he ’s “ … unwilling to risk a 10 % chance at change because John McCain has voted with President Bush 90 % of the time ” .
That Obama fellow is so clever the way he flipped that around !
What I ’m really having hard time wrapping my brain around is the voting process by which these statistics were derived .
Has the President been quietly sneaking into the Capital late at night , casting ballots and YEA / NEA votes in Congress ?
Does the President legislate under a pseudonym or have a split - personality whereas he is the Chief Executive on even numbered days and a Senator on odd numbered days ?
Do you suppose he could keep track of even and odd numbers in the first place …or would he get confused on day # 1 ?
Does the Department of Homeland Security know about this flip - flopper ?
To the best of my understanding , voting takes place in the tall building with the dome , and Bill ’s get approved or vetoed in the Ivory Building down the street .
At least that ’s the way it happens in the PBS cartoon How a Bill becomes a Law I watched when I was a kid .
The President does n’t really get to vote … does he ?
And if he does n’t get to vote , then how can John McCain be voting with him 90 ( or 95 ) percent of the time ?
Would n’t it be more accurate to say “ President Bush has approved of the way Senator John McCain votes 90 % of the time ” ?
Or if you ’re a Democrat , “ President Bush has failed to agree with Senator McCain 10 % of the time ” ?
I suppose that would n’t make for a very inspirational TV commercial though .
I ’ll try harder to pay less attention on the next one .
I ’m Mathew Hall , and I approve of this message .
( A friend )
And if you approve of this message , then we are 1 for 1 and you have voted with me 100 % of the time .
When the Supreme Court ruled in June that detainees at Guantánamo had the right to challenge their detention in federal court , the justices said that after more than six years of legal wrangling the prisoners should have their cases heard quickly because “ the costs of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held in custody . ”
But nearly four months later , as the Bush administration has opened a new defense of its detention policies in federal court , none of the scores of cases brought by detainees have been resolved by any judge .
Since the Supreme Court issued its ruling , lawyers for most of the 255 detainees in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , have pressed ahead with habeas corpus lawsuits , yet most of those cases have been delayed by battles over issues like whether some court sessions will be held in secret , whether detainees can attend and what level of proof will justify detention .
Some of the arguments made by the Justice Department appear to challenge the Supreme Court ’s conclusion that the federal courts have a role in deciding the fate of the detainees .
One Bush administration argument asserts that only military officials  not federal judges  have the power to decide how to conclude wartime detentions .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 24 ( UPI ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's standing with U.S. voters has dropped sharply since the Republican Convention , a poll released Friday indicates .
Palin appears to be a drag on Republican nominee John McCain , The Washington Post said .

A majority of likely voters surveyed for the Washington Post - ABC News poll hold unfavorable views of Palin .
While 51 percent view her unfavorably , only 46 percent had a favorable view , a 13 percent drop since early September .
The drop in Palin 's approval among women has been especially sharp , down 21 percent among white women since early September and 24 percent among independent women .
When McCain introduced Palin to the national stage , many voters saw her as someone who understands the problems of ordinary people .
In the recent poll , only 50 percent saw her as someone who understands them , down 10 percent in three weeks , while 47 percent said she does not .
The poll found that among those who do not like Palin , 40 percent held strongly negative views .
The poll was done Wednesday and Thursday nights .
The polling sample and margin of error were not reported .

Many years back , I read with great interest about the Cilk project at MIT , headed up by Charles Leiserson ( that is : the L in CLR , Corman , Leiserson , and Rivest , authors of " Introduction to Algorithms " ) .
I was a bit saddened when I looked back at that work a year or so ago and saw very little had been done recently .
And it seemed that the world seemed to be standardizing on OpenMP , which to me , really seems an obviously inferior solution .
So , I was really excited when I noticed today that Cilk was not standing still , they were just working on starting a spin - off company , Cilk Arts , to further develop and commercialize the technology .
Apparently it now is now based on C++ instead of C , and is implemented both for GCC and for MS VC ++. I find it quite interesting , because it could make it possible for mere mortals to write efficient and correct multithreaded algorithms .
The genius is the simplicity .
There 's two new basic keywords added to C : , and .
Spawn spawns a new thread , and sync waits for all threads spawned by the current function to complete .
That 's basically the whole system .
They 've also added a , which more efficiently implements spawning off each iteration of the loop .
Here 's a trivial program from their examples :
You might be thinking right now : okay , so what ?
I can implement those macros , there 's no cleverness there .
But , if you just go off and literally implement what I said , you 'll quickly find that the overhead of thread spawning and waiting overshadows any possible efficiency gain you might get .
But , not so in Cilk : spawn is incredibly cheap to execute .
Why ?
Because itactually spawn off another thread .
Instead , it marks the current location as a place where another threadstart executing , if it has run out of its own work to do .
And , here is the great part : when some other thread is idle , it will steal work from the outer - most stack frame of the current thread at a " spawn " location .
Thus ensuring that the other thread can do the most work on its own before having to come back to get more work .
They call this the work - stealing scheduler .
Think about that one for a while .
It means you can start adding parallelism to almost any part of your program , even fairly small loops or recursive functions , without worrying excessively that the overhead of spawning off threads will erase any gains from parallelism .
And as you manage to push your way outwards , adding parallelism to larger parts of your application , as you verify that they do n't mutate global state , you do n't need to remove the spawning , either .
You do n't need to know where is most efficient to spawn off worker threads , you can just do itFor me , the biggest value here is that it can help solve the problem of converting an existing serial program to a parallel one .
Let 's say you have an giant program , that mutates global state all over the place , shares state everywhere , and you despair at the prospect of ever having it efficiently use multiple processors .
Now , Cilk wo n't really help you clean up your program .
But what does promise to do is , as you incrementally clean up small pieces , it allows you to add the parallelism right there , in that small piece , and have your program actually gain efficiency as you do so .
And , if eventually you manage to clean up larger parts of the program , and later add parallelism to an outer - more loop , it wo n't require you to go back and remove it from the inner loop .
And , that 's a Big Deal .
I encourage you to read more on their website .
The docs for Cilk ++ are public , and there are links to a bunch of papers written over the years .
Unfortunately , it seems Cilk ++ itself is n't publicly available yet ( and I have n't tried it either ) , but the earlier research project Cilk , upon which Cilk ++ is based , is available .
Now , if someone would just port it to Common Lisp . :)
The war in Iraq was moving toward an acceptable but not optimal solution .
The government in Baghdad was not pro-American , but neither was it an Iranian puppet , and that was the best that could be hoped for .
The United States anticipated pulling out troops , but not in a disorderly fashion .
The war in Afghanistan was deteriorating for the United States and NATO forces .
The Taliban was increasingly effective , and large areas of the country were falling to its control .
Force in Afghanistan was insufficient , and any troops withdrawn from Iraq would have to be deployed to Afghanistan to stabilize the situation .
Political conditions in neighboring Pakistan were deteriorating , and that deterioration inevitably affected Afghanistan .
The United States had been locked in a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program , demanding that Tehran halt enrichment of uranium or face U.S. action .
The United States had assembled a group of six countries ( the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany ) that agreed with the U.S. goal , was engaged in negotiations with Iran , and had agreed at some point to impose sanctions on Iran if Tehran failed to comply .
The United States was also leaking stories about impending air attacks on Iran by Israel or the United States if Tehran did n't abandon its enrichment program .
The United States had the implicit agreement of the group of six not to sell arms to Tehran , creating a real sense of isolation in Iran .
First , Russia recognizes the primacy of the fundamental principles of international law , which define the relations between civilized peoples .
We will build our relations with other countries within the framework of these principles and this concept of international law .
Second , the world should be multipolar .
A single - pole world is unacceptable .
Domination is something we cannot allow .
We cannot accept a world order in which one country makes all the decisions , even as serious and influential a country as the United States of America .
Such a world is unstable and threatened by conflict .
Third , Russia does not want confrontation with any other country .
Russia has no intention of isolating itself .
We will develop friendly relations with Europe , the United States , and other countries , as much as is possible .
Fourth , protecting the lives and dignity of our citizens , wherever they may be , is an unquestionable priority for our country .
Our foreign policy decisions will be based on this need .
We will also protect the interests of our business community abroad .
It should be clear to all that we will respond to any aggressive acts committed against us .
Finally , fifth , as is the case of other countries , there are regions in which Russia has privileged interests .
These regions are home to countries with which we share special historical relations and are bound together as friends and good neighbors .
We will pay particular attention to our work in these regions and build friendly ties with these countries , our close neighbors .
Attempt to make a settlement with Iran that would guarantee the neutral stability of Iraq and permit the rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces there .
Iran is the key here .
The Iranians might also mistrust a re-emergent Russia , and while Tehran might be tempted to work with the Russians against the Americans , Iran might consider an arrangement with the United States — particularly if the United States refocuses its attentions elsewhere .
On the upside , this would free the U.S. from Iraq .
On the downside , the Iranians might not want — or honor — such a deal .
Enter into negotiations with the Russians , granting them the sphere of influence they want in the former Soviet Union in return for guarantees not to project Russian power into Europe proper .
The Russians will be busy consolidating their position for years , giving the U.S. time to re-energize NATO .
On the upside , this would free the United States to continue its war in the Islamic world .
On the downside , it would create a framework for the re-emergence of a powerful Russian empire that would be as difficult to contain as the Soviet Union .
Refuse to engage the Russians and leave the problem to the Europeans .
On the upside , this would allow the United States to continue war in the Islamic world and force the Europeans to act .
On the downside , the Europeans are too divided , dependent on Russia and dispirited to resist the Russians .
This strategy could speed up Russia 's re-emergence .
Rapidly disengage from Iraq , leaving a residual force there and in Afghanistan .
The upside is that this creates a reserve force to reinforce the Baltics and Ukraine that might restrain Russia in the former Soviet Union .
The downside is that it would create chaos in the Islamic world , threatening regimes that have sided with the United States and potentially reviving effective intercontinental terrorism .
The trade - off is between a hegemonic threat from Eurasia and instability and a terror threat from the Islamic world .
The United States has been fighting a war in the Islamic world since 2001 .
Its main theaters of operation are in Afghanistan and Iraq , but its politico - military focus spreads throughout the Islamic world , from Mindanao to Morocco .
The situation on Aug. 7 , 2008 , was as follows :
In short , the United States remained heavily committed to a region stretching from Iraq to Pakistan , with main force committed to Iraq and Afghanistan , and the possibility of commitments to Pakistan ( and above all to Iran ) on the table .
U.S. ground forces were stretched to the limit , and U.S. airpower , naval and land - based forces had to stand by for the possibility of an air campaign in Iran — regardless of whether the U.S. planned an attack , since the credibility of a bluff depended on the availability of force .
The situation in this region actually was improving , but the United States had to remain committed there .
It was therefore no accident that the Russians invaded Georgia on Aug. 8 following a Georgian attack on South Ossetia .
Forgetting the details of who did what to whom , the United States had created a massive window of opportunity for the Russians :
For the foreseeable future , the United States had no significant forces to spare to deploy elsewhere in the world , nor the ability to sustain them in extended combat .
Moreover , the United States was relying on Russian cooperation both against Iran and potentially in Afghanistan , where Moscow 's influence with some factions remains substantial .
The United States needed the Russians and could n't block the Russians .
Therefore , the Russians inevitably chose this moment to strike .
On Sunday , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev in effectran up the Jolly Roger .
Whatever the United States thought it was dealing with in Russia , Medvedev made the Russian position very clear .
He stated Russian foreign policy in five succinct points , which we can think of as the Medvedev Doctrine ( and which we see fit to quote here ) : Medvedev concluded , " These are the principles I will follow in carrying out our foreign policy .
As for the future , it depends not only on us but also on our friends and partners in the international community .
They have a choice . "
The second point in this doctrine states that Russia does not accept the primacy of the United States in the international system .
According to the third point , while Russia wants good relations with the United States and Europe , this depends on their behavior toward Russia and not just on Russia 's behavior .
The fourth point states that Russia will protect the interests of Russians wherever they are — even if they live in the Baltic states or in Georgia , for example .
This provides a doctrinal basis for intervention in such countries if Russia finds it necessary .
The fifth point is the critical one : " As is the case of other countries , there are regions in which Russia has privileged interests . "
In other words , the Russians have special interests in the former Soviet Union and in friendly relations with these states .
Intrusions by others into these regions that undermine pro-Russian regimes will be regarded as a threat to Russia 's " special interests . "
Thus , the Georgian conflict was not an isolated event — rather , Medvedev is saying that Russia is engaged in a general redefinition of the regional and global system .
Locally , it would not be correct to say that Russia is trying to resurrect the Soviet Union or the Russian empire .
It would be correct to say that Russia is creating a new structure of relations in the geography of its predecessors , with a new institutional structure with Moscow at its center .
Globally , the Russians want to use this new regional power — and substantial Russian nuclear assets — to be part of a global system in which the United States loses its primacy .
These are ambitious goals , to say the least .
But the Russians believe that the United States is off balance in the Islamic world and that there is an opportunity here , if they move quickly , to create a new reality before the United States is ready to respond .
Europe has neither the military weight nor the will to actively resist Russia .
Moreover , the Europeans are heavily dependent on Russian natural gas supplies over the coming years , and Russia can survive without selling it to them far better than the Europeans can survive without buying it .
The Europeans are not a substantial factor in the equation , nor are they likely to become substantial .
This leaves the United States in an extremely difficult strategic position .
The United States opposed the Soviet Union after 1945 not only for ideological reasons but also for geopolitical ones .
If the Soviet Union had broken out of its encirclement and dominated all of Europe , the total economic power at its disposal , coupled with its population , would have allowed the Soviets to construct a navy that could challenge U.S. maritime hegemony and put the continental United States in jeopardy .
It was U.S. policy during World Wars I and II and the Cold War to act militarily to prevent any power from dominating the Eurasian landmass .
For the United States , this was the most important task throughout the 20th century .
The U.S. - jihadist war was waged in a strategic framework that assumed that the question of hegemony over Eurasia was closed .
Germany 's defeat in World War II and the Soviet Union 's defeat in the Cold War meant that there was no claimant to Eurasia , and the United States was free to focus on what appeared to be the current priority — the defeat of radical Islamism .
It appeared that the main threat to this strategy was the patience of the American public , not an attempt to resurrect a major Eurasian power .
The United States now faces a massive strategic dilemma , and it has limited military options against the Russians .
It could choose anaval option , in which it would block the four Russian maritime outlets , the Sea of Japan and the Black , Baltic and Barents seas .
The United States has ample military force with which to do this and could potentially do so without allied cooperation , which it would lack .
It is extremely unlikely that the NATO council would unanimously support a blockade of Russia , which would be an act of war .
But while a blockade like this would certainly hurt the Russians , Russia is ultimately a land power .
It is also capable of shipping and importing through third parties , meaning it could potentially acquire and ship key goods through European or Turkish ports ( or Iranian ports , for that matter ) .
The blockade option is thus more attractive on first glance than on deeper analysis .
More important , any overt U.S. action against Russia would result in counteractions .
During the Cold War , the Soviets attacked American global interest not by sending Soviet troops , but by supporting regimes and factions with weapons and economic aid .
Vietnam was the classic example : The Russians tied down 500,000 U.S. troops without placing major Russian forces at risk .
Throughout the world , the Soviets implemented programs of subversion and aid to friendly regimes , forcing the United States either to accept pro-Soviet regimes , as with Cuba , or fight them at disproportionate cost .
In the present situation , the Russian response would strike at the heart of American strategy in the Islamic world .
In the long run , the Russians have little interest in strengthening the Islamic world — but for the moment , they have substantial interest in maintaining American imbalance and sapping U.S. forces .
The Russians have a long history of supporting Middle Eastern regimes with weapons shipments , and it is no accident that the first world leader they met with after invading Georgia wasSyrian President Bashar al Assad .
This was a clear signal that if the U.S. responded aggressively to Russia 's actions in Georgia , Moscow would ship a range of weapons to Syria — and far worse , to Iran .
Indeed , Russia could conceivably send weapons to factions in Iraq that do not support the current regime , as well as to groups like Hezbollah .
Moscow also could encourage the Iranians to withdraw their support for the Iraqi government and plunge Iraq back into conflict .
Finally , Russia could ship weapons to the Taliban and work to further destabilize Pakistan .
At the moment , the United States faces the strategic problem that the Russians have options while the United States does not .
Not only does the U.S. commitment of ground forces in the Islamic world leave the United States without strategic reserve , but the political arrangements under which these troops operate make them highly vulnerable to Russian manipulation — with few satisfactory U.S. counters .
The U.S. government is trying to think through how it can maintain its commitment in the Islamic world and resist the Russian reassertion of hegemony in the former Soviet Union .
If the United States could very rapidly win its wars in the region , this would be possible .
But the Russians are in a position to prolong these wars , and even without such agitation , the American ability to close off the conflicts is severely limited .
The United States could massively increase the size of its army and make deployments into the Baltics , Ukraine and Central Asia to thwart Russian plans , but it would take years to build up these forces and the active cooperation of Europe to deploy them .
Logistically , European support would be essential — but the Europeans in general , and the Germans in particular , have no appetite for this war .
Expanding the U.S. Army is necessary , but it does not affect the current strategic reality .
This logistical issue might be manageable , but the real heart of this problem is not merely the deployment of U.S. forces in the Islamic world — it is the Russians ' ability to use weapons sales and covert means to deteriorate conditions dramatically .
With active Russian hostility added to the current reality , the strategic situation in the Islamic world could rapidly spin out of control .
The United States is therefore trapped by its commitment to the Islamic world .
It does not have sufficient forces to block Russian hegemony in the former Soviet Union , and if it tries to block the Russians with naval or air forces , it faces a dangerous riposte from the Russians in the Islamic world .
If it does nothing , it creates a strategic threat that potentially towers over the threat in the Islamic world .
The United States now has to make a fundamental strategic decision .
If it remains committed to its current strategy , it cannot respond to the Russians .
If it does not respond to the Russians for five or 10 years , the world will look very much like it did from 1945 to 1992 .
There will be another Cold War at the very least , with a peer power much poorer than the United States but prepared to devote huge amounts of money to national defense .
There are four broad U.S. options :
We are pointing to very stark strategic choices .
Continuing the war in the Islamic world has a much higher cost now than it did when it began , and Russia potentially poses a far greater threat to the United States than the Islamic world does .
What might have been a rational policy in 2001 or 2003 has now turned into a very dangerous enterprise , because a hostile major power now has the option of making the U.S. position in the Middle East enormously more difficult .
If aU.S. settlement with Iran is impossible , and a diplomatic solution with the Russians that would keep them from taking a hegemonic position in the former Soviet Union cannot be reached , then the United States must consider rapidly abandoning its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and redeploying its forces to block Russian expansion .
The threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War was far graver than the threat posed now by the fragmented Islamic world .
In the end , the nations there will cancel each other out , and militant organizations will be something the United States simply has to deal with .
This is not an ideal solution by any means , but the clock appears to have run out on the American war in the Islamic world .
We do not expect the United States to take this option .
It is difficult to abandon a conflict that has gone on this long when it is not yet crystal clear that the Russians will actually be a threat later .
( It is far easier for an analyst to make such suggestions than it is for a president to act on them . )
Instead , the United States will attempt to bridge the Russian situation with gestures and half measures .
Nevertheless , American national strategy is in crisis .
The United States has insufficient power to cope with two threats and must choose between the two .
Continuing the current strategy means choosing to deal with the Islamic threat rather than the Russian one , and that is reasonable only if the Islamic threat represents a greater danger to American interests than the Russian threat does .
It is difficult to see how the chaos of the Islamic world will cohere to form a global threat .
But it is not difficult to imagine a Russia guided by the Medvedev Doctrine rapidly becoming a global threat and a direct danger to American interests .
We expect no immediate change in American strategic deployments — and we expect this to be regretted later .
However , given U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney 's trip to the Caucasus region , now would be the time to see some movement in U.S. foreign policy .
If Cheney is n't going to be talking to the Russians , he needs to be talking to the Iranians .
Otherwise , he will be writing checks in the region that the U.S. is in no position to cash .
Some early voters in Florida and North Carolina faced a long wait Researchers are warning of potential problems during the US election with record numbers set to vote and many states using new voting machines .
Long queues are likely at polling stations on 4 November , Pew researchers say , and both parties are hiring lawyers in anticipation of challenges .
Voters have already had long waits in some states where early voting is under way , like North Carolina and Florida .
It comes despite efforts to improve the system after problems in 2000 and 2004 .
The 2008 election " has the potential to combine a record turnout with an insufficient number of poll workers and a voting system still in flux , " the report by the non-partisan Pew group says .
The biggest hurdle facing election workers may be the new voters registering in record numbers in almost every state , the report says .
Millions of new voters have registered across the US in the run-up to the vote For example , officials in Virginia recently ordered 200,000 extra voter registration forms .
And although many states are encouraging people to cast their ballot early or send it in by post , there is still a danger of big queues on election day and insufficient numbers of poll workers to handle the influx , the report warns .
Election officials in Virginia have said they will step up polling station security amid concerns that arguments over long queues , voter registration and identity issues could become heated .
Analysts suggest that early voting in a number of key states is favouring Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
In North Carolina , some 214,000 people cast their ballot on the first two days of early voting , with registered Democrats making up 62 % of the number compared with 22 % registered Republicans .
Meanwhile , a new opinion poll by the Pew Research Center suggests Mr Obama has increased his national lead over rival John McCain in the past month to 14 points , with 52 % to his 38 % .
The latest NBC / Wall Street Journal poll gives Mr Obama the same lead over Mr McCain , up from a six - point margin in the same poll two weeks ago .
Testing times Mr Obama and his running mate , Senator Joe Biden , are to meet his campaign 's national security advisers in Virginia on Wednesday .
After the discussion , Mr Obama is expected to give a public briefing on how his foreign policy plans compare to those of his rival .
McCain continues to talk about Obama ' spreading the wealth ' , which I understand as a political tactic might be effective
Campaign Trail : Matthew Price
It comes a day after Mr McCain questioned his rival 's readiness for the White House , as he campaigned in Pennsylvania .
" We do n't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis and Americans are already fighting in two wars , " Mr McCain said .
Mr McCain was expected to return on Wednesday to New Hampshire , a state he won in the Republican primaries but which opinion polls suggest is leaning towards his rival .
Mr Obama will also hold rallies in Richmond and Leesburg , Virginia , on Wednesday in which he will focus on the economy .
He will campaign in Indiana - another traditionally Republican - leaning state where he is doing well in the polls - on Thursday , before taking a two - day break to visit his sick grandmother in Hawaii .
Clashes on tax On Tuesday , the second day of a swing through Florida , Mr Obama accused Mr McCain of making " stuff " up in the last weeks of the campaign .

Earlier , Mr Obama met the governors of Ohio , Michigan , New Mexico and Colorado in Lake Worth , Florida , to discuss jobs and the economy with business leaders and financial experts .
On the campaign trail in Pennsylvania , where Mr Obama has the lead in opinion polls , Mr McCain said his rival 's economic plan would result in raised taxes .
Meanwhile , his running mate Sarah Palin apologised for any misunderstanding over comments last week on the patriotic values of " the real America " and " pro-America areas of this great nation " .
Mrs Palin denied that was her intention to imply that some parts of the country were more patriotic than others .
" I do n't want that misunderstood .
If that 's the way it came across , I apologise , " she told CNN .

In the early decades of the twentieth century the discipline of psychology was still in its infancy , but beginning to make significant headway .
Pioneering researchers were enthusiastically unraveling the human mind , and some were willing to go to alarming lengths to satisfy their curiosity .
One such trailblazer was a behaviorist named John B. Watson .
In 1919 , his curiosity was aroused after observing a child who showed an irrational fear of dogs .
Watson supposed that a shiny new human would not possess an inborn fear of domesticated animals , but if “ one animal succeeds in arousing fear , any moving furry animal thereafter may arouse it . ”
In order to satiate his scientific appetite , he undertook a series of experiments at Johns Hopkins University to determine whether an infant could indeed be conditioned to fear cute - and - cuddly animals by associating them with scary stimuli .
A couple decades earlier Pavlov ’s notorious dogs had been conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell ; Watson hoped to expand upon the concept .
In 1920 Watson secured access to a “ healthy , stolid , and unemotional ” nine - month - old infant named Albert B. , the son of a wet nurse who worked in the hospital .
He was assisted by Rosalie Rayner , a graduate student at the university .
The researchers ’ first order of business was to establish a psychological baseline .
They tried exposing the infant to a white rat , a rabbit , a dog , and a monkey , and Albert reached for each animal with cheerful curiosity .
The researchers brought him items such as masks and clumps of cotton , and he manipulated the objects with interest .
They placed a long steel rod behind Albert ’s head and struck the metal sharply with a claw hammer , and he flinched with evident distress .
The infant ’s baseline reactions to these stimuli were duly noted , and two months later the peculiar series of “ joint stimulation ” experiments was underway .
Excerpts from Dr. Watson ’s notes outline its progression :
Age : 11 months , 3 days
White rat suddenly taken from the basket and presented to Albert .
Just as his hand touched the animal the bar was struck immediately behind his head .
The infant jumped violently and fell forward , burying his face in the mattress .
Just as the right hand touched the rat the bar was again struck .
Again the infant jumped violently , fell forward and began to whimper .
Age : 11 months , 10 days Rat presented suddenly without sound .
When the rat nosed the infant ’s left hand , the hand was immediately withdrawn .
It is thus seen that the two joint stimulations given the previous week were not without effect .
Joint stimulation .
Fell over immediately to right side and began to whimper .
Rat alone .
The instant the rat was shown the baby began to cry .
Almost instantly he turned sharply to the left , fell over on left side , raised himself on all fours and began to crawl away so rapidly that he was caught with difficulty before reaching the edge of the table .
Age : 11 months , 15 days Rat alone .
Whimpered immediately , withdrew right hand and turned head and trunk away .
Rabbit alone .
Negative responses began at once .
He leaned as far away from the animal as possible , whimpered , then burst into tears .
When the rabbit was placed in contact with him he buried his face in the mattress , then got up on all fours and crawled away .
Fur coat ( seal ) .
Withdrew immediately to the left side and began to fret .
Coat put close to him on the left side , he turned immediately , began to cry and tried to crawl away on all fours .
[ A lab assistant ] brought the Santa Claus mask and presented it to Albert .
He was again pronouncedly negative .
Age : 11 months , 20 days Rat alone .
Withdrawal of the whole body , bending over to left side , no crying .
Fixation and following with eyes .
It was thought best to freshen up the reaction by another joint stimulation .
Just as the rat was placed on his hand the rod was struck .
Reaction violent .
Rabbit alone .
Leaned over to left side as far as possible .
Began to whimper .
When the rabbit was left on Albert ’s knees for a long time he began tentatively to reach out and manipulate its fur with forefingers .
While doing this the steel rod was struck .
A violent fear reaction resulted .
Rabbit alone .
Started immediately to whimper , holding hands far up , but did not cry .
Watson next sought to determine whether these acquired fears had any substantial staying power .
The researchers granted the infant a one month reprieve , after which they once again confronted Albert with his fuzzy phobias :
Age : 12 months , 21 days Santa Claus mask .
Withdrawal , gurgling , then slapped at it without touching .
When his hand was forced to touch it , he whimpered and cried .
He finally cried at the mere visual stimulus of the mask .
Fur coat .
Wrinkled his nose and withdrew both hands , drew back his whole body and began to whimper as the coat was put nearer .
In moving his body to one side his hand accidentally touched the coat .
He began to cry at once , nodding his head in a very peculiar manner .
The rat .
He allowed the rat to crawl towards him without withdrawing .
The rat was then allowed to crawl against his chest .
He first began to fret and then covered his eyes with both hands .
The rabbit .
After a few seconds he puckered up his face , began to nod his head and to look intently at the experimenter .
He reached out tentatively with his left hand and touched the animal , shuddered and withdrew the whole body .
The experimenter then took hold of his left hand and laid it on the rabbit ’s back .
Albert immediately withdrew his hand and began to suck his thumb .
Again the rabbit was laid in his lap .
He began to cry , covering his face with both hands .
John B. Watson
Without a doubt , the thirty day hiatus was insufficient to expunge the artificially - induced fear .
One last scientific question remained : could these conditioned emotional responses be removed through laboratory methods ?
Watson had originally intended to end his experiment by “ re-conditioning ” the infant to neutralize the fear response , but he ultimately opted to drop that portion of the experiment due to a lack of time .
When he published the results of his study , however , he suggested that the best re-conditioning method would have been to replace the traumatizing metallic CLANG !
with a positive stimulus such as A ) physical stimulation of “ first the lips , then the nipples and as a final resort the sex organs ” ; B ) candy or food ; or C ) constructive activities .
The psychological community received Watson ’s results with rapt fascination .
Several months later , in spite of his new - found popularity , the officials at Johns Hopkins asked Watson to resign from the university .
But the request had nothing to do with the questionable ethics of his baby - scaring experiments ; he was dismissed due to unauthorized “ experimentation ” with a lovely young graduate student .
Watson ’s wife discovered evidence that he and his assistant Rosalie Rayner had participated in unabashed physical stimulation of one another ’s sex organs , and consequently Watson lost his career and his marriage amidst a flurry of publicity .
By modern standards , Watson ’s infant - phobia experiment was grossly unethical for numerous obvious reasons .
The research was undertaken during the rough - and - tumble adolescence of psychology , a time when the subjects ’ well - being was seldom considered equal to the scientific rewards .
Moreover , the experiment itself was rife with procedural flaws which rendered the results ambiguous at best .
For instance , the researchers only tested with one subject and one negative stimuli , and the tests tended to be improvised and slapdash .
Although Watson himself conceded that the experiment was imperfect , he considered the results to be valuable to science .
“ These experiments would seem to show conclusively that directly conditioned emotional responses as well as those conditioned by transfer persist , although with a certain loss in the intensity of the reaction , for a longer period than one month , ” he wrote in his infamous paper .
“ Our view is that they persist and modify personality throughout life . ”
Today , the “ Little Albert ” experiment is the stuff of psychological legend .
It has been thoroughly cited , scrutinized , expanded , and embellished since its publication in 1920 .
But as is true with many fundamentally flawed studies , the scientific community ultimately categorized the experiment as intriguing - yet - uninterpretable .
Though Watson spent the rest of his career begging to differ , no firm conclusions can be drawn from his hard - earned data⁠ — except perhaps that one should avoid employing experimental psychologists as babysitters .
As for Albert , he and his mother slipped into obscurity immediately following the study , and were never publicly identified .
No one knows what ultimately became of the tormented infant , nor whether his repulsion of cute - and - cuddly creatures haunted him into adulthood .
Update : In 2009 , psychologist Hall P. Beck and two colleagues claimed to have the discovered the true identity of Little Albert .
If they are correct , this story turns the corner from Sad Street onto Seriously Depressing Avenue .

Kim Nash in an interview with Jonathan Heiliger , Facebook VP of technical operations , provides some juicy details on how Facebook handles operations .
Operations is one of those departments everyone runs differently as it is usually an ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny situation .
With 2,000 databases , 25 terabytes of cache , 90 million active users , and 10,000 servers you know Facebook has some serious operational issues .
What are some of Facebook 's secrets to better operations ?
Frequent Releases .
A major release once a week and a minor releases every few days .
Create a Cyber Liability Group .
At one time operations was distributed amongst several groups .
A permanent operations group was created to isolate problems and revert problem software components back to previously known good states .
The ability of a separate team to handle rollbacks speaks to a great deal of standardization and advanced tool building .
Distribute Team Across Time Zones .
Split the operations team across different time zones so no one has to work the graveyard shift .
Facebook has 20 people in their team located in Palo Alto , California and London , England .
Be Innovative , Not Safe .
Fear of failure often shuts down the organizational brain and makes it hide behind excessive rules and regulations .
A technology company should have a bias towards action and innovation .
Release software .
Do n't stifle genius .
Rely on your tools and processes to recover from problems .
Expect Problems .
Software pushed to production will have problems .
Expect problems , but do n't let that stop you from innovating .
Roll Backward .
When a problem is detected in a release the changes can either be rolled forward or backward .
Rolling back is going to a previously good release .
Rolling forward is fixing problems in the new release rather than rolling back .
Bugs in production are fixed in production .
Roll forward ends up being covered in the press , so prefer roll backs over roll forwards .
Roll Out Massive Changes Slowly .
Turn on features gradually , for a few percent of users at a time .
Use the slow rollout to fix problems that can only be found under real user conditions .
This approach give operations and development a lot of confidence in changes .
Encourage Openness and Information Sharing .
Design reviews , PR strategy , which servers to buy , etc are often open for informal debate among employees .
Facebook has created an Ideas system where employees can create an Idea by category .
There 's a discussion tool for discussing the idea and a rating system for rating the idea .
Tools are built on - top of Facebook platform so they are available to everyone .
Was it Jack Cafferty ’s blistering attack on Sarah Palin that was an instant hit on youtube ?
or was it this comment :
They have stood by and watched their 401 ( k ) s hemorrhage for months .
They were also told all weekend by their elected leaders that a rescue plan was on the way .
Their elected leaders lied .
Again .
In the end , politics trumped everything else .
Nancy Pelosi gave a speech and that angered some house republicans , and bingo , the whole project went right down the toilet .
Now it ’s the Jewish holidays and nothing will happen for a couple more days .
And once again , the middle class will take it in the shorts because some Washington moron wanted to make a point .
They make me tired .
Fact is : Since October 2nd , when you go to Jack Cafferty ’s blog you get this message :
Jack will not be in the Situation Room Today .
When our reader “ houseofroberts ” asked the question a couple of days ago , I still thought Cafferty ’s absence was not out of the ordinary .
Personal issues , programming issues , whatever .
Now , I ’m not so sure .
You can ask CNN what happened to an integer and integral part of the “ best political team on TV ” yourself here .

Parents seething over “ requirement ” that children get a flu shot in order to attend preschools and day - care centers
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , Oct 17 , 2008
Hundreds of concerned parents participated in demonstrations outside the New Jersey Statehouse yesterday in protest of the State ’s decision to mandate flu vaccinations for young children .
Protesters also turned out to support a bill that would allow for conscientious objections to forced vaccinations , arguing that medication should be the choice of the parent not the government .
New Jersey ’s health department has indicated that it is strongly opposed to such legislation , stating “ Broad exemptions to mandatory vaccination weaken the entire compliance and enforcement structure ” .
New Jersey ’s policy was approved last December by the state ’s Public Health Council and is taking effect this fall , reports the Daily Texan .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Children from 6 months to 5 years old who attend a child - care center or preschool have until Dec. 31 to receive the flu vaccine , along with a pneumococcal vaccine .
Watch a CBS short on the protests :
Ralph Fucetola JD , trustee of the Natural Solutions Foundation , a non governmental educational body , insisted that there is a universal right to vaccine exemptions .
“ It is so important to remember that this harm that is caused by vaccines is a foreseeable harm .
The insurance industry foresees the harm , and will not insure the pharmaceutical industry against this harm .
Yet we as parents as being forced to give these dangerous substances to children in exchange for alleged free public education .
This is simply wrong . ”
Fucetola said .
Watch Fucetola ’s speech :
Ralph Fucetola also referred to a case we reported on in Prince George ’s County , Maryland , last November , where parents of more than 1600 children were told they could be put in jail for failing to get their kids vaccinated .
At the time a local Fox News affiliate reported , “ A new law was passed last year requiring children from 5th through to 10th grade to have the vaccine , ” which was a total lie .
The non-complying parents were not charged not under vaccination laws ( because there are n’t any ) but under truancy , neglect or child in need of supervision laws , which state that the parent is culpable after 30 days of a child ’s unexplained absence from school .
The school itself triggered the truancy violation by unfairly kicking the kids out of school , and failing to inform parents about vaccine waiver forms .
A state prosecutor involved in the case then admitted that there is no law that mandates any vaccine .
This trick will continue to hoodwink Americans into taking all manner of dangerous and untested vaccines , the number of which rises every year , until they realize that there is no law that forces them to take any vaccine .
( Article continues below )
More recently , large Pharmaceutical companies , unable to sell the “ benefits ” of vaccinations to make enough profit out of them , have increasingly turned to state legislatures and attempted to pay off Governors and other officials to curry favor and force young children to take vaccines such as the flu shot and the Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine .
However , pharmaceutical giants have faced a fierce backlash from concerned parents and religious organizations .
We previously exposed Merck ’s role in one such crony deal with Texas Governor Rick Perry which saw a resulting media campaign fool parents into thinking that the HPV vaccine had been made compulsory by law for all young girls .
Without consulting and doctors , scientists or medical experts , Perry , who has various close ties to Merck , issued an executive order requiring girls to be vaccinated against HPV .
Several Texas lawmakers subsequently petitioned for a reversal of the decision without success .
Almost immediately following Perry ’s announcement , newspapers and TV stations began to report that it was “ the law ” that parents had to have their child vaccinated .
This reflects a national and international hoax that is repeatedly being perpetrated shortly before school terms begin each year .
There is no law in America , aside from those applying to medical workers , that says any citizen or their children have to take any vaccine whatsoever , no matter what any executive order , requirement , mandate or policy dictates .
As in the case of all other vaccines , Perry ’s executive order merely stated that the vaccine is “ recommended , ” yet the mass media drumbeat constantly conditions people to believe that if they do n’t take their shots they will be kicked out of school , arrested and thrown in jail .
Until this is drilled home with parents we will also keep seeing relatively unchallenged moves to pass legislation to make mandatory all vaccines recommended by the CDC for all children , including infants and toddlers .

Comment on this article
Turns out Hef 's 19 - year - old handpicked twin successors to the throne of Holly , Bridget and Kendra come with a checkered past .
Karissa ( left ) and Kristina Shannon ( right ) -- who have recently moved into the Playboy Mansion -- were both busted by St. Petersburg , Fla. police for felony aggravated battery back in January .
They both received probation and were ordered to pay restitution to the two victims .
UPDATE 6:40 PM
PT : We just talked to a relative of one of the victims and here 's what they tell us went down .
The twins went out after work with one of their Wing House co-workers , Erica Civello , to a house party .
Kristina allegedly started arguing with Erica , and Karissa came up behind her and hit Erica over the head with a bottle of beer and they both " jumped her . "
Erica suffered a concussion .
I ’ve been practicing Zen meditation pretty consistently for about 3 months now .
Usually , I spend the last 15 minutes of my day sitting in silence and listening to my breath .
I think I ’ve reached a point where I can say I ’ve made some “ progress , ” although that ’s probably not the right word .
Let ’s just say I ’ve gained access to some insights that I did n’t have before I began to cultivate the habit .
One of the most important things I ’m starting to realize is that my thoughts are not “ me . ”
For a very long time , I figured that if anything could be trusted , it was my own thoughts .
Anything my mind brought to my attention seemed realer than real , and I unconsciously gave each thought full authority , raising each one on a throne above me .
My thoughts governed my reality without any consideration or questioning on my part .
This is pretty funny when I think about it since I ’ve always been very aware of the importance to question external authorities , especially of the religious and political flavor , but I never thought to apply this principle to my own thoughts .
Meditation is now shining some light where there was none before .
Months of following my thoughts have showed that I am definitely not in control of my mind , and that thoughts are more like arbitrary passing weather patterns than concrete entities I generate of my own volition .
Just like hurricanes consistently form in certain places because of ripe conditions around them , thoughts swirl up out of the ether and pass through the creative void of consciousness .
Not attaching yourself to them or investing them with a sense of self is an extremely gratifying practice .
Now , my thoughts seem to be padded in a nice bubble of detached awareness .
I realize that they are not any more “ me , ” than a passing storm .
Keeping a bit of breathing room between me and my mental gymnastics is improving my ability to enjoy life , as well as get things done without succumbing to the frustrations anything unforeseen that pops up along the way .
Do you let your thoughts govern your life without questioning their accuracy or validity ?
Do you become attached to them to a point where they interfere with your ability to simply relax and “ be ? ” I recommend trying a bit of meditation if this is something you ’d like to change .
How much authority do you give your own thoughts ?
The ethics of secession
Is secession wrong , and if not , who may legitimately secede ?
This is a brief review of the specific ethics of secession , especially in relation to democracy and nationalism .
the paradox of secession
Do you live in a western society , and do you want to be treated as a crank ?
Then suggest establishing a new state with a new political system .
And preferably , suggest it should be on an artificial island , and write the constitution yourself .
On the other hand , if you suggest establishing a new nation state , for an existing but oppressed ethnic group , you will not be treated as a crank .
You might be called a traitor , or even executed for treason .
But if you survive that phase , you might end your life as president of the new state - with airports , streets , and mountains named after you .
And they might even let you write the Constitution .
This is the paradox of secession which deserves attention from political theory .
Looking at history , national secessionist movements are relatively successful .
Numerically , most of them failed - but the ones that succeeded now run most of this planet .
Considering the magnitude of their demands , the vehemence of opposition , and the bloodshed they usually engender , they seem a successful type of political movement .
Yet in the same historical perspective , non-national ( non-ethnic ) secessionist movements are a total flop .
Now , if anyone can secede at any time , that means the end of the state , the government , on the usual definitions .
And not just of tyrannies and gulags , but also of ' nice ' democratic governments .
The explanation might be simply the fear of bloodshed and chaos - anarchy in the most negative sense .
This does not explain why national secession has been relatively successful : it is possible to take an ethical position that " all secession is wrong " , but evidently very few people do .
Distinctions are made , and conditions are set , but some secessions are accepted .
So the ' ethics of secession ' here means both the claims made about secession , and the question of whether these claims are right ( or even consistent ) .
Both are relevant for consideration of the ethical issues .
democracy contra secession Democracy relies on a prohibition of secession .
A democratic regime assumes a ' demos ' - a unit of political decision - making which is constant between decisions .
If every dissident minority secedes after every opposed decision , then there is no democratic regime .
( There would be no political regime at all - at least not for standard political theory ) .
So democrats have concluded , like President Lincoln in the 1860's , that secession must be suppressed .
Since modern democracies are nation states , secession is now treated as an issue of national unity , and national identity : Lincoln was one of the last politicians who had to address secession as a classic political issue .
It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy -- a Government of the people , by the same people -- can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes .
It presents the question whether discontented individuals , too few in numbers to control administration , according to organic law , in any case , can always , upon the pretenses made in this case , or on any other pretenses , or arbitrarily without any pretense , break up their Government and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth .
It forces us to ask : " Is there , in all republics , this inherent and fatal weakness ? "
" Must a government , of necessity , be too strong for the liberties of its own people , or too weak to maintain its own existence ?
Abraham Lincoln , Special Session Message , 1861 .
So he sent the troops : the speech marked the start of the Civil War .
Today Lincoln would avoid political philosophy , and talk about a shared history , identity and culture .
He would conclude that there can only be one American sovereign state , because there is one ' American people ' .
The supporters of democracy no longer need to advocate force - because nationalists do that for them .
The nationalists advocate force to preserve the territorial integrity of the nation , which coincidentally is also the demos , the political unit .
In this way , the nationalists get the bad publicity , not the democrats .
Nevertheless , those who advocate democracy are also logically advocating , that at some point secession be suppressed .
And almost inevitably , that implies the use of force - military force .
You can not be a democrat unless you are prepared to kill .
An entirely pacifist democracy might work for small homogeneous groups , but not for large states with hundreds of millions of inhabitants .
A large democratic state , with no armed forces , would be overwhelmed by secession .
One democratic theorist who represents this darker side of democracy is Lea Brilmayer .
Her essay on secession and self - determination is a charter for anti-secessionist force ( and therefore inevitably for anti-secessionist atrocities ) .
Despite the rhetoric of liberal democracy , actual consent is not necessary to political legitimacy ... Separatists cannot base their arguments on a right to opt out because no such right exists in democratic theory .
Government by the consent of the governed does not necessarily encompass a right to opt out .
It only requires that within the existing political unit a right to participate through electoral processes be available .
Moreover participatory rights do not entail a right to secede .
Lea Brilmayer ( 1991 ) Secession and self - determination : a territorial interpretation .
Yale Journal of International Law 16 , 177-202 , p.184-185 .
Her ethic of democracy is clear : " we let you participate in the demos , therefore we are entitled to keep you in it " .
Democrats claim a general right to reject secession .
But it is equally possible to reverse the approach , and ask if any political regime ever has a right to prevent secession .
More specifically , if there is a universal right to prevent the formation of a new state ( by secession ) .
Political philosophy generally ignores this issue - which can also be formulated as a question about how many states there should be .
At present there are 180 to 200 ' states ' , depending on exact definitions .
And for liberal - democratic political philosophy , that seems to be enough .
Lea Brilmayer puts it like this :
When a group seeks to secede , it is claiming a right to a particular piece of land , and one must necessarily inquire into why it is entitled to that particular piece of land , as opposed to some other piece of land - or no land at all .
Lea Brilmayer ( 1991 ) Secession and self - determination : a territorial interpretation .
Yale Journal of International Law 16 , 177-202 , p.201 .
This is not an accurate picture of the present geopolitical reality .
A non-ethnic secessionist group might not claim any particular piece of land , but just some land , somewhere .
However , it will belong to some state : there are no more undiscovered , uninhabited islands , at least not of any habitable size .
Since about 1950 , all land area is claimed by some nation state , often by several nation states .
Artificial islands are disproportionately prominent in neo -secessionist proposals , but no large - scale proposals of this type were ever implemented .
Secession is the only real method of new state formation , and a prohibition of secession is equivalent to a veto on new states .
There is no moral justification for such a veto .
As a general principle every state - forming secession is legitimate , unless there are specific reasons to reject it .
These could be ethical objections to the state itself , or to the means of its formation , especially forced population transfers .
libertarian secession proposals Recent proposals for non-ethnic secession usually come from libertarians .
Libertarianism itself is a primarily Anglo - American political ideology : it derives from the English tradition of anti-state ' protective liberalism ' .
Although the idea seems to be going out of fashion , US libertarians especially have proposed new states on artificial islands .
Sometimes they are misleadingly called ' new nations ' , although no new ethnic or cultural group is intended .
These suggestions should not be confused with projects for new structures in sea , as a form of property development .
These projects are essentially a form of land reclamation .
In the Netherlands there are plans for new islands and peninsulas off the coast , instead of traditional enclosure dikes .
Dubai has the largest existing project of this type .
They do not have the intention of creating a new state : they fall under the sovereign territory of an existing state .
They may be designed to fall exactly within a particular sovereignty , as in Monaco and Macao .
Both semi- sovereign territories have run out of land , for new hotels and casinos : that is the only reason for expensive construction in sea .
These property developments are real construction projects , with real investors , and using available technology .
In contrast , the libertarian projects are political proposals .
In the case of ocean islands - necessary to evade the 200 - mile economic zones of existing states - the construction technology does not exist yet .
Although the projects are justified with general libertarian arguments of individual sovereignty and limited government , one factor stands out .
Libertarian ' new state ' proposals are primarily intended for tax avoidance .
There is a thin line between tax avoidance and tax evasion : the proposals evoke the semi-criminal image of existing tax havens .
Some are no more than investor scams : the financial logic is absent .
Why build a floating Liechtenstein , when there is a non-floating version available already ?
And if international fiscal pressure is eroding the traditional sovereign tax havens , why would it stop at an artificial island ?
The libertarian proposals have been unable to present any other economic logic , for new island states .
For most industrial or service activities , they would far more expensive than a land location .
Leaving aside the tax - avoidance aspect , the free market will not lead to the construction of such projects .
( And of course libertarians would be horrified by the suggestion , that the government should raise extra taxes to pay for their construction ) .
So although some legal issues concerning sovereignty of new island states have been discussed , they will not be tested .
In terms of self determination and state formation , results can be drawn from two general lines of thought .
First of all , in extent to general rights and principles , especially expressed in U.N. Resolution 1514 , Paragraph 2 and Resolution 2625 , the rights of communities of people to self determination are quite clear , and as such the formation of a self governing colony of ' peoples ' would be quite legal ....
Conversely , one could argue that there are no objective qualifications of the group of colonists .
There would be no shared history , traditions , religions , ethnicities , or cultures on which to base this new ' nation ' ....
The second line of reason , follows from the Montevideo qualifications , objective but yet abstract general principles of state formation .
As argued the proposed model would theoretically fulfil of these conditions ; territory , population and sovereign control .
Yet , arguably the most contentious condition , recognition by other states , is difficult to predict and would be subject to various political manoeuvring of other states .
Rene Kardol ( 1999 ) Proposed Inhabited Artificial Islands in International Waters : International Law Analysis in Regards to Resource Use , Law of the Sea and Norms of Self - Determination and State Recognition ( MA Thesis , Universiteit van Amsterdam ) .
The proposal in this case is fictitious - an artificial island of 100 000 inhabitants .
No real project of this magnitude will be built in the near future .
The standard method of new state formation will continue to be the secession of existing territory .
anti-secessionism
When secession is considered by political philosophers - and that is not very often - they usually say that no secession is legitimate , except in response to oppression or injustice .
The underlying logic is that new states are somehow a bad thing - something which can only be justified to avoid another great evil .
Most liberal - democratic theorists require an explicit policy of oppression by the majority community , as grounds for secession .
They give the impression that you are only justified in thinking about it , when the secret police is already knocking at the door .
If only impending atrocities could justify secession , then secession would indeed be something horrifying .
But what exactly is so horrifying about it ?
The dominant anti-secessionism is reflected in geopolitics : the underlying pattern is of anti-secessionist co-operation between states , and some anti-secessionist interventionism .
Here too , nationalism is a parallel explanation for this pattern .
Historically , nation states act together with other nation states , to promote the nation state as form of state .
The United Nations , as the name implies , is a reasonably successful product of this co-operation : there is no United Empires or United Tribes .
It is true that nation states sometimes support secessionist movements in other states .
That attracts all the attention , but the reality is that new state formation is rare .
The net long - term average , since the European nationalist uprisings of 1848 , is about one new nation state per year - it could have been far more .
It also seems , at first sight , that anti-secession interventions are rare - for example the UN attempt to preserve a unitary Somali state .
But Africa is the wrong place to look for the examples .
A better example is the NATO , which has an implicit function as a de facto anti-secession league .
That may seem a strange interpretation , after the western role in the break - up of Yugoslavia .
It is true that the NATO in Kosovo ' captured the territory ' from Serbia , and created a protectorate .
But the point is , that the NATO does not treat its own members like that .
The structure of the NATO assumes the permanent existence and permanent legitimacy of its member states , and it has the treaty authorisation to preserve them .
Attempted non-ethnic secession from a NATO member state would qualify as ' aggression ' under the North Atlantic Treaty , and lead to an intervention by other members , to preserve the status quo .
The European Union also has a stabilising role on the system of states in Europe .
It does not have a specific secession prohibition , but the geopolitical reality is that the EU has ' frozen ' the number of nation states in western Europe ( and now eastern Europe ) .
Any new non-ethnic state in Europe is out of the question , in this geopolitical order .
Other macro-regional organisations of states , such as the OAU ( Africa ) or ASEAN ( South - East Asia ) can not match the success of the EU in this respect .
However none of them accept non-ethnic secession .
' incession ' , the opposite of secession Democracy also relies on a prohibition of what could be called ' incession ' - the forced inclusion in the demos of a previously external population .
The word ' accession ' is generally used when the transfer is agreed by both sides , as in the accession of the western states to the United States of America .
Until about 30 years ago , potential ' incession ' was not important in western political theory .
The last unwanted mass migration in western Europe was the Viking raids .
In the older standard view , repressive regimes had walls to keep their citizens in , and democracies had open borders .
Now however , it is the democracies which have walls , to keep new citizens out .
Modern democratic theory was formulated in the 18th and 19th century .
It was not then a serious proposition that millions of people from Africa and Asia could emigrate to Europe , against the opposition of European governments .
Despite the experience in the United States , democratic theory in general assumed low immigration rates , and a culturally stable ' demos ' .
In Europe , the scale of post - war immigration gradually became clear .
Potentially , the new population could politically dominate the old , simply by force of numbers .
The fear of being " swamped " ( as Margaret Thatcher called it ) facilitated the growth of anti-immigration parties in the last decades - and ' defence of democracy ' is one argument they have deployed .
Democratic theorists do n't like to be associated with people like Jean - Marie Le Pen or Jörg Haider , but they are generally hostile to ' incession ' .
Democratic theory seems to treat it as a general principle , that the ' demos ' should be maintained in its present form .
If necessary by force , and that includes immigration controls .
In the light of estimates that Europe will need hundreds of millions of immigrants to maintain its population , the tone is getting harsher .
In the future , anti-incession arguments will probably be more prominent in democratic theory .
nationalism contra secession , usually Although secessionist groups are often nationalist , the ideology of nationalism is generally hostile to secession .
It is a mistake to equate ' nationalist ' with ' secessionist ' .
Emphasis on national unity and the indivisibility of the nation is central to nationalist ideology and rhetoric .
( Nationalist anti-immigration propaganda is also directed primarily at the ' non- belonging ' of the immigrant , at the cultural differences ) .
Democracy theory and nationalist ideology concede a right to secession in a limited number of cases , for a specific recognised unit .
Democrats call that unit a ' demos ' , nationalists speak of a ' people ' or ' nation ' .
Both ideologies are related , and are borrowing from each other - although democrats may not want to admit that .
Democrats speak of a ' legitimate demos ' - entitled to secede , even from a democracy .
But when they try to define it , it sounds exactly like a nation - with unity of culture , language and descent , and historical links to a particular territory .
In practice , overseas colonies of imperial powers stood the best chance of independence .
In every case , the ex-colonies proclaimed themselves to be the national homeland of a specific people , entirely in accordance with nationalist ideology .
It is easy to understand why nationalists give nations priority in state formation .
However , there is no reason why only these units can form the demos of any new democracy .
Democratic theory can not ethically justify its alliance with nationalism on this issue .
Avishai Margalit and Joseph Raz did attempt a justification , listing six characteristics of groups which made them candidates for self - determination ( or not ) .
However , all they did was to restate well - known characteristics of nations , without explaining exactly why these characteristics justify special privilege , in state formation .
What is it that makes peoples particularly suited to self - determination ?.... we may gain insight by comparing them with groups , e.g. the fiction - reading public or Tottenham Football Club supporters , which obviously do not enjoy such a right .
Reflection on such examples suggests six characteristics that in combination are relevant to a case for self - determination .
1 . The group has a common character and a common culture ....
2. ... people growing up among members of the group will acquire the group culture , will be marked by its character .
3. Membership of the group is , in part , a matter of mutual recognition .
4. ... groups membership of which is one of the primary clues for people generally in interpreting the conduct of others .
5. Membership is a matter of belonging , not of achievement .
6 . The groups concerned are not small face - to - face groups , members of which are generally known to all other members .
They are anonymous groups where where mutual recognition is secured by the possession of general characteristics ....
Avishai Margalit and Joseph Raz ( 1990 ) National self - determination .
Journal of Philosophy LXXXVII , 9 , 439-46 , p.443-447 .
Having evaded the justification issue in this way , democrats are left with the simpler question : who fits these criteria ?
In the overall ethical context of secession , this is a question of detail , but it accounts for the bulk of discussion on secessionism - for instance , all the detailed assessments of Quebec secessionism .
Nationalists approach secession with a similar bias : they will only talk about which group is a nation , and the boundaries of its homeland .
If nationalists are agreed that a minority is a separate nation with its own distinct territory , they will concede secession .
Statistically , that is very rare .
There is apparent agreement among democratic philosophers , that some collectivities can not be a ' demos ' .
Most theorists of democracy would indeed agree , that supporters of a football club have no right to secede .
But again , there is no inherent reason for this .
The example was used by Margalit and Raz to trivialise the issue - but the consequences are not so funny .
Margalit and Raz are in effect saying that if such a group tried to secede from a democracy , it may legitimately be opposed by military force .
Defining certain groups as ' non - demos ' gives a democratic government a licence for repression of that group .
At worst , it gives a democratic government a licence to kill them , under conditions of attempted secession .
It is a serious issue , because most liberal - democratic theorists are agreed that a simple political minority is not a demos .
That consensus leads almost inevitably to political repression .
After all , the point of democratic political philosophy is to establish that democratic government is ' legitimate ' - meaning that people are morally obliged to obey the government , even if they disagree with it .
( The claim that the government is entitled to maintain the demos by preventing secession , is a special case of the claim that a government is morally entitled to govern ) .
The democratic anti-secession consensus condemns minorities to a form of political serfdom , permanently complying with the will of the majority .
circumventing democracy by secession
And so to the core issue ... why are pro-democracy political philosophers so hostile to secession ?
Is it because of what secession is , or because of what secession does ?
Apparently the second of these : it is not the secession itself they fear , but its effect .
Secession allows the democratic process to be circumvented or evaded , without a direct attack on the government .
In a secession , the existing government is not overthrown , the nation is not colonised , the people are not murdered or enslaved .
Something is added , a new state .
Only territory is taken away - disregarding nationalist claims that national unity is itself sacred .
The unwillingness to concede secession says something about the nature of democracy itself .
If democracy was about maximising autonomy for individuals or groups , democratic theory would not be so hostile to secession .
If democracy was about maximising possibility and change , democratic theory would welcome new states .
In reality democracy is primarily an innovation - minimising social structure .
Democracy is a noble form of government , in the eyes its supporters , so they ought to be happy to see 10 000 democracies on this planet .
However , they clearly are not .
Read their literature on secession , and you will see how unhappy they are with a multiplication of states .
Here too is a parallel with nationalism .
There are ethno- nationalists who want to see 10 000 autonomous territories on this planet , because that is the approximate number of ' peoples ' by their definition .
But the majority of nationalists have a conception of ' the nation ' which suggests a population of several million .
They would call a group of 500 people a ' tribe ' , even if they had their own separate language ( such small distinct ethnic groups are not unusual ) .
Mainstream nationalists would not concede them any territorial autonomy , comparable to that of nation states - and no nationalist would concede any purely political secession .
Together , nationalism and democracy have produced a specific world order .
It is still emergent , because not all territories are nation states , and not all states are democratic .
But the character of this world order is clear .
It has a relatively limited number of states , there is no possibility to form new states , and the internal political process in each state has a universal legitimacy claim .
To put it crudely : societies come in 200 flavours , and 200 flavours only .
Same 200 last year , same 200 next year .
This is not a favourable climate for innovation in the long term .
Whoever designed this geopolitical order , did not like innovation .
The ' designers ' of the geopolitical order , insofar as they exist , are the political theorists and philosophers of the dominant political culture .
The world as it is today , reflects the dominance of western liberal - democratic ideas .
A Marxist would see things the other way round - that the underlying structures generate the philosophies .
But either way , it is possible to reject the ' design ' .
Innovation is not wrong .
New states are not wrong .
If something is impossible inside a democratic society , but possible elsewhere , then that something is not inherently wrong .
A blanket prohibition on all social forms which are incompatible with democratic nation states , is not morally legitimate .
The national - democratic geopolitical order forms such a prohibition - because it has a limited number of states , and each has a tendency to internal uniformity ( national culture and values ) .
And of course it is very difficult to alter the entire geopolitical order itself .
The ethics of secession should be treated as part of the general assessment of the principles underlying the present world order .
In particular , there is a need to introduce ' innovation ' as an issue to be considered in political ethics - and not just as a personal preference of some individuals .
Ethical systems often assume a static society : ethical principles are supposed to be valid for thousands of years .
In the ethics of secession , I fear the reverse is also true : if you apply the standard principles , then the world will stay the same for thousands of years .
That is plainly wrong .
Desperate to resuscitate his diminishing hopes for the White House , John McCain during tonight 's presidential town hall meeting dramatically reversed course on a mortgage bailout for home owners .
This spring , McCain adamantly stated " it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , whether they are big banks or small borrowers . "
Now with his presidential campaign and the economy in dire straits alike , John McCain decided to open the federal wallet after all .
McCain 's born - again concern for American home owners represents a 180 degree turn from his Scrooge - like posture in March :
" Some Americans bought homes they could n't afford , betting that rising prices would make it easier to refinance later at more affordable rates , " he said .
Later he added that " any assistance must be temporary and must not reward people who were irresponsible at the expense of those who were n't . "
But right out of the gate tonight , McCain conjured up a massive new program to save his ailing campaign , if not Americans on the brink of foreclosure .
Now , he insisted , the government should buy existing mortgages and reprice them at new market rates .
That 's a far cry from his hard line only months ago .
On March 25 , McCain pronounced that when all else fails for distressed homeowners , Americans should just join the rapidly growing ranks of those :
" Doing what is necessary -- working a second job , skipping a vacation , and managing their budgets -- to make their payments on time . "
Now down if not out in the polls , McCain has dropped his past moralizing about not helping either " big banks or small borrowers . "
Of course , all along John McCain was only interested in helping himself .
UPDATE : Sadly for John McCain , he chose tonight of all nights to praise eBay and its former CEO Meg Whitman as his possible choice for Treasury Secretary .
On Monday , eBay announced it was laying off 1,600 employees , 10 % of its entire workforce .
( This piece was crossposted at Perrspectives . )
George
Will made an excellent point this morning on ABC’s THIS WEEK .
Americans are about to get a mailing that is going to do wonders for Obama ’s campaign .
They ’re going to be getting their quarterly statements from their 401ks and their pension plans .
And it ai n’t going to be pretty .
John McCain wants to change the subject away from the economy .
He wants to pull the plug on the number one discussion , the number one issue of importance to every American , because he does n’t know much about economics .
And Sarah Palin ?
Yeah .
Imagine Sarah Palin being in charge of your 401k .

The presidential campaign of Barack Obama has today unveiled a new robocall to counter the calls sponsored by John McCain and the RNC that link the Democrat to terrorists and terrorism .
The calls slams McCain for using hateful and sleazy phone calls and mail .
According to Talking Points
Memo the call uses a former McCain supporter to denounce the GOP tactics , “ Hi , this is Jeri Watermolen , calling for the Campaign for Change .
I live in Green Bay and , like you , I ’ve been getting sleazy phone calls and mail from John McCain and his supporters viciously — and falsely — attacking Barack Obama .
I used to support John McCain because he honorably served our country — but this year he ’s running a dishonorable campaign .
We know McCain will continue many of Bush ’s policies , and now he ’s using George Bush ’s divisive tactics .
In fact , he hired the Bush strategists whose attacks even McCain once called hateful . ”
The call ends by delivering Obama ’s change message , “ Barack Obama will turn the page on these negative politics and stand up for the middle class .
That ’s the change we need , and it ’s why I have changed my mind about John McCain . ”
This is a typical response from the Obama campaign .
For almost two years now , they have been in touch with the mood of the electorate .
Polling shows that the American people have rejected McCain ’s negative campaign , so it is a no brainer for the Obama campaign to do this sort of call .

Jeri from Green Bay is also direct answer to Joe the Plumber .
The campaign is looking to thwart any idea that Obama is anti-small business .
Besides voter backlash , the real down side to McCain ’s negative campaign is that it plays right into Obama ’s theme of changing politics as usual .
It is hard for voters to believe that McCain is a maverick when he running the exact same type of campaign that George W. Bush ran in 2000 and 2004 .
McCain is trailing so he had to go negative , but there is a fine line separating negative campaigning on the issues , and personally attacking an opponent .
Anybody who has watched Obama in action could have told the McCain camp that personally attacking the likable Obama would backfire .
The backlash would not have been as severe against McCain if he would have attacked Obama ’s policies sooner .
Personal attacks work best when they are delivered with a smile , not a snarl , as the McCain camp has .
Obama has answered McCain ’s charges perfectly , which is why he is in control of this election .
A New Zealand adventure company has been charged with four offences relating to the deaths of six students and a teacher during a school trip six months ago .
The group , from Auckland 's Elim Christian College , were on an adventure trip in the North Island , when they were swept away in flash flooding .
The Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits centre says it will defend the charges when the case is heard next month and maintains it did not receive weather reports of flash flooding in the area before the trip .
New Zealand 's Department of Labour says someone has to be held accountable for not keeping the group safe .
Elim Christian College Principal Murray Burton says the grieving families want to ensure this does not happen again .
" They will have mixed emotions once again , " he said .
" This news still does n't bring back a child .
But I guess in some ways they might take a little bit of comfort in the fact there will be , potentially there will be changes made . "
Mr Burton says he is relieved the school was not charged .

The gap between rich and poor in Britain narrowed " remarkably " between 2000 and 2005 but the country remained one of the most unequal in the developed world , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said yesterday .
The UK 's growth in wealth equality has been the fastest among the world 's 30 richest and most developed countries .
But in 2005 , when the organisation compiled its latest data , the UK remained a more unequal society than three - quarters of OECD countries , with the richest 10 % earning nine times more than the poorest 10 % .
Income inequality in the UK grew steadily from the mid-1970s and only dipped briefly in the mid-1990s , the OECD said .
" We found it starts narrowing from the year 2000 , " said Mark Pearson , the head of the OECD 's social policy division .
" It is really quite a remarkable reduction since then - the largest fall in all developed countries , at a time when inequality has been rising in most developed countries . "
But in 2005 , the earnings gap between rich and poor was still 20 % wider than in 1985 .
And in the years since 2005 , which are not covered in the study , the narrowing of the wealth gap appears to have flattened off , Pearson added .
Last month the prime minister admitted that " social mobility has not improved in Britain as we would have wanted " , but added : " Poverty has been reduced and the rise in inequality halted . "
The increase in inequality in developed countries " has not been as spectacular as most people probably think it has been " , Pearson said .
" This difference between what the data shows and what people think no doubt partly reflects the so - called Hello ! magazine effect .
We read about the super - rich , who have been getting much richer and attracting enormous media attention as a result . "
He said a combination of economic growth , which had lifted more people out of unemployment , and redistributive fiscal policies had been responsible for much of the change .
" In the five years since 2000 things have gone in the right direction and the poor have done very well from employment growth , the much - maligned tax credit system and the minimum wage , with the effect of redistributing wealth , " he said .
Between 2000 and 2005 , incomes for the top fifth of earners grew by 1.5 % in real terms each year , while for the bottom fifth they grew by 2.4 % .
But Pearson stressed the long - term trend remained towards greater inequality in the UK when measured by disposable incomes .
" We are talking about a blip downwards and over the last 30 years there has been a very rapid increase in inequality , " he said .
The report also found that in the UK new generations struggle to escape the income levels of their parents more than in almost any other country in the group .
" There is less social mobility in the UK than in Australia , Canada and Denmark .
In this respect it is similar to the United States and Italy , " said the report .
" What your parents earned when you were a child has much more effect on your own earnings than in more mobile countries . "
James Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , welcomed the findings as evidence that the government 's employment policies were working .
" We have seen a decline in the rate of people not working by 4 % - one of the highest rates in the OECD - as people have made the most of the opportunities afforded to them by our flexible labour market , " he said .
" As a consequence we have helped cut the numbers on out - of - work benefits by over a million .
There is a common and understandable criticism that too often parents ' earnings determine their children 's earnings .
But what this shows is that we have one of the lowest levels of people in the poorest fifth , meaning that with most parents in a higher income bracket their kids follow suit . "
Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokeswoman Jenny Willott said : " This government can take no pride in the fact that social mobility has not improved in the last 10 years or that the wage gap has increased between rich and poor .
Pensioner and child poverty have both increased since 2005 , a period this report does not cover .
It is shameful that Labour 's policies to tackle social mobility and poverty have completely stalled since 2005 . "
The latest findings run contrary to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report in January that found that " income inequality is currently at its highest levels since the late 1940s " .
According to the OECD 's findings , inequality remains higher in the UK than in Germany , France , Belgium , the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries .
The gap between rich and poor has grown in more than three - quarters of OECD countries over the past two decades .
Speaking at the report 's presentation , Oxford University economist Anthony Atkinson said growing global inequality posed a new challenge to governments in a time of recession .
" What will happen if the next decade is not one of world growth ? " he said .
" With governments around the globe announcing trillions of dollars in rescue financing to shore up banks , I think that citizens of OECD countries are going to expect that if you can find funds to rescue banks , then governments can fund an effective unemployment insurance scheme , and they can fund employment subsidies " .
Angel Gurria , the OECD secretary general , warned : " Growing inequality is divisive .
It polarises societies , it divides regions within countries , and it carves up the world between rich and poor .
Greater income inequality stifles upward mobility between generations , making it harder for talented and hard - working people to get the rewards they deserve .
" Ignoring increasing inequality is not an option . "
The Soviet Union has created a Moscow Stock Exchange , the first in the country since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution .
The official Tass press agency said today that the exchange was founded on Monday by 187 Soviet enterprises and banks .
It did not say when trading would begin .
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued an order on Oct. 26 permitting Soviet citizens to buy stocks , bonds and other securities as part of his plan to switch from central planning to a market economy .
Tass said the Moscow Stock Exchange would be represented overseas by an international brokerage company that had asked not to be identified .
The exchange plans to open offices in the world 's leading stock exchanges in New York , Frankfurt , Tokyo and Singapore , the press agency said .
Trading in shares was outlawed after the revolution .
A flourishing stock market in St. Petersburg , now Leningrad , was closed along with more than 100 commodity exchanges elsewhere in Russia .

In response to a question by Rachel Maddow on how Barack Obama or John McCain may have responded differently to than Bush , Chris Matthews goes off on the President for irresponsibly squandering the national unity that followed .
He then goes on to bash all the neoconservatives who saw the event not as a way to lead the world in a fight against those who attacked us , but rather as an excuse to go after Iraq and pursue their wildest imperial ambitions .

Okay .
If you ’re trying to eat healthily and eliminate fat and calories from your diet , I would n’t be a friend if I did n’t tell you right now to RUN .
Run FAR AWAY from this recipe .
It ’s almost ridiculous in its blatant disregard for the rules of even remotely healthy eating , I tried to get embarrassed about posting it .
But I could n’t .
And the reason I could n’t is that I would n’t be a friend if I did n’t share its deliciousness with you ; it ’s really that good .
So I ’m conflicted , is what I ’m saying .
Conflicted , confused , and jiggly .
If I could throw out one of those three attributes , I ’d get rid of jiggly .
What about you ?
This is an elegant potato dish that I make on special occasions , adding different combinations of herbs and seasonings to complement the rest of the meal .
I ’m posting it under “ Holiday Food ” today because it ’s perfect on your Thanksgiving table for folks who might prefer an alternative to mashed potatoes , OR for Christmas dinner , where the main course is roast beef … or prime rib…or HAMBURGERS , for all I care .
Just make sure you have these potatoes on the side .
They ’ll make you really jiggly .
I ’ll let you decide whether that ’s a good thing or not .
The Cast of Characters : russet potatoes , onion , cream cheese , heavy cream , milk , butter , salt , pepper , herbs , and parmesan cheese .
And LOOK !
The sun ’s coming through the window , which means these photos will be a real challenge .
I ’ll talk about that soon in PW Photography .
The great thing about this dish is , you can use whatever herbs are seasonal , or whatever herbs the horses have n’t yet eaten from your garden .
I decided on parsley , which is kind of a no - brainer for this type of dish ; rosemary , which is my favorite herb ever ; chives , which pack a flavor punch beyond measure ; and SAGE .
I ’ll use the sage in small quantities since it can really overpower , but I thought it would give a nice Thanksgiving -y flavor to the dish .
And note : I have not intentionally set out to completely turn my back on the green can Parmesan stuff forever .
It ’s just that I ’ve had this huge block of the real stuff in my fridge for months , and I ca n’t not use it .
It would be rude .
Begin by dicing a small white onion really finely .
Here .
I ’ll show you how to do it .
Cut the onion in half from root to tip , then cut each half in half again .
Peel off the outer papery layer , then make very small vertical slices across the onion .
Then rotate the onion 90 degrees and slice downward to create a fine dice .
This is a mandoline .
I ’m going to use it to slice my potatoes , but you do n’t really have to have one .
You do , however , need a pretty good , sharp knife .
We need the potato slices to be really , really thin .
If you do use a mandoline , keep this in mind : it ’s the most dangerous kitchen tool there is .
They ’re as sharp as all get - out , yes … but the downward , back - and - forth motion with which you slice the food lends itself well to one ’s hand slipping and hitting the blade square on .
Usually , I ’ll wrap a dish towel around my hand and grasp the potato through the towel .
That way , if I slip or get too close to the blade , the towel will buy me a little room for error .
But not much .
The blade is razor sharp .
Here ’s what the potatoes should look like .
I ’ve done it with a sharp knife before … no problem .
It just takes a little more time .
Next , in a large skillet , melt 1 stick butter over medium - low heat .
When it ’s melted , throw in the diced onions .
Stir around and allow them to cook over medium - low heat , about 3 minutes .
Reduce heat to low , then slice up the cream cheese and add it to the skillet .
I ’m sorry , okay ?
But I have to be me .
And ME likes cream cheese .
Stir around until cream cheese melts into the butter and onions .
The mixture will be pretty dadgum thick .
And that ’s where the CREAM comes in !
I ’m sorry , but I have to be me .
But look — MILK !
It negates all of my sins .
Milk covers a multitude of sins .
Sister Agatha Mary Margaret said that to me once .
And I ’ve chosen to believe it through the years .
Stir the mixture together , and do n’t taste it or you ’ll be toast .
It is SO good .
Now , add in some salt .
And remember : you ’re salting not just for the sauce , but for all those potatoes you just sliced .
In my experience with this dish , it ’s very easy to UNDERsalt it , which is never good .
So really salt away , and if you think the sauce tastes adequately salty , salt it some more .
You ’ll just have to trust me on this one .
Next , add plenty of finely ground black pepper .
If you want to use the black dust in the red and white can , you ’ll hear no judgment from me .
Really , there ’s not much you could do to warrant judgment from me .
I love you .
I love her .
I love him .
I love everyone .
And whatever any of you does is fine .
Love , Miss Tolerant and Permissive .
Now chop all the herbs pretty finely and add them to the skillet .
Here ’s the rosemary .
There ’s probably a teaspoon here .
And here are the chives .
Oh , how I love fresh chives .
Like , totally .
Here ’s the fresh parsley …
And finally , the sage .
I used about 1/3 the amount as the other stuff .
Stir the mixture together , then do me one small favor : take a whiff .
Take a nice , long whiff .
Then pick yourself up off the floor .
I know it ’s hard , but you ’ll be glad you did .
Turn off the heat , then taste the sauce for seasonings .
Remember : you ’re saltin’ for two here .
Now , generously butter a baking dish .
Throw in the sliced potatoes .
Then carefully pour the creamy , sinful mixture over the top .
Okay , now I ’m really embarrassed .
No , not at the cream .
Not at the butter .
Not at the cream cheese , either .
I ’m embarrassed at the quality of the photo .
What happened ?
Did I cough ?
Hiccup ?
Convulse ?
It ’s off center , and the light from the window is messing everything up .
It ’s WRONG now , it ’s just all WRONG now !
But we ’ll talk about that in PW Photography .
Finally , just grate some Parmesan and sprinkle it over the top .
Now pop it into the oven and bake it for 45 minutes or so , until it ’s really bubbly and hot and … bubbly .
I did n’t get a photo of the finished potatoes inside the pan , because I ’m scatterbrained and I plum forgot .
I was thinking about thumthin’ elth .
Mmmm .
But I did get a photo of it on my plate .. up close and personal .
Mmmm .
I seriously have no words .
And I do n’t need any .
My mouth is a little busy right now .
You ’ve gotta try these , my darling friends .
They ’re…um … not to be believed .

Last week , in an otherwise sleepy Senate Estimates session , Greens senator Scott Ludlum asked fellow senator and Minister for Communication Stephen Conroy a series of questions about the Government 's proposal to " filter " the internet sites Australians can view .
As Ludlum thrust and Conroy parried , neither suspected their tussle would ignite mass action .
But , like a landmine buried just below the scene of their affray , the whole thing has suddenly blown up .
Campaigns have been launched , protests planned , reports filed throughout the broadcast media .
Conroy now faces a rising chorus of complaints from backbenchers who suddenly find themselves deluged with emails from constituents .
All of this is due principally to the emergence of a new kind of connectivity , the " social message service " .
Typified by Twitter , a web service now mushrooming in popularity , these social message services allow you to subscribe to messages from your friends , while your friends can " follow " you and receive your messages .
Across dense webs of interconnections ( with many people all reading the messages of one another , forwarding the best messages along , etc . )
Twitter has become a bit of an early warning system .
For example , the first reports of May 's horrific earthquake in Sichuan appeared on Twitter , a full 30 minutes before the AP wire , because some of those affected by the earthquake used Twitter to spread the word .
Over the following days , Chinese Twitter users coordinated rescue and relief efforts via Twitter .
Twitter has been around for about eighteen months , and many Australians - particularly those whose careers depend upon the internet - use Twitter to establish and reinforce business relationships , extend personal networks , even to sell off furniture before a move overseas .
Twitter has become the Speaker 's Corner , the neighborhood pub , and the auction block for tens of thousands of Australians .
The Australian Twitter community , though often chaotic and larrikin , has a fierce sense of pride in its interconnectedness , which often makes Twitter feel more like a country town than a big city .
That civic pride has just collided with the Government 's plans to filter the internet .
The imposition of any constraint on the free - flow of ideas online strikes at the very heart of Australia 's net culture - a culture that now keeps itself well - connected via Twitter .
As soon as Senator Conroy 's statements made their way out of Estimates , they echoed and reverberated through the Australian Twitter community .
Tempers rose .
Calls for action rang out , and were answered .
A movement began .
In less than a week 's time , Conroy has found himself in deeper and hotter water than ever before in his ministerial career .
Australia 's Twitterers , better connected than the Government which governs them , have out - organized , out - thought , and out - manoeuvered the government .
Senator Conroy has taken a disorganized community of well - connected peers and given them an organizing principle , a raison d'etre .
This may not have been Conroy 's intention ( I rather think it was n't ) but the senator must face the consequences of his actions .
This mob wo n't quiet down until the Government drops the filtering proposal .
Worse yet , from the Government 's point of view , when this mob succeeds in changing the policy of the Government , the Government will have implicitly blessed a new political force .
This collective , ad - hoc political action ( which I have termed " hyperpolitics " ) , is well on its way to becoming a permanent feature in Australian politics , no matter what happens in this particular instance .
Both different from and complementary to online campaigning , hyperpolitics knows no party affiliation , and is too chaotic to be channeled into manageable forms .
Hyperpolitics come at you from a dozen directions at once - a sensation Senator Conroy is now wholly familiar with .
Although the issue at hand involves making the internet safe and clean , that is actually less important than the force rising to oppose the plan .
In the next days , weeks and months , as we watch the Department of Communications and Broadband modify its proposal and redefine their election commitments in the face of hyperpolitical opposition , we 'll get a good glimpse into the inner workings of political life in Australia in the 21st century .
Senator Conroy , as the first victim backed into the buzz saw of hyperpolitics , is learning a lesson that other politicians would well heed : the mob is no longer yours to command or control .
The mob is fully capable of stating its own needs , and furthermore , is fully capable of satisfying them .

A street by any other name would n't be such sweet revenge .
North York councillors peeved at being overruled by the Ontario Municipal Board – on a condo complex they did n't want – exacted poetic justice yesterday by giving the project an address the developer wo n't soon forget : OMB Folly .
That 's the name the North York community council , on a 7 - 2 vote , chose for the new street leading into the 36 - unit complex .
Councillor John Filion , who has frequently knocked heads with developers , said he was flabbergasted the OMB would allow rezoning for townhouses on a site that lies outside the designated North York Centre development area .
" This one really stands out as the most ludicrous decision that I know of , " Filion said .
" It takes the cake .
I could cite a lot of terrible OMB decisions , but it 's the one that 's just obviously absurd and ridiculous . "
Filion had expected his colleagues to resist his suggestion to name the street OMB Folly .
Not today , said Councillor Maria Augimeri , after Councillor Howard Moscoe urged Filion to put it to a vote .
Councillor David Shiner said the move may usher in a welcome precedent : " When we start having the OMB not only go against our council but our planning staff , we may be able to come up with some very creative names to help name these new developments that show up without city council or city staff support . "
The municipal board , a quasi- judicial tribunal set up by the province , has routinely been blasted by Toronto councillors without firing back .
Yesterday was no exception .
" I can tell you right now we have no comment on that , " said Matthew Bryan , of the OMB 's communications office .
" We have no comment on what North York community council wishes to do . "
But the developer , who plans to start construction soon , was not amused .
" Are they nuts ? " said Stephen Maizels , CEO of Hallstone Group .
" Where is the adulthood ?
When do they grow up ? "
Maizels said the previous owner of the site , Churchill - Basswood Developments Inc. , was the entity that went to the OMB .
The tribunal ruled in 2005 that the proposed development was appropriate for the site , fit well into the neighbourhood and represented good planning .
Filion , however , said there are lots of available sites within the specified boundaries for intensification – on either side of Yonge St. from Highway 401 to north of Finch Ave .
According to the master plan , development is n't supposed to encroach into neighbourhoods of single - family detached homes .
Filion is worried the Hallstone development sets a bad precedent .
" Other developers will follow the lead and say , ` Let 's just run off to the Ontario Municipal Board and see if we get a crazy decision , too . '
It 's worth it for them to gamble $ 50,000 on an OMB hearing and roll the dice . "
A city staff report had suggested the street be named Connfield Lane , after John Conn , an early landowner in the area .

City council has given community councils authority to decide street names on their own , but officials are currently pondering whether OMB
Folly contravenes the street - naming policy , which says derogatory names should be avoided .
So the issue may be reopened for a second look at the next meeting of city council , Oct. 29-30 .
Is there a need for a separate EULA ( end user license agreement ) in the open source Mozilla browser ?
To date there has been , but that EULA is going to change very soon .
In a conversation with InternetNews.com , Mitchell Baker , Chairperson of Mozilla , admitted that Mozilla may not need both the EULA and open source license , with the EULA the likely casualty .
That said , there is a need for something in between the open source license and the user which is what Baker and Mozilla are actively working on .
The issue of Firefox 's EULA has raised concerns in the Linux community lately with questions arising about the need and validity of the EULA .
" Initially when we first shipped Firefox the idea of shipping Firefox under a binary source code license seemed odd so we created a EULA and we 're now coming to the conclusion that is not necessary , " said Baker .
" So the license agreement that we 've been working on will now say , ' dear end user you 're using FOSS software and here are the open source licenses to look at if you 'd like too and enjoy them . "
Ubuntu Linux founder Mark Shuttleworth argued this week that the EULA for Firefox was a not a best practice for open source software while other Ubuntu users labeled the EULA as a bug .
Red Hat 's Fedora Linux is n't in favor the current Firefox EULA either .
Fedora Project Leader Paul Frields noted that Fedora has been working with Mozilla since before the release of Firefox 3 on this issue , and those discussions are still ongoing .
" We 're concerned about the fact that Mozilla feels that Firefox requires a EULA for use of the software , " Frields told InternetNews.com .
" We continue to believe that the Mozilla Public License is a perfectly valid license for Firefox binaries and source code . "
For Novell 's OpenSUSE , the EULA has been a temporary annoyance as well .
" I understand the shock that people might feel the first time they see an application popping up a EULA -- and I dearly hope it does n't become a standard practice with OSS apps -- but in the general scope of things , I do n't think it 's an enormous burden on the user , since it 's a one - time issue , " Joe " Zonker " Brockmeier , Novell 's openSUSE community manager , told InternetNews.com .
That said Brockmeier noted that he does n't want to see every FOSS application requiring acceptance of a EULA when you launch it , so he hopes this does n't become a trend .
Under the approach Baker said Mozilla will be taking with Firefox though , she 's confident that many of the concerns of the Linux community will be addressed .
That said she does feel that an agreement behind just having the source code licensed under an open source license is necessary .
" There is a need for something , something to explain the license I 'm not sure I would call it a EULA because that has a meaning to many people of adding restrictions to software and we wo n't be doing that , " Baker said .
" We 'll be having a license agreement much as Red Hat has a license agreement that says the software is available under the GPL and do n't use our trademarks etcetera .
So we 'll have a license agreement but we wo n't think of it as a EULA . "
The move away from a EULA to something more in line with other open source approaches to licensing on Linux is something that Baker noted has been in process for some time .
" I think it 's fair to say we 'll be moving faster now , " Baker said .
" Now that the topic has risen I think it 's the right time to get our plans out there and give people the chance to comment and get moving . "
We have now come full cycle .
Money poured into Latin America and places like Iceland driving their currencies to insane levels vs. the US dollar .
Let 's take a look at Iceland before moving on to currency intervention by numerous countries in Latin America .
Reuters is reporting Iceland PM asks public not to take out lots of cash
Iceland 's prime minister asked the country 's savers on Thursday not to withdraw large amounts of money from the banking system .
" I want to emphasise ... that people remain calm and understand that the transaction system is fully functioning and depostits are safe , " Haarde said .
" I also ask the public not to withdraw large sums of money from the banks .
It will make things more difficult . "
Iceland seizes Kaupthing and closes stock market
Crisis - hit Iceland has taken control of Kaupthing , its biggest bank , and suspended trading on its stock exchange for two days .
With the nationalisation of Kaupthing , the Icelandic Government now has control of all three of the country 's big banks — Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir — as it struggles keep a lid on the panic .
The OMX Nordic Exchange Iceland said it will not re-open until Monday , due to “ unusual market conditions . "
Meanwhile trading in the Icelandic crown ground to a halt .
As Iceland abandoned efforts to shore up its currency and concentrated on efforts to secure a financial lifeline from Russia , Geir Haarde , the country 's Prime Minister , said that Iceland was probably paying the price for punching above its weight .
" What we have learned from this whole exercise over the last few years is that it is not wise for a small country to try to take a leading role in international banking , ” he said last night .
Iceland Learned Something
What we have learned from this whole exercise over the last few years is that it is not wise for a small country to try to take a leading role in international banking .
Latin American Banks Attempt to Save Currencies
Latin American central banks are being forced to draw on record foreign reserves built up during the six - year commodities rally to stop their currencies from sinking in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Brazil sold dollars for the first time in five years and Mexico sold $ 2.5 billion in the spot market between yesterday and today , helping their currencies pare losses .
Chile may follow suit , Barclays Capital analyst Rodrigo Valdes said .
The worst currency meltdown in Latin America since the emerging - market economic crises of the 1990s is causing companies ' dollar debts to swell as well as sparking derivatives losses , and may stoke inflation .
The decision to intervene came after central banks in the U.S. , Europe and Canada cut interest rates in a coordinated effort to boost confidence .
The real is down 29 percent since reaching a high of 1.5545 per dollar Aug .
1 . Brazil 's central bank did n't say how much it sold in the four dollar auctions it has held since yesterday .
The Mexican peso fell 0.3 percent to 12.3589 to the dollar .
Yesterday the peso at one point fell the most since 1994 , when President Ernesto Zedillo was forced to devalue to avoid depleting the country 's reserves .
Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB , the owner of supermarkets and Costco stores in Mexico , fell 44 percent yesterday after saying the peso 's plunge increased the cost of its foreign debt " significantly . "
Grupo Industrial Saltillo SAB , the Mexican auto parts and building materials company , asked the local exchange to suspend trading of its shares before announcing it will take a $ 48.5 million charge related to derivatives .
Brazil 's central bank last month raised the benchmark overnight rate for a fourth time since April to rein in inflation , which quickened to 6.25 percent in September .
The target is 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points .
Mexico and Chile already busted their targets .
Chilean consumer prices rose 9.2 percent last month from a year earlier , more than triple the bank 's target of 3 percent .
Inflation in Mexico quickened to 5.57 percent in August , above the 4 percent upper end of the target band .
" There 's a very high chance " that the Chilean central bank will intervene to strengthen the peso , said Gabriel Casillas , an economist with UBS Pactual in Mexico City .
The bank " will be feeling quite uncomfortable with the peso at this level . "

I showed my program to a Perl hacker and got a lot of good feedback on it .
He did n’t like my tedious table parsing and general reinventing of core Perl features with mediocre code .
He suggested I look at Filter : : Simple .
I have to say that Active State ’s package manager program for CPAN is a pleasure to use .
It ’s exactly the sort of painless no -hacking type of tool that Windows development practices breed addictions to in its developers .
No hacking around in weird script files .
No posting questions on forums .
Yea !
So getting Filter : : Simple is not a problem … and dashing out a quick test project is a piece of cake thanks to the good documentation on CPAN :
#!/usr/bin/perl #squig.pm package SQUIG ; use Filter : : Simple ; FILTER { s/( \w+ ) ~( \w+ ) ~( \w+ ) / try ( '\ 1 ' , ' \ 2 ' , ' \ 3 ' ) / g ; } ; 1 ;
#!/usr/bin/perl #test.pl use SQUIG ; sub try { my ( $a , $b , $ c ) = @_ ; print " $ a...$b...$ c...
" ; } Abba~Babba ~Dabba ;
I think this easy - to - use tool can solve about 80 % of my syntactic sugar issues .
The only hitch I see is that I ’d like to go beyond a simple sed - like command and call subroutines or functions on the replacement side so I can get different results depending on what turns up in the regexp match .
For instance , I ’d want to adapt the above “ squiggle ” filter to put single quotes around text , but leave scalars plain .
I might want to transform Foo~Bar ~ $baz into $ self->a_function_call ( ‘ Foo ’ , ‘ Bar ’ , $ baz ) .
( I ’m not sure I ’d want to see a regex that could do that ….)
This could help me clean up my object code and eliminate some of the ugliness in the method routines .
( Although I may be using Moose in a hamfisted way to begin with …. )
Turning this technique to my data file parsing of table data …
I could create simple functions that build up my ‘ environment ’ objects .
Instead of parsing text and ‘ manually ’ loading up Moose objects , I could use the sourcefilter transform my table definitions directly into perl code wherever that makes sense .
This also brings me back to my original ‘ dream ’ project .
I could create my own shorthand for a certain class of objects .
I could create a set of source filters that get rid of the boiler plate .
Instead of hacking up my own evalutator or abusing eval , I could rearrange functions however I like based on the keywords I tag with them .
My spider sense is tingling , though .
I suspect this is only marginally less evil than my original inclination .
This technique is not covered in any of my Perl books .
Larry mentions it in passing in the Camel book , the Perl Cookbook mentions it only in the context of a switch command hack , and Mastering Perl explicitly avoids it .
It ’s strange to me that Perl literature is so far removed from how I actually use Perl day - to - day .
Without word - of - mouth type tips from ‘ real ’
Perl hackers , I would never have thought to try either Moose or source filters … but that ’s what I ’m leaning on the most in my architecture .
Is there really a gap or do I want bizarre things from my programming environment ?

Rails can simply be defined as a very dynamic and productive web application framework , which has its origin written in Ruby .
The Reason as to why rails are the most common being used today is because you can develop a web application much faster with compared to any java framework .
You will realize that to open up a ruby framework to develop a database - backed web one has to configure the chose using Database Schema .
In order for this to function well , it will require a full stack framework which is everything needed that will create a database driven web most of the time using the model view controller pattern .
This means that all the layers are built to work well together and requires a very few lines of codes than most of the available framework
In order for the rails to be more productive and strong at the same time , they have some features that rely on one another .
Some of these features are :
Metaprogramming : this is here the framework extensive code to write the program from the beginning .
The rails use this code as well as ruby but they all rely very heavily on the metaprogramming for heavy lifting .

Environments : there are a total of three default environments that rails provide and they all behave in a different manner which enables one to develop the much - needed cycle very easily .
The environments are development , testing , and production .
Conclusion
There are many things that one can do that they were unable to do and this can be made possible by learning how to code .
Some of this thing that you will greatly benefit from coding is the ability to create your own website , starting one of your own technology business , or even advancing a career in coding .
this is why it is key to get to know what coding is all about .
As we are aware that the world has been totally shaped by the ever - advancing technology and the best way to be able to understand this technology is by learning some of the basics about coding .
This is why it is important to get to learn to code as a hobby or just the need to understand technology and some of the benefits that it provides to the world , with this knowledge you will fell not left behind as far as technology is concerned .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Major players in the $ 455 trillion global derivatives market rushed Sunday to scale back exposure to a potential bankruptcy filing by investment bank Lehman Brothers in a rare emergency trading session .

Trading took place as U.S. regulators and bankers were making last - ditch efforts to prevent toxic assets from ailing Lehman Brothers LEH.N spilling into global markets and rupturing investor faith in the international financial system .
“ This is an extremely , and I stress extremely , rare event .
It also speaks to the more general notion that , in today ’s highly disrupted financial markets , the unthinkable is thinkable , ” said Mohamed El - Erian , the chief executive of Pimco , the world ’s biggest bond fund , based in Newport Beach , California .
The session opened at 2 p.m. New York time and was due to run until 4 p.m. ( 1800 to 2000 GMT ) , according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association .
ISDA later extended it for another two hours and some banks continued to offset their Lehman exposure even after the official session ended , according to a market source .
Trading involved credit , equity , rates , foreign exchange and commodity derivatives .
ISDA estimates the OTC derivatives market excluding commodities has a value of $ 455 trillion .
Market sources said the special session was initiated by the Federal Reserve .
The aim is to reduce risk associated with a potential bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .
“ Trades are contingent on a bankruptcy filing at or before 11:59 p.m. New York time Sunday ( 0359 GMT ) , ” said the statement .
“ If there is no filing , the trades cease to exist . ”
LEHMAN DEAL HOPES FADE
Britain's Barclays Plc BARC.L , which had appeared to be the frontrunner to take over Lehman -- excluding its bad mortgage - related assets -- pulled out of the bidding early in the afternoon , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Bank of America , which had also been named as a potential acquirer , was in advanced talks to buy Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.
N for at least $ 38.25 billion in stock , the New York Times said on Sunday , citing people briefed on the negotiations .
Merrill Chief Executive John Thain and Bank of America BAC.N Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis were present at weekend talks on the future of Lehman .
Fading hopes for a Lehman deal raised the risk the firm may file for bankruptcy .
Lehman hired law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges to prepare a potential bankruptcy filing , the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday in its online edition , citing a person familiar with the matter .
The head of bond fund Pimco , Bill Gross , said a Lehman bankruptcy risks an “ immediate tsunami ” because of the unwinding of derivative and credit swap - related positions worldwide in the dealer , hedge fund and buyside universe .
The trading session “ saw very little trading -- perhaps $ 1 billion total -- but at much wider spread levels for corporate bonds , ” he said .
Mark Grant , managing director of structured finance at Southwest Securities , based in Dallas , said the lack of transparency in the credit derivatives market is a problem .
“ No one has any idea about the credit quality of the assets in Lehman ’s portfolio and no one has a handle about the size of the CDS contracts , ” he said .
“ The market is going to be spooked .
People will be fearful and no one outside a very small group of people knows what Lehman going into liquidation will mean . ”
If there is a forced sale or liquidation , “ this could set off another round of writedowns globally . ”
COUNTERPARTY RISK
If Lehman were to file for bankruptcy , credit spreads for all corporates are expected to widen dramatically , causing large losses to investors , including those without any direct exposure to Lehman .
Barclays credit analysts said earlier this year that CDS counterparty failure could amount to $ 47 billion in losses .
“ Our analysis shows that the failure of a major counterparty which had $ 2 trillion outstanding in OTC credit derivatives , could result in losses of $ 36 - 47 billion in the financial system solely due to the immediate re-pricing of credit risk due to a counterparty default , ” Barclays said in a February 2008 report .
The U.S. dollar fell against major currencies late Sunday , while U.S. stock index futures tumbled on opening , indicating a sharply lower open on Monday .
Dow futures fell more than 300 points , while futures on the S&P 500 were down about 40 points , reflecting investor jitters about the health of the financial sector .

A takeover of Merrill by Bank of America would likely restore some confidence to markets , said Pimco ’s Gross , “ although I am skeptical that BofA would pay such a premium on such short not . ”

Once you know the method it looses its power over you .
Its easier to manipulate those who are unaware .
For all of us to teach and learn about manipulation techniques and thereby become immune to them , is the purpose of this thread .
What follows are just a few examples means of infowar , psychowar and mass - indoctrination .
These are used on a daily basis by mass - media , politics , schools , speakers , writers ... even here on ATS .
Im sure there are psychological labels for these phenomena but I dont know them so Ive devised some of my own .
1. The Yes - Street Technique
I wanna get my audience to agree with something controversial , so I´ll first start by saying a bunch of things that they already agree with and already believe in .
This is how I build trust .
Then , when I have them all nodding and agreeing at the principles
Ive laid out , I can also sell the more disagreeable stuff .
This is the basic cult - recruitment technique .
You can not recruit anyone for a cult if you do not first offer enough benefits to get the person hooked .
Once hooked you can sell him anything you want .
It goes without saying that politicians also love to use this one .
This is called " the yes - street technique " because one first gets someone into the habit of saying yes , yes , yes , yes before offering something he / she would have otherwise said " no " to .
Remedy : Discernment .
Nothing is completely black or white .
Just because organization / politician / book X has said many true things in the past doesnt mean that everything coming from that source is good and true .
2. Create your own enemy
If you secretly create your own opposition this has many , many benefits .
This is a technique that goes completely unnoticed by most people .
Since you know that everything has its opposite , might as well create that opposite yourself .
Once you have created a worldview , religion , politicial agenda , cult , company or whatever and you create the opposing side to your agenda yourself , you can :
* Control the enemy ( control the extent of damage they do to you )
* Make the enemy look crazy or goofy
* Make " friends " with real enemies thus getting insight into their operations .
* Create " negative " publicity about you ... which is essentially good publicity because everyone is being forced to look at you and what you have to offer .
( ATS Example : Notice how negative posts bump your thread to the top of the list ?
You can be thankful for your enemies without which some of your threads wouldnt be getting any attention ) .
Remedy : Avoid extremely polarized / fanatical positions .
See both sides of an issue .
3. Diverting Attention
If you want to cover something up , you divert attention .
One way to do this that we might all remember having done ourselves as children is to admit to a lesser lie in order to cover - up a bigger lie .
Mom asks : " Where do you have that money from ? "
You dont tell her that you robbed a bank but start crying and say " I admit it , I admit it .
I found a purse on the street and stole some money out of it .
Im so sorry " .
The global power players use this technique on a regular basis .
One conspiracy - example of this would be : " Tell them there was a votefraud - conspiracy 2003 so that they dont recognize that they entire election process is rigged since hundreds of years " or " Tell them we´re in Iraq for oil ... give them some bread to eat , so that they dont see the bigger picture " ( These are only examples , not proposals for theories or discussion points ) .
The most basic example of attention - diversion is the politician who wants to get peoples attention away from problems in their own country so he keeps pointing at problems in another country .
Want to know how easy it is to divert peoples attention ?
Stop on a crowded street and start staring upwards at the clouds .
Notice how other people start looking upward too .
Monkey see , monkey do .
Remedy : Practice not putting your attention on where everyone else is putting their attention but looking behind the veil .
Dont only look at the obvious in front of your eyes but also behind it .
4. Overload , Overwhelm & Confusion
Some manipulators rely heavily on peoples short - attention span .
Overhelm and overload someone with so much information and contradictory data that his mind goes into a state of exhaustion and he either a )
Doesnt care anymore what the truth is ( apathy ) or looses sight of the big picture ( confusion ) .
Information - overload is what is happening today , with contradictory messages being force - fed on us on a daily basis .
Today we learn that coffee causes cancer , tommorow we learn that coffee prevents cancer , then we learn that you have to drink a lot of water if you wanna drink coffee , and next we learn that coffee does not suck water out of the body afterall .
Being the superficial information - hounds that we are ( sucking up a little bit of this and that without going into depth with anything ) , we loose sight of what is important and what is true .
Remedy : Choose wisely what you look into .
Prioritize your reading .
When a subject is overloaded with confusion ( ATS - example : The 9/11 Forum ) , get back to the basic questions of asking what is important , what is really known and what is really unknown .
Dont listen to emotionally charged people , dont listen to hysteria and hype .
Rest and relax before getting back to a subject .
5. Mystery - Maker
Mystery attracts attention .
Present something with a few knowns but many unknowns .
What happens is that peoples attention is sucked into the subject , causing hours or even a lifetime of preoccupation .
Manipulators use this by making a few remarks about a subject and intentionally withholding the rest .
So they get the person interested .
Then bits of information are revealed piece by piece to keep the dog on the hook of wanting more food .
Remedy : Give money only to those who can tell you squarely and clearly what something is about .
6. The Fear / Desire Circus
The power player , knowing that humans are driven by fear ( survival ) and desire ( survival ) can easily play ball with mass - attention .
Find out what someone wants and make the impression you that you offer that .
Find out what someone fears and make the impression you offer the solution to that .
Remedy :
Dont let your fears and desires be too strong , otherwise you can be played like a ball by any con-man or scam - artist around .
Notice how our whole civilization is being controlled with the Fear / Desire Circus .
Notice how you can find fullfillment within and dont need all of the stuff they offer .
Someone who doesnt need much cannot be manipulated .
Neediness = Powerlessness .
I have about a dozen more techniques
Id like to write about in this thread , but I dont want to overwhelm the reader so I will add them later .
I welcome your realizations on manipulation - techniques or your examples on how they are applied in world politics , media and " education " and look forward to learning a lot from my fellow ATSers .

The coordinate system appears to be " flipped " by AppKit standards , so the origin is in the upper - left .
Even though the APIs may have the same names , they may not behave the same .
For example , [ view setWantsLayer : YES ] is n't enough in Cappuccino .
You need to actually instantiate a CALayer yourself and add it to the view .
Cappuccino seems to intercept all key events by default , so I found ⌘- N would n't open new windows in Safari with a Cappuccino app running in the window
The syntax is currently Objective - C 1.x , so none of the new 2.x syntax is available
First Look at Cappuccino and Objective -J
Posted Sep 5 , 2008 — 46 comments below Posted Sep 5 , 2008 — 46 comments below
You 've probably heard of 280 Slides , which is an exceptionally polished Keynote - like presentation app for the web .
The creators , 280 North , today published the framework and language used to create it , called Cappuccino and Objective - J , respectively .
I only had a few hours to play with both , so keep in mind this is a very early review .
The executive summary is that Cappuccino is re-implementation of many of the basic parts of Cocoa , and Objective - J is a language which looks nearly identical to Objective - C and " compiles down " into JavaScript .
You can also use JavaScript right inline with Objective - J , similar to how you can use C in Objective - C.Mac OS X Leopard has 82 built - in frameworks , and Cappuccino implementsof only two of them : Foundation and AppKit .
There is an implementation of certain data structures of Core Animation as well , but Iit 's misleading to call it a port because there 's no OpenGL underlying it so none of the fancy 3D effects are available .
There is a lot of one - to - one mapping of common classes , such asbeing equivalent tobeing equivalent to , and so on .
Some of the CoreGraphics / Quartz API is implemented as well .
Browsing the Cappuccino class documentation gives you a pretty good idea of what 's going on .
280 North has done an incredible amount of work here .
That said , you generally wo n't be able to take a modern , multi- framework Mac app and " recompile " it for Cappuccino .
Some small apps might be able to pull it off with a bit of renaming and reshuffling , but any moderately complex app would be stranded .
As a simple example , there is n't a , but there is a , which I assume is close to This is n't a knock against 280 North — all of this is really , really difficult to do .
It 's just important to understand that this does n't mean all Mac apps can suddenly run on the web .
What itmean is that Xcode and Interface Builder are now reasonable prototyping tools for web apps based on Cappuccino , and Mac programmers can now quickly become very effective client - side web developers .
The transition is somewhat similar to developing for iPhone — fundamentally similar concepts , but a slightly different inventory in the utility belt .
What 's most shocking initially is how practically anyone could mistake Objective - J for Objective - C: If you change theline and rename everything fromto , this would probably compile as Objective - C .
In my experiments , I did run into some obvious missing methods , such as , but a ton of it is already here in the first release .
As a Cocoa / Objective - C programmer , it 's easily to forget that you 're writing a web app .
For example , here 's some code I wrote today to make a draggable box ( ) : Other than replacingwithandwith , this is , verbatim , how you 'd do it in Cocoa .
You do n't have to think about any sort of DOM queries or JavaScript of any sort .
For Mac and iPhone developers , this is beginning of something very big .
One question that occurred to me immediately is how to incorporate server - side frameworks into the stack .
Cappuccino is , after all , a client - side framework , so you 'll need need a separate server - side piece ( ) in most cases .
I have n't had much time to look at this , but the Cappuccino Flickr demo seems to use an asynchronous JSON request to fetch data and display it as it arrives .
I 'll need to spend more time with it to figure out the details .
One side note here : Cappuccinoto like to take over the whole browser window .
I experimented with adding my own bare CSS - styled DIVs at arbitrary locations in the canvas and I did n't have a lot of success .
Not sure if this is by design I was doing something wrong .
The documentation does make it clear that Cappuccino is intended to create web - based , though , not web pages .
The biggest technical hurdle right now is the size of the framework .
The AppKit implementation is 18 k lines long , and Foundation is about 5 k .
When I asked the 280 North guys about this earlier in the year , they seemed to think server - side compression was a reasonable solution .
This is n't my area of speciality , though , so I can't really comment on it .
A few quick things I figured out today :
One last note : there are a set of tools provided to improve the development process , including a pre-interpreter ( ) and plug-ins for TextMate and SubEthaEdit .
Overall , a very big day for Cocoa and iPhone developers looking to deploy web apps .
Major kudos to 280 North .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Regular low - dose aspirin , taken typically to ward off a heart attack , may increase the risk of developing stomach ulcers , but this can be counteracted by taking another pill -- esomeprazole , more familiarly known as Nexium .
That finding comes from a study reported in the American Journal of Gastroenterology .
Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor , meaning that it suppresses gastric acid .
The authors note that no studies until now have measured how often low - dose aspirin users develop stomach ulcers ( as seen by endoscopy ) or “ to what extent ulcers are prevented by use of a proton pump inhibitor . ”
Dr. Neville Yeomans , at the University of Western Sydney , Australia , and colleagues studied nearly 1000 patients , 60 years of age and older , who were taking 75 to 325 milligrams of aspirin daily and were randomly assigned to also take esomeprazole or an inactive “ placebo ” for 26 weeks .
During the study period , endoscopic examinations revealed stomach ulcers in 5.4 percent of patients in the placebo group compared with 1.6 percent of those in the esomeprazole group , the researchers report .
Thus , esomeprazole reduces the risk of gastroduodenal ulcer in low - dose aspirin users by about 70 percent .
“ The results of this study support the use of esomeprazole 20 mg once daily for reducing the risk of gastric and / or duodenal ulcers associated with the use of low - dose aspirin in patients aged 60 years and older who do not have preexisting gastroduodenal ulcers , ” Yeoman ’s team concludes .

Microsoft just announced at E3 that they 'll be giving the Xbox 360 a total software overhaul this fall .
" When people turn on their Xbox 360s this fall , they 'll get an entirely new interface and Dashboard , an entirely new Xbox through the magic of software , " said John Schappert , head of Live services .
New features will include those fancy new Mii - like 3D Avatars , a new emphasis on community with IM , video chat , and photo sharing , along with a brand new 3D slide interface for the main Dashboard screen .
Avatars will be integrated into your GamerCard , but you can also create a " Live party " and invite your friends , with as many as 8 of your three dimensional homies hanging out at once -- though you 're not hanging out in an actual 3D environment .
You can use your avatar in certain Live Arcade games like Uno , and even in third party titles such as the upcoming Scene It ? title .
It sounds like Microsoft is taking cues from the Wii , Sony 's Home and Facebook all in one fell swoop , not bad at all .
Have you heard the old joke about what separates a hockey mom from a pitbull ?
Lipstick .
And $ 150,000 worth of clothes , hair , and makeup .
Politico reports that the Republican National Committee " has spent more than $ 150,000 to clothe and accessorise vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family " since August , with shopping bills at stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue , Neiman Marcus , Barney 's and Bloomingdale 's totaling as much as $ 75,062.63 , and a one - month hair and makeup total expenditure of $ 4,716.49 .
There is some question about the legality of such extravagant wardrobe expenditures under the Federal Election Commission 's guidelines on the use of campaign contributions to procure personal items , although my completely proletarian opinion is that securing an appropriate wardrobe for a female candidate in particular is a necessary part of campaign branding .
Given the truly preposterous amount of attention that has been given to Palin 's hair , glasses , shoes , accessories and every other little detail of her clothing and makeup , it 's tough to argue that the campaign had no reason to invest in Palin 's look .
( Arguing that women should n't be subjected to such scrutiny is a whole other argument entirely . )
The question is n't whether they should have spent any money .
It 's whether they should have spent what my grandmother used to describe as " that kind of money . "
It certainly was n't a necessity with regard to the availability of fashionable clothes for modest prices .
As Pam Spaulding aptly notes , " Michelle Obama buys off - the - rack ( eg , the dress that she wore on The View was $ 148 ) , and looks damn good in it without costing the campaign a fortune . "
I can't imagine the campaign calculated it was a necessity with regard to their audience .
The McCain - Palin campaign 's governing principle is easily and succinctly précised as " What would Joe Six - pack do ? "
One guesses he would n't spend a cool $ 150 k at Bloomie's .
Even if Joe Six - pack had that kind of money to spend these days , the small towns in " Real America " populated by Clans Six - pack and Plumber , about which Palin gushingly enthuses on the campaign trail , generally trend less toward Saks and more toward Marts : Wal and K to be precise .
And so , predictably , the scheme has failed miserably with their base .
Marc Ambinder reports , " Republicans , RNC donors and at least one RNC staff member have e-mailed me tonight to share their utter ( and not - for - attribution ) disgust at the expenditures . "
Palin spokesperson Tracey Schmitt tried valiantly to spin the complaints : " With all of the important issues facing the country right now , it 's remarkable that we 're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses . "
The point , you have missed it .
It 's remarkable that with all the important issues facing the country right now – economic morass , homelessness increasing , the majority of states now in recession – you 're spending three times the US median household income on pantsuits and blouses , and did n't have the foresight to consider the average American might find that objectionable .
That 's beyond tone deaf .
That 's completely out of touch with the very people whose champions the McCain - Palin ticket purports to be .
Who could have guessed that the emperor wearing no clothes would be an improvement ?
Lehman Brothers was tonight scrambling to secure a buyer after a week in which confidence in the bank has spiralled lower at a breathtaking pace .
Officials at the Federal Reserve and US Treasury have been working with Lehman and are hoping to get a deal in place by the opening of the Asian markets on Monday , to prevent a worsening financial crisis .
Barclays is thought to be interested although it is not clear whether it is eyeing parts or all of the troubled Wall Street firm .
Bob Diamond , the Barclays president had been in the US on Monday , coincidentally at a conference hosted by Lehman , and was rumoured to have returned to New York late this week .
Other potential buyers include Bank of America , said to be working alongside the investment firm JC Flowers and the Chinese sovereign wealth fund , China Investment Co .
Nomura has also been named as a possible bidder , as have a number of private equity firms .
None would comment .
But Wall Street was not convinced that a deal could be done , fearing that potential buyers would be wary of finding as yet uncovered problems in the Lehman balance sheet .
Shares in the bank , which have fallen dramatically this week , were trading lower again today , down another 43 cents to $ 3.79 .
There were suggestions that buyers would only move forward with the kind of guarantees offered by the Federal Reserve to JP Morgan when it bought Bear Stearns in March and agreed to absorb up to $ 29bn ( £ 16 bn ) of losses .
Treasury secretary Hank Paulson is , though , said to be adamant that further taxpayers ' money will not be used .
The turmoil at Lehman is the latest in the unravelling credit crisis that began over a year ago .
Far from abating , the situation appears to be getting worse , with the US government forced to step in and bailout the mortgage finance firms Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae last weekend .
There has been pressure on the shares of both Merrill Lynch and Washington Mutual this week .
It is unclear how much so called counter - party risk is carried at Lehman - that is , how much does it owe to other banks and to whom , and therefore how much of a risk it would pose if allowed to go under .
Senator Richard Shelby , a Republican who chairs the senate banking , housing and urban affairs committee said the government was under no obligation to rescue Lehman .
" They are not too big to fail .
I do n't see this as a national problem .
I see this as their problem , " he said .
Diamond has made no secret of his plans to boost Barclays ' position on Wall Street but in the past stressed his preference for organic growth .
Among the talk on Wall Street today were suggestions that a consortium could take Lehman private , recreating an old fashioned partnership .
A partial break - up , already proposed by existing management , is also possible .
Barclays is keen to expand its asset management operation and could potentially be interested in the highly - regarded Lehman fund management division already on the block .
But the Fed might be even more reluctant to provide any support to a foreign buyer and Barclays would also need to convince its own shareholders that taking part of the investment bank was not too risky in the current climate .
Lehman ran into trouble after expanding aggressively into financing commercial and residential property , including sub - prime mortgages .
As the credit crunch began to emerge last year , the bank insisted that it would be able to get through the crisis .
The market appeared to believe it , and its shares were still at $ 66 in February .
The failure of Bear Stearns in March however unnerved Wall Street and confidence in Lehman began to erode .
The bank registered losses of $ 2.8bn in the second quarter and a further $ 3.9bn in the third , after taking huge writedowns on its property investments .
Lehman employs around 25,000 people worldwide .
Lehman had attempted to calm the markets on Wednesday with a series of measures to cut its exposure to the property market and raising fresh capital .
But Wall Street was not convinced , forcing chief executive Richard Fuld to search for a buyer .

Allegations against Mr Al Fayed were made in May Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed has been questioned by police over allegations of a sexual assault on a girl under 16 .
Police are investigating claims the girl , reported to be 15 , was assaulted at the central London department store .
A spokeswoman for Mr Al Fayed , who has not been arrested , said he " vehemently " denied the claims .
Scotland Yard has confirmed a man attended a west London police station by prior arrangement and was interviewed under caution .
Mr Al Fayed 's spokeswoman Katharine Witty said he voluntarily visited the police station on Wednesday and spent less than half an hour there .
Leak claim
She said : " Mr Al Fayed vehemently denies the allegations and is confident that his name will be cleared . "
She said he was concerned details of the interview had been leaked by police and was reported in the media within an hour of it ending .

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " We can confirm that a man attended a west London police station by prior arrangement and was questioned under caution this morning .
" The man was questioned in relation to an allegation of sexual assault on a girl under 16 at a business premises in central London .
" The allegation was received in May 2008 . "
BBC crime correspondent Ben Ando said he understood it was alleged that an assault had taken place at Harrods in Knightsbridge .
A spokesman for the store said it had no comment to make on the matter .
The Met 's Operation Sapphire , which investigates sexual offences in London , is leading the inquiry .
It is understood the attack is alleged to have taken place at Harrods Our correspondent said detectives would collect a dossier of evidence around the allegations before sending it to the Crown Prosecution Service .
He said : " It will be they who decide whether or not to prosecute .
" There will be two basic tests - whether there is a realistic chance of any kind of conviction based on the evidence and if it is in the public interest for a conviction to be sought . "
Brushes with the law Mr Al Fayed 's UK business interests include high - profile department store Harrods and Premiership football club Fulham .
His son Dodi Fayed died alongside Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris in 1997 .
During the 1970s , a long - running feud between Mr Al Fayed and businessman , the late Tiny Rowland , resulted in a Department of Trade inquiry into the Egyptian entrepreneur .
MOHAMED AL FAYED Born in Egypt in 1933 Becomes an advisor to one of the world 's richest men , the Sultan of Brunei , in 1966 .
Moves to the UK in the 1970s Buys Harrods in a £ 615 m takeover bid in 1985 Department of Trade report in 1990 concludes Mr Al Fayed and his brother lied about their background .
Son Dodi and Princess Diana are killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997 Arrested after precious gems go missing from Harrods safety deposit boxes in 1998 but no charges are ever brought Application for a British passport is turned down in 1999
In 2001 former MP Neil Hamilton loses libel claim against Mr Al Fayed over the cash for questions affair
In 2008 Mr Al Fayed gives up his campaign to prove the death of his son and Princess Diana was a " conspiracy "
The subsequent report , issued in 1990 , concluded that Mr Al Fayed and his brother Ali had lied about their background and wealth .
Mr Rowland later accused his business rival of breaking into a safety deposit box stored at Harrods .
Mr Al Fayed settled the dispute with Mr Rowland 's wife after his death without admitting any responsibility over the issue .
It has been suggested that the feud contributed to Mr Al Fayed 's being refused British citizenship the first time he applied .
He viewed that refusal as an affront , and at the time , said : " Why wo n't they give me a passport ?
I own Harrods and employ thousands of people in this country . "
Mr Al Fayed has also given millions to charities such as the Great Ormond Street Hospital and set up the Al Fayed Charitable Foundation to help children suffering from illness or those living in poverty .
But further attempts to gain British citizenship have also failed .
In 1999 , his application for a UK passport was rejected by the - then home secretary , Jack Straw , and he failed to overturn this on appeal .
Political scalps
After the first time his application for a British passport was refused , Mr Al Fayed said he had paid two Conservative ministers - Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith - to ask questions related to his interests , in the House of Commons .
Both left the government in disgrace .
Mr Hamilton had wanted to clear his name of accusations that he had accepted envelopes stuffed with cash from Mr Al Fayed in exchange for asking parliamentary questions , but subsequently lost a libel case against the businessman .
Mr Al Fayed claimed another political scalp in Jonathan Aitken , the cabinet minister who resigned after the Harrods boss revealed he had been staying free at the Ritz in Paris at the same time as Saudi arms dealers .
But it was the death of his son Dodi and Princess Diana which threw Mr Al Fayed into the spotlight .
He spent 10 years campaigning for an inquest into their deaths , claiming it had been a conspiracy by the British " establishment " .
This year , coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker dismissed his claim the pair had been murdered and said there was " not a shred of evidence " to support it .

Olbermann calls on McCain the ' fraud ' to suspend campaign David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Incendiary language from the audiences at McCain - Palin rallies has recently become commonplace .
During the warmup prior to an appearance by Sarah Palin in Scranton on Tuesday , there was yet another cry of " kill him " following a mention of Barack Obama 's name .
Democratic vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden told ABC on Sunday , " I 'm no more concerned about it , as long as ...
John pushes it back in a box and Gov. Palin pushes it back in a box .
I do n't think they intentionally do it . "
However , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann devoted a Special Comment on Tuesday evening to John McCain and Sarah Palin 's failure to take responsibility for what is said in their name and rein in their increasingly intemperate followers .
He concluded by suggesting to McCain that he " suspend your campaign now , until you or somebody else gets some control over it and it ceases to be a clear and present danger to the peace of this nation . "
Olbermann was particularly incensed by McCain 's reaction when he was asked on Tuesday about the violent rhetoric of his supporters .
McCain replied , briefly and casually , " Sure , I repudiate it , as I have on several occasions . "
He immediately went on to rail against Rep. John Lewis ( D - GA ) , who charged last weekend that McCain and Palin are " sowing the seeds of hatred and division " and compared the mood at their rallies to the " atmosphere of hate " created by George Wallace .
" And unfortunately Congressman John Lewis -- an American hero who I admire -- made the most , worst , most unacceptable statement a couple of days ago that I 've ever heard , " McCain stated .
" He accused me and Sarah Palin of being involved with segregation , George Wallace , and even made reference to a church bombing where children were killed .
Senator Obama has not repudiated that statement .
...
It 's the most outrageous thing that I 've heard since I 've been in politics .
..
It 's disgraceful . "
" ' Disgraceful ' ? " Olberman echoed .
" Obviously , Senator , you have n't heard your own speeches , or Governor Palin's , and what people shout during them .
...
These people are speaking for you .
And how dare you try to claim Congressman Lewis was linking you to Governor George Wallace 's segregation .
He was , in fact , linking you -- aptly , sir -- to Governor George Wallace 's lynch - mob mentality . "
" There are some things to honor and respect about you Senator McCain , " concluded Olbermann , " but on this , you are not only a fraud , sir , but you are tacitly inciting lunatics to violence .
If you want to again grandstand and suspend your campaign , here 's your big chance , sir . "

In the pre-dawn hours of Wednesday , September 3 , three U.S. helicopters carrying U.S. Special Operations Forces swooped down onto the Pakistani village of Musa Nika , in South Waziristan , killing fifteen to twenty people according to early reports .
The U.S. press noted that this is the first known ground assault of U.S. troops in Pakistan .
The provincial governor said twenty civilians including women and children were killed .
The Foreign Minister denounced the attack , declaring that “ no important terrorist or high - value target ” was hit .
The chief spokesman for the Pakistani Army registered its “ strong objection . ”
Gen. Athar Abbas declared that the attack could provoke a general rebellion of local tribes against his government , and threaten NATO supply lines from Karachi into Afghanistan .
The Foreign Minister angrily declared that “ no important terrorist or high - value target ” was hit .
The U.S. ambassador was summoned to receive Islamabad ’s official protest .
This is heavy stuff .
But this news got sidelined by the star coverage conferred by the mainstream media on Sarah Palin , whose ringing oration , dripping with ignorance and contempt for the world , brought down the house Wednesday night in that celebration of stupidity in St. Paul .
That speech , authored by George W. Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully for whatever vice presidential candidate McCain selected , asserted among other things that Bush ’s “ surge ” had prevented al - Qaeda from taking over Iraq .
The message is clear : all U.S. military action is designed to protect the U.S. from al - Qaeda terror .
Why would the mainstream media , pronouncing “ a star is born , ” want to highlight the little news story about remote Waziristan ?
Palin was splashed all over the front page of the Boston Globe on Thursday ; the Pakistan story was on page A - 3 .
On Friday a follow - up AP story made page A - 26 .
It emphasized how the raid had “ complicated life for presidential front - runner Asif Ali Zardari . ”
But this largely ignored event holds potentially horrifying significance .
“ Top American officials ” have told the New York Times that this raid “ could be the opening salvo in a much broader campaign by Special Operations forces against the Taliban and Al Qaeda inside Pakistan , a secret plan that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has been advocating for months within President Bush ’s war council . ”
The plan of course enjoys the support of John McCain , who never met a warlike action he did n’t like , as well as his opponent in the presidential race .
Barack Obama has been saying for over a year that is the U.S. has “ actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets ” in Pakistan and the chance to hit them , it should do so .
The hell with Pakistani sovereignty !
Why should such a detail matter after “ we were attacked ” ?
Why should the outraged opposition of the Pakistani government constitute a major news story ?
Pakistan ’s only a nuclear - armed Muslim country of 165 million people , which has at great cost to itself agreed–under duress , indeed the threat of being “ bombed back into the Stone Age ” — to abet U.S. objectives in neighboring Afghanistan .
It ’s just a country that having helped create and nurture the Taliban in order to stabilize Afghanistan , broke with that organization at the demand of the U.S. in 2001 and then found its frontier provinces flooded with Islamist militants fleeing across the border .
According to a White House “ fact sheet ” issued in August 2007 :
Pakistan has worked closely with the United States to secure the arrest of terrorists like Khalid Shaykh Mohammad , Abu Zubaydah , and Ramzi bin al Shibh .
Pakistan has killed or captured hundreds of suspected and known terrorists , including Mullah Obaidullah , who ranked second in the Taliban hierarchy at the time of his capture .
About 100,000 Pakistani troops are deployed in the region near the Afghan border , and hundreds of Pakistani security forces have given their lives in the battle to combat terrorism post - 9/11 .
Pakistan provides vital logistical support to coalition forces in Afghanistan .
President Musharraf has a comprehensive strategy that combines three critical components –strengthened governance , increased economic development , and improved security–aimed at eradicating extremism in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas .
No government has provided more assistance to Washington as it pursues its goals in Southwest Asia .
No country has been more dramatically destabilized as the price of its cooperation .
But not only does the U.S. political class take this disasterous compliance for granted , it wants to further emphasize Islamabad ’s irrelevance by attacking the border area at will .
It insults the sensibilities of a population that holds bin Laden in far greater esteem than the U.S. president .
It provokes the powerful Inter - Service Intelligence ( ISI ) , originally the creation of the CIA , once a close partner with the U.S. in the project of destroying the secular pro-Soviet state that existed in Afghanistan from 1978 to 1993 .
( The ISI , a power unto itself , is already annoyed that Afghanistan , where anti-Indian Kashmiri jihadis used to hone their skills in training camps , has been cozying up to India . )
Its embrace undermines any leader who seeks nationalist and religious credentials in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan .
“ There ’s potential to see more [ attacks on Pakistan ] , ” an unnamed U.S. official told the New York Times .
Who do these people think they ’re dealing with ?
It is one thing to ignore the government of Iraq , placed in power by the U.S. invasion , when it says no to a permanent U.S. military presence , U.S. forces ’ immunity from Iraqi law , or the privatization of Iraq ’s petroleum resources .
It ’s one thing to laugh at al - Maliki & Co. and say , “ Well , they do n’t mean that , ” confident that they ’ll eventually knuckle under .
It ’s another thing to suppose that the Pakistanis , when they say “ No , ” mean anything other than “ No ” and will simply burn with quiet resentment indefinitely as U.S. forces violate their sovereignty .
But that sort of insane arrogance stems naturally from the post 9 - 11 “ us vs. them ” mentality of U.S. leaders .
Not just the neocons , mind you , but the entire political mainstream .
Pakistan , these leaders will note , is not doing enough to prevent militants from crossing over the border to attack U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
One should respond to this assertion with the following points :
1. The U.S. is conflating Taliban and al - Qaeda forces .
But these are not the same thing .
( This is perhaps the most obvious but obviously neglected point of fact in the post 9 - 11 ear . )
The Taliban is an indigenous Afghan movement and –however unsavory –unquestionably enjoys a social base .
Al - Qaeda is a mostly Arab force rooted in the U.S. - sponsored anti-Soviet Mujahadeen of the 1980s .
2. Nobody in Afghanistan asked the U.S. to invade , bomb , or continue bombing Afghanistan for seven years .
Nor did the Pakistanis .
3 . The invasion and occupation of Afghanistan , against the advice and will of Pakistan , and the failure of that invasion to crush al - Qaeda , pushed al - Qaeda and Taliban forces into Pakistan .
It ’s likely the latter far outnumber the former .
4. Pakistan ’s government had never firmly controlled the frontier provinces or deployed large - scale military forces there in deference to the sensibilities of local tribes .
Washington , oblivious to Pakistan ’s realities , demanded that Islamabad suppress the al - Qaeda and Taliban forces that fled into the region .
In effect , it demanded that Pakistan clean up a mess that the U.S. invasion had created .
5. Pakistan ’s efforts to obey Washington have taken a terrible toll on the Pakistani Army , solidified local resistance to the central government , and in fact produced a Pakistani Taliban rooted in the local Pashtuns who identify with the Afghan Pashtuns and have no use for the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan drawn by colonialists who never consulted with them in drawing the map .
6 . Faced with the prospect of a general tribal - based rebellion , Islamabad has cut deals with local Taliban - linked groups .
Washington has expressed its disapproval , claiming such deals continue to allow militants to cross back and forth across the border attacking its forces and their allies in Afghanistan .
Washington is , in effect , asking Pakistan ’s government to risk civil war and its own collapse to prevent Afghans from attacking its forces in Afghanistan whose deployment Pakistan opposed in the first place .
7. Washington is saying to this nuclear power , Pakistan : “ You must obey ! ” And some in Pakistan are saying : “ You do not know this region .
You ’ve responded to 9 - 11 by lashing out in all directions , creating enemies you never had before .
You created this problem , our headache , in Waziristan and adjoining regions .
And you make it worse by saying that since we ’re not handling it to your satisfaction , you ’re going to start landing your troops in our villages , shooting on our civilians .
And you ’re expecting us to say , ‘ Ok , no problem , boss ? ’
You ’re crazy . ”
It is crazy , even for a cocky hyper - imperialist power , to manifest such arrogance and contempt .
Such attacks on Pakistan say to the Muslims of the world : “ You are the problem and we reserve the right to slaughter you , because back home , we have powerful politicians who respond to a mass base that thinks fighting you all is , as Sarah Palin put it , ‘ a task from God . ’
( USA !
USA ! USA ! USA !)
If you do n’t agree with our program to restructure your region , supporting our misogynistic fanatical Islamists in the Northern Alliance as opposed to the Taliban misogynistic fanatical Islamists you used to sponsor , we ’ll invade you and take care of the problem ourselves .
( USA !
USA ! USA ! USA !)
Get used to it .
It ’s not just the Bush crowd .
We ’ve got Obama on board now too .
We will strike Pakistani targets as we see fit .
Screw international law , which we invoke when it serves our needs and ignore when it might restrain us .
Nobody is allowed to cross any border to attack our brave Americans , no matter where we invade , or why .
Just accept that , world , and avoid our wrath .
( USA ! USA ! USA ! ) ”
That ’s indeed the message to Pakistan .
If there were a free press in this country , honest education and genuine discussion , the people would recoil in horror from the crimes committed in their name and the premises–largely lies–behind those crimes .
But we have none of that , just some posts on the internet .
The outlook is grim .
Text tattoos gaining popularity Fonts of wisdom make a statement on arms or backs that 's more than skin deep

Apoet with a laptop walks into a bar .
He orders a beer and begins scrolling Web sites of " literary tattoos . "
He sees a man 's back entirely inscribed with the first page of " Fight Club . "
The tattoo looks fresh , red and painful .
He sees a woman holding aside her hair to show the nape of her neck , where this line by e.e. cummings - " be of love a little more careful than of anything " - appears on her freckled flesh .
Then , with a sharp shock , he stops scrolling .
He has come upon his own words , inked on skin .
Many living writers might have just this experience , including Bay Area poet Robert Hass , the UC Berkeley professor of English , winner of this year 's National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for poetry , and former poet laureate of the United States .
On the Web site Contrariwise.org , this line from Hass ' poem " Meditation at Lagunitas " appears in blue script on a young woman 's arm : " Longing , we say , because desire is full of endless distances . "
San Francisco is a creative crucible for tattooing , piercing and other body art .
It was North Beach visionary V. Vale , of RE / Search Publications , who named the trend in his 1989 book , " Modern Primitives , " which the editors of the avant - garde North Beach publishing house called " an anthropological inquiry into a contemporary social enigma - the increasingly popular revival of ancient human decoration practices . "
Since then , tattoos have emerged from the underground .
In fact , they 're mainstream .
The styles are ever - evolving and , in recent years , " script " or text tattoos have gained in popularity .
" I 've noticed more and more people with a bit of Dickinson or Kafka or Nietzsche somewhere on their bodies , " said San Francisco poet Kim Addonizio .
" It 's natural that writers and literary readers would be drawn to commemorating some bit of language that has moved or changed them - or that maps a direction they want to go . "
She co-edited the 2002 book " Dorothy Parker 's Elbow : Tattoos on Writers , Writers on Tattoos , " a collection of work by Ray Bradbury , Sylvia Plath , Herman Melville , Flannery O'Connor , William T. Vollmann and others .
( The title refers to a tiny star on Parker 's arm . )
Message art form
Internationally known San Francisco tattoo artist and historian Lyle Tuttle attests to the popularity of " script or written - word " tattoos .
It makes sense .
" Tattooing is a message art form , " said Tuttle , who once inked a 135 - line poem on a chest .
" Tattoos are exterior decorations for interior feeling . "
A case in point is Beth Loster , 24 , a San Francisco writer and waitress who was a student at UC Berkeley when she met a young man who said , " Hey , we have tattoos in the same font . "
The text of her tattoo - " clad in the panoply of love " - came from " Science & Health " by Mary Baker Eddy .
" I like the way the written word looks on the body , " she said .
" And that phrase made me feel safe . "
His tattoo , also in a " typewriter " typeface , was in Latin .
( She ca n't recall the translation . )
The text of Loster 's next tattoo was written by that young man , who had become her boyfriend .
Before leaving for South America , where he was going to study , he left a note on her refrigerator that began , " this is on account of my loving you forever . "
That phrase - in the form of a tattoo - offered her comfort when he was killed in a car accident in Brazil .
" After he passed away , I got it for him , " Loster said .
The typeface is from one of the vintage manual typewriters she collects : " I typed it up and brought it in . "
Several years have passed , and she is asked about it nearly every day .
" I talk about his death more than I would normally , " she said .
" But that 's good .
It reminds me that something good happened and something bad happened and , somehow , it 's all OK . "
Acknowledging personal history is also the motivation behind the tattoos of Jon Woo , 29 , manager of a sports shoe shop in San Francisco .
Growing up in Pittsburgh , he got his first tattoo - of his last name , in Chinese , on his left shoulder - when he was 17 .
" At the time , tattoos were n't as widely accepted , " he said .
" I 've watched the progression as tattoos have gone from taboo - esque to mainstream . "
The one that sparks the most comment is a line on his arm , " As long as the world is turning and spinning , we 're going to be dizzy and we 're going to make mistakes , " by comic and author Mel Brooks .
" I have tripped and fallen and picked myself up so many times , " Woo said , explaining the tattoo 's significance .
" I wanted to get it somewhere where I could see it and others could see it . "
" It 's a statement to everybody , about my life , about everybody 's life .
People respect it , " he added .
" They read it and say , ' That 's so true , ' and it is . "
Michaela Healy , 22 , a cook in San Francisco , has been fascinated with tattoos since she was 10 years old , growing up in Encinitas , in San Diego County .
That 's when her older sister brought over a friend who had a tattoo of a huge tiki god on his shoulder .
" I saw him the day he got it , " she said .
Teenage tattoo
Before her 18th birthday , she got her own first tattoo - the name of her favorite band , the ska band No Doubt - on her upper back .
Since then , she 's gotten others , but the one that stands out artistically is a color rendering of the cover of her favorite comic serial , " Strangers in Paradise , " with art by Terry Moore .
" The cover tells the whole story of the book , " Healy said .
" Sex , drugs , government conspiracy , struggling with sexuality , mercenaries , assassins and , ultimately , love . "
She does n't mind being asked about her tattoos , which happens often .
" That 's OK , " she said .
" It 's half the reason I have them .
This is the art that I 've chosen to put out there . "
Illustrations from beloved books can have emotional power beyond words , as Ken Samuels , 44 , a San Francisco bookseller , will attest .
On both arms , he has tattoos of illustrations from his favorite children 's books , including Max from " Where the Wild Things Are , " Harold from " Harold and the Purple Crayon , " Peter from " The Snowy Day , " Thelonious Monk from " Mysterious Thelonious " and Ferdinand the Bull .
" These books made me love reading , " he said .
" I loved the characters ' persistence and creativity in the face of difficulties and their ultimately successful journeys home . "
Samuels did n't get his first tattoo until he was in his mid-30s .
" I became reacquainted with these books when my nephews were little boys , " he said , " and I got the tattoos in tribute to them and their future journeys into the world . "
Whether they inscribe themselves with words or illustrations , a good portion of San Francisco artists , book lovers and wordsmiths are likely to continue to find personal expression in tattoos .
Poet Addonizio - who has five tattoos , but no text yet - is discerning .
She is taking her time .
" As soon as I find the right words , " she said , " they 'll be inked somewhere on my skin . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge approved a revised version of British bank Barclays Plc ’s deal to purchase the core U.S. business of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .
In a Manhattan court hearing that started on Friday and lasted past midnight , U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck approved the sale , saying he had found no better alternative for the assets Lehman sought to sell .
“ This week more than any other week since I was appointed to the bench I have felt the awesome power of this job , ” Peck told a packed Manhattan court room , at the end of a nearly seven - hour hearing .
“ I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction , ” he said .
Earlier this week , Barclays agreed to buy Lehman ’s North American investment banking and capital markets businesses for about $ 1.75 billion after Lehman filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy case in history .
The deal was modified slightly in court on Friday , as lawyers for Lehman said the company ’s trading accounts had shrunk and appraisals for its property values , including Lehman ’s New York headquarters , had been less - than - expected .
The deal will save up to 10,000 jobs at Lehman Brothers U.S. unit , provide cash to fund operations while the rest of the company unwinds , and plans were underway to transfer customer accounts over the weekend .
Barclays has also said it could purchase more Lehman assets in other regions .
Lehman collapsed under the weight of toxic assets , mainly related to real estate , that are now worth only a fraction of their original prices .
NOT A PRECEDENT
The Lehman bankruptcy case is unprecedented in U.S. courts .
With more than $ 600 billion in pre-petition assets , it dwarfs the second - largest U.S. bankruptcy , WorldCom , whose 2002 bankruptcy had assets over $ 100 billion .

Peck said the case , in which the company ’s core assets were sold in less than a week , should not be viewed as a precedent for other Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases , which typically proceed in a slower , more methodical fashion .
“ This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I ’ve ever sat through , ” Peck said .
“ It can never be deemed precedent for future cases .
It ’s hard for me to imagine a similar emergency , ” he said .
Peck adjourned the courtroom to applause from the more than hundred people present .
In one of his last statements of the evening , he said “ Lehman Brothers became a victim , in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets and it saddens me , ” Peck said .
Luc Despins , a lawyer for the creditors committee , said the creditors were not objecting to the sale , but not supporting it either .
“ The reason we ’re not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative , ” Despins said , adding that they did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it .
However , the court hearing made clear that unwinding Lehman is a process that had only just begun .
CHALLENGES
Martin Flics , a lawyer for the joint administrators of the Lehman European Group told the court there may be challenges separating the two businesses which for many years “ have for many years operated as one , ” as they share various information technologies and client contracts .
Flics also asked Lehman ’s chief operating officer about $ 8 billion in transfers made from the European business to the U.S. business made on the Friday before it went bankrupt .
PricewaterhouseCoopers , the UK administrator for Lehman , submitted a declaration to the court on Friday saying it felt the transfers were “ potentially depriving them of billions of dollars in recoveries . ”
Lehman ’s lawyer Harvey Miller said that because administrators began the UK case prior to the U.S. Chapter 11 filing , the U.S. unit was unable to repay the sum .
Judge Peck said since the original deal had been modified so that $ 700 million in cash will no longer will be transferred to Barclays , the issue could be pursued at a later date .
Lawyers for Lehman brothers told the court that declines in the securities markets and collateral seizures from trading partners in the past few days had reduced the size of the deal .
In the revised deal , Barclays would absorb about $ 47.4 billion in securities and assume $ 45.5 billion in trading liabilities , attorneys said .
The original deal called for $ 72 billion in securities and $ 68 billion in trading liabilities .
Miller said the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $ 1.29 billion , including $ 960 million for Lehman ’s New York headquarters and $ 330 million for two New Jersey data centers .
Miller said Lehman ’s original estimate valued its headquarters at $ 1.02 billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at $ 900 million .
In other changes to the deal , Barclays will no longer purchase Lehman ’s Eagle Energy unit .
It will acquire entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc , Lehman Brothers Sudamerica , Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high net - worth individuals .
Lehman , however , will retain $ 20 billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays , they said .
The nationally televised U.S. vice - presidential debate Thursday night has become the most - watched in history , Nielsen Media Research reported Friday .
With 66.9 million U.S. viewers , the debate between Democratic vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden and his Republican opponent Sarah Palin handily beat the previous record of 56.7 million viewers .
That record was set in 1984 by Democratic vice - presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro , the first woman on a major - party ticket , and the Republican incumbent at the time , George Bush .
The audience tally for the Palin - Biden debate also easily eclipsed the 52.4 million viewers who tuned in for the first faceoff between presidential nominees Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama last Friday .
Two more presidential debates are scheduled for Oct. 7 and Oct. 15 .
Meanwhile , two national polls of Americans who watched the U.S. vice - presidential debate and are uncommitted voters showed that more of them thought Biden turned in the best performance .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey found 51 per cent of those polled after Thursday night 's debate in St. Louis , Mo. , said the Delaware senator did the best job , while 36 per cent said the same about the Alaska governor .
The survey of 611 adult Americans had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points .
Respondents said Palin —- who had to recover from some bumbling media interview performances —- was the more likable of the pair , scoring 54 per cent support , compared to Biden 's 36 per cent .
The Republican candidate also exceeded expectations , according to 84 per cent of the viewers who were surveyed .
CBS News and Knowledge Networks conducted a cross-country poll of 473 uncommitted voters who watched the debate and found 46 per cent said Biden won the debate , compared to 21 per cent for Palin .
Thirty - three per cent said it was a tie .
The margin of error for the sampling was plus or minus 5 percentage points .
The flash polls conducted by CBS and CNN reflected trends in overall opinion polls toward Obama conducted over the past couple of weeks .
Recent polls show Obama with a small but perceptible lead .
Before the vice - presidential debate , McCain had decided to pull out of Michigan , conceding the state to the Democrats .
Palin on the side of ' Joe six - packs '
U.S. media pundits said Palin returned to her folksy style in the debate , throwing in lines that included " you betcha . "
She told the audience she 's not a Washington insider , but is fighting for " hockey moms and Joe six - packs . "

' Biden is obviously better equipped to serve as V.P. with a proper understanding of what that role involves . '

She did n't always answer questions , but turned that into a point of pride , saying she may not be answering the way Biden or the moderator wanted to hear , but that " I 'm going to talk straight to the American people . "
Biden , who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 at age 29 , was described by media analysts as respectful of Palin , governor of Alaska since 2006 , as the two sparred over taxes , energy policy and the Iraq war .
He steered clear of any hint of condescension and instead focused on McCain 's record .
After the two met , Palin asked her opponent , " Hey , can I call you Joe ? ’’
Throughout the debate , Biden consistently referred to her as Gov. Palin .
Biden sought to make McCain out as a straight - ahead successor to an unpopular President George W. Bush .
" He voted four out of five times for George Bush 's budget , which put us a half - trillion dollars in debt and over $ 4 trillion in debt since he got here , " he said of McCain .
Palin merely accused Biden of reciting the past rather than looking to the future .
" Americans are cravin ' that straight talk " that McCain offers , she said .
Biden calls Cheney ' dangerous '
When the question came to the powers of the job they both seek , Biden accused current Vice - President Dick Cheney of believing himself part of the legislative branch of the U.S. government .
" Vice - President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice - president we ’ve had probably in American history , ’’ Biden said .
Both candidates offered stories of their personal lives and struggles .
Palin told the country that being a mom , and being concerned about one son in Iraq and a special needs child at home , she understands worries about tuition bills and health insurance .
" We know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay out - of - pocket for health care , ’’ she said .
Biden said he , too , has known hardship and became emotional when recalling the death of his first wife and infant daughter in a car crash in 1972 .
" The notion that somehow , because I ’m a man , I do n’t know what it ’s like to raise two kids alone , ’’ he said , " [ that ] I do n’t know what it ’s like to have a child you ’re not sure is going to — is going to make it — I understand . ’’
He appeared to be fighting tears as he spoke .

The giant 8ft Lego man who washed up on the beach
At 8ft tall and wearing a garish green jersey he's not the sort of chap to get lost down the sofa .
In fact , you 'd think he was unlikely to get lost at all .
But someone ( possibly someone big ) , somewhere is missing a key bit of their Lego set .
The colourful character mysteriously washed up on Brighton beach yesterday spawning dozens of tales - soon to become local legend - about where he may have come from .
Stand - up comedy : Bemused children heave the brightly coloured figure upright
While some believe he floated from Denmark - where there is a Legoland park ) , others suggest he toppled off a ship .
Of course , there 's always the cynical possibility he 's part of a publicity stunt .
Resident Gerry Turner , 34 , said : ' It 's very odd .
God knows how it got here but people are saying it's from Holland because it 's got some Dutch writing on it .
' It must have fallen off a boat of something .
The kids love it .'
Children who helped stand the Lego man up on the beach were desperately curious about where it came from .
One said : ' It 's great , but we do n't know why it 's here . '

The giant Lego man lies where he washed up on Brighton beach
A spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said town hall officials had no idea of the origin of the Lego man , but added that they saw no difficulty in letting it stay on the beach where it washed up .
He said : ' There 's no problem at all .
It will be interesting to see how long the Lego man stays there for .
We 'll keep an eye on it . '
But Lego was insistent : ' We 're bemused .
He has nothing to do with us . '
The Lego giant 's arrival on the East Sussex shingle yesterday morning comes two years after an armada of plastic ducks landed on British shores .
Borne on the ocean currents , the ducks had made a 17,000 - mile odyssey from the Pacific where they had been washed from a container ship in a 1992 storm .

It ’s a case of really bad timing .
John McCain ’s campaign put out yet another slashing anti-Obama ad on Monday morning that accused Barack Obama of being part of “ the corrupt Chicago machine . ”
The evidence ?
William Daley , an Obama policy adviser , is a lobbyist and brother to the mayor of Chicago .
( He also was commerce secretary during the Clinton years . )
The ad goes on to note that Obama ’s “ money man ” is Tony Rezko , a convicted felon–making the disgraced developer sound like Obama ’s main fundraiser , which he was not .
The ad also declares that “ his governor , Rod Blagojevich ” has “ a legacy of federal and state investigations . ”
His governor ?
Well , that ’s true , since Obama is a resident of Illinois .
But this is guilt by association .
Under such a standard , Obama could run an ad saying , “ John McCain–part of a corrupt political machine .
His fellow Republican legislator in Arizona–indicted for money laundering . ”
( That would be Rick Renzi , who was cochairman of McCain ’s 2008 presidential campaign in Arizona . )
In response to this ad , Obama spokesman Bill Burton issued a statement : “ Barack Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate as an independent Democrat .
He took on the Chicago Democratic organization in a primary to win a seat in the US Senate .
And in both Illinois and Washington , he has challenged the Old Guard for landmark ethics reforms . ”
But , more to the point , the ad came out the morning The New York Times reported that McCain ’s campaign manager was paid nearly $ 2 million for running a Washington outfit set up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to stop stricter regulation of these two entities .
Talk about the corrupt Washington machine .
McCain ’s right hand was one of its major players .
Yet McCain accuses Obama of being part of a corrupt system .
No doubt , Davis approved that message .
On the morning of November 2 , 1859 — Election Day — George Kyle , a merchant with the Baltimore firm of Dinsmore & Kyle , left his house with a bundle of ballots tucked under his arm .
Kyle was a Democrat .
As he neared the polls in the city ’s Fifteenth Ward , which was heavily dominated by the American Party , a ruffian tried to snatch his ballots .
Kyle dodged and wheeled , and heard a cry : his brother , just behind him , had been struck .
Next , someone clobbered Kyle , who drew a knife , but did n’t have a chance to use it .
“ I felt a pistol put to my head , ” he said .
Grazed by a bullet , he fell .
When he rose , he drew his own pistol , hidden in his pocket .
He spied his brother lying in the street .
Someone else fired a shot , hitting Kyle in the arm .
A man carrying a musket rushed at him .
Another threw a brick , knocking him off his feet .
George Kyle picked himself up and ran .
He never did cast his vote .
Nor did his brother , who died of his wounds .
The Democratic candidate for Congress , William Harrison , lost to the American Party ’s Henry Winter Davis .
Three months later , when the House of Representatives convened hearings into the election , whose result Harrison contested , Davis ’s victory was upheld on the ground that any “ man of ordinary courage ” could have made his way to the polls .
The founders did n’t anticipate that voting would be done in secret .
Illustration by Arnold Roth
Voting in America , it ’s fair to say , used to be different .
“ Are you not a man in the full vigor of manhood and strength ? ” a member of the House Committee on Elections asked another Harrison supporter who , like Kyle , went to the polls but turned back without voting ( and who happened to stand six feet and weigh more than two hundred pounds ) .
The hearings established a precedent .
“ To vacate an election , ” an election - law textbook subsequently advised , “ it must clearly appear that there was such a display of force as ought to have intimidated men of ordinary firmness . ”
What was at stake , in the House Committee on Elections , was whether men like George Kyle were too easily daunted .
What was n’t at stake was that Kyle , an ordinary voter , carried with him to the polls a bundle of ballots .
Nowhere in the United States in 1859 did election officials provide ballots .
Kyle , like everyone else , brought his own .
The ballots he carried , preprinted “ party tickets , ” endorsed the slate of Democratic candidates , headed by Harrison .
Voters got their ballots either from a partisan , at the polls , or at home , by cutting them out of the newspaper .
Then they had to cross through the throngs to climb a platform placed against the wall of a building ( voters were n’t allowed inside ) and pass their ballots through a window and into the hands of an election judge .
This was no mean feat , and not only in Baltimore .
In the middle decades of the nineteenth century , eighty - nine Americans were killed at the polls during Election Day riots .
The reform that ended this unsettling state of affairs was imported from Australia , and was not achieved in the United States until the eighteen - nineties .
The American adoption of the “ Australian ballot ” — and the radical idea that governments should provide ballots — was hard fought .
It lies , if long forgotten , behind every argument about how we ought to vote now , from the 2002 Help America Vote
Act ’s promotion of paperless voting to the more recent backlash , favoring a paper trail .
And it is also , like every other American election reform , a patch upon a patch .
The United States was founded as an experiment in eighteenth - century republicanism , in which it was understood that only men with property would vote , and publicly , since they were the only people who could be trusted to vote with the commonweal , and not private gain , in mind .
What went on in 1859 was something altogether different : voting was still public , but all white men could vote , and nearly seventy per cent of them managed to do so in the congressional elections that year , pistols and fisticuffs notwithstanding .
From an eighteenth - century point of view , how we vote now looks even stranger .
Casting a ballot remains the defining act of American citizenship .
But , especially since the election of 2000 , with its precariously hanging chad , many people worry that voting in America is a shambles and even a sham , that the machinery of our democracy is broken , crippled by confusing , illegible , and deceptive ballots ; vote - counting devices either rickety and outdated or new , gimmicky , and untested but , in any case , unreliable and by no means tamperproof ; and a near total absence of national standards and federal oversight .
In this fall ’s Presidential election , every citizen who is eighteen or older — except , in some states , prisoners and felons — will be eligible to vote .
Somewhat more than half of us will turn up .
We wo n’t be clobbered , stabbed , or shot .
We will not have to bring our own ballots .
We will insist that how we vote be secret .
The founders did n’t plan for this .
No one planned for it .
There is no plan .
It ’s patches all the way down .
Americans used to vote with their voices — viva voce — or with their hands or with their feet .
Yea or nay .
Raise your hand .
All in favor of Jones , stand on this side of the town common ; if you support Smith , line up over there .
In the colonies , as in the mother country , casting a vote rarely required paper and pen .
The word “ ballot ” comes from the Italian ballotta , or little ball , and a ballot often was a ball , or at least something ballish , like a pea or a pebble , or , not uncommonly , a bullet .
Colonial Pennsylvanians commonly voted by tossing beans into a hat .
Paper voting was n’t meant to conceal anyone ’s vote ; it was just easier than counting beans .
Our forebears considered casting a “ secret ballot ” cowardly , underhanded , and despicable ; as one South Carolinian put it , voting secretly would “ destroy that noble generous openness that is characteristick of an Englishman . ”
In 1634 , the governor of Massachusetts was elected “ by papers ” for the first time ; thirteen years later , a Bay Colony law dictated voting “ by wrighting the names of the persons Elected . ”
But , outside learned , literate New England , this would have been entirely impractical .
Only very slowly did voting by paper grow common enough that the word “ ballot ” came to mean not a ball but a piece of paper .
Well after American independence , elections remained widely the stuff of corn and beans and hands and feet .
The Constitution , drafted in 1787 , left the conduct of elections up to the states : “ The times , places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives , shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations . ”
Further than this limited federal oversight the framers would not go .
And even this needed James Madison ’s insistence , during the Constitutional Convention , that “ it was impossible to foresee all the abuses ” that states might make of unimpeded power over the conduct of elections .
With the exception of Benjamin Franklin , who anticipated Malthus , the nation ’s founders could scarcely have imagined that the population of the United States , less than four million in 1790 , would increase tenfold by 1870 .
Nor did they prophesy the party system .
Above all , they could not have fathomed universal suffrage .
In the first Presidential election , only six per cent of Americans were eligible to vote .
And these men did n’t elect George Washington ; they voted only for delegates to the Electoral College , an institution established to further restrain the popular will .
( The original proposal , at the Constitutional Convention , was for the President to be elected by Congress , called , in the debates , the “ national legislature . ”
A motion “ to strike out ‘ National Legislature ’ & insert ‘ citizens of U.S. ’ ” was defeated , with only Franklin ’s Pennsylvania dissenting .
It was all but inconceivable that the people , even given limited suffrage , would elect the President directly .
The election of the President by Congress , however , violated the separation of powers .
The Electoral College , proposed after the defeat of the motion for direct election , was an illbegotten compromise . )
“ Hey , I ’m Whatever Man . I possess vast powers of indifference . ”

The states , left to their own devices , adopted electoral methods best described as higgledy - piggledy , except that everyone agreed that Election Day ought to be a public holiday , involving plenty of stumping , debating , and parading .
Some of the original state constitutions make mention of voting by ballot ; some do n’t .
The framers of New York ’s 1777 constitution , wondering whether “ voting at elections by ballot would tend more to preserve the liberty and equal freedom of the people than voting viva voce , ” proposed a “ fair experiment ” with paper .
In 1802 , Ohio required voting by ballot in “ all elections . ”
By no means , however , did paper voting become universal .
The citizens of Kentucky voted viva voce until 1891 .
Early paper voting was , to say the least , a hassle .
You had to bring your own ballot , a scrap of paper .
You had to ( a ) remember and ( b ) know how to spell the name of every candidate and office .
If “ John Jones ” was standing for election , and you wrote “ Jon Jones , ” your vote could be thrown out .
( If you doubt how difficult this is , try it .
I disenfranchise myself at “ Comptroller . ” )
Shrewd partisans began bringing prewritten ballots to the polls , and handing them out with a coin or two .
Doling out cash — the money came to be called “ soap ” — was n’t illegal ; it was getting out the vote .
The eighteenth century ’s experiment in republicanism gradually gave way to the unruly exuberance of nineteenth - century democracy .
New states entering the union adopted constitutions without any property qualifications for voting , putting pressure on older states to eliminate those restrictions .
As suffrage expanded — by the time Andrew Jackson was elected President , in 1828 , nearly all white men could vote — scrap voting had become a travesty , not least because the newest members of the electorate , poor men and immigrants , were the least likely to know how to write .
Political parties , whose rise to power was made possible by the rise of the paper ballot , stepped in .
Party leaders began to print ballots , often in newspapers : either long strips , listing an entire slate , or pages meant to be cut in pieces , one for each candidate .
At first , this looked to be illegal .
In 1829 , a Boston man named David Henshaw tried to cast as his ballot a sheet of paper on which were printed the names of fifty - five candidates .
Election officials refused to accept it .
Henshaw sued , arguing that he had been disenfranchised .
When the case was heard before the state ’s Supreme Court , the decision turned on whether casting a printed ballot violated a clause in the state ’s 1780 constitution , requiring a written one .
“ It probably did not occur to the framers of the constitution , ” the Court observed , in a landmark ruling in Henshaw ’s favor , “ that many of the towns might become so populous as to make it convenient to use printed votes . ”
The Massachusetts constitution , only fifty years old , had already been outpaced by the times .
Printed ballots came to be called “ party tickets , ” because they looked like train tickets ( which is why , when we talk about someone who votes a single - party slate , we say that he “ votes the party ticket ” ) .
The printing on ballots of a party symbol , like the Free Soilers ’ man-pushing - a- plow , meant that voters did n’t need to know how to write , or even to read .
Not surprisingly , the ticket system consolidated the power of the major parties .
Curiously , it promoted insurgency , too : party malcontents could “ bolt , ” or print their own ballots , listing an alternate slate of candidates ; they could “ knife ” a candidate by stacking up a pile of tickets and slicing out his name ; and they could distribute “ pasters , ” strips of paper printed with the name of a candidate not on the party ticket , to be pasted over that of his opponent .
( For this , polls were stocked with vats of paste . )
Undeniably , party tickets led to massive fraud and intimidation .
A candidate had to pay party leaders a hefty sum to put his name on the ballot and to cover the costs of printing tickets , buying votes , and hiring thugs , called “ shoulder - strikers , ” to tussle with voters .
To make sure all that soap was paying off , ballots grew bigger , and more colorful , so bright - colored that even “ vest - pocket voters ” — men who went to the polls with their ballots crammed into their pockets — could barely hide their votes .
But wanting to hide those votes began to seem eminently reasonable to reformers both in the United States and in Britain , where suffrage had also been expanding .
In 1830 , the Scottish Benthamite James Mill argued for a secret ballot in order to curb the influence of landlords upon their tenants and factory owners upon their workers .
The next year , Maine required that all ballots be printed on the same color paper , to protect voters trying to cast minority ballots in a polling place besieged by rowdy members of the majority .
It did n’t do much good .
What honest man was ashamed of his vote ?
The secret ballot , the Virginian John Randolph insisted , “ would make any nation a nation of scoundrels , if it did not find them so . ”
In 1851 , a Massachusetts legislature dominated by Free Soilers and Democrats mandated the use of envelopes , to be supplied by the Secretary of State .
That did n’t do much good , either .
“ To say that the citizen shall vote with a sealed bag , or not at all , ” critics argued , “ is an act of despotism . ”
In 1853 , when the Massachusetts legislature changed hands , the new majority made envelopes optional , having accepted the argument that it was its duty to give every citizen the right “ to vote as his fathers did , with an open ballot . ”
By the time the House Committee on Elections investigated the contested 1859 Baltimore congressional election , jostling and brawling at the polls were to be expected and endured .
( Women were not enfranchised until the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment , in 1920 , although , as suffragettes argued , maybe if women had been allowed to vote earlier , Election Day would have been marked by more decorum . )
“ Were the voters of the 11th ward men of ordinary courage ? ” a committee member asked a Baltimorean who had only this honest answer : “ Men of ordinary courage , extraordinary courage , and some with no courage at all . ”

The Indiana Supreme Court on Friday , voting 3 - 2 , rejected to grant the GOP request to shutdown three early voting sites in Democratic cities of Gary , Hammond and East Chicago .
Their closing would have put in jeopardy many residents right to vote .
Special Judge Diane Kavadias
Schneider citied that many residents would not be able to travel to Crown Point to vote early and she also acknowledged that safeguards had been put in place , such as , state law requiring a photo identification to fight voter fraud .
Republican attorneys had wanted the high court to take the case directly , with both sides submitting arguments next week .
Republicans argue the voting centers increase the risk of voter fraud and that state law only allows one such voting center – at the clerk ’s main office in the county seat of Crown Point – unless both parties agree to additional locations .
The case has taken on racial overtones , with some Democrats questioning whether Republicans were trying to suppress votes by minorities likely to favor Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
Indiana has not chosen a Democrat for president since 1964 , but recent polls have shown Obama about even with or leading Republican John McCain .
Democrats applauded the Supreme Court decision .
“ The courts have been very clear in ruling on the side of the voters , ” state Democratic Party spokeswoman Lauren Smith said .
“ It ’s all about having an open , honest and fair election .
Let ’s get this election back on track and focused on the voters . ”
With all the new restrictions passed in Indiana the likelihood of voter fraud is slim .
This is very good news for the voters of Indiana and will allow the elderly also , a better chance to cast their ballots .
Update :
An appeals court later agreed to expedite the case and set oral arguments for five days before the general election .
Indiana Court of Appeals , which set oral arguments for Oct. 30 .
Attorney James Wieser , who earlier saw the high court ’s decision as a victory for his clients including Democrats , the Indiana NAACP and several unions , was surprised by the Court of Appeals action .

Warns that a panic atmosphere is intentionally being nurtured to get bill passed
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , Oct 3 , 2008
A Democratic Congressman has warned that a panic atmosphere is being intentionally created in order to get the financial bailout billed passed , further stating that several members of Congress were told before Monday ’s vote that martial law will be instigated in America if the legislation fails .
Congressman Brad Sherman of California ’s 27th congressional district told the House in a speech yesterday evening that he personally knew of several Congressional representatives who have said they were threatened with the prospect of all out martial law should they vote in opposition to the $ 700 billion bailout .
Sherman essentially intimated that powerful forces who want the bill passed have attempted to blackmail elected representatives .
“ The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere .
That atmosphere is not justified . ”
Sherman stated .
“ Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall , the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day , another couple of thousand the second day , and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no . ”
The Congressman continued .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ That ’s what I call fear mongering .
Unjustified .
Proven wrong .
We ’ve got a week , we ’ve got two weeks to write a good bill .
The only way to pass a bad bill is to keep the panic pressure on . ”
Sherman urged .
Watch Rep. Sherman speaking in the House yesterday :
Watch Rep. Sherman ’s full speech at CSPAN .
Sherman has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1997 and also serves on the Committee on Financial Services along with Texas Congressman Ron Paul .
On the Eve of a second Congressional vote on the legislation , these revelations show that freedom in America is under direct attack .
The Congress should instigate an immediate investigation into these serious allegations to uncover which private individuals and administration officials , if any , are involved with directly threatening a military takeover of the workings of the U.S. government .
( Article continues below )
Sherman ’s comments follow those of Rep. Michael Burgess ( R - TX ) , who warned Monday that the only information he had received about the bailout was what talking points to use on the American people and that he had been thrown out of meetings for not blindly supporting the bill .
Ominously , Burgess also commented , “ Mr. Speaker I understand we are under Martial Law as declared by the speaker last night . ”
Rep .
Burgess appeared on the Alex Jones show earlier this week to discuss his comments .
Subscribers , listen here .
However , it must be stressed that the definition of martial law that Congressman Sherman is referring to is the full blown military suspension of the normal administration of justice , while rep .
Burgess was referring to the temporary suspension of the rules and procedures of Congress by its leaders so that a bill can be passed quickly .
Sherman ’s allegations of threats against elected representatives have also been echoed by outspoken political activist Lyndon LaRouche who told an audience “ There are those in high positions who know that if they do n’t allow this bill to pass , that there are people behind the Bush Administration who will force them to pass it or kill them … ” .
LaRouche stated that well placed sources had told him that the use of armed troops to enforce the passage of the bill is “ reality ” .

Sex is an expensive and risky business .
It steals time and drains precious nutrient resources .
And each act of reproduction runs the risk of messing up carefully crafted genetic blueprints .
So why do we do it ?
The answer might seem obvious to you .
But it 's not so clear to biologists who consider that despite a logical alternative -- asexual reproduction by simple cloning without the help of a partner -- sex is preferred in the wild .
Asexuality , which came first , is seen in plants that send out underground runners and flatworms which , when cut in half , grow a new head on one half and a new tail on the other .
Some microbes and fungi lean this way , too , and have since life began .
Scientists do n't know how sex even got started .
But they have long suspected that organisms prefer sex specifically because of the risk .
The slight shuffling of genes produced through sexual reproduction may help organisms adapt more easily to a stressful or changing environment , the thinking goes .
Belief is not the basis of conclusions , however .
A new study using genetically modified yeast helps to settle the question : Sex is indeed beneficial .
The experiment pitted a strain of yeast that reproduces sexually against a modified , asexual version of the same strain .
Each grew and reproduced at the same rate , said Matthew Goddard of the University of Auckland .
Then Goddard and his colleagues raised the stakes , providing less food to the little critters .
Under these conditions , those engaging in the ultimate act still managed a growth rate of 94 percent whereas the asexual strain only reached 80 percent .
Sexual organisms seem fit to survive .
The research is detailed in the March 31 issue of Nature .
There are shortcomings in the study .
For one , it does not reveal why sexual organisms are hardier in stressful conditions .
And it fails to explain why the burden of sexual reproduction differs so much between males and females .
Not only do females spend more time and energy developing and raising offspring , in most cases , but their sex cells are significantly more expensive to make compared to a male's .
" We are sill far from a definitive answer to the question of why sexual reproduction is so common , " Rolf Hoekstra of Wageningen University wrote in a review of the study also published in the journal .
Sexual Leftovers
Preposterous presidential playboy Nicolas Sarkozy is not amused by a voodoo doll of himself for sale in French bookshops , and has demanded the pernicious pin-based product is pulled from the shelves , er , post - haste .
The dolls , according to the Times ( which displays a lovely picture ) , are being sold along with a handy set of pins and an amusing guide to slapping a curse on the president .
20,000 are available at the moment .
Sarko , who now has time and funds on his hands having solved all of France 's social and financial problems and personally given every citizen a biscuit , is threatening to sue the product publishers K&B for unauthorised use of his image .
The stack - heeled statesman has been busily flinging around expensive legal bitchslaps for some time in the name of protecting his image , with the inevitable result that even more mischievous souls feel the urge to rip the proverbial out of the silly man , and the whole idiotic circle of bad pointlessness begins again .
One Yaël Rolognese , a " witchcraft specialist " ( ie a bloke with a clever idea ) is responsible for the latest abomination , which is intended to be satirical ( what 's the French for " duhhh " ? ) .
Similarly humourless is Sarko's hair - swishingly glamorous one - time opponent Ségolène Royal , who has also been immortalised in voodoo poppet form and is considering legal action too .
K&B is having none of it though , and despite the presidential order to get that crap out of circulation sharpish is standing its ground , considering it “ totally disproportionate given the humorous aspect of the project and the fact that Nicolas Sarkozy and Ségolène Royal are political , public figures ” .
You could pick up your very own Sarko - doll here , but if you feel others are more deserving of your cursing , you could always hex the politician or other hate figure of your choice with this handy voodoo - mail deelie .
In other news , a UK publisher has jumped on the bandwagon with a realistic voodoo doll of Peter Mandelson .
" We 've already sold out in pre-order , " enthused a spokesperson .
" One buyer seemed keen to get as many as he could , ' just in case ' .
We 're still not sure what he meant . " ®

In addition , the hurricane may affect the tone of the NBC show ’s season premiere , which will be hosted by Olympian Michael Phelps .
“ If it ’s serious , it will change everything for us , ” the show ’s creator and producer Lorne Michaels told Politco on Friday .
“ The tone of the show will shift , and it would be inappropriate for the senator to do if it looks in any way like it ’s going to be a tragedy . ”
Story of Joe the Plumber springs many leaks
That 's not his name or his craft , and he owes taxes to Ohio
Forget

A couple of things about Joe the Plumber , the icon of the authentic working - class voter who was declared the " winner " of the final presidential debate .
His first name is n't really Joe .
It 's Samuel .
He 's not really a plumber - at least , not a licensed one .
He 's concerned about increased taxes - but has n't paid his own income taxes .
And he 's not exactly just a guy from Ohio .
He 's lived in Arizona ... and Alaska .
And as for that unscripted moment that ended up on Fox News , the one at a rally where he questioned Sen.
Barack Obama about the American Dream - and whether he'd have to pay higher taxes under Obama 's plan ?
Seems Joe , who is actually Samuel J. Wurzelbacher , told the conservative Web site familysecuritymatters.org that catching the Democratic presidential candidate off guard " was actually my intent . "
" Looks like there 's a crack in Joe the Plumber 's story , " said Bob Mulholland , the Democratic party activist and adviser , after some details of Wurzelbacher 's life emerged Thursday .
In an election that has starred all sorts of celebrities - remember Paris Hilton ?
Britney Spears ?
- Wurzelbacher got his 15 minutes of fame after being referenced 26 times during Wednesday 's presidential debate , 21 times by Sen. John McCain .
On Thursday , McCain even happily declared " Joe the Plumber " to be " the winner " of the debate .
Not so fast .
" Joe the Plumber 's story sprang a few leaks Thursday , " said an Associated Press story .
That 's after the AP , bloggers , investigators and librarians - and The Chronicle - turned up court documents and birth records .
For one , Wurzelbacher 's expressed concern about paying more taxes looked a bit tarnished with the revelation that he owes Ohio about $ 1,200 in personal income taxes , according to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas records .
And there 's a 2007 civil filing that shows a record for a $ 1,200 owed to a creditor , St. Charles Mercy Hospital .
So Wurzelbacher has an active lien on his property filed in January 2007 , records from the Ohio Department of Taxation show .
The Toledo Blade , examining Lucas County Building Inspection records , reported that his employer , the A.W. Newell Corp. , " does maintain a state plumbing license , and one with the City of Toledo , but would not be allowed to work in Lucas County outside of Toledo without a county license . "
" Mr. Wurzelbacher said he works under Al Newell 's license , but according to Ohio building regulations , he must maintain his own license to do plumbing work , " the newspaper said .
" He is also not registered to operate as a plumber in Ohio - which means he 's not a plumber . "
What else did Americans learn about Wurzelbacher this week ?
Among the factoids gleaned from state and county records :
--
He is registered as a Republican , and voted in the state 's GOP primary in March , county elections records show .
But he was previously registered , dating back to 2007 , in the Natural Law Party .
--
He has lived in McCain 's home state of Arizona - in both Mesa and Tucson .
--
He lived in GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's home state of Alaska - in North Pole , from September 1992 to July 1993 .
And as comic Bill Maher pointed out , in his 15 minutes of fame , Wurzelbacher has already done more interviews than Palin .

World 's richest got even richer last year : report Reuters
Published : Thursday September 4 , 2008
Print This Email This By Joseph A. Giannone
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The old saying holds true :
The rich do get richer .
Even as world financial markets broke down last year , personal wealth around the world grew 5 percent to $ 109.5 trillion , according to a global wealth report released on Thursday by Boston Consulting Group .
It was the sixth consecutive year of expanding wealth .
The fastest growth was among households in developing regions , such as China and the Gulf States and among families who were already rich .
That wealth also is increasingly concentrated among the richest .
The top 1 percent of all households owned 35 percent of the world 's wealth last year .
Meanwhile , the top 0.001 percent , ultra - rich households holding at least $ 5 million in assets , commanded $ 21 trillion -- a fifth of the world 's wealth .
The planet also continues to mint new millionaires rapidly .
The biggest jumps in 2007 came from emerging countries in Asia and Latin America .
Overall , the number of millionaire households grew 11 percent to 10.7 million last year .
BCG notes that , while the rich are still rich , they have been making some adjustments as a result of the financial crisis .
This year , assets are being shifted to more conservative investments , more money is being kept onshore in home markets and some individuals have curtailed new investment .
Yet BCG cautioned the outlook for wealth markets and the banks who serve them , is dimmed by the current financial crisis .
North American personal wealth growth slowed to 3.8 percent last year , compared with 9 percent in 2006 , reflecting the the mortgage crisis and the onset of the credit crunch last summer .
" The financial crisis continue to cast a pall over established wealth markets , " said Victor Aerni , a Zurich based partner who coauthored the report .
BCG , which advises banks and wealth managers , forecasts personal wealth will continue growing , but at a slower pace .
This year , with Wall Street suffering through one of its worst slumps in decades , growth in assets is expected to rise less than 1 percent .
Things will improve over the next five years , BCG said , with personal wealth growing more than 3 percent annually -- well off the 8.5 percent set between 2002 and 2007 .
Wealth is growing at much faster rates among the rest of the world .
Households in Asia , the Pacific Rim excluding Japan and Latin America saw the greatest growth , with wealth rising 14 percent .
That growth was fueled by manufacturing in Asia and commodities in Latin America and the Middle East , as well as more currency and political stability .
BCG observed that banks , brokerages and money managers will have little choice , but to expand their presence in these fast growing centers .
Dubai and Singapore , the firm said , are becoming regional private banking centers offering greater competition to traditional havens such as Switzerland .

OpenID is one of those web technologies I would love to love : it addresses a need , seems pretty well thought - out , and all the cool kids are doing it .
But the fact is , it ’s still a bit too hard for what it ’s trying to be .
When I first heard about OpenID , I read about it , and did n’t quite get it .
People kept talking about it , so I kept going back to read about it , and it still mystified me .
Big players started adopting it ( AOL , Yahoo ) , so it seemed like it was here to stay , but I still did n’t have the incentive to get over the learning curve .
Earlier this week I visited yet another site that encouraged me to get an OpenID , and I decided I would finally cross OpenID off my list of technologies I should at least understand and probably use .
The simplest way to use OpenID is to pick a provider like Yahoo , go to their OpenID page , and enable your Yahoo account to be an OpenID .
This in itself was a little complicated , because when I was done , I got to a page that showed me my “ OpenID identifiers ” , which had one item in it :
https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-
What !?
What is that , what do I do with it ?
Am I supposed to paste that into OpenID fields on other sites ?
Are you kidding me ?
Also , in the text on that page is a stern warning :
This step is completely optional .
After you choose an identifier , you can not edit or delete it .
( Emphasis theirs ) .
So now I have a mystifying string of junk , with a big warning all over it that I ca n’t go back .
“ This step ” claims it ’s optional , but I seem to have already done it !
Now I ’m afraid , and I ’m a technical person — you expect my wife to do this ?
Luckily I can choose to enable other identifiers , so I also enable my flickr account as an OpenID .
Since I am a technical person , I ’ve learned that OpenID supports delegation .
That ’s a way to have your website act as an OpenID simply by adding some HTML to your page .
The HTML points to another OpenID behind the scenes .
That way , I can use nedbatchelder.com as my OpenID , and later be able to change who is actually hosting my OpenID .
Simon Willison shows the simple way to delegate your OpenID on your home page .
You need the id you just got from your provider , and you need a URL for the provider ’s server .
Oh , bad news :
Yahoo wo n’t say what their server ’s URL is .
I ca n’t delegate to Yahoo .
Why ?
Do n’t know .
Time to get another provider .
So I go to a more savvy provider , get an ID and a delegate server URL , edit my page , and I ca n’t log in to my desired site .
I must have messed something up .
A good debugging tool for this is to log in to jyte.com .
Since it was built by JanRain , the company behind a lot of OpenID , they helpfully provide very geeky error messages if the OpenID login fails for some reason .
Turns out I had omitted one place in the HTML that I had to put my user id .
Once I fixed that , all was well .
But what have I really gained ?
Ted Dziuba exuberantly rants about OpenID , since it is why he hates the Internet , and his points are accurate : OpenID is still really difficult , and does n’t gain you that much .
Stefan Brands rounds up lots of issues with OpenID , and I think they need to be taken seriously .
OpenID may be one of those Internet technologies that will be fabulous among the savvy and well - intentioned , but falters when spread to the wider population on the web .
WASHINGTON 
In the aftermath of two major terrorist attacks on Western targets , America 's counterterrorism community is warning that Al Qaeda may launch more overseas operations to influence the presidential elections in November .
Click Image to Enlarge AAMIR QURESHI / AFP / Getty A Pakistani army soldier stands guard by the devastated Marriott Hotel following an overnight suicide bombing at Islamabad on September 21 , 2008 .
Call it Osama bin Laden 's " October surprise . "
In late August , during the weekend between the Democratic and Republican conventions , America 's military and intelligence agencies intercepted a series of messages from Al Qaeda 's leadership to intermediate members of the organization asking local cells to be prepared for imminent instructions .
An official familiar with the new intelligence said the message was picked up in multiple settings , from couriers to encrypted electronic communications to other means .
" These are generic orders , " the source said  a distinction from the more specific intelligence about the location , time , and method of an attack .
" It was , ' Be on notice .
We may call upon you soon . '
It was sent out on many channels . "
Also , Yemen 's national English - language newspaper is reporting that a spokesman for Yemen 's Islamic Jihad , the Qaeda affiliate that claimed credit for last week 's American embassy bombing in Sa'naa , is now publicly threatening to attack foreigners and high government officials if American and British diplomats do not leave the country .
Mr. bin Laden has sought to influence democratic elections in the past .
On March 11 , 2004 , Al Qaeda carried out a series of bombings on Madrid commuter trains .
Three days later , the opposition and anti-Iraq war Socialist Workers Party was voted into power .
In the week before the 2004 American presidential election , Mr. bin Laden recorded a video message to the American people promising repercussions if President Bush were re-elected .
In later messages , Al Qaeda 's leader claimed credit for helping elect Mr. Bush in 2004 .
Last year in Pakistan , Qaeda assassins claimed the life of Benazir Bhutto , a former prime minister who returned to her native country in a bid for re-election .
" There is an expectation that Al Qaeda will try to influence the November elections by attempting attacks globally , " a former Bush and Clinton White House counterterrorism official , Roger Cressey , said yesterday .
Mr. Cressey said Al Qaeda lacks the capability to pull off an attack in the continental United States , however .
" It would likely be a higher Al Qaeda tempo of attacks against U.S. and allied targets abroad , " he said .
At a talk at the Washington Institute for Near East Affairs on August 12 , the national intelligence officer for transnational threats said he expected to see more threat reporting on Al Qaeda as America approaches the November elections .
The terrorist attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on Saturday was a particular blow to the allied effort against Al Qaeda .
The hotel 's lobby in recent years served as a meeting place for the CIA and Pakistanis who would not risk being seen at the American Embassy .
The bombing , which targeted one of the most heavily fortified locations in Pakistan 's capital , will likely claim close to 100 lives after the dead are pulled from the rubble .
President Zardari , who had just given his first major address as Pakistan 's head of state , on fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda , was the target of Saturday 's attack , the vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , Daveed Gartenstein - Ross , said .
" He was expected to attend the iftar dinner at the Marriott , " Mr. Gartenstein - Ross said " Think of the symbolic value if they were able to kill Zardari after his first address as president of Pakistan in a speech announcing his fight against the terrorists .
The symbolic effect of the attack on the same day would be devastating . "
An adviser to Senator McCain and a former director of central intelligence under President Clinton , James Woolsey , said Al Qaeda has a " history of doing three things at least related to elections .
One is to attack before elections , such as in 2004 in Spain , and of course the assassination of Benazir Bhutto .
They also have a history of attacks when new leaders take over , like Gordon Brown in Britain and the new leader in Pakistan , with the attack over the weekend .
Also Al Qaeda sends messages to populations in elections .
You really do n't know which one of these they are going to implement . "
Earlier this summer , another McCain campaign official mused in an interview that an attack could benefit his candidate in the polls .
But whether that statement is true is unclear :
At the Republican National Convention this month , Mr. McCain praised the president 's counterterrorism policies for preventing an attack in America since September 11 , 2001 .
The Bush administration has deliberately refrained from pointing to this success in light of the many plots that the president has said have been aborted on American soil since September 11 .
The deputy communications director for the McCain campaign , Michael Goldfarb , said : " There is no doubt that Al Qaeda is still dangerous and still desires to strike at America and our allies .
But Americans will not be intimidated and their votes will not be swayed by terror . "
A spokeswoman for the Obama campaign , Wendy Morigi , said , " Last week 's attacks demonstrate the grave and urgent threat that Al Qaeda and its affiliates pose to the United States and the security of all nations .
As Senator Obama has said for some time , we must refocus our efforts on defeating Al Qaeda around the world . "
According to one study released last week , your answer does n’t matter much : even if you walk to the burger joint , your food will have its own set of wheels — and an exhaust pipe .
While it ’s now common knowledge that activities like driving conventional cars cause global warming , the environmental impact of what we eat continues to slip under the mainstream radar .
The study , performed by Germany ’s Institute for Ecological Economy Research , could change this with its comprehensive and comprehensible findings .
Instead of measuring the impact of diets with pounds or kilograms of carbon or methane produced in food manufacturing , the researchers have reduced their results to numbers that reflect the distance driven in a mid-sized car that would produce the same amount of greenhouse gas over the course of a year .
They took into account the energy used to produce feed for livestock , all transportation involved in the process , and even the methane produced by animals themselves .
The results are familiar : vegetarians and vegans , well … drive less .
Following an omnivorous diet for one year is comparable to driving 2,956 miles .
Meanwhile , vegetarians travel half as far at 1,508 miles , and vegans rank a mere 391 miles .
Furthermore , a plant - based diet consisting entirely of organic foods is equivalent to only 175 miles traveled — less than the free daily mileage limit on a ZipCar .
For perspective , the average American drives around 12,000 miles each year .
While an omnivorous diet heavy on organic foods certainly reduces the toll on the planet ’s odometer , the researchers insist that the production of beef and milk — organic or not — ought to be curtailed .

It looks like the years of the Republican Ascendancy are perhaps ending .
And they are ending as anyone with sense could have predicted -- with mounds of corpses abroad and a destroyed economy at home .
And now certain scenes from these dark years flicker past in my mind 's eye , a tumult of images : " monstrous familiar images , " as they say .
Here 's the first of them :
This is of course the " Brooks Brothers Riot , " from the Florida recount debacle , when vicious young GOP geekapparatchiks from DC were flown down to disrupt by violence the operations of an election board .
For all its nerdiness , this was indeed an instance of actual , real - life fascism -- systematized extra-legal violence used to attain political ends and the ordinary processes of democratic government be damned .
Oddly enough a certain " scholar " of fascism in American political neglected to include an account of this episode in his comprehensive tome , though , you know , by any rational standard these Brooks Brothers suit - shirts are brown .
Charmingly , the WaPo tells us that these nasty little shits like to brag about their participation in this nasty little affair on their resumes .
That alone tells you everything you need to know about the 21st century GOP -- not only its ugliness , but its spectacular incompetence .
It is no surprise that people with brazen contempt for democratic government do n't have the slightest clue how to run one .
Brooks Brothers riots , blood on the floor :
Certain consequences are inevitably inscribed in the logic of certain origins .

Sarah Palin fans are so adament and hopeful they resort to this :
Animal New York has the deets :
Meet Eitan Levine , he 's a 19 - year - old Yeshiva Student from New Jersey who attended the Rally To Stop Iran Now at the United Nations yesterday — the one that turned into an anti-Obama rally — to show his support for Israel and declare his crush on Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
He was spotted wandering around with a handwritten sign with his cell phone number on it and the words , " Palin , call me . "
Earlier today , ANIMAL reached Levine by phone to ask him about his sign .
He said that he no qualms attending a very public event and displaying his number , although he did n't expect it to be published on the New York Times ' website either .
When a reporter contacted him yesterday for a quote , they assured him that it would n't be published — they kind of kept their word , the photo was cropped in today 's print edition .
When asked why he specifically made a pro-Palin sign , Levine said he was partly motivated by her good looks .
" I made it last week .
It was a joke because she is relatively attractive . "

While much of the buzz about Spore has revolved around the DRM and now the lawsuit , what 's important to remember is that the DRM is n't in place just to " fight " pirates .
No , the activation limit and the one - account system are also strong deterrents against selling your copy of the game ; EA would much rather everyone bought it instead of taking part in a second - hand market .
As one Ars reader found out , buying the game used may be a risky proposition .
The question is open : is EA breaking the law ?
According to the buyer , his copy of the game was purchased from " a crotchety old redneck , " but the buyer did n't get the necessary information needed to get into the game 's main account , and thus could n't play .
A call to customer support was no help ; sellers have to give the purchaser the account name and password , almost like a World of Warcraft account .
Unless buyers get that information from the person or store they get the used game from , nothing can be done .
EA will not let you open another account .
The portion of the game 's EULA that deals with sales is interesting ; the company technically allows it , but EA wo n't make it easy on you .
" You may not be able to transfer the right to receive updates , dynamically served content , or the right to use any online service of EA in connection with the Software , " the agreement states .
" You may not be able to transfer the Software if you have already exhausted the terms of this License by authenticating the Software on the allowed number machine [ sic ] .
Subsequent recipients of this License may not be able to authenticate the Software on additional machines . "
Could EA get into legal trouble by limiting the " first sale " doctrine , or is the company just trying to annoy you into not trying to sell the game ?
We brought the question to Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation to find out .
" Those are the right questions , " he told Ars . " Rightsholders are increasingly using ' contracts ' ( EULAs and TOS ) to end - run the traditional limits imposed by copyright — such as first sale , fair use , reverse engineering , etc .
These strategies are being tested in court right now , and EFF has been involved in those cases — and intends to continue being involved . "
He lists a few cases that are making their way through the courts , such as UMG vs. Augusto .
An eBay seller was selling his " promo " CDs , even though the sticker on the cover stated that this was forbidden .
EFF won that case , although UMG is appealing .
" So just affixing a label is n't enough to trump first sale , " von Lohmann told us .
In Vernor v. Autodesk , a man bought , and then sold , a copy of AutoCAD on eBay .
The thing is , he did n't open the package , so he never clicked on the " I agree " box in the licensing agreement .
" He won a preliminary victory a few months ago , although everyone expects that AutoDesk will appeal , " von Lohmann explained .
Few people have the time , energy , or money to fight these things out in court , though , and the fact remains that you can resell your copy of Spore .
You just need to provide the buyer with the information for the account you created when first playing the game , though EA may not give buyers any more hardware activations , and the company wo n't promise to allow used games access to the Spore community .
Illegal , though ?
Probably not , although the courts are still working out many of these issues .
" The law in this area is a bit of a jump ball right now , " von Lohmann told Ars .
Unfortunately , while the legality is being worked out , it 's the customers who suffer .
Noonan , Murphy trash Palin on hot mike : ' It 's over '
After a segment with NBC's Chuck Todd ended today , Republican consultant Mike Murphy and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan were caught on a live mike ridiculing the choice of Sarah Palin .
" It 's over , " said Noonan , who then responded to a question of whether Palin is the most qualified Republican woman McCain could have chosen .
" The most qualified ?
No .
I think they went for this — excuse me — political bullshit about narratives , " she said .
" Every time the Republicans do that , because that 's not where they live and it's not what they 're good at , they blow it . "
Murphy chimed in :
" The greatness of McCain is no cynicism , and this is cynical . "
Noonan 's blunt call contrasted with her conflicted column today saying Palin " could become a transformative political presence . "
" The Sarah Palin choice is really going to work , or really not going to work , " Noonan wrote .
" It 's not going to be a little successful or a little not ; it 's not going to be a wash .
She is either going to be magic or one of history 's accidents .
She is either going to be brilliant and groundbreaking , or will soon be the target of unattributed quotes by bitter staffers shifting blame in all ' The Making of the President 2008 ' books . "
UPDATE : Noonan tries to explain her remarks , and says that what 's " over " is n't , she meant , McCain 's campaign , but that what 's over is the truth to the belief that " whatever the base of the Republican party thinks is what America thinks . "
Have you ever gone to school on a snow day ?
Tell me that ’s not the worst .
Everyone else is outside having snowball fights and going sledding , and you ’re stuck inside playing Battleship with the teacher because your parents could n’t find a babysitter .
The probability of you learning anything is zero and the school just transforms into a maze of barren , lonely hallways .
It ’s kind of a got a horror movie feel to it too , especially if you walk by a room full of kindergarteners and they all look up at you at the same time and slowly smile .
No , when it snows , you have to figure out a way to stay home and just have the time of your life .
So let ’s break it down a bit .
Let ’s talk about the three main types of snow days :
3. The Pre-planned Snow Day .
Your town got hit by an ice storm and four - feet of heavy , packing snow .
It ’s going to take a couple of days to dig out , so somebody makes the call to cancel school in advance .
This is definitely a good snow day , but it really zaps out all the anticipation .
Worst of the three types .
2. The It ’s Gonna Happen , I Can Just Feel It Snow Day .
This is where the snow is hitting hard and heavy the night before .
There are reports of black ice and cars in the ditch .
People hunker down by the window with some hot cocoa and turn the radio on for weather updates .
This is what ’s known as a high - probability snow day .
You ’re almost positive it ’s going to happen so you go to sleep excited about getting up the next morning .
And really , the night before is almost as fun as the snow day itself , because you ’re already planning the day in your head , putting off your homework , and calling your friends .
Of course , once in a while the sun is mysteriously shining the next morning and the roads are clear , but this is very rare .
1. The Surprise Snow Day .
Now this is it : The Mighty King Of The Snow Days .
This is where nobody suspects a thing the night before .
Just have some dinner , do some homework , brush some teeth .
Yup , just a typical night around here .
But then suddenly the next morning there ’s a knock on the door and it ’s your mom or dad telling you that … guess what , it ’s a snow day !
Now that ’s a buzzy kid high right there .
Homework already out of the way , no risk of missing anything important at school , just an all - out , lay back and relax full - on chill session with your friends .
And the day really can’t disappoint , because there were no expectations to begin with !
You wanna sit in the basement and play Contra all afternoon ?
No problem .
Build a snowman and shovel the driveways for cash ?
Sign me up .
Construct elaborate forts in preparation a massive snowball fight ?
I ’m in .
Just be a kid and love it lots .
And so , as its starts to get a bit chilly , let ’s all cross our fingers and hope for a good snow day season .
Let ’s hope this is n’t one of those winters where we put up a goose egg on the snow day category .
No , I say let ’s break the record .
Let ’s go for four or five of the suckers .
Hey , maybe six even .
Let ’s get El Nino in on it .
Because ladies and gentlemen , say it with me , if there ’s one thing we all know , it ’s gotta be that a snow day … is a good day .
AWESOME !

VIENNA , Va. - Douglas Crockford , a JavaScript architect at Yahoo and founder of the JavaScript Object Notation , says he wants a browser war .
Well , with Google 's introduction of its Chrome browser Sept. 2 he just may have it .
During a keynote at the Rich Web Experience conference here Sept. 4 , Crockford said the term " Web time " used to mean " fast , " but not anymore .
The last time ECMAScript and HTML were revised was in 1999 , an era when things happened fast on the Web , he said .
" What happened then ? "
Crockford asked , questioning the source of that speed .
" They had a browser war .
I want a browser war , " he said , although acknowledging that the industry still needs to undo some of the pain of the last browser war .
" It turns out a browser war is a good thing , " although most of the pain will be borne by Web developers and users , Crockford said .
Crockford said innovation should be happening in research labs and not in standards bodies .
Indeed , some of the " good works " in the Web world of late include AJAX , JSON , Google Gears , XDomain Request from Microsoft , and Google 's Chrome .
" I 'm not sure if Chrome 's going to be successful on its own or not , " Crockford said .
Moreover , Crockford said this time around in a browser war " the market must punish bad behavior . "
Yahoo has a Graded Browser Support program where the company gives grades to various browsers , with " A " being the best and " C " being the grade for blacklisted browsers .
The " X " grade is reserved for fringe browsers .
" My proposal is if a browser maker screws up we 're going to rate them poorly , and we can put significant pressure on the browser makers to stay in line . "
The benefit of Yahoo having its Graded Browser Support program is , " Web developers are under tremendous pressure to have their applications run on everything .
But developers can look at it and say , If Yahoo is not supporting IE 5.5 , why should I ? " Crockford said .
" We 're going to get a lot of inducement by all the browser makers to try to trick you so your site works only for them ; we should n't fall for that bait , " he said .
For his part , Crockford said because of the first browser war the industry needs standards .
" Never again , " he said of the industry enduring another period like the mid- to late '90s when Microsoft and Netscape engaged in a bitter standards war , because the companies were warring so much and making changes so quickly that " they put a lot of bugs into the network because they did n't have time to get it right . "
Indeed , " the reason AJAX happened in 2005 instead of 2000 is because it took all that time for the bugs to get flushed out , " he said .
" Microsoft has been condemned for having done nothing after winning the browser war .
I contend that their doing nothing is the best thing they could 've done because it led to innovation by others .
Bravo , Microsoft . "
Crockford , who has been critical of some of the proposed Web standards , particularly the ECMAScript 4 proposal , said , " A revision to a standard is an act of violence ; it causes pain and injury .
Careless revision of standards has a huge social and business cost .
Minimalism should be highly valued in standards . "
Crockford then said the ECMAScript 4 proposal " lacked a credible value proposition and added a huge amount of complexity . "
And he praised the Ecma working group governing the specification for abandoning it for an ECMAScript 3.1 proposal that " brings the standard more in line with reality . "
Crockford entitled his talk " Web Forward ! " and said , " I 'm really interested in how the Web goes forward - the Web 's been stuck and we need to get it unstuck . "
Crockford added that there is no such thing as Moore 's Law for software , but that software seems to be governed more by Murphy 's Law .
" Rather than a doubling in productivity every two years , we see a doubling of software productivity every 10 to 20 years . "
He noted major advancements in software and pointed to OOP ( object - oriented programming ) as the last major step in software development .
But OOP has been around more than 20 years , he said .
" We 're still waiting for the next thing , " Crockford said .
He said that next thing might be assembling software like Lego pieces using components .
" We 're doing that now with mashups , and JavaScript is the mashup language . "
Meanwhile , Crockford said the Web is under attack and " browser security is the biggest problem for the Web .
The weaknesses of the browser are hampering innovation . "
Crockford also noted that JavaScript is close to helping to get the security equation right , but it needs " object capability . "
He said in an object capability system an object can only communicate with objects it has reference to .
And there are three ways to obtain a reference : by creation , by construction and by introduction .
However , safe JavaScript subsets such as Caja , Cajita , ADsafe and Dojox . secure offer some safety now , and the Ecma technical committee governing ECMAScript has begun work on Secure ECMAScript , he said .
" The war is coming ; I 'll see you in the trenches , " Crockford said .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup 's first tracking report based entirely on post - Democratic convention attitudes shows Barack Obama maintaining a six percentage point lead over John McCain , the same as Sunday 's report .
According to interviews conducted Aug. 29 - 31 , national registered voters prefer Obama 49 % to 43 % .
Comparing Obama 's current 49 % support with the 45 % he received immediately before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Denver last week suggests he received a 4 - point bounce out of the convention , fairly typical of past convention bounces .
Aside from the past few days , Obama has only once previously attained 49 % support from national voters , and that was in late July .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
The determination of this year 's Democratic convention bounce is complicated by the fact that McCain announced his pick for vice president -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- on the first morning after the convention , thus diverting considerable media attention to the McCain campaign that otherwise would have been focused on recapping the Democratic convention and Obama 's Thursday night acceptance speech .
However , even using Friday 's Gallup Poll Daily tracking report as the indicator of Obama 's convention bounce produces the same result .
Obama was preferred by 49 % of registered voters in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Aug. 26 - 28 , after the Democratic National Convention was underway , but before the Palin choice was made public .
Slight Vice - Presidential Bounce for McCain
Given this year 's unusually condensed convention and vice presidential selection calendar , today 's tracking report also represents the first three days following McCain 's vice presidential announcement .
McCain's 43 % level of support in today 's report contrasts with 41 % supporting McCain right before the Palin choice was revealed , giving McCain a 2 - point vice presidential selection bounce .
While lower than typical vice presidential selection bounces , McCain 's 2 - point vice - presidential bounce is technically better than the complete lack of a vice presidential bounce seen for Obama with his selection of Delaware Sen.
Joe Biden on Aug. 23 .
However , from a statistical standpoint , both shifts are within the margin of sampling error , and thus not significant .
Any hope the Republicans had of shifting into convention high gear and nullifying Obama 's convention gains have been thrown to the wind with Hurricane Gustav making landfall on the Gulf Coast today .
Republican convention planners are now forced to improvise their way through what otherwise promised to be a highly scripted week in St. Paul .

The lesbian community faces unique challenges when accessing health care , from widespread provider misconception about STI risks for women who partner with women to doctors who tailor their medical advice to stereotypes they have of lesbians ' lives and needs .
When seeking medical care , LGBT people are often confronted
with a system that denies our existence or insults who we are .
From medical
forms that ask for a patient ’s marital status to doctors who refuse care to lesbians who seek to parent to medical ignorance of intersex conditions , even LGBT
people with health insurance struggle to get the healthcare services they are
paying for and need .
The lesbian community faces unique challenges when accessing
health care , from widespread provider misperception about STI risks for women
who partner with women to doctors who tailor their medical advice to
stereotypes they have of lesbians ’ lives and needs .
Misperceptions About Sexual
Risk and Behavior
Many medical providers erroneously believe that women who
have sex with women are not at risk for sexually transmitted diseases or
infections and that we are not in need of regular preventative care .
Although there is a lack of research on the
issue of sexually transmitted diseases and infections among women who have sex
with women , it is known that the risk of STD
transmission between women varies significantly from STD to STD .
Herpes , HPV , and bacterial vaginosis are
easily transmitted between women during sex .
HIV , hepatitis B , gonorrhea , and chlamydia are less likely to be transmitted
between women during sex , but it is still possible .
Most lesbian and bisexual women who have had
sex with both men and women are at risk for STDs that can be transmitted
between men and women during sexual intercourse .
Since many STDs do not have
symptoms , it is possible for a woman to have an STD and unknowingly share it
with her partner .
Women who have sex
with women may encounter a healthcare provider who harbors the misconception
that they are not at risk and , therefore , actually be put at risk if they are
not encouraged to relate their full sexual history , seek regular screenings and
get tested for STDs .

An Our
Bodies Ourselves report on health care for LGBT patients states that health
care providers should take a thorough health and family history from all
patients , ask gender - inclusive , open - ended questions that allow patients to
come out to them or give them the information they need to provide appropriate
treatment when necessary .
But some doctors do not even know how LGBT people have sex .
Evident discomfort and confusion about lesbian sexuality
faced a friend , Keisha , at an annual well woman exam :
" I had always used my local Planned Parenthood for my yearly
exam , but I finally had a job with full benefits and thought I ’d try to find a
gynecologist since well woman exams were part of my coverage .
So , I found a doctor who was a woman and just
assumed it would be the same kind of experience that I ’d always had at Planned
Parenthood ; LGBT friendly and positive .
What I got was a gynecological version of the who ’s on first joke .
It all started when the doctor asked if I was
a virgin .
I said no , but that I was a
lesbian , to which she responded with a question about whether I am sexually
active .
I said yes , but that I would
need a smaller Pederson specula for the exam since I have never had sex with a
man .
She seemed confused and asked again
if I was sexually active and I found myself telling a gynecologist that there
are more ways to have sex than with a man .
" So you ’re not a virgin ? " she asked .
" No , " I replied .
She finally
asked if I had ever had sex with vaginal penetration , but by that time I was
done .
There was no way I was going on
with the exam .
I ’m sticking with Planned
Parenthood from now on . "
When Keisha shared her story at my lesbian women of color
support group ’s monthly gathering , we all related .
As the evening went on and my friends related
story after story , the emotional impact of a homophobic gynecological
experience became clear .
Many of us spoke of the anxiety of coming out to a
healthcare professional and too many of us were met with judgment or an
apathetic acceptance of our " lifestyle . "
Some of my friends felt like they had to educate their gynecologist on
how lesbians have sex and several said that their doctor did n’t seem to think
lesbians are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases .
Stereotypes About
Patients
I shared my own story with my friends in the group .
When I
had to switch gynecologists while undergoing treatment for fibroids , one appointment
with with the new doctor was enough to show me the match would n’t work .
The
physician reviewed my form and said that since I was " gay " I would n’t be having
children and so I should have a hysterectomy rather than continue
treatment .
My jaw dropped , but before I
could recover enough to tell him where he could put his medical advice he
added , " You might as well get that uterus out now since you ’re not going to use
it . "
I told him I was incredibly
offended , and the man had the audacity to look shocked when I abruptly ended
the appointment .
Misunderstanding
Families
As we move forward with our national discussion of
healthcare needs , we must include the specific needs of all people including
those of us who identify as LGBT .
Medical professionals need training , informational pamphlets and
websites need to be revised to include inclusive language and laws need to be
passed to insure access to healthcare services regardless of an individual ’s
sexual orientation or gender identity .
We can all learn from the experiences of LGBT patients to improve
patient care .
Cammie and her partner ’s experience stands out in this
regard .
The two have been together for
ten years and decided the time was right to have a baby .
The first hurdle they faced was finding an
OB / GYN who had experience with same - sex couples .
Friends recommended an OB / GYN but that
physician was n’t within Cammie ’s provider network .
Though her insurance allows for out of
network treatment , Cammie was concerned about the cost .
So , the couple selected an in - network doctor
and set up an appointment .
" I knew we were in for some drama when we signed in at the
front desk and the receptionist asked if my husband was with me , " Cammie
recalls .
" I replied that my partner was
with me and she acted embarrassed and flustered .
The patient forms all contained references to
a person ’s husband or spouse and I had to scratch the word out and replace it
with partner . "
Cammie went on to tell us that the OB / GYN confessed that he
did n’t think he had even treated any lesbians or " at least not one who made a
big deal about it . "
As she and her partner sat back in shock over the phrasing
of that statement he continued the conversation by calling Cammie ’s partner her
" friend or whatever " and adding that he did n’t have any problem with their
" chosen lifestyle . "
Once Cammie and her partner realized their safest bet was to
turn to the provider recommended by their friends , Cammie reports , " The only
problem we faced there was trying to get an appointment .
It seems that every lesbian couple in the
metropolitan area was trying to use the same doctor at the same time . "
The couple finally secured an appointment and
had the kind of welcoming experience everyone hopes for when visiting an
OB / GYN .
They are now the proud parents
of a daughter and are considering having more children .
When Patients Avoid
Care
Beyond the emotional impact , there are the very real health
risks associated with going to a gynecologist who lacks an understanding of
LGBT people .
How many of my friends
have n’t received STI counseling because their doctors assumed they have never
had sex with men , even though several of them had relationships with men before
coming out ?
How many have withheld
healthcare concerns from their doctors because they did n’t want to deal with
insulting questions or judgment ?
How
many avoided yearly exams because they did n’t want to add another homophobic incident
to their medical history ?
Thankfully , the medical community has begun to address the
need to include sexual orientation and gender identity in medical
training .
But doctors are people and are
subject to the same issues of homophobia and ignorance that anyone else is
subject to .
Addressing the need for
training will go a long way to improving the reproductive healthcare
experiences of lesbians and other members of the LGBT community .
Well woman exams are crucial for all women ,
and we need to do whatever we can to create medical environments that encourage
women to visit their healthcare provider rather than fear another
disrespectful , alienating ordeal .
Increasing bureaucracy is the biggest single threat to clinical research in the UK and urgent action needs to be taken , argue experts on bmj.com today .
European legislation introduced in 2001 was intended to simplify and harmonise the regulation of trials across the European Union .
But it has led to long delays in approval , is " poorly coordinated , lacks inconsistency at all levels , and at times is completely illogical " , write Professors Morris Brown and Paul Stewart .
Because of the increasingly complicated and time - consuming approval process , the UK has fallen from being one of the most attractive places for the pharmaceutical industry to undertake clinical trials to one of the least attractive , warn the authors .
Main concerns of the authors include the lengthy application process -- paperwork can take up to 40 hours to complete , the inconsistencies and delays in the review process , and the lack of clarity about what requires ethical approval .
According to the authors , another key problem is the ineffectiveness of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) approval process -- the application is difficult to complete , cannot be submitted online and is sometimes lost by the MHRA .
The MHRA was set up to investigate new medicinal products , but its extended responsibility to approve all clinical trials in the UK has been counterproductive , say the authors .
" The process adds long delay for no perceived benefit ... No improvement in patient safety has been demonstrated as a consequence of the extra tier of bureaucracy for such studies " , say the authors , " On the contrary , the MHRA failed to prevent the TeGenero disaster at Northwick Park - - or acknowledge its failure " .
So what needs to be done ?
The recently formed National Institute of Health Research ( NIHR ) has already begun a " bureaucracy busting " mission , say the authors , but they outline a number of recommendations to reduce research bureaucracy .
For example , they suggest a single and simple web based submission form for all research studies , rather than a different form for every funding and governance organisation .
In addition , they suggest a national and consistent ethical review process to replace the current " postcode lottery " , and an automatic grading of applications which would make patient safety " self evident " .
They conclude by calling for the MHRA to concentrate on its primary responsibility , and ensure that medicines work and are safe .
###
The fact is that there are a lot of problems that are hard to solve in a purely - functional style .
That ’s not to say that no solution exists , but certain problems are very difficult to model without shared state .
In such situations , a slightly different approach to concurrency must be considered .
Actors are inapplicable , seeing as they are the embodiment of “ shared - nothing ” continuation passing , and fork / join does n’t really help us .
Usually , when faced with the need for shared mutable state , most developers will resort to the old - fashioned technique of locking everything and controlling access to that state one thread at a time .
The solution often goes something like this :
public class Container { private int value ; private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock ( ) ; public int getValue ( ) { lock .
readLock ( ) . lock ( ) ; try { return value ; } finally { lock .
readLock .
unlock ( ) ; } } public void setValue ( int value ) { lock .
writeLock ( ) . lock ( ) ; try { this .
value = value ; } finally { lock .
writeLock .
unlock ( ) ; } } }
Obviously , most scenarios which call for such locking are a bit more complex , but you get the picture .
There are two very serious problems with locking :
Implementation rules are ad hoc
Throughput is reduced
The first issue is obvious : there is nothing actually preventing us from accessing value without locking .
What ’s worse , it would be just as easy to lock , access value and then forget to unlock when we were done .
There is no logical connection between value and its lock , the implementation rules are solely enforced by convention .
Of course , we can avoid the problem of forgetting to unlock by using a locking strategy which is lexical in nature , but in that case our second issue ( throughput ) becomes even more pronounced :
private int value ; private final Object lock = new Object ( ) ; public int getValue ( ) { synchronized ( lock ) { return value ; } } public void setValue ( int value ) { synchronized ( lock ) { this .
value = value ; } }
The problem here is that everything blocks everything else .
If one thread wants to retrieve value , it literally stops the world while the other threads wait their turn .
Data integrity is guaranteed , but this was accomplished only by creating a serial bottleneck on read / write access to value .
On top of that , we still have no enforced correlation between the lock and its corresponding piece of data .
“ Glass is Half Full ” Concurrency
What we have been doing here is called “ pessimistic locking ” .
We have literally started with the assumption that we are going to run into data contention issues .
Our entire locking mechanism is designed with the worst case scenario in - mind : lots of threads trying to write to the same piece of data simultaneously .
However , not every concurrent system is going to have constant interference between threads .
As it turns out , in practice data contention is the exception rather than the rule .
Given this , it would be very nice if we could design a system which gave threads the “ benefit of the doubt ” , assuming that they will not conflict , while still somehow maintaining data integrity .
The answer to this is “ optimistic locking ” .
We turn the problem completely on its head .
Instead of assuming that there will be problems and so locking everything preemptively , we assume that everything will be fine and just allow everyone free , non-blocking access .
Of course , an “ open - door policy ” with regards to shared mutable state is n’t enough in and of itself , we have to have some rule for dealing with contention issues , and some way of detecting those conflicts when they happen .
Enter transactions …
The idea behind a purely - optimistic transactional memory model is that all write operations must occur within a transaction .
Data can be read any time , but the memory model will ensure that the data is never in an “ intermediate state ” – or between writes .
Let ’s consider the more complicated scenario of the transfer of funds from one bank account to another .
The steps are as follows :
Withdraw $ 500 from account A Deposit $ 500 into account B
Of course , this is n’t really an algorithm , it ’s a high - level overview .
We ’re really looking at something a bit more complicated than it would seem :
def transfer ( amount : Int , a : Account , b : Account ) { a. balance = a. balance - amount b. balance = b. balance + amount }
I avoided using the += and -= operators so as to illustrate the problem more explicitly .
This operation has four separate operations on shared mutable state ( the account balance ) .
It ’s not too difficult to see how this could go terribly wrong in the case where two separate transfers are taking place simultaneously .
For example , we could transfer $ 500 from account A into account B , while at the same time we transfer $ 200 from account B into account C. Remember , we ’re not locking anything , so we run the danger that our concurrent execution order will be interleaved in the following fashion :
[ Thread1 ]
Get balance of account A [ Thread1 ]
Set balance of account A to its former amount less 500 [ Thread1 ]
Get balance of account B [ Thread2 ]
Get balance of account B [ Thread1 ]
Set balance of account B to its former amount plus 500 [ Thread2 ]
Set balance of account B to its former amount less 200 [ Thread2 ]
Get balance of account C [ Thread2 ]
Set balance of account C to its former amount plus 200
The operation in red is the one we need to be concerned about .
Thread2 retrieved the balance of account B just prior to when it was modified by Thread1 .
This means that when Thread2 calculates the new balance ( less 200 ) , it will be basing its result on a now - obsolete balance .
When it sets the balance , the $ 500 that was transferred from account A will mysteriously vanish , the unfortunate victim of a common race condition .
In a transactional system , both transfers would be separately handled in their own transaction .
Neither of them would modify the other ’s data until all operations are completed , at which point the transaction would commit and the data would become “ live ” .
Thus , when the Thread1 adds $ 500 to account B , the actual balance of account B will remain constant at its original value ( prior to the transaction ) .
Once the transaction commits , both the balance of A and B will be updated essentially simultaneously .
There will never be a point where $ 500 is discovered missing “ in transit ” between two accounts .
This is only half the equation though .
The real genius of the transactional model is just prior to committing , a transaction validates itself , ensuring that all of the data it worked with is still in the same state it was at the beginning of the transaction .
If something has changed , then the transaction is invalidated and must be re-run automatically .
Our issue from above can never happen because the Thread2 transaction will attempt to validate itself , only to discover that the balance of account B has been changed in the meantime .
Rather than yield to the race condition , the Thread2 transaction will throw away its work and start from scratch .
Assuming that nothing else is running , the second validation will be successful ( since nothing will have changed concurrently ) and the transaction will commit .
It all sounds much more complicated than it actually is .
People familiar with modern databases like Oracle should already be comfortable working with optimistic transactional models .
The technique is a little less common in software , but it can still be applied .
In order to make this work in a conventional application setting , we need to introduce a few more abstractions .
There are several ways to go about this , but I have chosen to follow the model laid down by Rich Hickey in his implementation of Clojure ’s STM .
In turn , Clojure seems to take a fair bit of inspiration from Haskell ’s STM monad , although it does not port over concepts like transaction composition and what Simon Payton Jones calls “ choice ” .
Basically , the design can be distilled as follows :
Each item of shared state must be stored in a reference
References can be read at any point , but they can only be modified within a transaction
The data contained within a reference must itself be immutable , the reference simply allows you to switch the data it contains
Within a transaction , reading a reference does not return its current value , but rather the value it had precisely when the transaction began .
This allows data to change outside the transaction without disrupting its internal processing .
Changes made to a reference inside a transaction are not world - visible until the transaction completes and is committed .
Validation ensures that no data is lost during the commit .
Transactions must never contain side - effects as they may be executed multiple times
With all that in mind , let ’s get to work on an implementation !
References
Since these are the primitive building blocks of our STM , it seems logical that we should start here .
At an extremely basic level , we will need a structure which looks something like the following :
class Ref [ T ] ( private var value : T ) { def get = value def := ( value : T ) { this .
value = value } }
This is the basic idea anyway .
We want to be able to retrieve a value from a reference using get , and we want to be able to store a value in the reference using the := operator ( hat tip to all of you rabid Pascal fan - boys ) .
Unfortunately , we have n’t really accomplished anything here .
Yes , we have a reference to wrap around a mutable piece of data , but there are no associated concurrency semantics .
Remember the definition of a reference ?
We must only be able to write to it within a transaction .
Furthermore , the value returned from a reference within a transaction is not necessarily its current , world - visible state , but rather the data it had the moment the transaction began .
In order to accommodate these requirements , we will introduce the concept of a context .
Both read and write access to a reference will require a context to be present .
We will have one context for the entirety of world - visible state .
Additionally , each transaction will have its own context .
In that way , we can ensure that transaction modifications are kept local to itself prior to commit while at the same time preventing changes from other transactions from becoming visible after the transaction has started ( potentially leading to data integrity problems ) .
Our API has now evolved to something more like the following :
class Ref [ T ] ( private var value : T ) { // ??? def get ( c : Context ) = c. retrieve ( this ) def := ( value : T ) ( c : Context ) { c. store ( this ) ( value ) } }
I left the constructor undefined because of the fairly obvious problem in this implementation : how does the Context get the values in the first place ?
For the moment , let ’s put that problem aside and deal with a more interesting one : limiting write access to within transactions .
Recall that we ’re going to have two different kinds of contexts : a live context which is global , as well as a context which is local to the transaction .
The requirement alone implies a way to statically restrict reference mutability to within transactions : require a type of context other than the live one .
To this end , we will derive the following closed hierarchy .
It is closed because there will be no other Context implementations , preventing over - zealous API extensions from fouling up our semantics .
We will define Context to be an abstract class and LiveContext to be a singleton object .
Each transaction will have its own Transaction context which it will use in both read and write operations .
LiveContext will only be used outside of a transaction , when there is no other context available .
To enforce this , we will restrict the type of the Context taken by the reference assignment operator to only accept Transaction :
def := ( value : T ) ( c : Transaction ) { c. store ( this ) ( value ) }
With this in mind , we can start to envision what the syntax for reference operations will look like :
def transfer ( amount : Int , a : Ref [ Int ] , b : Ref [ Int ] ) ( c : Transaction ) { a.:= ( a. get ( c ) - amount ) ( c ) b.:= ( b. get ( c ) + amount ) ( c ) } // ... val accountA = new Ref [ Int ] ( 1500 ) val accountB = new Ref [ Int ] ( 200 ) // somehow call `transfer` as a transaction println ( " Account A : " + accountA . get ( LiveContext ) ) println ( " Account B : " + accountB. get ( LiveContext ) )
And just when our design was looking so nice too .
We ’ve succeeded in preventing at compile time the modification of references outside of transactions , but we did it at the cost of a tyrannical syntax .
Fortunately , Scala has a handy mechanism for cleaning up syntax such as this , one which should reduce the volume of annoying bulk by several orders of magnitude : implicits .
IScala makes it possible to mark parameters as accepting implicit values .
These parameters in turn become implicit values themselves .
When a method which accepts an implicit parameter of a specific type is called with an implicit value of the same type in scope , the parameter can be omitted entirely .
Thus , by marking LiveContext as an implicit object and appropriately annotating the last parameter of transfer as well as the Context parameters of Ref ’s accessor and mutator , we can eliminate almost all of the annoying bulk in the above example :
implicit object LiveContext extends Context { ... } class Ref [ T ] ( value : T ) { // ??? def get ( implicit c : Context ) = c. retrieve ( this ) def := ( value : T ) ( implicit c : Transfer ) { c. store ( this ) ( value ) } }
With these extra modifiers in place , we can redo our transfer snippet to see how things look .
To cut down on line length , we will also assume that accountA and accountB are references in some sort of global scope :
val accountA = new Ref [ Int ] ( 1500 ) val accountB = new Ref [ Int ] ( 200 ) def transfer ( amount : Int ) ( implicit t : Transaction ) { accountA := accountA. get - amount accountB := accountB. get + amount } // somehow call `transfer` as a transaction println ( " Account A : " + accountA. get ) println ( " Account B : " + accountB. get )
Pretty slick , and we are n’t even finished yet !
We can add an implicit conversion from Ref [ T ] to T , eliminating the need to call get anywhere in the code :
implicit def refToValue [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) ( implicit c : Context ) = { ref. get ( c ) }
… and the final example syntax :
val accountA = new Ref [ Int ] ( 1500 ) val accountB = new Ref [ Int ] ( 200 ) def transfer ( amount : Int ) ( implicit t : Transaction ) { accountA := accountA - amount accountB := accountB + amount } // somehow call `transfer` as a transaction println ( " Account A : " + accountA ) println ( " Account B : " + accountB )
With the exception of the := syntax ( which is unfortunately unavoidable ) , you would never be able to tell that references are being used rather than conventional vars .
Even better , we have managed to preserve our static assurance that no reference may be modified outside of a transaction .
If we were to attempt to call the := method without an instance of Transaction on - hand , the Scala type checker would complain and our code would not compile .
The we need to do to close the loop is to make sure that the only place a Transaction instance can be obtained is inside a transaction ( seems logical ) .
Atomic
For the moment , let ’s shelve all of the implementation requirements for the STM and instead focus on the API .
We already have an almost elegant syntax for references , but we ’re still missing one final piece : initiating the transaction .
Being incredibly imaginative and innately creative , I decided the best way to devise an API for this would be to hit Wikipedia .
After all , why come up with something original when someone smarter has already solved the problem ?
// Insert a node into a doubly - linked list atomically atomic { newNode -> prev = node ; newNode -> next = node -> next ; node -> next -> prev = newNode ; node -> next = newNode ; } atomic ( queueSize >
0 ) { remove item from queue and use it }
Credit : Software transactional memory # Proposed language support
It ’s a fairly straightforward API , one which could be expressed in Scala as it stands if we really wanted to .
Obviously the body of the first transaction is a little closer to C than Scala , but we can just take that as example pseudo - code and move on .
The real core of the API is a single method , atomic , which takes a function value and executes that function as a transaction .
If a conditional is provided , it acts as a guard .
If the guard ever returns false , the transaction aborts and is not retried .
The only problem here is we have n’t accounted for our implicit Transaction parameter .
Intuitively , we could just add a parameter of type Transaction to the function value , but unfortunately Scala does n’t allow anonymous functions with implicit parameters .
That leaves one of two options : either take the Transaction as a parameter to the anonymous function and then store it in an implicit value within the function ; or pass an actual method which takes an implicit parameter .
In truth , either approach will work , but for the remainder of the article I will use the method - passing approach , rather than the separate assignment within the anonymous method .
Altogether , our API in action looks something like this :
val accountA = new Ref [ Int ] ( 1500 ) val accountB = new Ref [ Int ] ( 200 ) def transfer ( amount : Int ) ( implicit t : Transaction ) { accountA := accountA - amount accountB := accountB + amount } atomic ( transfer ( 500 ) ( _ ) ) // run transaction println ( " Account A : " + accountA ) println ( " Account B : " + accountB )
Notice the extra ( _ ) syntax in the call to atomic .
( thanks , Jesper ! )
This is required because transfer accepts an implicit parameter .
Without it , Scala does n’t know whether we mean to call the method using some implicit value in scope or if we want the function value itself .
Remember this API .
We ’ll come back to the implementation of this method after we have completed the rest of the framework .
For now , let ’s move onto context …
Context
Returning to the dark and mysterious internals of the implementation , we now come to the deep morass of Context .
As it turns out , everything in the STM will revolve around this class and its two separate implementations .
Recall that it is responsible for retrieving reference values , controlling what data is visible from within a transaction and what data is live .
Generally speaking , we are going to have the following design with respect to where reference data is handled :
If in LiveContext , access the One True copy of the data .
, access the One True copy of the data .
If in Transaction , access the One True copy if and only if there is no transaction - local version .
Once the reference has been read , cache the data and return that value from all future reads within the transaction .
We ’re cheating a bit here since we are n’t taking a snapshot of the world on transaction start , we ’re waiting for the first reference read .
As long as we get our validation right , this should be ok .
Logically , this is a simple default operation clouded by a fairly substantive special case ( within a transaction after the reference has been read or written once ) .
To handle the special case , it only makes sense that we use a map from reference to the data to which it corresponds in that transaction .
Remember that the data within a transaction may be a bit behind the live copy .
We could use another map for the general case , but we can make things even simpler than that .
Rather than having a global map from reference to value , we can just store the live values within the Ref objects themselves .
They will still need to delegate to their context to retrieve and store that value , but the actual live version can be kept locally .
This simplifies LiveContext tremendously :
class Ref [ T ] ( private [ stm ] var value : T ) { def get ( implicit c : Context ) = c. retrieve ( this ) def := ( value : T ) ( implicit t : Transaction ) { t. store ( this ) ( value ) } } // ... sealed abstract class Context { def retrieve [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) :
T } implicit object LiveContext extends Context { def retrieve [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) = ref. value }
In this iteration , we have simplified Context a little bit , seeing as it is never actually used for storage .
Notice that all we need to do in LiveContext is delegate right back to the reference .
This may seem like a bit of superfluous indirection but it becomes absolutely essential once we start considering Transaction :
import collection .
_ final class Transaction private [ stm ] ( ) extends Context { private val world = mutable .
Map [ Ref [ Any ] , Any ] ( ) def retrieve [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) = { val castRef = ref .
as InstanceOf [ Ref [ Any ] ] if ( ! world .
contains ( castRef ) ) { world ( castRef ) = ref. value } world ( castRef ) .
as InstanceOf [ T ] } def store [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) ( value : T ) { val castRef = ref .
as InstanceOf [ Ref [ Any ] ] world ( castRef ) = value } }
This is the reason we needed to redirect through retrieve rather than just grabbing the value directly in Ref .
Within a transaction , any dereferencing will polymorphically come to an instance of this class .
The mutable map , world , handles the transaction - local cache of all values once they have been accessed .
Thus , the reference can change after we have looked at it ( when another transaction commits ) and it does n’t affect the values local to our transaction .
This technique is exceedingly powerful and in no small part responsible for the higher throughput made possible by the transactional model .
Incidentally , it is worth noting that within a transaction , references are not thread safe .
Thus , if you start a transaction and then start manipulating references concurrently within that same transaction , bad things will happen .
This is n’t really a problem though because transactions are always designed to be single - threaded from start to finish .
They are used in multi - threaded situations , they do not use multiple threads .
Commitment
Now that we have the basic nuts and bolts of our STM framework , we need to start considering how we are going to commit transactions .
The process is two fold : first , we validate all references either read or written to by the transaction , checking for anything which may have changed in the interim ; and second , we copy all new data from our transaction - local cache into the live references .
For the sake of simplicity , we will only allow one transaction to commit at a time .
We could do a little better , but this should work just fine for the experimental stuff .
Validation is a toughy , but the second commit step is fairly easy to satisfy : just loop through a set of all writes and copy the changes into the corresponding Ref .
The necessary changes are as follows :
final class Transaction private [ stm ] ( ) extends Context { private val world = mutable .
Map [ Ref [ Any ] , Any ] ( ) private val writes = mutable .
Set [ Ref [ Any ] ] ( ) ... def store [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) ( v : T ) { val castRef = ref .
as InstanceOf [ Ref [ Any ] ] world ( castRef ) = v writes += castRef } def commit ( ) = { CommitLock .
synchronized { // TODO validate for ( ref <- writes ) { ref. value = world ( ref ) } } true } } private [ stm ] object CommitLock
The commit method returns a Boolean value indicating whether or not the commit was successful .
If a conflict was detected the method returns false and ( presumably ) the transaction will be tried again .
Since we are n’t doing any validation just yet , we will always return true .
Note that we do n’t really have to lock anything related to the Ref instances in order to write their data .
It is possible for another thread to be reading data from these same references at precisely the same time as we are writing to them .
However , primitive memory operations are atomic by definition , meaning that we do n’t need to worry about data integrity on the level of a reference value .
Validation is actually the most important part of the transaction commit process and quite possibly the most important facet of the entire STM concept .
Without it , there is nothing to prevent data integrity from breaking down and causing problems .
( remember that $ 500 we lost ? )
Unfortunately , our system does n’t quite have the chops yet to support any sort of transaction validation .
In order to validate a Ref , we need to compare its state to the state it was in at the moment we read from it or wrote to it ( meaning into the transaction - local cache ) .
We ca n’t just compare values , partially because equals is n’t fast enough , but also because it does n’t provide a strong enough guarantee about whether or not data has changed .
What we need is some value which we control which indicates deterministically the current state of a Ref and which can be used later to determine if that state has changed .
In short , we need a revision number :
class Ref [ T ] ( value : T ) { private [ stm ] var contents = ( value , 0 ) // init revision to 0 }
The revision numbers have to be controlled statically with thread - safety , so the best place for them should be in the Transaction singleton .
Transaction ( the companion object for Transaction the Context ) also contains our implicit conversion as well as that enigmatic atomic method that we still have yet to implement .
object Transaction { private var rev_ = 1 private val revLock = new AnyRef private def rev = revLock .
synchronized { val back = rev_ rev_ += 1 back } ... }
Empowered by a revision increment system which is guaranteed to produce unique values for each invocation , we can expand upon our concept just a little bit .
Each Transaction will have a unique revision number associated with it ( maintained within the rev field ) .
Assuming a transaction successfully commits , it will not only modify the value of the references in question but also their revision , which it will set to its own number .
This revision system can be used in validation of transaction commit .
Whenever we read or write to a Ref for the first time , we will store its current revision number within the transaction .
When it comes time to commit the transaction , we can loop over our revision map and compare with the actual revision of the reference in question .
If all of the expected revisions match up with reality , the transaction checks out and we can go ahead and commit .
Otherwise , we have to assume that a transaction operating concurrently modified a reference we used and committed after we started our own transaction .
Once this is known , we ca n’t simply commit over the other transaction ’s changes , throwing away all of that money .
Our transaction must be retried from scratch .
Now that we know how to validate , we can finally look at a completed version of commit ( and supporting cast ) :
final class Transaction private [ stm ] ( val rev : Int ) extends Context { private val world = mutable .
Map [ Ref [ Any ] , Any ] ( ) private val writes = mutable .
Set [ Ref [ Any ] ] ( ) private val version = mutable .
Map [ Ref [ Any ] , Int ] ( ) def retrieve [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) = { ... if ( ! world .
contains ( castRef ) ) { ... if ( !version .
contains ( castRef ) ) { version ( castRef ) = castRef. contents ._2 } } ... } def store [ T ] ( ref : Ref [ T ] ) ( v : T ) { ... if ( !version .
contains ( castRef ) ) { version ( castRef ) = ref. contents ._2 } ... } def commit ( ) = { CommitLock .
synchronized { val back = world .
foldLeft ( true ) { ( success , tuple ) => val ( ref , _ ) = tuple success && ref. contents ._2 == version ( ref ) } if ( back ) { for ( ref <- writes ) { ref. contents = ( world ( ref ) , rev ) } } back } } }
It ’s a lot of code , but all fairly straightforward .
The validation simply bears out our intuition : checking the revisions initially retrieved from the references with their current values .
Here again we are making use of the fact that memory access is atomic .
We do n’t need to worry about a revision changing out of sync with a value because both of them are encapsulated by a 2 - tuple within the Ref itself .
Meanwhile , the validation can be trusted because of the CommitLock : we do n’t need to worry about another transaction committing between our validation and when we actually get around to saving our values .
Atomic 2.0
I said we would come back to this , and here we are !
We never did implement the atomic method , which is a bit of a shame seeing as it is what is responsible for kicking off the entire transactional process .
Not only that , but it creates the Transaction instance , ensures that the transaction gets committed once it has finished and it retries if that commit fails .
Set in code , it looks something like this :
def atomic [ A ] ( f : ( Transaction ) => A ) :
A = atomic ( true ) ( f ) def atomic [ A ] ( cond : => Boolean ) ( f : ( Transaction ) => A ) = { def attemptTransact ( ) :
A = { if ( cond ) { val trans = new Transaction ( rev ) try { val result = f ( trans ) if ( trans .
commit ( ) ) result else attemptTransact ( ) } catch { case _ => attemptTransact ( ) // if exception , assume conflict and retry } } else null .
as InstanceOf [ A ] } attemptTransact ( ) }
The only weird thing here is the use of an internal function to control the transaction dispatch process .
This is necessary because we need to emulate the pattern of a do / while loop without losing the ability to capture a return value .
This is the one minor feature of the transaction API that we have designed which I have n’t already discussed : the ability to return a value from a transaction .
Practically speaking , this is n’t needed too often since the very purpose of a transaction is to modify references , but it is still a pattern worth keeping in hand .
You will notice that we have some generic catch - all exception handling going on here .
Whenever a transaction throws an exception , we assume that it has failed and we try again .
To be honest , I wrestled back and forth with this decision .
After all , if a transaction comes across a NullPointerException on its first try , it ’s not likely to do any better the second time around , or the third , or the fourth , or the …
On the other hand , there is a remote but very real possibility that data can briefly get into an inconsistent state within a transaction .
To understand how , consider the following abstract scenario :
Transaction
A writes data to reference A and reference B Transaction B starts after transaction A but before it has committed Transaction B reads from reference A Transaction A commits Transaction B reads from reference B Transaction B does the funky chicken and tries to commit Transaction B fails validation and has to try again Everything works fine on the second time around
Everything gets straightened out in the end due to the validation , but there is still this hairy moment within transaction B that we have to worry about .
Within the transaction , we have some data from before transaction A committed , and some from afterward .
Validation is never going to let this slip by , but while the transaction is still executing we can run into some fairly serious issues .
Imagine for example that reference B is changed in such a way that it throws an exception in transaction B unless it is paired with just the right value of reference A . Since we have an inconsistent pairing between references A and B within transaction B , we will get an exception caused directly by a breakdown in data integrity .
Because this is a data integrity issue , we want this exception to trigger a redo in the transaction .
However , we ca n’t really predict such exceptions , so there ’s no way we can distinguish between a legitimate exception ( which should be propagated outside the transaction ) and a data integrity fault .
In short , we ’re in trouble .
Given the way we designed the STM framework , I do n’t really see a nice , efficient way to avoid this problem .
There are other approaches we could take which do n’t have this issue , but that would either require an entirely different implementation or a much smarter developer taking the lead .
I would be interested to see how Clojure handles this case …
A Less - Trivial Example
Now that we have this full STM framework , it might be interesting to put it to work .
To that end , let ’s create a simple market simulation with three businesses and a hundred potential customers , each with their own accounts and separate balances .
All of these entities will have their own thread operating on their behalf , making purchases , excepting refunds and keeping the Mafia off their back .
Bear in mind that this is a truly concurrent simulation with full thread semantics .
We ’re not going to use actors or anything like that to reduce the number of threads involved , everything will operate in true parallel .
To make things a little more interesting , we will also associate a 7.5 % fee with each transfer , paid to a separate account .
Also , each transfer will be logged presumably for later review .
To make everything fun , we will have one final thread which monitors the entire market , summing up every account and checking the total .
The obvious concern is that some collision in access of the shared data will lead to the unexpected loss ( or gain ) of wealth .
So long as the total market value remains constant , we can assume that shared state is being handled appropriately .
Let ’s start out by defining our accounts and basic structure .
Bear in mind that Account is a type alias ( similar to a C - style typedef ) for Ref[ Long ] , it is not a separate class .
object BankFrenzy { import Transaction . _ type Account = Ref [ Long ] private val fees = new Account private val log : Ref [ Vector [ Transfer ] ] = new Ref ( EmptyVector ) def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) { val business1 = new Account ( 15000 ) val business2 = new Account ( 20000 ) val business3 = new Account ( 50000 ) val people = ( 0 until 100 ) .
foldLeft ( Vector [ Account ] ( ) ) { ( vec , i ) => vec + new Account ( 1000 ) } } }
Remember that all data contained within a reference must be completely immutable , otherwise the STM framework cannot help you .
If you can just change the underlying data within a reference at will , then transaction semantics are useless ( since revision tracking breaks down ) .
To that end , we will use my port of Clojure ’s persistent vector to handle the transfer log ; and just because it ’s fun , we will also use it to manage personal accounts .
Moving on , we should probably define some functions to operate on these accounts .
Remember , they must take an implicit parameter of type Transaction , otherwise they will be prevented from modifying references .
def transfer ( amount : Long , from : Account , to : Account ) ( implicit t : Transaction ) { log := log +
Transfer ( amount , from , to ) val less = Math. round ( amount * 0.075 ) from := from - amount to := to + ( amount - less ) fees := fees + less } def sum ( portfolio : Vector [ Account ] ) ( implicit t : Transaction ) = { portfolio .
foldRight ( 0 : Long ) { _ + _ } }
One thing worthy of attention here is the sum method : we are n’t actually modifying any references in this method , so why bother putting it within a transaction ?
The answer is to enforce data integrity .
We want to make sure that we see a truly consistent picture of the entire market , and the only way to be absolutely sure of that is to use the conceptual “ snapshot of the world ” maintained by a transactional log .
Also notice that the sum method does not store its result within a reference , it actually returns a value .
This is one of the neat features of our STM implementation : it allows transactions to return values just like functions .
This dramatically reduces the boilerplate which would normally be required to get the result of a calculation from within a transaction .
With this infrastructure in place , we can go ahead and create all of the threads we ’re going to need for the simulation :
val market = people + business1 + business2 + business3 + fees var running = true val secActor = thread { while ( running ) { val total = atomic ( sum ( market ) ( _ ) ) println ( " Market value : $ " + total ) sleep ( 10 ) } } val businessActor = thread { while ( running ) { atomic ( transfer ( 250 , business1 , business2 ) ( _ ) ) // transfer rent sleep ( 200 ) } } val peopleActors = for { i <- 0 until people .
length val p = people ( i ) } yield thread { atomic ( transfer ( 50 , p , business3 ) ( _ ) ) // payoff the mob atomic ( transfer ( i * 10 , p , business1 ) ( _ ) ) // purchase from business1 atomic ( transfer ( i * 3 , business2 , p ) ( _ ) ) // refund from business2 }
This is assuming that we have already defined a utility method , thread , in the following fashion :
def thread ( f : => Unit ) = new Thread { override def run ( ) { f } }
Just one of the many little tricks made possible by the staggering power of Scala ’s syntax .
There is n’t much worthy of attention within our simulation threads , it ’s just a lot of concurrent operations running against some shared state .
If we wanted to really have some fun , we could add println status messages to each thread , allowing us to try the simulation multiple times and watch the thread interleaving change from run to run .
However , all we ’re really interested in with this simulation is the assurance that data integrity is maintained at all times .
To see that , all we really need is to check the starting market value , the ending value and some period market auditing while the simulation is in progress :
println ( " Starting market value : $ " + atomic ( sum ( market ) ( _ ) ) ) businessActor . start ( ) secActor . start ( ) for ( pa <- peopleActors ) pa. start ( ) for ( pa <- peopleActors ) pa. join ( ) running = false businessActor . join ( ) secActor . join ( ) println ( " Total fees : $ " + fees ) println ( " Final market value : $ " + atomic ( sum ( market ) ( _ ) ) )
If we compile and run the simulation , the output will look something like this ( on a dual - core , 2 Ghz processor ) :
Starting market value : $ 185000 Market value : $ 185000 Market value : $ 185000 Market value : $ 185000 Total fees : $ 5258 Final market value : $ 185000
We could try the simulation a hundred times with different CPU loads and even on separate machines , the results will always be the same .
While there may be a greater or lesser number of concurrent market audits during the simulation , the values retrieved each time will be the same .
From this we can conclude one important fact : we have succeeded in designing an STM framework which preserves data integrity .
In simulations like this one with a high degree of contested data , STM may actually be slower than a traditional , fine - grained locking strategy .
However , just think for a moment about trying to write this simulation using Java ’s ReentrantReadWriteLock class .
It would be nearly impossible to design such a system , let alone maintain it .
There would always be the danger that we would accidentally get the locking in the wrong order , or forget to lock something before we access it .
In short , such an effort would be extremely hazard prone , and far more verbose .
Using our STM framework , the resulting code was clean and simple to understand .
It ’s easy to see why techniques like this are really starting to catch on .

Conclusion
Hopefully this has been an informative and enjoyable foray into the world of transactional memory systems .
I will retroactively apologize for any areas where my facts are in err ; I ’m certainly quite new to all of these concepts .
As per usual , the library described in this article is available for download .
I was a little lax on the testing side of life , so you may want to vet the library a little bit before you trust it unsupervised in your data center .
There are a number of interesting aspects to STM that I did n’t cover in this article , such as retry and the related function , check ( implemented in the framework ) .
Also left completely untouched is the monadic operation orElse which can be used to compose transactions in a “ first try this , then try that on failure ” sort of way .
STM is a very active research topic today with a lot of the brightest minds in the industry pondering ways to make it better .
While it certainly does n’t solve all of the problems associated with concurrency , it does have the potential to simplify locking and produce better performance under some conditions .
Definately a technology to watch as it develops !

DANIEL E. GURR , a doctor in Miami , had always wanted a baby .
The yearning lasted through his 30s and early 40s , through medical school and into his residency .
That longing created tension ; he and his longtime boyfriend , he said , fought each time the subject came up .
At 46 , Dr. Gurr , who is settled in his job but now unattached , is finally fulfilling his wish .
Next month , through a surrogate , he will become the single parent of a baby boy .
“ I ’ve always felt that I wanted fatherhood to be a part of my life , ” he said .
“ It ’s just a core part of who I ’ve always been .
I absolutely would want a partner , but I could n’t let my life wait for that random event . ”
Like the women two decades ago who decided to become mothers on their own  sparking a redefinition of family , not to mention a culture war  single men , gay and straight , hear the ticking biological clock .
And they are moving beyond looking for Ms. or Mr. Right .
On Wednesday , August 8 , 2008 , the Department of Justice held a news conference announcing that Bruce E. Ivins , a former anthrax researcher for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , was the sole person responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks .
Headed by U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor and FBI Assistant Director Joseph Persichini , the presentation was noteworthy for often not answering relevant questions , but instead referring reporters to several dozen court documents they had just been provided .
After hurriedly reading one of these documents I decided to hedge my strong conclusion in an essay that the FBI had persecuted and framed Ivins in order to protect the actual perpetrators until determining enough facts to decide the matter .
I stated , " The most important question is whether Ivins was provided with fully weaponized cutting - edge anthrax that he could use by merely drying it out as the FBI case requires .
If not , then the cover - up explodes in the face of the FBI . "
See " 911 Plotters Bury the Evidence of Anthrax as their Follow - up Punch " http://tinyurl.com/694avu
And , indeed , the cover - up had exploded in the face of the FBI and DOJ .
Richard Spertzel , UNSCOM 's biological weapons chief from 1994 - 199 , had described an exquisitely weaponized anthrax contained in the letters to Senators Leahy and Daschle that " far exceeds that of any powdered product found in the now extinct U.S. Biological Warfare Program . "
These included anthrax spores of 1.5- 3.0 microns necessary to make a pure spore mix , a polyglass that tightly bound hydrophilic silica to each particle ( to prevent clumping ) and a weak electrical charge to optimize dispersion by means of repulsion with no other propellant required .
Spertzel concluded :
The multiple disciplines and technologies required to make the anthrax in this case do not exist at the Army 's Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases .
Inhalation studies are conducted at the institute , but they are done using liquid preparation , not powdered products .
Furthermore , the FBI spent 12 - 18 months trying to " reverse engineer " the Daschle - Leahy anthrax without success .
The FBI case against Ivins gives him 7 ½ hours in the evening over the course of three days to prepare his first concoction sent in letters postmarked September 18 , 2001 and roughly 15 ½ hours over eight days to prepare the Senate anthrax letters postmarked October 9 , 2001 .
But after reading the first DOJ document , that was suggestive and not apparently made from whole cloth , I was seized by the possibility that the FBI might have been concealing that Ivins had been working with fully weaponized anthrax in order to disguise a violation of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention treaty to which the U.S. is a signatory , hence the hedge in my essay ( made on the final day of OPEDNEWS window for editing one 's essays . )
Direct inspection of the BTWC rules out that concern .
Apparently what matters is in the heart or mind : one can make fully weaponized materials so long as the purpose in doing so is in some part defensive or prophylactic , as was Ivins 's purpose in testing the efficacy of anthrax vaccines .
The question is thus whether Ivins was working with fully weaponized materials .
The answer is that he was not .
Neither the DOJ oral presentation , nor anything in any of its documents states or implies this during a public presentation whose purpose was to convince the American public that the FBI " got the right man " this time .
They cannot even bring themselves to say that the spores in Ivins 's possession were of the same consistent tiny size of 1.5 - 3.0 microns that made them so deadly -- something they would surely say were it so .
In fact , the topic is sedulously avoided even though -- or precisely because -- it is essential to making the case against Ivins .
Better , Jeffrey Taylor , who seemed to have a weak grasp of the evidence , in his opening remarks gave away the fact that the anthrax in the letters did not come directly from the flask with the sample of spores " RMR - 1029 " that Ivins monitored and that were reportedly a genetic match to the anthrax that killed its victims .
Mr. Taylor advised :
As the court documents allege , the parent material of the anthrax spores used in the attacks was a single flask of spores , known as " RMR - 1029 , " that was created and solely maintained by Dr. Ivins at USAMRIID .
This means that the spores used in the attacks were taken from that specific flask , regrown , purified , dried and loaded into the letters .
So , that 's the game and the frame - up right there .
Regrown spores do n't weaponize themselves .
They do not regrow super - small and covered with state - of - the - art anti-clumping silicon with a weak electrical charge for dispersion .
And how do we know , aside from voluminous ongoing reports that we will soon examine , that there was such silica on the spores , and that it was cutting edge technology ?
Search Warrant Affidavit 07-534-M-01 ( available at USDOJ : Amerithrax Court Documents ) , dated October 31 , 2007 , states in pertinent part , p.4 :
Microscopic examination of the evidentiary spore powders recovered from all four letters identified an elemental signature of Silicon within the spores .
This Silicon signature had not been previously described for Bacillus anthracis organisms .
This fundamental problem with the FBI case has been around for a long time , and helps us understand how covert action can take place in front of the public without being noticed .
Indeed , the entire emphasis of the DOJ and FBI is focussed on proving that there is a genetic match between the letter anthrax and the anthrax batch RMR - 1029 allegedly in Ivins 's possession while ignoring that RMR - 1029 lacked the weaponized qualities found in the Senate anthrax letters .
That focus is a deliberate red herring to make it seem possible that Ivins was the lone nutcase perpetrator .
An October 2 , 2002 Washington
Post article by Guy Gugliotta and Gary Matsumoto underscores how committed the FBI has been to protecting the 911 plotters from the beginning , e.g. , by starting with a conviction that the perpetrator had to be a lone nutcase :
A profile of the attacker issued by the FBI last November described an angry , " lone individual " with " some " science background who could weaponize the anthrax spores in a basement laboratory for as little as $ 2,500 .
Instead , the scientists who understood the spores opined as follows :
" In my opinion , there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff , and I 'm one of them , " said Richard O. Spertzel , chief biological inspector for the U.N. Special Commission from 1994 to 1998 .
" And even with a good lab and staff to help run it , it might take me a year to come up with a product as good . "
Instead , suggested Spertzel and more than a dozen experts interviewed by The Washington Post in recent weeks , investigators might want to reexamine the possibility of state - sponsored terrorism , or try to determine whether weaponized spores may have been stolen by the attacker from an existing , but secret , biodefense program or perhaps given to the attacker by an accomplice .
... " Just collecting this stuff is a trick , " said Steven A. Lancos , executive vice president of Niro Inc. , one of the leading manufacturers of spray dryers , viewed by several sources as the likeliest tool needed to weaponize the anthrax bacteria .
" Even on a small scale , you still need containment .
If you 're going to do it right , it could cost millions of dollars . " ...
Several sources agreed that the most likely way to build the coated spores would be to use the fine glass particles , known generically as " fumed silica " or " solid smoke , " and mix them with the spores in a spray dryer .
" I know of no other technique that might give you that finished product , " Spertzel said .
According to William C. Patrick III , the former chief of product development for the U.S. Army 's now - defunct bioweapons program , U.S. government scientists made biological agents using spray dryers , but did not spray dry anthrax .
...
In spray drying , a technician mixes fumed silica and spores with water , then sprays the mist through a nozzle directly into a stream of superheated air shooting from a second nozzle into an enclosed chamber .
The water evaporates instantly , leaving spores and additive floating in space .
What do the DOJ and FBI offer us for how Ivins could have done all this ?
Silence and disinformation .
The aforementioned affidavit states :
Culturing anthrax and working safely with dried anthrax spores requires specific training and expertise in technical fields such as biochemist or microbiology .
It also requires access to particular laboratory equipment such as a lyophilizer or other drying device , biological safety cabinet or other containment device , incubator , centrifuge , fermentor , and various protective gear , all of which Dr. Ivins had readily accessible to him through his employment at USAMRIID .
The above paragraph is a carefully worded frame - up .
Yes , a special drying device is needed to coat the anthrax with silicon in the right way ; it is a spray dryer -- a device that works with intense heat to vaporize nearly instantly a water suspension of silicon particles that then is drawn to the anthrax .
Ivins had access to a lyophilizer , but not to a spray dryer .
A lyophilizer freeze dries liquid anthrax into a powder .
So the affidavit slips the fact that Ivins lacks even the basic tools by including " or other drying device " and states ( truly and deceptively ) that Ivins had access to " all of which , " i.e. , the unhelpful lyophilizer but not the essential spray dryer , let alone the specialized silicon and team of colleagues to make it work .
The Post continues about the requirements :
" Surface tension will pull those little [ silica ] particles together onto the big one , " said California Institute of Technology chemical engineer Richard Flagan .
" You will end up with some degree of coating . "
Whoever made such an aerosol would " need some experience " with aerosols and " would have to have a lot of anthrax , so you could practice , " Edwards said .
" You 'd have to do a lot of trial and error to get the particles you wanted . "
It would also help to have an electron microscope to examine the results .
This would mean at least several hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment , several experts said .
Niro 's cheapest spray dryer sells for about $ 50,000 .
Electron microscopes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars .
In all , said Niro's Lancos , " you would need [ a ] chemist who is familiar with colloidal [ fumed ] silica , and a material science person to put it all together , and then some mechanical engineers to make this work . . . probably some containment people , if you do n't want to kill anybody .
You need half a dozen , I think , really smart people . "
The following year , Gary Matsumoto wrote an article for Science 28 , November 2003 , Volume 302 that stated that " a schism now exists among scientists who analyzed it for the FBI . "
Initially , there was consensus :
Early in the investigation [ once it took to heart the science needed to produce the spores ] , the FBI appeared to endorse the latter view : that only a sophisticated lab could have produced the material used in the Senate attack .
This was the consensus among biodefense specialists working for the government and the military .
In May 2002 , 16 of these scientists and physicians published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association , describing the Senate anthrax powder as " weapons - grade " and exceptional : " high spore concentration , uniform particle size , low electrostatic charge , treated to reduce clumping " ( JAMA , 1 May 2002 , p. 2237 ) .
Donald A. Henderson , former assistant secretary for the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the Department of Health and Human Services , expressed an almost grudging respect : " It just did n't have to be that good " to be lethal , he told Science .
As the [ criminal ] investigation dragged on , however , its focus shifted .
In a key disclosure , U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft revealed in August 2002 that Justice Department officials had fixed on one of 30 so - called " persons of interest " : Steven J. Hatfill , a doctor and virologist who in 1997 conducted research with the Ebola virus at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick , Maryland .
( Hatfill has denied any involvement in the anthrax mailing . )
Thus , the FBI had begun with the " backyard biokiller " profile , then was forced to abandon it by the advanced design of the anthrax that points the finger where it belongs at state - sponsored terrorism , and then embraced it again once it felt that Steven Hatfill could be made to fill the role of " patsy . "
But in order to convict Hatfill , the FBI would need to demonstrate how Hatfill could have produced the anthrax in the Daschle - Leahy letters , hence their effort to " reverse engineer " the process .
One lovely comparable historical example is the FBI 's fantasy that the WTC was car - bombed in 1993 by dozens of committed Arabs urinating to generate the " uric acid " needed for its imaginary " home - made " bomb in order to conceal that high - grade military explosives provided by FBI mole Emad Salem were used in that event .
But those were Muslim " terrorists , " easy to convict with the help of Judge Michael Mukasey , since promoted to Attorney General .
Something better was needed for Hatfill , so the FBI tried , and failed :
Although the FBI did not spell out its theory [ about Hatfill ] , this announcement and leaks to the media from federal investigators indicated that the inquiry had embraced the idea that a lone operator or small group with limited resources could have produced the Senate anthrax powder .
This premise now appears to have run its course .
In September 2003 , the FBI 's Michael Mason admitted that the bureau failed to reverse engineer a world - class anthrax powder like the Senate material and expressed regret that Hatfill had been called a " person of interest . "
Hatfill 's story remains instructive for many reasons .
The FBI violated normal investigative procedures by leaking Hatfill 's name to the press and keeping politicians informed about the ongoing investigation .
When Hatfill found a university position , the FBI forced the university to fire him .
The FBI deliberately informed the press in advance of their searches of Hatfill 's residence , both when he voluntarily submitted to a search and when the search was done under warrant , in order to create a media circus and to antagonize and intimidate Hatfill .
The FBI harassed Hatfill by following him everywhere under the pretext that he would strike again if let out of their sight .
The wave of propaganda against Hatfill was so pervasive and effective that when Hatfill reported to D.C. police that the FBI had run over his foot while surveilling him , he was ticketed for " walking to create a hazard . "
FBI sources stated that the Bureau had focused on Hatfill until 2006 , but when a federal judge reviewed the case in 2008 , including still - secret FBI summaries , he opined " There is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that Dr. Hatfill had anything to do with this . "

According to Garrett :
The anthrax investigation , almost from the beginning , was hampered by top - heavy leadership from high ranking , but inexperienced FBI officials , which led to a close - minded focus on just one suspect and amateurish investigative techniques that robbed agents in the field the ability operate successfully .
http://tinyurl.com/6ojel2
Garrett ignores the obvious implications of the fact that there was not a scintilla of evidence against Hatfill , viz. , that the FBI modus operandi against Hatfill -- and Ivins as well -- was " frame 'em and break ' em . "
Garrett notes that " The original complaint accused several government officials , including Ashcroft , of deliberately leaking information about the criminal probe into Hatfill in order to harass him and to hide the FBI 's lack of hard evidence , " but he also states that the $ 5,825,000 settlement included no such admissions without seeming to understand that so much money was paid to avoid having to make that admission or having a jury so find .
One wishes for more hard facts , but instead of taking the convenient route that the FBI investigation of this crucial act of domestic terrorism was hamstrung by stupid , incompetent and inexperienced high - ranking officials , the better interpretation in this case is that the FBI 's wild goose chase was grand political theater to keep the public confused and distracted from the actual terrorists .

Jessica Simpson Pregnant ?
Hold on to your hats everybody becauseis pregnant with a littlebaby .

Yeah , I 'm thinking li'l Miss Simpson just had a case of the bloats , considering the photos below were taken on September 2nd outside Beso in Hollywood .
Nice try though .
This is n't the first time pregnancy rumors have plagued the pop-turned - country star .

Please consider upgrading for better performance ” to other people on my local network .
When you use the net send command in the command prompt , you specify the computer you want it sent to by typing the computer name , it also says on the message which computer it came from , so I changed my computer name to Microsoft , so it appeared , to the technically challenged , that the message actually came from Microsoft .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Yes , we 're dummies .
You .
Me. All 300 million of us .
Clueless .
We should be ashamed .
We 're obsessed about the slogans and rituals of " democracy , " distracted by the campaign , polls , debates , rhetoric , half - truths and outright lies .
McCain ?
Obama ?
Sorry to pop your bubble folks , but it no longer matters who 's president .
Why ?
The real " game changer " already happened .
Democracy has been replaced by Wall Street 's new " disaster capitalism . "
That 's the big game - changer historians will remember about 2008 , masterminded by Wall Street 's ultimate " Trojan Horse , " Hank Paulson .
Imagine : Greed , arrogance and incompetence create a massive bubble , cost trillions , and still Wall Street comes out smelling like roses , richer and more powerful !
Yes , we 're idiots :
While distracted by the " illusion of democracy " in the endless campaign , Congress surrendered the powers we entrusted to it with very little fight .
Congress simply handed over voting power and the keys to trillions in the Treasury to Wall Street 's new " Disaster Capitalists " who now control " democracy . "
Why did this happen ?
We 're in denial , clueless wimps , that 's why .
We let it happen .
In one generation America has been transformed from a democracy into a strange new form of government , " Disaster Capitalism . "
Here 's how it happened :
Three decades of influence peddling in Washington has built an army of 42,000 special - interest lobbyists representing corporations and the wealthy .
Today these lobbyists manipulate America 's 537 elected officials with massive campaign contributions that fund candidates who vote their agenda .
This historic buildup accelerated under Reaganomics and went into hyperspeed under Bushonomics , both totally committed to a new disaster capitalism run privately by Wall Street and Corporate America .
No -bid contracts in wars and hurricanes .
A housing - credit bubble -- while secretly planning for a meltdown .
Finally , the coup de grace :
Along came the housing - credit crisis , as planned .
Press and public saw a negative , a crisis .
Disaster capitalists saw a huge opportunity .
Yes , opportunity for big bucks and control of America .
Millions of homeowners and marginal banks suffered huge losses .
Taxpayers stuck with trillions in debt .
But giant banks emerge intact , stronger , with virtual control over government and the power to use taxpayers ' funds .
They 're laughing at us idiots !
Amazing is n't it , Wall Street 's Disaster Capitalists screwed up , likely planned or let happen this meltdown and recession .
Yet America 's clueless taxpayers just reward them by giving the screw - ups massive bailouts , control over more than $ 2 trillion of tax money , and the power to clean up the mess they made .
Oh yes , we are dummies !
This end game was planned for years in secret war rooms on Wall Street , in Corporate America , in Washington and the Forbes 400 .
Democracy is too cumbersome .
It had to be marginalized for Disaster Capitalism to take over .
Reagan , Bush and Paulson were Wall Street 's " Trojan Horses . "
Naomi Klein summarizes the game in " Shock Doctrine : the Rise of Disaster Capitalism . "
This " new economy " generates enormous profits feeding off other peoples ' misery :
Wars , terror attacks , natural catastrophes , poverty , trade sanctions , subprime housing meltdowns and all kinds of economic , financial and political disasters .
Natural ( Katrina ) or manmade ( Iraq ) , either way " disaster capitalism " creates fortunes .
So you , me and the other 300 million better get out of denial .
America is no longer a democracy .
Voting is irrelevant .
Best case scenario :
We 're a plutocracy , a government ruled by the wealthy , the richest 1 % , the Forbes 400 , the influential wealthy elite , while the other 99 % are their " servants . "
Meanwhile , the inflation - adjusted income of wage - earners has declined for three decades .
Worst case scenario : America's no democracy and as a result of the meltdown and the surrender of our power to Wall Street 's new Disaster Capitalism we are morphing into what one WWII dictator called " corporatism , " a " merger of state and corporate power , " kind of like what 's going on now with Goldman Sachs ' ex-boss as de facto president .
Wolves in sheep 's clothing
Yes , a strong charge .
But like a lot of our readers , I do n't like what 's happening to America .
I 'm a patriot .
I volunteered for the Marines .
Served four years .
Volunteered for Korea .
I do n't like how our freedoms , rights and value system are being subverted in the name of greed , arrogance , self - righteous intolerance and other false gods .
We know for the last eight years disaster capitalists ignored obvious warnings of a coming meltdown .
They apparently planned it .
They road the bull , got very rich .
Now they have the ultimate disaster capitalist weapons , trillions in tax money , virtual control of government .
That 's why I fear we 're on the edge of a dangerous line between Wall Street 's version of disaster capitalism and a toxic " merger of state and corporate power . "
The wolf is in sheep 's clothing .
Wall Street pretends we 're a democracy .
Yet America more closely resembles the kind of " corporatism " that Laurence W. Britt wrote about five years ago in Free Inquiry magazine .
We adapted his historical analysis of 14 key traits for today 's discussion .
Notice how they have a huge impact your investments and retirement :
1. Wall Street rich get first priority
Think " bailout . "
Wall Street 's greedy con game spins out of control globally .
Millions of homeowners misled , lose .
Who gets hundreds of billions first ?
Wall Street 's con men .
2. National security obsession
Think of the expansion of executive powers in the name of national security : Preemptive wars , wiretapping private citizens , Gitmo , torture ; driven by a dark wealthy neocon elite .
3. Superpower with massive military
Think of our $ 3 trillion Iraq / Afghan War .
Disaster capitalists love the thrill of military power .
We outspend all nations , over half the federal budget to strut before the world .
4. Extreme nationalism
Signs are everywhere : Flags , lapel pins , " support the troops " slogans , all to get huge military budgets passed .
Challenge them and you 're un-American and unpatriotic .
5 . Rally the masses by scapegoating enemies
Think " axis of evil , " mushroom clouds , " Islamofascists , " more terrorist attacks on the homeland .
Propaganda creates " enemies " in the public 's mind and distracts from real issues .
6. Corruption and cronyism
Think earmarks , no - bid defense contracts , paid mercenaries outnumbering military in Iraq , superlobbyist Jack Abramoff , biofuels , bridge to nowhere , millions donated to campaigns .
7. Obsession with crime
Think of prison - building as just another investment opportunity , rather than focusing on reforming our criminal justice system .
Stoke irrational fear of criminals and extremists .
8. Labor and low wages
Think corporate earnings versus the wages paid to workers .
No " trickling down , " leaves more for tricklers : Rich insiders , stockholders .
Wages dropping as CEO salaries skyrocket .
9. Contempt for human rights
Think of abuses of habeas corpus , loss of right to trial , bogus charges , plus " demonizing " the victims , all in the name of national defense and homeland security .
10 .
Mass media manipulation
Think of leaking false information , Joseph Wilson , Valerie Plame , Scooter Libby , Colin Powell 's United Nation 's testimony , Condoleezza Rice 's mushroom clouds , WMDs , all to suppress the truth .
11 . Obsession with sexism
Think of paternalism , antigays , antiabortion , subordinate women -- then codify the system as the law of the land reinforcing a male - dominated society , punish violators .
12 . Disdain for intellectuals
Think of conservative intellectuals Francis Fukuyama and Bill Buckley .
Contrast them to Sarah Palin and Joe Sixpack conservatism , Bush 's funding cuts for arts and science education .
13 . Religion in government
Think of all the faith - based programs versus antiscience in drug approvals , creationism vs. evolution , Ten Commandments enshrined in public buildings , public money to churches .
14 . Fraudulent elections
Think of police and prosecutorial intimidation and threats to voters , challenging minority voters , ballots disappearing , party election officials committing outright fraud .
Yes , officially America is still a democracy .
We have enough signs and rituals to support that illusion .
But the truth is America has become a plutocracy run by and for the wealthy .
And since Wall Street 's Disaster Capitalism coup de grace , we are rapidly morphing into a dangerous new government .

What You Gonna Do When The Grid Goes Down ? [ Explicit ]
LISA MORRISON has always considered herself a pillar of health .
She ate only organic food , exercised often and meditated .
The only glitch in her otherwise exemplary existence was the pack of Marlboros that she had inhaled daily since age 18 .
By the time Ms. Morrison , now 50 , went to see Dr. Vincent Giampapa , a board - certified plastic surgeon in Montclair , N.J. , she had tried everything to quit for the sake of her health .
“ Acupuncture , the patch , hypnosis , ” she said .
“ Nothing worked . ”
Nothing , that is , until 2007 , when Dr. Giampapa told her she would have to toss her beloved cigarettes if she wanted a neck - and eye - lift .
“ The doctor strongly suggested that if I wanted to heal properly I needed to quit , ” Ms. Morrison said .
“ When you start talking about your face , it becomes motivating . ”
Each year , roughly 40 to 45 percent of the 45 million smokers nationwide try to quit , according to Dr. Michael Fiore , the director of the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention , in Madison .
Only about 5 percent quit for life .
Gordon Brown today said the British government planned to sue Iceland to recover the deposits of thousands of savers in the nation 's stricken banks .
The chancellor , Alistair Darling , had earlier guaranteed that the government would cover deposits of British savers with Icesave , which yesterday stopped customers from withdrawing money from their accounts
The British government also seized control of Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander and put the business into administration , transferring the £ 2.5 bn of retail deposits in its Kaupthing Edge accounts to ING Direct .
Kaupthing is the largest bank in Iceland and the only one left of the big three still operating in private hands .
Iceland 's woes deepened further this afternoon when Reykjavik put the third largest Icelandic bank Glitnir into receivership .
The government had nationalised the bank two weeks ago but the central bank governor David Oddsson told Icelandic television that the " difficulties of the bank were much greater " than previously estimated .
The central bank also abandoned efforts to put a floor under its slumping currency by pegging it to the euro .
In a news conference today , Brown pledged legal action against the Icelandic government for refusing to honour its obligations after customers were prevented from taking money out of Icesave , an online British arm of Iceland 's second biggest bank Landsbanki .
Landsbanki was taken over by Icelandic authorities yesterday after emergency legislation designed to prevent the tiny nation 's economy going into a complete meltdown .
" We are showing by our action that we stand by people who save , " Brown said .
" We are taking legal action against the Icelandic authorities , to recover the money lost to people who deposited in UK branches of its banks . "
Iceland has suffered a tumultuous few weeks .
The country 's government is scrambling to save the economy from collapse and has asked Russia for a € 4bn loan .
It has introduced emergency laws earlier giving the government sweeping new powers to take over banks , force them to merge or even into bankruptcy .
But the country appeared to sink deeper into the financial crisis today .
Sweden is granting liquidity assistance to the Swedish arms of Kaupthing , with a total loan of up to 5bn crowns ( £ 400 m ) .
ING Direct UK , the British division of the Dutch bank , is buying more than £ 3bn of deposits held by around 180,000 British savers with Kaupthing Edge , the UK arm .
The group also signed an agreement with the Treasury to acquire deposits from Heritable Bank , another British division of Landsbanki .
Today 's action by Sweden comes a day after the Icelandic prime minister , Geir H Haarde , publicly criticised the lack of assistance the country has received from Europe .
The central bank said it believed that Kaupthing was solvent , but was suffering temporary liquidity problems that could have wider repercussions .
" To safeguard financial stability in Sweden and ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets , the Riksbank has therefore decided to grant liquidity assistance to Kaupthing Sverige , " it said in a statement .
With the deregulation of its financial market in the mid-1990s and subsequent stockmarket boom , Iceland had transformed itself into one of the wealthiest nations in Europe .
Many Icelandic banks and companies have invested heavily in Europe , making it even more important to ensure that turmoil is contained .
Kaupthing has also invested in European retail groups , and racked up debts of more than $ 5.25 bn ( £ 3 bn ) to help fund British deals .
The Icelandic government said today that it had extended its own $ 680 m loan to Kaupthing to tide it over .
Trading in the bank was halted on the Nasdaq - OMX , after its shares plunged 34 % this morning .
The Origin of Chinese Yin Yang Symbol
Yin Yang Symbol , Tai - Chi & I - Ching
Where does the Yin Yang Symbol Come From ? is a well - known Chinese Yin Yang symbol .
Sometimes it 's called Tai - Chi symbol .
The Tai - Chi is from I - Ching .
The I - Ching is the greatest foundation of Chinese philosophy .
It 's development is from the natural phenomena of our universe .
Because I - Ching comes from nature , it should be easy .
The Chinese characters of I - Ching are The second character means a book , a profound book .
The first character means ease or change .
Since I - Ching is easy , some people call it as " The Book of Ease " or " The Book of Changes " .
The original Chinese character of is , which is a symbol combining the sun ( top ) and moon ( bottom ) .
It 's easy for people to understand the philosophy by talking about the sun ( Yang ) , moon ( Yin ) and universe .
After observing the universe , ancient Chinese found that the universe is changing every day .
Although it changes easily every day , it also has seasonal and annual cycles .
From these cycles the unchanging rules are created .
However , it 's not easy to use the method to find the unchanging rules from the universe and apply on human activities .
That 's why some people think I - Ching is easy and some do n't .
The Origin of Yin Yang Symbol
The Dipper at Night By observing the sky , recording the Dipper 's positions and watching the shadow of the Sun from an 8 - foot ( Chinese measurement ) pole , ancient Chinese determined the four directions .
The direction of sunrise is the East ; the direction of sunset is the West ; the direction of the shortest shadow is the South and the direction of the longest shadow is the North .
At night , the direction of the Polaris star is the North .
They noticed the seasonal changes .
When the Dipper points to the East , it 's spring ; when the Dipper points to the South , it 's summer ; when the Dipper points to the West , it 's fall ; when the Dipper points to the North , it 's winter .
When observing the cycle of the Sun , ancient Chinese simply used a pole about 8 feet long , posted at right angles to the ground and recorded positions of the shadow .
Then they found the length of a year is around 365.25 days .
They even divided the year 's cycle into 24 Segments , including the Vernal Equinox , Autumnal Equinox , Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice , using the sunrise and Dipper positions .
They used six concentric circles , marked the 24 - Segment points , divided the circles into 24 sectors and recorded the length of shadow every day .
The shortest shadow is found on the day of Summer Solstice .
The longest shadow is found on the day of Winter Solstice .
After connecting each lines and dimming Yin Part from Summer Solstice to Winter Solstice , the Sun chart looks like below .
The ecliptic angle 23 26 ' 19 '' of the Earth can be seen in this chart .
The Hidden Meanings of Yin Yang Symbol The Ecliptic is the Sun 's apparent path around the Earth .
It 's tilted relative to the Earth 's equator .
The value of obliquity of the Ecliptic is around 23 26 ' 19 '' in year 2000 .
By rotating the Sun chart and positioning the Winter Solstice at the bottom , it will look like this .
The light color area which indicates more sunlight is called Yang ( Sun ) .
The dark color area has less sunlight ( more moonlight ) and is called Yin ( Moon ) .
Yang is like man .
Yin is like woman .
Yang would n't grow without Yin .
Yin could n't give birth without Yang .
Yin is born ( begins ) at Summer Solstice and Yang is born ( begins ) at Winter Solstice .
Therefore one little circle Yin is marked on the Summer Solstice position .
Another little circle Yang is marked on the Winter Solstice position .
These two little circles look like two fish eyes .
In general , the Yin Yang symbol is a Chinese representation of the entire celestial phenomenon .
It contains the cycle of Sun , four seasons , 24 - Segment Chi , the foundation of the I - Ching and the Chinese calendar .

The deal is worth $ 3bn , says the oil minister
China 's state - owned oil firm CNPC has agreed a $ 3bn ( £ 1.63 bn ) oil services contract with the government of Iraq .
The two parties renegotiated a 1997 deal to pump oil from the Ahdab oilfield , the Iraqi oil minister said .
Under the new deal , output from the oilfield will be 110,000 barrels per day , up from the 90,000 barrels forecast in the original deal .
The deal is the first major oil contract with a foreign firm since the US - led war in Iraq , reports say .
As security improves , Iraq - which has some of the biggest oil reserves in the Middle East - is trying to bring in foreign oil companies to boost crude output .
It needs billions of dollars of investment after years of war and sanctions .
Other foreign oil companies , such as Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil , are also negotiating deals with the Iraqi government .
The Iraq government says its aim is to increase crude oil production from the current 2.5 m barrels per day to 4.5 m by 2013 .
Final agreement
Production is set to begin at the Ahdab oilfield three years from now and the contract will run for 20 years .
" Finally we have reached an agreement , " Hussain al - Shahristani , the Iraqi oil minister told Reuters .
" The total investment of the project is expected to be about $ 3bn . "
CNPC would own 75 % of a joint venture to be set up for the contract , with the remainder held by Iraq 's Northern Oil Company .
The field is located in Wasit province , 160 kilometres ( 100 miles ) south of Baghdad , in a Shiite - dominated area that has seen sporadic violence .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal appeals court Wednesday blocked the planned release of 17 Chinese Muslims from the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , granting the government more time to argue against the plan .
A guard looks from a tower at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
A three - judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals granted the Bush administration 's motion for an emergency stay and set up a schedule for briefings over the next week to address the complicated issues of the case .
A day earlier , a lower court in Washington ruled the detainees -- who had been in U.S. custody for nearly seven years -- were to be brought to the court by 10 a.m.
Friday so a judge could set them free .
In an emergency motion filed overnight , Justice Department attorneys said only the executive branch -- not the courts -- may decide whether to admit an alien into the United States .
The government further argued the lower court 's decision to free the detainees " threatens serious harm to the interests of the United States and its citizens by mandating that the government release in the nation 's capital 17 individuals who engaged in weapons training at a military training camp . "
The appeals court 's move will halt the release for at least a week .
" We are pleased that the Court of Appeals granted our request for a temporary stay , and we look forward to presenting our case , " Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said .
The detainees , ethnic Uighurs from a mostly Muslim autonomous region in western China , have been in U.S. custody since 2001 .
They fled Afghanistan soon after the U.S. - led bombing campaign began that year , and Pakistani authorities turned them over to the U.S. military .
The United States said the 17 had engaged in weapons training at an Afghan military training camp .
The United States determined in 2004 that the 17 Uighurs were not enemy combatants , but it kept them at Guantanamo while trying to persuade other countries to resettle them .
Do n't Miss Judge orders Chinese Muslims freed from Gitmo
Officials said they were not returned to China because of credible fears that they could be persecuted if returned .
U.S. government lawyers say the law forbids the detainees ' entry into the United States , but efforts to find another nation willing to accept them have been unsuccessful .
The U.S. district judge who ordered the detainees ' freedom Tuesday had planned to hold a hearing to determine under what conditions they would be settled in the United States .
Wells Dixon , an attorney for the 17 , told legal colleagues Wednesday night that he dreaded having to tell his clients Thursday about the Court of Appeals decision .
" I do n't know how I can explain to them that now their release has been postponed indefinitely , " Wells said .
Another attorney from the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York expressed hope that the prisoners would still be released in the not - too - distant future .
" We remain hopeful that justice still means something in this country and that the judge 's release order will eventually stand , " said Emi MacLean .

Why I created this site ?
Hello , my name is Charles Inniss , and I created this site for you .
I have lectured to 1000's of health students , personal trainers , and gym goers , and the # 1 question people ask me when they find out that I am a personal trainer is " How do I get rid of this " ... as they grab their stomachs or love handles .
Being a friendly and cool guy , I would immediately start off into an hour - long response .
I 've been studying all my life to help people be healthier and get in better shape , and no quick response would do justice .
So , I sat down and started thinking about everything that I tell my clients and students about the best ab exercises and the abs in general , and decided to create a website that is all about abs and the best ab exercises .
That way , I could teach more people how to lose stomach fat , strengthen the core muscles , prevent lower back injuries , and stay motivated long enough to see results .

Ab Workouts and Stomach Workout Tips
Constructing an ab workout is fairly easy once you define the goal and understand basic exercise principles .
Exercise can focus on increasing endurance , improving strength , and increasing speed .
Generally speaking , if you perform many repetitions in a slow manner you will most efficiently increase your endurance .
If you perform a moderate number of reps with a moderate tempo and heavier weights you will focus on strength .
And , if you perform motions in a fast and explosive way you will improve speed .
If you do n't belong to a gym , try this simple home workout .
Or if you 're looking for a challenge , try a killer ab workout , and see what I think was my best ab workout ever .

Lower Back Exercises and Lower Back Strengthening Exercises
Your core is only as strong as your weakest link , and unfortunately for most people , their lower back is their weakest link .
In this day of sedentary lifestyles and computer overload , many people develop postural problems and low back pain .
And although having strong abdominal muscles does help to support posture , back exercises are just as important as the best ab exercises .
As a physical therapist , I know that there can be many causes of back pain , but here are two simple things that you can do to improve the function of your back muscles and prevent injury .
1 ) Flexibility - We all sit too much and as a result our spines become stiff .
When your spines become stiff , your body does not move efficiently and the best stomach exercises are much less effective .
Stretching your back is not only good for your back , but it can increase the effectiveness of crunches or any other stomach or core exercise .
2 ) Strength - In multiple studies on back pain , researchers have shown that people with chronic low back pain have muscle atrophy ( deterioration ) in the lower back area .
And if muscles are deteriorating , strength training is a way to build them back up so that they support the back .
So many people focus exclusively on ab exercises in a quest to get a 6 pack or a flat stomach , and they neglect the lower back .
Do n't make the same mistake !
Learn some lower back exercises !
Core Exercises , Core Workouts , and Functional Training
Core Training is a philosophy that swept over fitness in the past 10 years , but so many people do n't really understand the philosophy of core training .
Physiotherapists in Australia did research on chronic lower back pain , and they tested coordination of core muscles during movements of the arm or legs .
What they found is that people who have healthy backs have good coordination - specifically their abdominal and low back muscles - which helps to stabilize the lower back before the arms and legs move .
Conversely , people with chronic lower back pain displayed poor coordination of their core muscles .
In other words , their arms and legs would move before the abdominal and lower back muscles could keep the spine stable .
This research is so important for understanding how the body is supposed to work .
All of our movements are initiated around our core .
When the core muscles are strong and coordinated , our backs are protected from excess pressure .
Core Exercises are an important part of any fitness program .

Exercise Myths
Unfortunately , even the best stomach exercises cannot do everything that we'd like them to do .
The fitness and weight loss industry keeps perpetuating certain myths because it is more profitable to keep people like you believing that exercise and pills work like magic wands .
Ab exercises and supplements can definitely help you to achieve any fitness goal you desire , but magic wands just simply do n't exist .
However , I do believe that getting your knowledge from a true professional can sometimes be so eye - opening that you will feel as if you have a magic wand .
And I hope that after reading every page on this site you 'll know exactly what to do to truly reach your goals .
This site is like your magic wand , but batteries are not included .

Drafting treaties in secret , especially when they concern new crackdowns on intellectual property violations , is a bit like rolling around in red meat , stuffing your pockets with raw hamburger , and jumping into a shark tank ; reaction in both cases is likely to be swift and violent .
Such was the predictable fallout from a leaked document outlining a new Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) being negotiated between the US , Canada , the EU , Japan , and other nations , and it has lead to a spate of lurid online accusations that border agents will soon be searching iPods and laptops for illicit copies of Zoolander .
The reality is less thrilling but potentially more serious .
Hysteria : Not just a Def Leppard album
We 've kept our eye on ACTA since its introduction last year , but there has been precious little to report .
The agreement is being negotiated directly between the key countries and it will bypass existing World Trade Organization and World Intellectual Property Organization structures to create a new set of multilateral rules designed to crack down on counterfeiting and piracy .
No one has seen a draft of the agreement , and no such draft apparently exists .
The various governments involved in negotiations have said little , which is why last week 's leaked release ( PDF ) of an ACTA " discussion paper " has generated such worldwide buzz .
In Ireland , RTE 's coverage suggested that " customs officers should be given the right to search laptops and media players for pirated material " under the treaty .
In Canada , media reports have claimed that " security officials would be charged with checking laptops , iPods and even cellular phones for content that ' infringes ' on copyright laws , such as ripped CDs and movies .
The guards would also be responsible for determining what is infringing content and what is not . "
And in the hands of bloggers , the headlines have grown even scarier .
The document
But when you turn to the document itself , none of this is clear .
For one thing , the document is not even a draft text of a treaty but a set of " examples of the types of provisions that could be included in the agreement . "
While every single one of them could well wind up in the final document , there 's no basis for wild statements about what border guards " would " be charged with doing .
Discussion of ACTA at this point needs a lot more " might " in it .
In any event , the draft does n't say that border guards will be searching iPods .
Or cell phones .
What does it say under the " Border Measures " categories ?
It says that some of the topics under discussion include giving customs authorities the authority to " suspend import , export , and trans - shipment of suspected IPR infringing goods . "
Customs could also impose " deterrent penalties " and could " disclose key information about infringing shipments to right holders . "
Do " import , " " export , " and " shipments " sound like part of a plan that would turn the guy who stamps your passport into someone who scans your iPod for illicit movies ripped ?
Not really .
The real issues
What is interesting about ACTA is a different set of provisions .
The first is one that would allow countries to bring criminal penalties against those who commit " willful infringements without motivation for financial gain to an extent as to prejudicially affect the copyright owner ( e.g. , Internet piracy ) . "
This provision , unlikely to be deployed against individual file - swappers and those who rip movies from their own DVDs , seems clearly targeted at sites like The Pirate Bay and other major hubs , which do n't always operate to make money .
While the US government has yet to go after file - swappers , the ability to bring criminal charges against the big hubs might bring the feds into the fight .
The second key provision here is the creation of a legal regime that would " encourage ISPs to cooperate with right holders in the removal of infringing material " by giving them safe harbor from certain legal threats .
The US DMCA already provides this sort of thing via its " takedown notice " provisions , but in countries like Canada , this could be seen as a way of sneaking DMCA - type rules in through the back door .
The document has lead Canadian legal scholar Michael Geist to write this week , " The effect of these reforms will dramatically reshape Canadian law with Prentice and Prime Minister Stephen Harper rolling out the red carpet for President George Bush 's demands and leaving Canadians wondering how their consumer , property , and privacy rights suddenly disappeared . "
( Geist had earlier submitted comments on ACTA to the Canadian government before many details were available . )
Possibly most worrying to US residents , due to its novelty here , is the discussion about a system to give rights holders a way to " expeditiously obtain information identifying the alleged infringer " of someone 's intellectual property .
Companies can do this now , of course , under judicial oversight through the subpoena process , but that can be slow and expensive .
It 's not clear what ACTA negotiators have in mind , but if this is a way to bypass judicial oversight , it seems ripe for abuse .
It would be especially thorny if it applied across borders , especially in Europe , where judges at the highest levels ( and the European Parliament ) have basically said that file - sharing is too petty a crime for this information to be turned over .
ACTA could be an attempt around those decisions .
While the discussion points do suggest that a couple of nasty new legal mechanisms could emerge from negotiations , the real goal does n't seem to be as much about a massive grab of new powers , at least in the US .
Instead , ACTA looks more like a way to rachet IP rights a little tighter , then push the entire caboodle on every other country , forcing them through trade agreements to adopt US - style IP policy .
Previous WIPO treaties have allowed a good deal of leeway in implementation , especially when it comes to issues of anticircumvention of DRM ; ACTA may prove less forgiving .
IP Justice , which has followed ACTA 's progress for some time , sums it all up : " After the multi-lateral treaty 's scope and priorities are negotiated by the few countries invited to participate in the early discussions , ACTA 's text will be ' locked ' and other countries who are later ' invited ' to sign - on to the pact will not be able to re-negotiate its terms .
It is claimed that signing - on to the trade agreement will be ' voluntary , ' but few countries will have the muscle to refuse an ' invitation ' to join , once the rules have been set by the select few conducting the negotiations . "
A worldwide DMCA on steroids : now is n't that scarier — and way more plausible — than iPod - scanning airport guards ?
The blog says that the reasons for the large scale topiary are unclear , but that it could have been intended as a tongue - in - cheek message of national pride to be picked up by American spy satellites .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
It 's official .
We are Japan .
At least when it comes to monetary policy .
The Federal Reserve 's decision to slash interest rates by a half percentage point to 1 % on Wednesday to help boost the economy was snubbed by the stock market , even though it had demanded the cut like a petulant child for more than two weeks .
See full story
There was nothing the Fed could do , and it's likely the European Central Bank will fall in line next week , as well as the Bank of Japan on Friday .
Central bankers know they need to show coordination and the ability to do something -- anything -- in the teeth of this bear market .
But Bernanke is quickly running out of monetary bullets , with the risk of having to take the extraordinary step of someday lowering interest rates to zero just a bank run or two away right now .
Japan , which spent five unproductive years at zero between 2001 and 2006 before boosting to a half percentage point , is now talking about a quarter point cut and possibly a return to zero , even though it did n't work last time .
See full story .
The economic theory behind zero rates , called quantitative monetary easing -- a term so heinous it is n't recognized by my computer 's spell check -- allows a central bank to run monetary policy by focusing on money supply instead of the cost of the money , i.e. interest rates .
It also means that Joe the Plumber and his elderly parents would get nothing on their savings account or certificates of deposit , which so many people depend on for their fixed - income lifestyles .
How 's that for an invitation to go out and spend ?
Arguably , it was a dramatic easing of interest rates after the tech bubble collapsed that plunked us into the systemic soup in the first place , allowing people to take out mortgages at ridiculous rates and Wall Street to make a killing by packaging the mortgages and playing various rates off each other .
But it wo n't work this time around .
Nobody 's lending , and nobody is borrowing .
Next week , we 'll find out how many Americans bought new cars in October .
Estimates vary , but it 's likely to be about the same number of people who attend a Sen .
Ted Stevens rally this weekend .
Some analysts predict it will be the worst month ever for the automakers , with sales falling between 30 % and 50 % year over year .
Why combining General Motors Corp. GM , - 2.37 % and Chrysler , other than to get private equity firm Cerberus off the hook , is considered a good way to sell more cars is beyond me .
Even if people wanted to buy , they can't get the financing .
That brings us to the major problem the Federal Reserve and the Treasury face if they want to get this bailout out of the showroom .
They have to get the banks to start lending the money they 've been given by the taxpayers .
Hoarding the cash , waiting for another wave of bad loans to come as the economy gets worse , just feeds the bear .
Congress is right to be concerned about this , and to force the Treasury to press Wall Street and the banks to get lending again .
Instead of freaking out about banker bonuses , just tie the bonuses to how much money their institutions lend , not how much they make .
Yes , over - lending got us into this mess , but the global economic engine remains stalled , and needs to be jump started .
Interest rates at 1.5 % , or 1 % , or zero are n't going to do that for us .
I suspect even Ben Bernanke realizes that by now .
It 's time to start cracking heads .
Big pension funds and young investors might be able to wait the months or years it might take for the stock market to come back , but for many Americans , it 's not about whether to sell or hold stocks now .
It 's about getting enough cash to make payments at the end of this month , tomorrow .
Just ask the poor savers whose money is still tied up in The Reserve Fund , the money market fund that froze assets last month after a run .
See New York Times story .
Americans are going into this election next week as angry as they 've been in a long time .
Bankers , politicians and economists would be wise not to mess with them .
What is a shell ?
The IBM ® AIX ® operating system and other UNIX - like operating systems need a way to communicate with the kernel .
This is done is through the use of a shell .
There are a few different shells that you can use , but this article focuses on the Korn shell .
The Korn shell is the default shell used with AIX .
When you log into AIX , you are started at a prompt in a certain directory .
The default directory is usually your home directory .
The reason it ’s called a home directory is because the directory structure is usually something like this :
$ /home / jthomas : Show more Show more icon
When you log in , you are said to be at the command line or command prompt .
This is where you enter UNIX commands .
You enter shell commands that interact with the UNIX kernel .
These commands can be as simple as one line to check the date or multiple lines long , depending on what you ’re doing .
Listing 1 provides some sample commands .
Listing 1 . Sample commands $ date Fri May 1 22:59:28 EDT
2008 $ uptime 10:59 PM up 259 days , 9:44 , 5 users , load average : 3.81 , 14.27 , 13.71 $ hostname gonzo Show more Show more icon
The great thing about shell commands is that you can combine them in a file called a script that allows you to run multiple commands one after another .
This is great when you have to repeat the same commands over and over again .
Instead of repeatedly typing these commands , you can put them in a Korn shell script .
Writing your first Korn shell script
The first line in a Korn shell script is the shell itself .
It is denoted as follows :
#!/bin/ksh
Show more
Show more icon
To write Korn shell scripts on AIX , you need to use a text editor .
The most widely used and most readily available is vi .
It can be a little intimidating at first , but the more you use vi , the more comfortable you will become .
People have written whole books just on how to use the vi text editor .
To begin writing your first Korn shell script , you need to open the vi editor and add the shell name as the first line .
After that , you need to build some type of script header telling users who wrote the script , what the script does , and when it was written .
You can name your script anything you want , but you usually use the extension .ksh to refer to a Korn shell script .
You do not have to do this , but it ’s good practice .
The pound symbol ( # ) is used to comment with scripts , as shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Example of a script header $ vi my_first_script.ksh #!/bin/ksh ###################################################
# Written By : Jason Thomas # Purpose :
This script was written to show users how to develop their first script # May 1 , 2008 ###################################################
Show more
Show more icon
This script header is pretty basic , but it does the trick .
Variables
Setting variables within a script is fairly simple .
I usually capitalize all variables within my scripts , as shown in Listing 3 , but you do n’t have to .
Listing 3 . Example of variables # Define Variables HOME= " /home / jthomas " # Simple home directory DATE =$ ( date ) # Set DATE equal to the output of running the shell command date HOSTNAME =$ ( hostname ) # Set HOSTNAME equal to the output of the hostname command PASSWORD_FILE= " / etc / passwd " # Set AIX password file path Show more Show more icon
Korn shell nuts and bolts
So far , you ’ve learned how to start writing a Korn shell script by writing a basic script header and defining some variables .
Now it ’s time to start writing some Korn shell code .
Start by reading some lines from a file .
In this case , use the /etc / passwd file you already defined in your script , and print just the usernames , as shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 .
The for loop $ vi my_first_script.ksh #!/bin/ksh ###################################################
# Written By : Jason Thomas # Purpose :
This script was written to show users how to develop their first script # May 1 , 2008 ################################################### # Define Variables HOME= " /home/ jthomas " # Simple home directory DATE =$ ( date ) # Set DATE equal to the output of running the shell command date HOSTNAME =$ ( hostname ) # Set HOSTNAME equal to the output of the hostname command PASSWORD_FILE= " / etc / passwd "
# Set AIX password file path # Begin Code for username in $ ( cat $ PASSWORD_FILE | cut ‑f1 ‑d : ) do print $ username done Show more Show more icon
This syntax is called a for loop .
It allows you to open the /etc / passwd file and read each line one at a time , cutting out just the first field in the file and then printing that line .
Notice this special character : | .
This is called a pipe .
Pipes allow you to redirect output from one command into another .
After you save the script , you run it as shown in Listing 5 .
Listing 5 . Running the script $./my_first_script.ksh root daemon bin sys adm uucp nobody lpd Show more Show more icon
The script begins to print the output to the screen .
Alternatively , you can just print the output to a file by doing the following :
print $ username >> /tmp/usernames
Show more
Show more icon
The >> tells the print command to append each username one after another to a file only .
By doing this , you never see the text display on your terminal .
You can also print the output to both the screen and a file by using this command :
print $ username | tee –a /tmp/ usernames
Show more
Show more icon
The tee command allows you to redirect output to your terminal and to a file at the exact same time .
You just learned how to read from a file with a for loop and how to cut out just a username and redirect the output to a file or to your terminal .
Error checking
What happens if the /etc / passwd file did n’t exist to begin with ?
The short answer is the script would fail .
Listing 6 shows the syntax that checks to see if the files exist .
Listing 6 . Syntax for checking to see if a file exists # Begin Code if [ [ ‑e $ PASSWORD_FILE ] ] ; then # Check to see if the file exists and if so then continue for username in $ ( cat $ PASSWORD_FILE | cut ‑f1 ‑d : ) do print $ username done else print " $ PASSWORD_FILE was not found " exit fi Show more Show more icon
This little piece of code shows the conditional if statement .
If the /etc / passwd file exists , then the script continues .
If the file does n’t exist , then the script prints " / etc / passwd file was not found " to the terminal screen and then exits .
Conditional if statements start with if and end with the letters reversed ( fi ) .
The dollar question mark ( $ ? )
Every time you run a command in AIX , the system sets a variable that is often referred to as dollar question .
AIX sets this to either 0 for successful or non-zero for failure .
This is excellent for Korn shell scripting .
Listing 7 shows how the $ ? is set when you run valid and invalid AIX commands .
Listing 7 .
How the $ ? is set for valid and invalid AIX commands $ date Sat May 10 00:02:31 EDT 2008 $ echo $ ?
0 $ uptime 12:02 AM up 259 days , 10:47 , 5 users , load average : 4.71 , 10.44 , 12.62 $ echo $ ?
0 $ IBM ksh : IBM : not found .
$ echo $ ?
127 $ aix ksh : aix : not found .
$ echo $ ?
127 $ ls ‑l /etc / password ls : 0653‑341
The file /etc / password does not exist .
$ echo $ ?

This is helpful when writing Korn shell scripts because it gives you another way to check for errors .
Here ’s a different way to see if the /etc / passwd file exists :
# Begin Code PASSWORD_FILE= " /etc/ passwd " ls –l $ PASSWORD_FILE > / dev/null 2>&1
Show more
Show more icon
This command allows you to list the file .
However , you do n’t really care if the file is there or not .
The important thing is for you to get the return code of the command .
The greater than sign ( > allows you to redirect output from the command .
You will learn more about redirecting output later in this article .
Listing 8 shows how to use $ ? in a script .
Listing 8 . Using $ ? in a script # Begin Code PASSWORD_FILE= " /etc/ passwd " ls –l $ PASSWORD_FILE > / dev/null 2>&1 if [ [ $ ? != 0 ] ] ; then print “ $ PASSWORD_FILE was not found " exit else for username in $ ( cat $ PASSWORD_FILE | cut ‑f1 ‑d : ) do print $ username done fi Show more Show more icon
Instead of actually checking to see if the file exists , I tried to list the file .
If you can list the file , then the file exists .
If you ca n’t list it , then it does n’t exist .
You list a file in AIX by using the ls –l filename ls –l filename command .
This gives you a way to test to see if your AIX command was successful by checking the $ ? variable .
Standard in , out , and error
You really need to understand these .
You basically have three sources of input and output .
In AIX , they are referred to as STDIN , STDOUT , and STDERR .
STDIN refers to the input you might get from a keyboard .
STDOUT is the output that prints to the screen when a command works .
STDERR prints to the screen when a command fails .
The STDIN , STDOUT , and STDERR file descriptors map to the numbers 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .
If you want to check to see if a command was a success or a failure , you do something like Listing 9 .
Listing 9 . Redirecting output to STDOUT and STDERR $ date > dev/null 2>&1
# Any output from this command should never be seen if [ [ $? = 0 ] ] ; then print " The date command was successful " else print " The date command failed fi Show more Show more icon
This code runs the AIX date command .
You should never see any output from STDOUT ( file descriptor 1 ) or STDERR ( file descriptor 2 ) .
Then you use the conditional if statement to check the return code of the command .
As you learned previously , if the command returns a zero , then it was successful ; if it returns a non -zero , then it failed .
Functions
In Korn shell scripting , the word function is a reserved word .
Functions are a way to divide the script into segments .
You only run these segments when you call the function .
Create an error - check function based on the code you ’ve already written , as shown in Listing 10 .
Listing 10 .
Error-check function ################## function if_error ################## { if [ [ $? ‑ne 0 ] ] ; then #check return code passed to function print " $ 1 " # if rc > 0 then print error msg and quit exit $ ?
fi } Show more
Show more icon
If I want to run a simple command from inside a script , I can easy write some code similar to the error checking of the $ ? above .
I can also just call the if_error function every time I want to check to see if something failed , as shown in Listing 11 .
Listing 11 .
Calling the if_error function rm –rf / tmp / file # Delete file if_error " Error : Failed removing file / tmp / file " mkdir / tmp / test # Create the directory test if_error " Error : Failed trying to create directory / tmp / test "
Show more Show more icon
Each time one of the above commands is run , a call is made to the if_error function .
The message you want to display for that particular error check is passed to the if_error function .
This is great because it allows you to write the shell script code one time , but you get to leverage it over and over .
This makes writing shell scripts quicker and easier .
The case statement
The case statement is another conditional statement that you can use in place of using an if statement .
The case statement begins with the word case and ends with the reverse ( esac ) .
A case statement allows you to quickly build upon it as your script evolves and needs to perform different tasks .
Listing 12 provides an example .
Listing 12 .
The case statement case value in " Mypattern " ) commands to execute when value matches Mypattern ;; esac Show more Show more icon
So , say that you want to delete a file at different times of the day .
You can create a variable that checks to see what time it is :
TIME=$ ( date + %H%M )
Show more
Show more icon
The code shown in Listing 13 will delete a file at 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m .
So , each time this section of code is executed , the $ TIME is checked to see if it matches the times of the case statement .
If so , then the code is executed .
Listing 13 . case statement to check time case $ TIME in " 2200 " ) # This means 10:00 rm –rf /tmp/file1 ;; " 2300 " ) #This means 11:00 rm –rf /tmp/file1 ; ; " ∗ " ) echo " Do nothing " > / dev/null ;; esac

Putting a whole script together
So far , you ’ve created a script header and some simple variables and added a function , as shown in Listing 14 .
Listing 14 .
Example Korn shell script $ vi my_second_script.ksh #!/bin/ksh ###################################################
# Written By : Jason Thomas # Purpose :
This script was written to show users how to develop their first script # May 1 , 2008 ################################################### # Define Variables HOME= " /home/ jthomas "
# Simple home directory TIME=$ ( date + %H%M ) # Set DATE equal to the output of running the shell command date HOSTNAME =$ ( hostname ) # Set HOSTNAME equal to the output of the hostname command ################## function if_error ################## { if [ [ $? ‑ne 0 ] ] ; then #check return code passed to function print " $ 1 " # if rc > 0 then print error msg and quit exit $ ? fi } if [ [ ‑e / tmp / file ] ] ; then # Check to see if the file exists first rm –rf / tmp / file # Delete file if_error " Error : Failed removing file / tmp / file " else print " / tmp / file does n’t exist " fi if [ [ ‑e / tmp / test ] ] ; then mkdir / tmp / test # Create the directory test if_error " Error : Failed trying to create directory / tmp / test " else print " Directory exists , no need to create directory " fi case $ TIME in " 2200 " ) rm –rf /tmp/file1 ;; " 2300 " ) rm –rf /tmp/ file1 ;; # End Script esac

To run the script , you simply type ./scriptname.ksh ./scriptname.ksh , like this :
$./my_second_script.ksh
Show more
Show more icon
Feeding input into a script from the command line
You can create scripts that allow you to feed input into the script .
Look at Listing 15 .
Listing 15 .
Feeding input into a script
#!/bin/ksh OPTION=$ 1 print " I love $ OPTION " $./ scriptname milk I love milk $./ scriptname tea I love tea $./ scriptname " peanut butter " I love peanut butter Show more Show more icon
Any time you feed something into a script , the first option after the script name is called $ 1 .
The second option after the script name is called $ 2 , and so on .
This is a great way to write a script so that it is more like a UNIX command with switches or options .
E-mail from a script
You can use your scripts to generate some type of report .
For instance , maybe a script was written to keep track of new users added to the system daily .
This script could write the output to a file , and then you could send it to yourself .
This way , you could get a copy of all the new users added to the system every day .
To do this , run the following command :
$ REPORT= " / tmp/users " cat $ REPORT | mailx –s " User admin report from server XYZ " Jason_Thomas@kitzune Show more
Show more icon
This will send you an e-mail of the contents in the $ REPORT file .
The -s is what the subject of the e-mail will be .
This can come in really handy .
Conclusion
Korn shell scripting can save you a lot of time and make your job so much easier .
It can seem intimidating at first , but remember to always start out simple and build upon each and every script .
Always follow the same steps : build your script header , define your variables , and error check your work .
You just might find yourself trying to write a script for everything you do .

REUTERS - India launched its first unmanned moon mission on Wednesday , following in the footsteps of its Asian rivals China and Japan , as it tries to show off its scientific know - how and claim a bigger chunk of global space business .
The PSLV - C11 ( Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ) , Chandrayaan - 1 sits on the second launch pad of Satish Dhawan space centre at Sriharikota , about 100 km north of Chennai in this October 11 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Babu
Here are some basic facts about the project :
* The unmanned rocket is called Chandrayaan - 1 .
It costs 3.86 billion rupees ( $ 79 million ) , has a take - off weight of more than 1.3 tonnes , and is being sent on a two - year mission to orbit the moon .
* India will be the third Asian country to send an unmanned mission into the lunar orbit .
Chandrayaan - 1 is much cheaper than spacecrafts launched by India ’s Asian rivals .
China ’s first lunar probe cost over $ 187 million when it launched in October 2007 , while Japan ’s Kayuga , launched in September 2007 , cost $ 480 million .
* Chandrayaan ( “ moon vehicle ” ) plans to map a three - dimensional atlas of the moon , and the surface ’s chemical and mineral composition .
* The rocket carries 11 payloads -- five from India , two from the USA , and one each from Germany , Britain , Sweden and Bulgaria .
* About 1,000 scientists have worked on the project for four years .
* India plans to send an astronaut into space by 2014 and a manned mission to the moon by 2020 .
The Indian government has approved the launch of Chandrayaan - 2 , which is expected to take off between 2010 and 2012 , and will include a rover that will land on the moon .
* At least 16 Indian satellites currently orbit the earth , supporting telecommunications , TV broadcasting , earth observation , weather forecasting , remote education and healthcare .
* India started its space programme in 1963 , developing its own satellites and launch vehicles to reduce dependence on overseas agencies .
India ’s constellation of seven earth - observation satellites is the largest in the world .
* In 1959 , the sphere - shaped Soviet spacecraft Luna 1 became the first spacecraft to orbit the moon .

Thanks !
The first time I spoke with John Harris and Jim VandeHei was in late 2006 , just after they fled from The Washington Post to launch a newspaper called The Capitol Leader .
Another Hill - focused newspaper and website ?
I was skeptical .
But they were confident , with aspirations of playing in the big leagues and scooping the Post and the Times during the 2008 campaign and beyond .
Well ,
The Capitol Leader quickly morphed into The Politico — later POLITICO — and started breaking political stories big and small , and my skepticism subsided when I found myself pitching ideas in Rosslyn , Va. , the following summer .
And now , more than 4,000 posts later , I ’m leaving Rosslyn and POLITICO .
There are too many thanks to go around among the editors , reporters and production staffers who make this operation work day to day , including all those who sent countless tips , story suggestions and advice .
I 'll leave a lot out , but here it goes .
Special thanks to Bill Hamilton , for editorial guidance , and to Matt Wuerker , for giving me the privilege of having a caricature done by a Pulitzer finalist !
For those too rare moments I was n't tethered to a laptop , I 'd like to thank Patrick Gavin , Avi Zenilman and others who pitched in to keep the blog churning .
Thanks to Danielle Jones and Vaughn Ververs for helping promote posts on this blog to the home page ; same to Katherine Lehr for CLICK .
And thanks to Ben Smith , too , since , if not for him , I never would have headed to D.C. in the first place .
More special thanks to everyone on the Web and media teams who were available on a moment ’s notice to help with images and video that appeared on this blog , as well as to the copy editors for jumping in to fix any number of spelling and grammatical mistakes .
Huge thanks to management for allowing an incredible amount of freedom each day to blog as I saw fit .
And countless thanks to readers .
I learned so much from e-mails and IMs , whether it was a link to something I 'd missed or a bit of perspective on how the media - politics nexus is looking from outside the Beltway ( always important to keep in mind ) .
Even within the loads of hate mail I got regularly from the left and the right , there were some helpful nuggets buried between the expletives and accusations that I was a communist , fascist or whatnot .
Thanks to everyone at the various news organizations I covered who took the time to help me better understand what was really going on at their respective newspapers , magazines and networks .
And thanks to the PR teams who dealt with innumerable requests when my self - imposed deadline to post an item was perhaps two minutes away .
So why leave ?
Here ’s what VandeHei told me in November 2006 , the day he left the Post for a brand - new online venture : “ I have one of the coolest jobs in journalism .
Why would I give it up for this ? ”
Good question !
But I ’m now very excited to join Yahoo !
News as part of a new project being helmed by Andrew Golis and Chris Lehmann and with a fast - growing group of excellent bloggers .
I ’ll still be writing on all things media , and the project will be getting off the ground soon .
For now , the best way to keep up with what 's going on is to follow me on Twitter ( please ! ) .
I can also be reached by e-mail at michael.l.calderone[at]gmail.com .
My AIM handle remains the same as it's been for years : observermlc .
So I 'm still accessible for links , suggestions or tips to report out .
That said , I 'll probably be taking a short Internet break and might not be responding as quickly as usual to IMs , tweets and e-mails for the next week or so .
Actually really looking forward to that .

Categories : Washington Post Reporters expect another convention marathon
It 's still a few years until the Republican and Democratic conventions , but journalists are already thinking about dealing with another political marathon like end of summer 2008 .
Personally , I thought it was easier having back - to - back conventions — going straight from Denver to St. Paul — but I know that some other reporters saw things differently .
Now , POLITICO 's Patrick Gavin gets some political journalists to weigh in on the GOP kicking things off Aug. 27 , and Democrats starting a week later , on Sept. 3 . Jonathan Weisman , who writes for the Wall Street Journal , hoped for something different .
" As a parent of two young kids , it 's brutal . "
Bloomberg / The Week's Margaret Carlson jokes that the format " is the party 's way of punishing reporters . "
The Washington Post 's Dana Milbank says , " I would like them to hold the conventions in warm places in February . "
Many reporters , however , see the benefit in constant convention coverage .
" In today 's world , which is to say the 24/7 continuous news cycle era , it makes as much or more sense to do them back to back , " says The Washington Post 's Dan Balz .
" The general election has long since started by the time of the conventions , so why not pack them close together and treat them almost as one continuous event ? ”

A thaw ?
For anyone reading this blog over the past couple years , you 've probably noticed the steady stream of bad news about the news industry — layoffs , cutbacks , buyouts — and numerous publications simply going under .
And yes , unemployment remains high nationwide and the economic outlook is far from rosy .
But in the media world , The Observer 's John Koblin sees a bit more movement and expansion than in a very long time .
It may be a small boomlet , but for the first time in a long while , there ’s a pulse in the New York journalism job market .
“ I would absolutely say that is the trend , ” said Time Inc. human - relations guru Bucky Keady .
“ I ’ve certainly seen more revolving door stuff , ” said Josh Tyrangiel , the new editor of Bloomberg BusinessWeek , who is keeping a careful eye on the market as he trolls for new editors and writers .
“ People are moving , and places that have people leaving are filling the slots . ”

Categories : Wall Street Journal Murdoch : NYT has ' an agenda ' ;
Times responds Rupert Murdoch spoke last night at the National Press Club about media battles of the past , present and future , while assuring interviewer Marvin Kalb that he ’s “ not at war with the world . ”
Still , the 79 - year - old mogul has never been adverse to conflict .
“ We ’ve been involved in media wars , television wars and all type of media wars , yes , and I ’ve enjoyed them . ”
Murdoch weighed in on several ongoing skirmishes during a taping of “ The Kalb Report , ” including the Wall Street Journal ’s upcoming launch of a New York edition to take on The Times and trying to stop Google , or other news aggregators , from using his newspapers ’ content .
Murdoch , whose Times of London just began charging for content online , said that “ newspapers ought to stand up " to aggregators and expects more will put up paywalls .
A lover of newsprint , Murdoch said that he begins each day by reading the Journal and his New York Post in print , along with parts of The Times .
“ I do n’t read the Washington Post , ” he said .
“ I probably should , but I do n’t . ”
But outside of print , Murdoch said he keeps tabs on the Journal and Times ’ websites all day on two large computer screens .
And during the interview , Murdoch pulled out a “ wonderful ” product that he said “ may be the savior of newspapers " : Apple ’s iPad .
Murdoch , who only recently started using e-mail and does n't carry his own BlackBerry , demonstrated for the audience how the Journal looks on the world 's hottest new device .
Murdoch said that while he respects the Times , the paper has " very clearly an agenda " and publishes “ anything that Obama wants . ”
He also said he believes some of New York 's Jewish community think the paper ’s " too critical of Israel . ”
He brushed off a question about the Journal recently using Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. ’s photo for a story about effeminate - looking men , saying it was just a joke .
Over the years , Murdoch has spoken out in favor of free markets and strongly supports Israel .
But at the same time , he 's always remained somewhat cagey about his specific political views ( and has supported politicians from various parties when worthwhile for his business interests ) .
Kalb tried drawing out whether he's on the same page as his Fox commentators , but the mogul instead described himself as “ a radical . ”
As for his thoughts on Obama , Murdoch said that “ unlike the rest of the country , I think he does well . ”
“ I think he ’s missing a great opportunity for a wonderful legacy by not tackling the education system in this country , ” Murdoch said , adding that while he ’s made good speeches , “ he has not really pressed the unions . ”
( Earlier , Murdoch spoke about how breaking up the unions in England led to better papers . )
During the Q & A , several audience members asked Murdoch about his ownership of Fox News — such as whether the coverage is objective or if there are Democrats on the network .
Ari Rabin - Havt , from the liberal watchdog Media Matters , began the Q & A by rattling off statistics of Fox ’s coverage of the tea parties and asked if it was appropriate for a news network to promote the movement .
" No , ” he responded .
“ I do n't think we should be supporting the tea party or any other party . ”
Murdoch said he ’d have to investigate before commenting further .
UPDATE : Times spokesperson Robert Christie responds to POLITICO : " The goal of The New York Times is to cover the news as impartially as possible .
Any claim to the contrary is simply wrong . "

Shuster suspended MSNBC brass was n't happy when news broke this week that David Shuster had taped a pilot for CNN , and the anchor was n't on - air yesterday .
Now comes word of Shuster 's fate through an MSNBC spokesperson : " David has been suspended indefinitely . "
It 's not the first time he 's been suspended .
Shuster was off the air a couple weeks in 2008 after he talked about how Hillary Clinton had " pimped out " Chelsea on the campaign trail .
And in January , he was reprimanded for a series of tweets criticizing James O'Keefe ( who he was covering at the time ) .
Since then , Shuster 's Twitter account has gone silent .
According to the Observer 's report , the CNN pilot was for a news show featuring Shuster and NPR's Michel Martin as co-anchors .
It also included , according to the report , " medical and opinion segments , and included appearances by several current CNN contributors . "
Word of Shuster 's CNN pilot caught the network by surprise .
TVNewser reported that MSNBC president Phil Griffin learned about it on vacation , and on the phone with Shuster , " ripped him a new one . "
Shuster , who 's been on MSNBC at various times over the past couple of years , while also filling in on shows such as " Countdown , " most recently had the 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. slots .

A new kind of " Crossfire " ?
New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wades into the " how to fix CNN " debate today with some advice of his own .
What might work , instead , is a cable news network devoted to actual debate .
For all the red - faced shouting , debate is n’t really what you get on Fox and MSNBC .
Hannity has ditched Colmes , and conservatives are only invited on Rachel Maddow ’s show when they have something nasty to say about Republicans .
There ’s room , it would seem , for a network where representatives from the right and left can both feel comfortable , and compete on roughly equal terms .
Sort of like they did on ... “ Crossfire . ”
But not the “ Crossfire ” of 2004 .
CNN overreacted to Jon Stewart ’s jeremiad , but he was n’t entirely wrong .
The show was years removed from its Michael Kinsley / Pat Buchanan glory days , and its liberal hosts at the time , Begala and James Carville , really were Democratic Party hacks .
( The conservatives , Carlson and Robert Novak , were much more independent - minded , but the constant need to rebut partisan talking points took its toll on them as well . )
What cable news needs , instead , is something more like what Stewart himself has been doing on “ The Daily Show . ”
Instead of bringing in the strategists , consultants and professional outrage artists who predominate on other networks , he ushers conservative commentators into his studio for conversations that are lengthy , respectful and often riveting .
Stewart ’s series of debates on torture and interrogation policy , in particular — featuring John Yoo and Marc Thiessen , among others — have been more substantive than anything on Fox or MSNBC .

Is Sarah Palin a politician , a pundit or some new political - media hybrid ?
The debate rages .
Today , David Carr looks at Brand Palin following last Thursday 's premiere of her Fox News show , writing that " with its tales of uplift and pluck , ' Real American Stories ' trades in the kind of easy sentimentality that provokes eye rolls among those of us who work in media while quickening the pulse and patriotic ardor of almost everyone else . "
( That take landed Carr a feisty , albeit anonymous , response . )
“ It ’s not the kind of thing that ’s going to excite you guys on the East Coast , but everyone else is dying to hear stories like these , ” said one of her representatives who was not authorized to speak on the record but was authorized to slam the East Coast .
Ms. Palin ’s politics can border on the atavistic , but beyond her Tea Party theatrics , she has tunneled her own route into the public consciousness and gone into the Sarah Palin Across America business .
And what a business it is .

Categories : Magazines Remnick is ' player - coach ' at the New Yorker Although David Remnick has been known to pound out 10,000 to 20,000 - word pieces while still editing The New Yorker , I still expected a slimmer volume on Obama — perhaps expanding on his Joshua Generation piece — rather than a full biography stretching over 670 pages .
The Times looks at Remnick 's ability to take on various roles in today 's profile , " Making It Look Easy at The New Yorker . "
He reports , writes and edits , a player - coach combination that works in magazine about as often as a Bill Russell shows up in the National Basketball Association ; his families , writers and advertising clients feel like they are his focus ; and he counts pennies at one of the most luxe publishing companies in the world .
At the same time , like his apparently cool - headed subject , Mr. Remnick works hard to seem as if he is not working hard .
“ He likes to pretend that there ’s no sweat , ” said Malcolm Gladwell , a New Yorker staff writer and an old colleague from The Washington Post .
“ He cruises around and chats with people and then disappears and writes thousands of words in 15 minutes .
It ’s all part of that ‘ making it look easy ’ thing . ”
It ’s hard to make running any magazine , even The New Yorker , look easy these days .
Last year , the magazine ’s ad pages fell 24 percent , a little less than the industry average .
But Mr. Remnick managed to eke out a small operating profit ( excluding corporate overhead charges ) by cutting costs , as he had for years .

New measurements of a rare but potent greenhouse gas finds levels to be four times higher than previously thought .
Nitrogen trifluoride ( NF 3 ) , used mainly in the manufacture of flatscreen TVs and microcircuits , is 17,000 times more powerful at trapping heat than an equal mass of carbon dioxide .
Although NF 3 is currently responsible for only 0.15 percent of human - induced global warming , the new analysis indicates that levels of the gas
are rising " quasi - exponentially " [ New Scientist ] .
Scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California looked at air samples taken in California and in Australia .
They found that over the past three decades , the atmospheric concentration of the gas has increased more than 20 - fold , from 0.02 to 0.454 parts per trillion , with most emissions occurring in the Northern Hemisphere .
The overall amount of the gas in the atmosphere , estimated in 2006 at less than 1,200 tonnes , was then actually 4,200 tonnes and has since risen to 5,400 tonnes , they report in
Geophysical Research Letters[ subscription required ] [ Nature News ] .
Yet the Kyoto protocol does not set limits on NF 3 emissions because it was made in tiny amounts when the protocol was agreed in 1997 [ New Scientist ] .
The gas was introduced in the last decade as a safer alternative to perfluorocarbon gases ( PFCs ) , another potent greenhouse gas that is regulated by the Kyoto protocol .
However , the dangers of NF 3 emissions were not publicized until earlier this year , and previous techniques could not accurately gauge levels of the gas in the atmosphere .
" Now we need to get hard numbers on how much is flowing through the system , from production to disposal , "
says Michael Prather , an atmospheric chemist .
[ New Scientist ]
Scientists are pushing for tighter regulations of
NF 3
. Ray Weiss , co-author of the new study , says , " From a climate perspective , there is a need to add nitrogen trifluoride to the suite of greenhouse gases whose production is inventoried and whose emissions are regulated under the Kyoto Protocol , thus providing meaningful incentives for its wise use " [ Reuters ] .

Alright , just because you people liked it so much ( and I think you 're crazy for doing so ) I 've updated it a bit .
Well , quite alot actually .
So now it 's a bit more worthy of all those favs it 's got .
Click on the buttons in the lower left corner to change the amount of lines and their rotation , and click anywhere on the scene to change the appearance of the lines .
You can aslo click on the little buttons in the lower right corner to switch between a black and white background .
Enjoy .
Added the original type of line because one person told me they liked it better as it was before .
And while I was at it , I added another one too .
edit : Added three types of lines , and took all the old arrangements and copy - paste - and - flipped them .
Why did n't I think of that before -_- I know , I 've updated this one alot and have n't uploaded anything new , I 'm working on something else but it's a much bigger thing so it 'll take a while .
¨¨¨
The new script is a bit long so I 'll just leave the old one :
Here 's the old script , which is put on four copies of the same movieclip placed in the center of the Scene .
They 're initially rotated 0 ( 360 ? ) , 90 , 180 , and 270 degrees , to make it so , well , you figure it out .
It 's pretty simple really .
onClipEvent ( load ) {
x=0 // where the dot is
y=0 // where the dot is
xmove=0 //it 's movement
ymove=0 //it 's movement
}
onClipEvent ( enterFrame ) {
xmove+= ( _root._xmouse-_x-x)/10 //math
ymove+= ( _root._ymouse-_y-y )/10 //math
x+=xmove+(_root._xmouse-_x-x)/10 //math
y+=ymove+(_root._ymouse-_y-y )/10 //math
clear ( )
lineStyle ( 1,000000,100 )
moveTo ( oldx , oldy )
lineTo(x , y )
oldx=x // this is so that in the next frame it knows where the dot was last frame
oldy=y // this is so that in the next frame it knows where the dot was last frame
_rotation -- // This is negative on two of the movieclips ( that initially have an opposite rotation to eachother ) , and positive on the other two .

AT&T Goes Dark In Wake Of Hurricane Posted by Pile ( 10570 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Faulty Products ]
Despite the day earlier , statements being issued by major cellular companies that they were prepared for Gustav , one company was n't .
AT&T customers in the New Orleans area experienced a total loss of cellular service for almost the entire day during the impact of Hurricane Gustav in Louisiana .
I had a friend stay with me in the city .
His phone was with AT&T .
He lost service sometime around 7:00 am , the time Gustav was making landfall , and service was not restored until more than 12 hours later -- at one point his phone became active and said , " Emergency calls only " yet he was unable to make any kind of call -- it was as if AT&T was mocking him .
Later that evening , he received a text message , AT&T was sorry for the outage and were going to offer their customers a free month of service .
This seems to be particularly hypocritical given AT&T 's new ad campaign touting the " reliability " of their network to be helpful to people when they need to make important calls .
Apparently , a life - and - death situation like a massive hurricane is not serious enough for AT&T to ensure its infrastructure operates .
This is particularly shameful considering we know of no other cell providers that lost service .
I was with Verizon and had cell service throughout the event .
Let this be a lesson to some of you ....

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) 1394 working group behind the development of FireWire in both its 400 Mbps and 800 M bps configurations has formally approved the next - generation S1600 and S3200 standards .
These two standards build on the already established FireWire ecosystem , and will offer speeds of 1.6 Gbps and 3.2 GBps , respectively .
The final specification itself should be published in October , but there 's no word on when we 'll see shipping product , or what the adoption ratio between S1600 and S3200 will be .
Backwards compatibility concerns , thankfully , should be kept to a minimum .
The new S1600 / S3200 cables will be fully compatible with both older FireWire 800 cables and FireWire 400/800 devices .
S3200 , meanwhile , is n't the end of the line for FireWire technology , as current plans call for the interface to scale up to at least 6.4 Gb /s over time .
That 's not going to happen any time soon , but there 's obviously still plenty of headroom in the interface itself .
The IEEE 1394 standard will face a new competitor in the form of USB 3.0 .
USB 3.0's specification is expected to be published by the end of the year , which may give S3200 a few months ' head start .
FireWire , however , has never enjoyed the widespread success of USB 3.0 , and as a result , could find itself the first standard out the door , but the last standard on the shelf .
Motherboard manufacturers will drop USB 3.0 on high - end boards as soon as chipsets are available ( even if devices are n't ) , but FireWire ports are considerably harder to come by .
That 's not to say they do n't exist , but FireWire 400 is easier to find than FireWire 800 ( except on Macs ) , and the number of available ports is typically limited to 1 - 2 , even on a high - end motherboard .
USB 2.0 ports , on the other hand , are plentiful , with most boards offering 8 - 12 in some combination of included ports and onboard headers .
The peripheral interconnect field is also more crowded now , and S1600 / S3200 will have to compete against eSATA , as well .
Daring to mention USB 2.0's dominance over FireWire inevitably brings the standard 's defenders out of the woodwork , and to be fair , FireWire has always been the more technologically - advanced standard , with its faster transfer speeds , lower CPU utilization , and the ability to provide more power to attached devices ( devices that can run off a single FireWire port could well require two USB ports ) .
These advantages , however , have never managed to overcome USB 2.0's general popularity , and FireWire remains a niche interface outside certain peripheral markets ( i.e. , video cameras ) , where it has always done well , and Macintosh computers .
Broad market penetration notwithstanding , the appearance of a faster FireWire standard will be warmly greeted by anyone frustrated by FireWire 800 transfer speeds who does n't want to deal with the potential hassles of USB 3.0 .
Several websites linking to Michael Moore 's freebie film Slacker Uprising have received cease - and - desist letters demanding removal of the torrents .
The legal crackdown , news of which surfaced this week , seems like an odd move :
The film was released online in September as a free gift to Moore 's fans in the United States and Canada , with an e-mail from the director giving them permission to " share it or show it in any way you see fit . "
The problem comes from international distribution of Slacker Uprising through the peer - to - peer sites , according to a lawyer from the firm of Franklin , Weinrib , Rudell & Vassallo , which issued the takedown notices .
" My purpose was to address unauthorized online dissemination outside the scope of authorization offered by Michael Moore , " said attorney Neil Rosini in a phone interview Friday .
" If a server makes the film available outside of the U.S. and Canada , then it 's infringing copyright . "
The move seems antithetical to the spirit of Moore 's maverick distribution plan , which drew more than 2 million visitors to the Slacker Uprising site during the week of the movie 's release .
The film , which documents Moore 's 62 - city tour in support of John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election , shot to the top slot on Amazon.com 's Video on Demand movie rentals list .
At the time , Moore claimed he wanted audiences to " not only download it , but also to e-mail it , burn it and share it with anyone and everyone . "
But according to Moore 's publicity team , the documentary maker only owns the North American rights to the film .
So , while he 's happy to distribute it for free , the Weinstein Company , which owns international distribution rights , may not be so inclined .
Moore addressed the issue in a note to fans before the movie 's release : " If you live outside the U.S. and Canada , I 'm sorry that I do n't own the rights to make this film available to you for free .
But it will be coming to a theater , video store or television network near you soon . "
Wired.com has requested an interview with Moore to discuss the crackdown ; we 'll update the post if and when it happens .
What would you ask Moore ?
Let us know in the comments below .

Here 's a prediction :
The media will report today that the federal budget deficit is big and getting bigger .
What most of them wo n't report , alas , is that the cause of these deficits is an explosion in federal spending .
The era of big government is back , bigger than ever .
The real news in yesterday 's Congressional Budget Office semiannual report is that federal expenditures on everything from roads to homeland security to health care will on present trends reach 21.5 % of GDP next year .
That 's a larger share of national output than at anytime since 1992 .
If the cost of the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac prove to be large and are taken into account , next year federal outlays could be higher as a share of the economy than at anytime since World War II .
In this decade alone , federal spending has increased by almost $ 1.2 trillion , or 57 % .
The federal deficit is expected to hit $ 407 billion for fiscal 2008 ( which ends at the end of this month ) and $ 438 billion next year .
Still , the deficit is expected to be only 3 % of GDP , which is in line with the average of the last 30 years .
We hope Congress and the Presidential candidates do n't obsess over the deficit per se , because the real fiscal drag from government comes from how much it spends , not how much it borrows .
The Bush tax cuts also are n't the budget problem .
Until this year federal tax collections have been surging .
In the four years after the 2003 tax cuts become law , tax receipts exploded by $ 785 billion .
This year revenues have declined by 0.8 % , but a major reason is the $ 150 billion bipartisan tax rebate that has hit the Treasury without spurring the economy .
Without these nonstimulating rebates , federal tax payments would have climbed another 2.5 % , according to CBO .
Revenue is expected to be a healthy 18.5 % of GDP next year without any tax increase .
Another myth is that the war on terror has busted the budget .
While operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are expensive , defense spending is $ 605 billion this year , or about 4.5 % of GDP .
That only seems large by comparison to the holiday from history of the 1990s , when defense fell to 3 % of GDP .
As recently as 1986 , defense spending was 6.2 % of GDP .

A man who had been fired from his job has been convicted of murdering a former colleague after she went into work at the weekend and found him stealing computers .
Matthew Fagan is an American who graduated from high school in a logging town in Washington state .
Cathy Marlow was a New Zealand expat , who had spent 18 months in London working as a finance manager .
THE KILLER Matthew Fagan was born in September 1975 Graduated from Columbia High School in White Salmon , Washington in 1994 Came to London in 2000 Married a German woman in 2003 Worked at Research Now from April 2005 to April 2006 Murdered Cathy Marlow in January 2007 Convicted of murder in September 2008 A cruel quirk of fate put them together one day .
She ended up dead and he now faces life in prison .
Judge Brian Barker , the Common Sergeant of London , said : " She made a fateful decision to go to work on a Saturday .
Her diligence cost her her life . "
Miss Marlow 's body was found , fully clothed , in a shower cubicle at her office on 13 January last year .
She had been tied up and throttled with her own scarf .
It was a Saturday and Cathy had come into the offices of Research Now , a market research company , at the weekend to finish off some work .
The 28 - year - old had been on holiday to Egypt and felt bad for falling behind with her work .
Miss Marlow was throttled with her own scarf
She arrived at the office at 0915 GMT and had arranged to meet a friend for lunch .
At 1330 GMT she spoke to her friend and said she would be leaving soon , but she never arrived .
The friend contacted Simon Edwards , who worked at Research Now .
They found her body and immediately called the police .
The walls and floor of the office were smeared with blood .
Detectives sent away material for forensic analysis and a DNA sample from underneath Miss Marlow 's fingernails gave them a match - Fagan .
He had had a DNA sample taken after he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly , and detectives discovered he had worked at Research Now as a web production manager before being fired in April 2006 .
Fagan and Miss Marlow were former colleagues who knew each other by sight and detectives realised he must have panicked and killed her when she disturbed him in the office .
Stole laptops
After killing her , rather than aborting the burglary , he continued .
His rucksack was seen on CCTV footage , bulging with stolen laptops as he left the office .
He did not stand out and was not in a lot of trouble - he was just an average guy
Janet McCutcheon
Former teacher Fagan was born in Oregon and grew up in a small logging town , White Salmon , just across the border in Washington state .
At the age of two he moved to Canada - but he returned to White Salmon aged 14 , and graduated from Columbia High School in the town with a B minus average .
The school 's assistant principal , Janet McCutcheon , said : " He did not stand out and was not in a lot of trouble .
He was just an average guy . "
She said he had been enrolled in her Future Business Leaders of America class .
When interviewed by police , Fagan made no comment - but he later admitted burgling the office and stealing six laptop computers .
Tied up
He said he had tied Miss Marlow up and left her with one of his accomplices .
When he gave evidence , Fagan , speaking in a strong American accent , said he had been married since 2003 to a German woman .
He admitted falling heavily into debt after losing his job and filing for bankruptcy .
Fagan , pictured here in his high school yearbook , was " callous and devious " Fagan said he had been earning cash working for a removal company and carrying out burglaries on the side .
He thought his former employers would be ripe pickings for a burglary .
Fagan said , in the witness box , that when Miss Marlow had found him and his accomplices in the office they had grabbed her , muffled her screams and tied her up .
He claimed she was alive when he left her to meet other accomplices .
On the way home Fagan said he had been mugged and injured by a man carrying a knife .
He said he had then gone to Guy 's Hospital to get his injuries treated .
But Detective Chief Inspector Damian Allain said Fagan was a " devious and callous " man who had told a tissue of lies .
Miss Marlow 's father , Bernie , and other members of her family flew over from New Zealand for the trial .
After the verdict , Mr Marlow said : " Whatever sentence he receives will never bring Cathy back , nor erase for us the horror of her suffering and death at his hands . "

For Immediate Release
Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac Bailout Could Cost Taxpayers $ 100 Billion or More
‘ The federal government is preparing to take over Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , ’ says Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party presidential nominee .
‘ Congress set up the taxpayers for big losses when it established these quasi - government agencies to subsidize the housing industry , and then earlier this year voted to approve direct federal support for them .
Policymakers should learn from the latest financial disaster and say never again , ’ Barr argues .
Barr says the bailout alone could cost $ 100 billion or more , and blames Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ’s for its role in creating the overall subprime lending crisis that prompted Congress to approve a $ 300 billion bailout of the housing industry .
“ First , government subsidizes an industry , ” says Barr .
“ Then , after the industry crashes , government bails it out !
The one factor that never changes is : the taxpayers lose , .
‘ The Fannie / Freddie bailout would be bad enough , ” says Barr , noting it comes on top of the Federal Reserve bailing out the brokerage house Bear Stearns .
“ The automakers are lining up with their hands out for $ 40 billion in assistance .
The federal deficit this year will run $ 400 billion , and next year ’s red ink is likely to hit a half trillion dollars .
That will inflate a national debt that already runs $ 9.5 trillion , ’ he adds .
‘ It is time to say no more .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to be privatized and sold off .
And Congress must stop treating the federal government like a national soup kitchen for businesses in trouble , ’ says Barr .
“ Even former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has cautioned against bailouts such as the Bush Administration is now championing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . ”
Barr says both Senators Barack Obama and John McCain supported the housing bailout , and neither has specified any hard decisions that they would make to control federal spending .
‘ Unfortunately , despite their rhetoric of change , they represent the Washington status quo , ” says Barr .
“ Only Bob Barr and the Libertarian Party would change the way the federal government operates and put the taxpayers before the special interests that have never met a government program they did n’t like . ”
Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr represented the 7th District of Georgia in the U. S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .

The Libertarian Party proudly stands for smaller government , lower taxes and more freedom .
NASHVILLE , Tennessee ( CNN ) -- Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama debated in Nashville , Tennessee , on Tuesday night .
NBC's Tom Brokaw moderated the debate .
Here is a transcript of that debate .
Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain meet in Nashville for their second debate .
Brokaw : Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville , Tennessee .
I 'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News .
And welcome to this second presidential debate , sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates .
Tonight 's debate is the only one with a town hall format .
The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight .
And earlier today , each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates .
From all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy .
Neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions .
And although we wo n't be able to get to all of them tonight , we should have a wide - ranging discussion one month before the election .
Each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question , and there will be a one - minute follow - up .
The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite , and attentive , no cheering or outbursts .
Those of you at home , of course , are not so constrained .
The only exception in the hall is right now , as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Gentlemen ?
Gentlemen , we want to get under way immediately , if we can .
Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago , the world has changed a great deal , and not for the better .
We still do n't know where the bottom is at this time .
As you might expect , many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and , in fact , with global economic conditions .
I understand that you flipped a coin .
And , Sen. Obama , you will begin tonight .
And we 're going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Allen Shaffer .
Allen ?
Shaffer :
With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes , what 's the fastest , most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin ?
Obama : Well , Alan ( ph ) , thank you very much for the question .
I want to first , obviously , thank Belmont University , Tom , thank you , and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in .
I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs , your pensions , your retirement accounts , your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college .
And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years , strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Sen.
McCain , that essentially said that we should strip away regulations , consumer protections , let the market run wild , and prosperity would rain down on all of us .
It has n't worked out that way .
And so now we 've got to take some decisive action .
Now , step one was a rescue package that was passed last week .
We 've got to make sure that works properly .
And that means strong oversight , making sure that investors , taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors .
It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they 're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package .
And , in fact , we just found out that AIG , a company that got a bailout , just a week after they got help went on a $ 400,000 junket .
And I 'll tell you what , the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired .
But that 's only step one .
The middle - class need a rescue package .
And that means tax cuts for the middle - class .
It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes .
It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs .
And then long - term we 've got to fix our health care system , we 've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families .
You need somebody working for you and you 've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ?
McCain :
Well , thank you , Tom .
Thank you , Belmont University .
And Sen. Obama , it 's good to be with you at a town hall meeting .
And , Alan ( ph ) , thank you for your question .
You go to the heart of America 's worries tonight .
Americans are angry , they 're upset , and they 're a little fearful .
It 's our job to fix the problem .
Now , I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence .
We 've got to stop sending $ 700 billion a year to countries that do n't want us very -- like us very much .
We have to keep Americans ' taxes low .
All Americans ' taxes low .
Let 's not raise taxes on anybody today .
We obviously have to stop this spending spree that 's going on in Washington .
Do you know that we 've laid a $ 10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight , $ 500 billion of it we owe to China ?
We 've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world .
And I think that this problem has become so severe , as you know , that we 're going to have to do something about home values .
You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments .
As president of the United States , Alan , I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes .
Is it expensive ?
Yes .
But we all know , my friends , until we stabilize home values in America , we 're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy .
And we 've got to give some trust and confidence back to America .
I know how the do that , my friends .
And it 's my proposal , it 's not Sen .
Obama 's proposal , it 's not President Bush 's proposal .
But I know how to get America working again , restore our economy and take care of working Americans .
Thank you .
Brokaw : Senator , we have one minute for a discussion here .
Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded .
The most powerful officer in the cabinet now .
Hank Paulson says he wo n't stay on .
Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post ?
Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Not you , Tom .
Brokaw :
No , with good reason .
McCain :
You know , that 's a tough question and there 's a lot of qualified Americans .
But I think the first criteria , Tom , would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with , immediately say , we can trust that individual .
A supporter of Sen. Obama 's is Warren Buffett [ chairman of Berkshire Hathaway ] .
He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations , institutions today .
I like Meg Whitman [ former CEO of eBay and current McCain campaign adviser ] , she knows what it 's like to be out there in the marketplace .
She knows how to create jobs .
Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay .
Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them .
But the point is it 's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence .
Because the problem in America today to a large extent , Tom , is that we do n't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington , D.C .
Brokaw :
All right .
Sen. McCain -- Sen. Obama , who do you have in mind for treasury secretary ?
Obama : Well , Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett , and I 'm pleased to have his support .
But there are other folks out there .
The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it 's not enough just to help those at the top .
Prosperity is not just going to trickle down .
We 've got to help the middle class .
And we 've -- you know , Sen.
McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy , starting with Sen.
McCain 's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound .
Part of the problem here is that for many of you , wages and incomes have flat - lined .
For many of you , it is getting harder and harder to save , harder and harder to retire .
And that 's why , for example , on tax policy , what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans , those who are working two jobs , people who are not spending enough time with their kids , because they are struggling to make ends meet .
Sen .
McCain is right that we 've got to stabilize housing prices .
But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income .
That 's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama , thank you very much .
May I remind both of you , if I can , that we 're operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion , it really is to be confined within about a minute or so .
We 're going to go now , Sen.
McCain , to the next question from you from the hall here , and it comes from Oliver Clark , who is over here in section F .
Oliver ?
Clark : Well , Senators , through this economic crisis , most of the people that I know have had a difficult time .
And through this bailout package , I was wondering what it is that 's going to actually help those people out .
McCain :
Well , thank you , Oliver , and that 's an excellent question , because as you just described it , bailout , when I believe that it 's rescue , because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street , Main Street was paying a very heavy price , and we know that .
I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight , in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures .
But you know , one of the real catalysts , really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
I 'll bet you , you may never even have heard of them before this crisis .
But you know , they 're the ones that , with the encouragement of Sen.
Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington , that went out and made all these risky loans , gave them to people that could never afford to pay back .
And you know , there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we 've got to enact legislation to fix this .
We 've got to stop this greed and excess .
Meanwhile , the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing .
They resisted any change .
Meanwhile , they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions .
Sen . Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history .
So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets , we will shore up these institutions .
But it 's not enough .
That 's why we 're going to have to go out into the housing market and we 're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we 're going to have to stabilize home values , and that way , Americans , like Alan , can realize the American dream and stay in their home .
But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts , the match that started this forest fire .
There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it .
There were others who took a hike .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama ?
Obama :
Well , Oliver , first , let me tell you what 's in the rescue package for you .
Right now , the credit markets are frozen up and what that means , as a practical matter , is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans .
If they can't get a loan , that means that they can't make payroll .
If they can't make payroll , then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off .
And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that , now imagine a million companies all across the country .
So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody , and that 's why we had to take action .
But we should n't have been there in the first place .
Now , I 've got to correct a little bit of Sen.
McCain 's history , not surprisingly .
Let 's , first of all , understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system .
Sen. McCain , as recently as March , bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator .
On the other hand , two years ago , I said that we 've got a sub - prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with .
I wrote to Secretary Paulson , I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman [ Ben ]
Bernanke , and told them this is something we have to deal with , and nobody did anything about it .
A year ago , I went to Wall Street and said we 've got to reregulate , and nothing happened .
And Sen. McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that 's how the free enterprise system works .
Now , with respect to Fannie Mae , what Sen.
McCain did n't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about was n't his own bill .
He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed .
And I never promoted Fannie Mae .
In fact , Sen. McCain 's campaign chairman 's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae , not me .
So -- but , look , you 're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers .
What you 're interested in is trying to figure out , how is this going to impact you ?
This is not the end of the process ; this is the beginning of the process .
And that 's why it 's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes .
The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package , but it has n't been exercised yet .
And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer , you as a homeowner , and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama , time for a discussion .
I 'm going to begin with you .
Are you saying to Mr. Clark ( ph ) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that ?
Obama : No , I am confident about the American economy .
But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system .
The problem is we still have a archaic , 20th - century regulatory system for 21st - century financial markets .
We 're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work .
But most importantly , we 're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes , make sure that they can pay their bills , deal with critical issues like health care and energy , and we 're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests are n't driving the process and your voices are n't being drowned out .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , in all candor , do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better ?
McCain : I think it depends on what we do .
I think if we act effectively , if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can , if we go out and buy up these bad loans , so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively .
My friend , I 'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis .
Sen .
Obama 's name was not on that letter .
The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy .
Americans ' workers are the best in the world .
They 're the fundamental aspect of America 's economy .
They 're the most innovative .
They 're the best -- they 're most -- have best -- we 're the best exporters .
We 're the best importers .
They 're most effective .
They are the best workers in the world .
And we 've got to give them a chance .
They 've got -- we 've got to give them a chance to do their best again .
And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time .
We can do it .
Brokaw :
Thank you , Sen. McCain .
We 're going to continue over in Section F , as it turns out .
Sen . Obama , this is a question from you from Teresa Finch .
Teresa ?
Finch :
How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got -- got us into this global economic crisis ?
Obama :
Well , look , I understand your frustration and your cynicism , because while you 've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here , you 've got a family budget .
If less money is coming in , you end up making cuts .
Maybe you do n't go out to dinner as much .
Maybe you put off buying a new car .
That 's not what happens in Washington .
And you 're right .
There is a lot of blame to go around .
But I think it 's important just to remember a little bit of history .
When George Bush came into office , we had surpluses .
And now we have half - a- trillion - dollar deficit annually .
When George Bush came into office , our debt -- national debt was around $ 5 trillion .
It 's now over $ 10 trillion .
We 've almost doubled it .
And so while it 's true that nobody 's completely innocent here , we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history .
And Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets .
So here 's what I would do .
I 'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we 've got to work on .
You know , you may have seen your health care premiums go up .
We 've got to reform health care to help you and your budget .
We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia .
We are mortgaging our children 's future .
We 've got to have a different energy plan .
We 've got to invest in college affordability .
So we 're going to have to make some investments , but we 've also got to make spending cuts .
And what I 've proposed , you 'll hear Sen.
McCain say , well , he 's proposing a whole bunch of new spending , but actually I 'm cutting more than I 'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut .
The key is whether or not we 've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately , and that 's mostly lobbyists and special interests .
We 've got to put an end to that .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Well , Theresa ( ph ) , thank you .
And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust , because the system in Washington is broken .
And I have been a consistent reformer .
I have advocated and taken on the special interests , whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Sen . [ Russ ] Feingold [ D - Wisconsin ] on campaign finance reform , whether it being a variety of other issues , working with Sen. Lieberman on trying to address climate change .
I have a clear record of bipartisanship .
The situation today cries out for bipartisanship .
Sen .
Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue .
And we need to reform .
And so let 's look at our records as well as our rhetoric .
That 's really part of your mistrust here .
And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do , like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time .
I do n't expect you to watch every vote .
And you know what you 'll find ?
This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate .
I have fought against excessive spending and outrages .
I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them .
Do you know that Sen. Obama has voted for -- is proposing $ 860 billion of new spending now ?
New spending .
Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks ?
He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects , including , by the way , $ 3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago , Illinois .
My friends , do we need to spend that kind of money ?
I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his .
Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy , not $ 860 billion in new spending , but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs , get middle - income Americans working again , and getting our economy moving again .
You 're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future , and energy independence is a way to do that , is one of them .
And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that .
And I 've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy , and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil , and stop sending $ 700 billion a year overseas .
Brokaw :
We 've run out of time .
We have this one - minute discussion period going on here .
There are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made .
Health policies , energy policies , and entitlement reform , what are going to be your priorities in what order ?
Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence ?
Sen. McCain ?
McCain :
The three priorities were health ...
Brokaw :
The three -- health care , energy , and entitlement reform : Social Security and Medicare .
In what order would you put them in terms of priorities ?
McCain : I think you can work on all three at once , Tom .
I think it 's very important that reform our entitlement programs .
My friends , we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present - day workers that we are going -- that present - day retirees have today .
We 're going to have to sit down across the table , Republican and Democrat , as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill .
I know how to do that .
I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle , whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others .
That 's my clear record .
We can work on nuclear power plants .
Build a whole bunch of them , create millions of new jobs .
We have to have all of the above , alternative fuels , wind , tide , solar , natural gas , clean coal technology .
All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it .
My friends , some of this $ 700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations .
As far as health care is concerned , obviously , everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care .
That 's the next issue .
But we can do them all at once .
There 's no -- and we have to do them all at once .
All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements .
Brokaw : I 'm trying to play by the rules that you all established .
One minute for discussion .
Sen .
Obama , if you would give us your list of priorities , there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once .
Obama :
We 're going to have to prioritize , just like a family has to prioritize .
Now , I 've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list .
Energy we have to deal with today , because you 're paying $ 3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline , and it could go up .
And it 's a strain on your family budget , but it 's also bad for our national security , because countries like Russia and Venezuela and , you know , in some cases , countries like Iran , are benefiting from higher oil prices .
So we 've got to deal with that right away .
That 's why I 've called for an investment of $ 15 billion a year over 10 years .
Our goal should be , in 10 year 's time , we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil .
And we can do it .
Now , when JFK said we 're going to the Moon in 10 years , nobody was sure how to do it , but we understood that , if the American people make a decision to do something , it gets done .
So that would be priority number one .
Health care is priority number two , because that broken health care system is bad not only for families , but it 's making our businesses less competitive .
And , number three , we 've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy .
But just one point I want to make , Tom. Sen. McCain mentioned looking at our records .
We do need to look at our records .
Sen . McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot .
And that 's important .
I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that do n't work and make sure that those that do work , work better and cheaper .
But understand this :
We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going .
So when Sen. McCain proposes a $ 300 billion tax cut , a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts , but an additional $ 200 billion that he 's going to give to big corporations , including big oil companies , $ 4 billion worth , that 's money out of the system .
And so we 've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they 're working for you .
That 's what I 'm going to do as president of the United States .
Brokaw :
All right , gentlemen , I want to just remind you one more time about time .
We 're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we do n't get this under control here before too long .
Sen. McCain , for you , we have our first question from the Internet tonight .
A child of the Depression , 78 - year - old Fiorra from Chicago .
Since World War II , we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country , except the blood of our heroic men and women .
As president , what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we 're now in ?
McCain : Well , Fiorra , I 'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate .
I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government .
And we 're going to have to eliminate those that are n't working .
I know a lot of them that are n't working .
One of them is in defense spending , because I 've taken on some of the defense contractors .
I saved the taxpayers $ 6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion .
I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks .
And sometimes those projects , not -- not the overhead projector that Sen .
Obama asked for , but some of them that are really good projects , will have -- will have to be eliminated , as well .
And they 'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others .
So we 're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America .
And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense , Veterans Affairs , and some other vital programs , we 'll just have to have across - the - board freeze .
And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to , but we can establish priorities with full transparency , with full knowledge of the American people , and full consultation , not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we do n't even -- sometimes we do n't even know about until months later .
And , by the way , I want to go back a second .
Look , we can attack health care and energy at the same time .
We 're not -- we 're not -- we 're not rifle shots here .
We are Americans .
We can , with the participation of all Americans , work together and solve these problems together .
Frankly , I 'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that , " I 'm sorry , you 'll have to wait . "
I 'm going to tell you Americans we 'll get to work right away and we 'll get to work together , and we can get them all done , because that 's what America has been doing .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , thank you very much .
Sen. Obama ?
Obama :
You know , a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and , you know , how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer , but to make us a better country and a more unified country .
And President Bush did some smart things at the outset , but one of the opportunities that was missed was , when he spoke to the American people , he said , " Go out and shop . "
That was n't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for .
And so it 's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government , but outside of government .
And let 's take the example of energy , which we already spoke about .
There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy .
I believe in the need for increased oil production .
We 're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil , and that includes offshore drilling .
It includes telling the oil companies , that currently have 68 million acres that they 're not using , that either you use them or you lose them .
We 're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy .
But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes , in our buildings .
And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we 're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that 's made right here in the United States of America , not in Japan or South Korea , making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient .
And that 's going to require effort from each and every one of us .
And the last point I just want to make .
I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve , and that 's one of the reasons why I 'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps , making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community , involved in military service , so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America .
That 's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama , as we begin , very quickly , our discussion period , President Bush , you 'll remember , last summer , said that " Wall Street got drunk . "
A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and , in fact , the American consumers got drunk .
How would you , as president , try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit , specifically , across the board , for this country , not just at the federal level , but as a model for the rest of the country , as well ?
Obama :
Well , I think it starts with Washington .
We 've got to show that we 've got good habits , because if we 're running up trillion dollar debts that we 're passing on to the next generation , then a lot of people are going to think , " Well , you know what ?
There 's easy money out there . "
It means -- and I have to , again , repeat this .
It means looking ( ph ) at the spending side , but also at the revenue side .
I mean , Sen.
McCain has been talking tough about earmarks , and that 's good , but earmarks account for about $ 18 billion of our budget .
Now , when Sen. McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $ 700,000 in tax cuts , that 's not sharing a burden .
And so part of the problem , I think , for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they do n't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks .
I mean , you know , it 's tough to ask a teacher who 's making $ 30,000 or $ 35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog .
And that 's why I think it 's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute , all of us are going to make sacrifices , and it means that , yes , we may have to cut some spending , although I disagree with Sen.
McCain about an across - the- board freeze .
That 's an example of an unfair burden sharing .
That 's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget .
I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us , like myself and Sen.
McCain , who do n't need help , are n't getting it .
That 's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Well , you know , nailing down Sen .
Obama 's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell - O to the wall .
There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough , there will probably be another one .
But he wants to raise taxes .
My friends , the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover , and he practiced protectionism as well , which I 'm sure we 'll get to at some point .
You know , last year up to this time , we 've lost 700,000 jobs in America .
The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses .
Sen .
Obama 's secret that you do n't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue .
Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and wo n't be able to hire because of Sen.
Obama 's tax policies .
You know , he said some time ago , he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad .
I 've got some news , Sen .
Obama , the news is bad .
So let 's not raise anybody 's taxes , my friends , and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy .
I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle - income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $ 3,500 to $ 7,000 .
To giving every American a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses , as Sen .
Obama 's plan calls for .
And let 's create jobs and let 's get our economy going again .
And let 's not raise anybody 's taxes .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama , we have another question from the Internet .
Obama : Tom , can I respond to this briefly ?
Because ...
Brokaw :
Well , look , guys , the rules were established by the two campaigns , we worked very hard on this .
This will address , I think , the next question .
Obama :
The tax issue , because I think it 's very important .
Go ahead .
Brokaw :
There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight .
And we have a question from Langdon ( ph ) in Ballston Spa , New York , and that 's about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security , Medicare , and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that 's in place and then go into a deficit position .
Since the rules are pretty loose here , I 'm going to add my own to this one .
Instead of having a discussion , let me ask you as a coda to that .
Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office ?
Because in a bipartisan way , everyone agrees , that 's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis .
Obama :
Well ,
Tom , we 're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we 've got to do it quickly .
We 're going to have a lot of work to do , so I can't guarantee that we 're going to do it in the next two years , but I 'd like to do in the my first term as president .
But I think it 's important to understand , we 're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies .
And you know , Sen. McCain , I think the " Straight Talk Express " lost a wheel on that one .
So let 's be clear about my tax plan and Sen.
McCain's , because we 're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in .
I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans , 95 percent .
If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year , you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up .
If you make $ 200,000 a year or less , your taxes will go down .
Now , Sen. McCain talks about small businesses .
Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $ 250,000 a year .
So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan .
And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers , because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it .
Some small business owners , a lot of them , ca n't even afford health insurance for themselves .
Now , in contrast , Sen. McCain wants to give a $ 300 billion tax cut , $ 200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street .
He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $ 700,000 in tax cuts .
That is not fair .
And it does n't work .
Now , if we get our tax policies right so that they 're good for the middle class , if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Sen.
McCain supported , then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare , because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you , reduces spending and costs over the long term , and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , two years for a reform of entitlement programs ?
McCain : Sure .
Hey , I 'll answer the question .
Look -- look , it 's not that hard to fix Social Security , Tom .
It 's just ...
Brokaw : And Medicare .
McCain : ... tough decisions .
I want to get to Medicare in a second .
Social Security is not that tough .
We know what the problems are , my friends , and we know what the fixes are .
We 've got to sit down together across the table .
It 's been done before .
I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan , a conservative from California , and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts .
That 's what we need more of , and that 's what I 've done in Washington .
Sen .
Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue .
I 've taken them on .
I 'm not too popular sometimes with my own party , much less his .
So Medicare , it 's going to be a little tougher .
It 's going to be a little tougher because we 're talking about very complex and difficult issues .
My friends , what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission , have the smartest people in America come together , come up with recommendations , and then , like the base - closing commission idea we had , then we should have Congress vote up or down .
Let 's not let them fool with it anymore .
There 's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there .
So let 's have -- and let 's have the American people say , " Fix it for us . "
Now , just back on this -- on this tax , you know , again , it 's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record .
Sen .
Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts .
That 's his record .
When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois , he said he would have a middle - income tax cut .
You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that ?
So let 's look at our record .
I 've fought higher taxes .
I have fought excess spending .
I have fought to reform government .
Let 's look at our records , my friends , and then listen to my vision for the future of America .
And we 'll get our economy going again .
And our best days are ahead of us .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , thank you very much .
I 'm going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow - up here .
The next question does come from the hall for Sen. McCain .
It comes from Section C over here , and it's from Ingrid Jackson .
Ingrid ?
Jackson : Sen. McCain , I want to know , we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis .
I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues , like climate change and green jobs ?
McCain :
Well , thank you .
Look , we are in tough economic times ; we all know that .
And let 's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today .
But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet , I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue .
I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions , Joe Lieberman and I .
And I introduced the first legislation , and we forced votes on it .
That 's the good news , my friends .
The bad news is we lost .
But we kept the debate going , and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes .
Now , how -- what 's -- what 's the best way of fixing it ?
Nuclear power .
Sen .
Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that .
Look , I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants .
Nuclear power is safe , and it 's clean , and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs .
And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel .
The Japanese , the British , the French do it .
And we can do it , too .
Sen. Obama has opposed that .
We can move forward , and clean up our climate , and develop green technologies , and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid , for hydrogen , for battery - powered cars , so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs .
We can do that , we as Americans , because we 're the best innovators , we 're the best producers , and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama ?
Obama :
This is one of the biggest challenges of our times .
And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge , it 's an opportunity , because if we create a new energy economy , we can create five million new jobs , easily , here in the United States .
It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades .
And we can do it , but we 're going to have to make an investment .
The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out , for defense purposes , how to communicate , we 've got to understand that this is a national security issue , as well .
And that 's why we 've got to make some investments and I 've called for investments in solar , wind , geothermal .
Contrary to what Sen. McCain keeps on saying , I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix .
But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record .
Sen. McCain and I actually agree on something .
He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years , politicians in Washington have n't done anything .
What Sen. McCain does n't mention is he 's been there 26 of them .
And during that time , he voted 23 times against alternative fuels , 23 times .
So it 's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign , but it 's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president .
One last point I want to make on energy .
Sen.
McCain talks a lot about drilling , and that 's important , but we have three percent of the world 's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world 's oil .
So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem .
And we 're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming .
We 're going to have to come up with alternatives , and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week .
We 've got to make sure that we 're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need .
Brokaw : Gentlemen , you may not have noticed , but we have lights around here .
They have red and green and yellow and they are to signal ...
Obama : I 'm just trying to keep up with John .
McCain : Tom , wave like that and I 'll look at you .
Brokaw :
All right , Senator .
Here 's a follow - up to that , one - minute discussion .
It 's a simple question .
McCain : Sure .
Brokaw :
Should we fund a Manhattan - like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America , the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley ?
McCain : I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate .
I think once it gets into productive stages , that we ought to , obviously , turn it over to the private sector .
By the way , my friends , I know you grow a little weary with this back - and - forth .
It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies , and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney .
You know who voted for it ?
You might never know .
That one .
You know who voted against it ?
Me . I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes .
I vote against them , my friends .
I vote against them .
But the point is , also , on oil drilling , oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap .
We can bridge the gap between imported oil , which is a national security issue , as well as any other , and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil , because when people know there 's a greater supply , then the cost of that will go down .
That 's fundamental economics .
We 've got to drill offshore , my friends , and we 've got to do it now , and we can do it .
And as far as nuclear power is concerned , again , look at the record .
Sen . Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel .
And I 'll stop , Tom , and you did n't even wave .
Thanks .
Brokaw :
Thank you very much , Senator .
Next question for you , Sen. Obama , and it comes from the E section over here and it's from Lindsey Trella .
Lindsey ?
Trella : Senator , selling health care coverage in America as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry .
Do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity ?
Obama :
Well , you know , as I travel around the country , this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get , is the issue of health care .
It is breaking family budgets .
I can't tell you how many people I meet who do n't have health insurance .
If you 've got health insurance , most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years .
And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone .
If you 're a small business , it 's a crushing burden .
So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing .
So here 's what I would do .
If you 've got health care already , and probably the majority of you do , then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it .
You can keep your choice of doctor .
We 're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $ 2,500 a year .
And we 're going to do it by investing in prevention .
We 're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital .
That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs .
If you do n't have health insurance , you 're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Sen.
McCain and I enjoy as federal employees .
Because there 's a huge pool , we can drop the costs .
And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions , which is a huge problem .
Now , Sen. McCain has a different kind of approach .
He says that he 's going to give you a $ 5,000 tax credit .
What he does n't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer - based health care benefits for the first time ever .
So what one hand giveth , the other hand taketh away .
He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you 're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered .
And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go .
In fact , just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce , which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans , said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer - based health care system .
That , I do n't think , is the kind of change that we need .
We 've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent , affordable health care .
And that 's something that I 'm committed to doing as president .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ?
McCain :
Well , thank you for the question .
You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces .
Co-payments go up , costs go up , skyrocketing costs , which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America .
And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient .
Let 's put health records online , that will reduce medical errors , as they call them .
Let 's have community health centers .
Let 's have walk - in clinics .
Let 's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies .
But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Sen. Obama .
As you notice , he starts talking about government .
He starts saying , government will do this and government will do that , and then government will , and he 'll impose mandates .
If you 're a small business person and you do n't insure your employees , Sen . Obama will fine you .
Will fine you .
That 's remarkable .
If you 're a parent and you 're struggling to get health insurance for your children , Sen. Obama will fine you .
I want to give every American a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit .
They can take it anywhere , across state lines .
Why not ?
Do n't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America ?
Of course it 's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee .
And if you do the math , those people who have employer - based health benefits , if you put the tax on it and you have what 's left over and you add $ 5,000 that you 're going to get as a refundable tax credit , do the math , 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold - plated Cadillac kinds of policies .
You know , like hair transplants , I might need one of those myself .
But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability .
Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could .
Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance .
Of course they all want to do that .
We 've got to give them the wherewithal to do it .
We can do it by giving them , as a start , a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice .
Brokaw : Quick discussion .
Is health care in America a privilege , a right , or a responsibility ?
Sen. McCain ?
McCain : I think it 's a responsibility , in this respect , in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen , to every family member .
And with the plan that -- that I have , that will do that .
But government mandates I -- I 'm always a little nervous about .
But it is certainly my responsibility .
It is certainly small - business people and others , and they understand that responsibility .
American citizens understand that .
Employers understand that .
But they certainly are a little nervous when Sen .
Obama says , if you do n't get the health care policy that I think you should have , then you 're going to get fined .
And , by the way , Sen .
Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be .
Perhaps we might find that out tonight .
Obama :
Well , why do n't -- why do n't -- let 's talk about this , Tom , because there was just a lot of stuff out there .
Brokaw : Privilege , right or responsibility .
Let 's start with that .
Obama :
Well , I think it should be a right for every American .
In a country as wealthy as ours , for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they 're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they do n't have to pay her treatment , there 's something fundamentally wrong about that .
So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference .
And , Tom , I know that we 're under time constraints , but Sen.
McCain through a lot of stuff out there .
Number one , let me just repeat , if you 've got a health care plan that you like , you can keep it .
All I 'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it .
You 'll still have choice of doctor .
There 's no mandate involved .
Small businesses are not going to have a mandate .
What we 're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need .
Now , it 's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care , because children are relatively cheap to insure and we do n't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma .
And when Sen. McCain says that he wants to provide children health care , what he does n't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children 's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who did n't have previously health insurance have it now .
Now , the final point I 'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers , that do n't give you the fine print , so you end up thinking that you 're paying for something and , when you finally get sick and you need it , you 're not getting it .
And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state , you know what insurance companies will do ?
They will find a state -- maybe Arizona , maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings , where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions , and they will all set up shop there .
That 's how in banking it works .
Everybody goes to Delaware , because they 've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards .
And in that situation , what happens is , is that the protections you have , the consumer protections that you need , you 're not going to have available to you .
That is a fundamental difference that I have with Sen. McCain .
He believes in deregulation in every circumstance .
That 's what we 've been going through for the last eight years .
It has n't worked , and we need fundamental change .
Brokaw : Sen. , we want to move on now .
If we 'd come back to the hall here , we 're going to shift gears here a little bit and we 're going to go to foreign policy and international matters , if we can ...
McCain : I do n't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine ?
Brokaw : Phil Elliott is over here in this section , and Phil Elliott has a question for Sen. McCain .
Phil ?
Elliott : Yes .
Sen. McCain , how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation 's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world ?
McCain :
Well , I thank you for that question , because there 's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy , as well .
And that is one of the challenges that America faces .
But having said that , America -- and we 'll hear a lot of criticism .
I 've heard a lot of criticism about America , and our national security policy , and all that , and much of that criticism is justified .
But the fact is , America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world .
My friends , we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense , usually , of somebody else 's freedom and our own .
So we are peacemakers and we 're peacekeepers .
But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis , when to go in and when not , when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure .
And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment , the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk , but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide , in preventing the spread of terrorism , in doing the things that the United States has done , not always well , but we 've done because we 're a nation of good .
And I am convinced that my record , going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon , to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War , and my judgment , I think , is something that I 'm -- a record that I 'm willing to stand on .
Sen . Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge .
He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia .
And in his short career , he does not understand our national security challenges .
We do n't have time for on - the - job training , my friends .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama , the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world .
Obama :
Well , you know , Sen. McCain , in the last debate and today , again , suggested that I do n't understand .
It 's true .
There are some things I do n't understand .
I do n't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 , while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us .
That was Sen. McCain 's judgment and it was the wrong judgment .
When Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq , he suggested it was going to be quick and easy , we'd be greeted as liberators .
That was the wrong judgment , and it 's been costly to us .
So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain , first of all , on our troops , obviously , and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude .
But it 's also put an enormous strain on our budget .
We 've spent , so far , close to $ 700 billion and if we continue on the path that we 're on , as Sen.
McCain is suggesting , it 's going to go well over $ 1 trillion .
We 're spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $ 79 billion surplus , $ 79 billion .
And we need that $ 10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work , to do all these wonderful things that Sen.
McCain suggested we should be doing , but has not yet explained how he would pay for .
Now , Sen. McCain and I do agree , this is the greatest nation on earth .
We are a force of good in the world .
But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority .
And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that 's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur , because we do n't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing .
That 's going to change when I 'm president , but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Sen.
McCain 's and George Bush 's foreign policy .
It has not worked for America .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama , let me ask you if -- let 's see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where there 's a humanitarian crisis , but it does not affect our national security .
Take the Congo , where 4.5 million people have died since 1998 , or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days , or Somalia .
What is the Obama doctrine for use of force that the United States would send when we do n't have national security issues at stake ?
Obama :
Well , we may not always have national security issues at stake , but we have moral issues at stake .
If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust , who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in ?
If we could 've stopped Rwanda , surely , if we had the ability , that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act .
So when genocide is happening , when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by , that diminishes us .
And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests , our national interests , in intervening where possible .
But understand that there 's a lot of cruelty around the world .
We 're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time .
That 's why it 's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies .
Let 's take the example of Darfur just for a moment .
Right now there 's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people .
We could be providing logistical support , setting up a no- fly zone at relatively little cost to us , but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead .
And that 's what I intend to do when I 'm president .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , the McCain Doctrine , if you will .
McCain :
Well , let me just follow up , my friends .
If we had done what Sen . Obama wanted done in Iraq , and that was set a date for withdrawal , which Gen . [ David ]
Petraeus , our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America , then we would have had a wider war , we would have been back , Iranian influence would have increased , al Qaeda would have re- established a base .
There was a lot at stake there , my friends .
And I can tell you right now that Sen.
Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat .
I 'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference .
The United States of America , Tom , is the greatest force for good , as I said .
And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide , whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again .
But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation .
That requires a cool hand at the tiller .
This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are .
We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization , we ended up trying to be -- excuse me , as a peacekeeping organization , we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation .
In Lebanon , I stood up to President Reagan , my hero , and said , if we send Marines in there , how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation ?
And said we should n't .
Unfortunately , almost 300 brave young Marines were killed .
So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you 're sending America 's most precious asset , American blood , into harm 's way .
And , again , I know those situations .
I 've been in them all my life .
And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation 's security .
And I may have to make those tough decisions .
But I wo n't take them lightly .
And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda .
But we had also better be darn sure we do n't leave and make the situation worse , thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , thank you very much .
Next question for Sen. Obama , it comes from the F section and is from Katie Hamm .
Katie ?
Hamm : Should the United States respect Pakistani sovereignty and not pursue al Qaeda terrorists who maintain bases there , or should we ignore their borders and pursue our enemies like we did in Cambodia during the Vietnam War ?
Obama : Katie , it 's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan .
I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we had n't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda .
So what happened was we got distracted , we diverted resources , and ultimately bin Laden escaped , set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there .
They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan , destabilizing the situation .
They 're stronger now than at any time since 2001 .
And that 's why I think it 's so important for us to reverse course , because that 's the central front on terrorism .
They are plotting to kill Americans right now .
As Secretary Gates , the defense secretary , said , the war against terrorism began in that region and that 's where it will end .
So part of the reason I think it 's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan , put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do , eliminate some of the drug trafficking that 's funding terrorism .
But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan .
We can't coddle , as we did , a dictator , give him billions of dollars and then he 's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants .
What I 've said is we 're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan , expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us , but insisting that they go after these militants .
And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out , then I think that we have to act and we will take them out .
We will kill bin Laden ; we will crush Al Qaeda .
That has to be our biggest national security priority .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Well , Katie ( ph ) , thank you .
You know , my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt .
Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly , but carry a big stick .
Sen .
Obama likes to talk loudly .
In fact , he said he wants to announce that he 's going to attack Pakistan .
Remarkable .
You know , if you are a country and you 're trying to gain the support of another country , then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion .
When you announce that you 're going to launch an attack into another country , it 's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan :
It turns public opinion against us .
Now , let me just go back with you very briefly .
We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan , and then we made a most serious mistake .
We washed our hands of Afghanistan .
The Taliban came back in , Al Qaeda , we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war .
Now , our relations with Pakistan are critical , because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations , and we have to get their support .
Now , General Petraeus had a strategy , the same strategy -- very , very different , because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq .
And that is to get the support of the people .
We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan , where I visited , a very rough country , and -- and get the support of the people , and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others .
And by working and coordinating our efforts together , not threatening to attack them , but working with them , and where necessary use force , but talk softly , but carry a big stick .
Obama : Tom , just a ...
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ...
Obama : ... just a quick follow - up on this .
I think ...
McCain :
If we 're going to have follow - ups , then I will want follow - ups , as well .
Brokaw :
No , I know .
So but I think we get at it ...
McCain :
It 'd be fine with me .
It 'd be fine with me .
Brokaw : ... if I can , with this question .
Obama :
Then let 's have one .
Brokaw :
All right , let 's have a follow - up .
McCain :
It 'd be fine with me .
Obama : Just -- just -- just a quick follow - up , because I think -- I think this is important .
Brokaw : I 'm just the hired help here , so , I mean ...
Obama :
You 're doing a great job , Tom .
Look , I -- I want to be very clear about what I said .
Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan .
Sen. McCain continues to repeat this .
What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say , which is , if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out , then we should .
Now , that I think has to be our policy , because they are threatening to kill more Americans .
Now , Sen. McCain suggests that somehow , you know , I 'm green behind the ears and , you know , I 'm just spouting off , and he 's somber and responsible .
McCain :
Thank you very much .
Obama : Sen. McCain , this is the guy who sang , " Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , " who called for the annihilation of North Korea .
That I do n't think is an example of " speaking softly . "
This is the person who , after we had -- we had n't even finished Afghanistan , where he said , " Next up , Baghdad . "
So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly .
And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator , Musharraf , had given him $ 10 billion over seven years , and he had suspended civil liberties .
We were not promoting democracy .
This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism , and it will change when I 'm president .
McCain : And , Tom , if -- if we 're going to go back and forth , I then -- I 'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to ...
Brokaw :
Yes , you get the ...
McCain : ... to -- to -- to ...
Brokaw : ... last word here , and then we have to move on .
McCain : Not true .
Not true .
I have , obviously , supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I did n't think so .
I understand what it 's like to send young American 's in harm 's way .
I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this .
I was joking with an old veteran friend , who joked with me , about Iran .
But the point is that I know how to handle these crises .
And Sen. Obama , by saying that he would attack Pakistan , look at the context of his words .
I 'll get Osama bin Laden , my friends .
I 'll get him .
I know how to get him .
I 'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it .
But I 'm not going to telegraph my punches , which is what Sen. Obama did .
And I 'm going to act responsibly , as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate .
And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it , and you just saw it in response to previous questions .
Brokaw : Can I get a quick response from the two of you about developments in Afghanistan this week ?
The senior British military commander , who is now leading there for a second tour , and their senior diplomatic presence there , Sherard Cowper - Coles , who is well known as an expert in the area , both have said that we 're failing in Afghanistan .
The commander said we cannot win there .
We 've got to get it down to a low level insurgency , let the Afghans take it over .
Cowper - Coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator .
If either of you becomes president , as one of you will , how do you reorganize Afghanistan 's strategy or do you ?
Briefly , if you can .
Obama : I 'll be very brief .
We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility , withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time , because we 're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan .
Gen . [ David ]
McKiernan , the commander in Afghanistan right now , is desperate for more help , because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses .
We 're also going to have to work with the Karzai government , and when I met with President Karzai , I was very clear that , " You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that 's necessary . "
I do n't think he has to be a dictator .
And we want a democracy in Afghanistan .
But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people , and , frankly , it 's just not responsive right now .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , briefly .
McCain : Gen. Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility , where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used .
And I 've had conversations with him .
It is the same overall strategy .
Of course , we have to do some things tactically , some of which Sen. Obama is correct on .
We have to double the size of the Afghan army .
We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure .
We have to do a lot of things .
We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis .
But most importantly , we have to have the same strategy , which Sen .
Obama said would n't work , could n't work , still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq .
He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq , and that 's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives .
And once they feel secure , then they lead normal , social , economic , political lives , the same thing that 's happening in Iraq today .
So I have confidence that General Petraeus , working with the Pakistanis , working with the Afghans , doing the same job that he did in Iraq , will again .
We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , this question is for you from the Internet .
It 's from Alden in Hewitt , Texas .
How can we apply pressure to Russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another Cold War ?
McCain : First of all , as I say , I do n't think that -- we 're not going to have another Cold War with Russia .
But have no doubt that Russia 's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy , as Russia has become , because of their petro dollars .
Now , long ago , I warned about Vladimir Putin .
I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters , a K , a G and a B .
He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks .
He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe , and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior , obviously , in Georgia .
I said before , watch Ukraine .
Ukraine , right now , is in the sights of Vladimir Putin , those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union .
We 've got to show moral support for Georgia .
We 've got to show moral support for Ukraine .
We 've got to advocate for their membership in NATO .
We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior , this kind of naked aggression into Georgia , a tiny country and a tiny democracy .
And so , of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior .
Now , the G - 8 is one of those , but there are many others .
But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage , economic , diplomatic and others united with our allies , with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama .
McCain :
It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War , but Russia is a challenge .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama ?
We 're winding down , so if we can keep track of the time .
Obama :
Well , the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we 're going to have to deal with in the next presidency .
And for the most part I agree with Sen.
McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken .
But we can't just provide moral support .
We 've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites .
But we 've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies .
Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges .
And some say that that 's what Putin intended in the first place .
The other thing we have to do , though , is we 've got to see around the corners .
We 've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time .
You know , back in April , I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute .
And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia , that that was not a stable situation .
So part of the job of the next commander - in - chief , in keeping all of you safe , is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen .
We have n't been doing enough of that .
We tend to be reactive .
That 's what we 've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe .
That 's part of what happened in Afghanistan , where we rushed into Iraq and Sen.
McCain and President Bush suggested that it was n't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through , and that has cost us dearly .
We 've got to be much more strategic if we 're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there .
And one last point I want to make about Russia .
Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia .
If we can reduce our energy consumption , that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world .
That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia .
Brokaw :
This requires only a yes or a no .
Ronald Reagan famously said that the Soviet Union was the evil empire .
Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire ?
Obama : I think they 've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they 're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Maybe .
Brokaw : Maybe .
McCain : Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things .
If I say yes , then that means that we 're reigniting the old Cold War .
If I say no , it ignores their behavior .
Obviously energy is going to be a big , big factor .
And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe .
And that 's one of the reasons why it 's in our interest .
But the Russians , I think we can deal with them but they 've got to understand that they 're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world .
Brokaw :
All right .
We 're going to try to get in two more questions , if we can .
So we have to move along .
Over in section A , Terry Shirey -- do I have that right , Terry ?
Shirey : Senator , as a retired Navy chief , my thoughts are often with those who serve our country .
I know both candidates , both of you , expressed support for Israel .
If , despite your best diplomatic efforts , Iran attacks Israel , would you be willing to commit U.S. troops in support and defense of Israel ?
Or would you wait on approval from the U.N. Security Council ?
McCain :
Well , thank you , Terry ( ph ) .
And thank you for your service to the country .
I want to say , everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer .
And I thank you , and I thank you , my friend .
Thanks for serving .
Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council .
I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles .
And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons , and it's a great threat .
It 's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel .
It 's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East .
If Iran acquires nuclear weapons , all the other countries will acquire them , too .
The tensions will be ratcheted up .
What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map , calls your country a stinking corpse ?
Now , Sen .
Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them , without preconditions .
That 's what he stated , again , a matter of record .
I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies , imposing significant , tough sanctions to modify their behavior .
And I think we can do that .
I think , joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies , that we can effectively abridge their behavior , and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons .
But , at the end of the day , my friend , I have to tell you again , and you know what it 's like to serve , and you know what it 's like to sacrifice , but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place .
Brokaw : Sen. Obama ?
Obama :
Well ,
Terry , first of all , we honor your service , and we 're grateful for it .
We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon .
It would be a game - changer in the region .
Not only would it threaten Israel , our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world , but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists .
And so it 's unacceptable .
And I will do everything that 's required to prevent it .
And we will never take military options off the table .
And it is important that we do n't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests .
It is important , though , for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we 've got to make those kinds of choices .
And that 's why I have consistently said that , if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran , if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy , so that Iran has less money , if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that , say , for example , Iran right now imports gasoline , even though it 's an oil - producer , because its oil infrastructure has broken down , if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products , that starts changing their cost - benefit analysis .
That starts putting the squeeze on them .
Now , it is true , though , that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends , but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough , direct message to Iran that , if you do n't change your behavior , then there will be dire consequences .
If you do change your behavior , then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations .
Now , it may not work .
But one of the things we 've learned is , is that when we take that approach , whether it's in North Korea or in Iran , then we have a better chance at better outcomes .
When President Bush decided we 're not going to talk to Iran , we 're not going to talk to North Korea , you know what happened ?
Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000 .
North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability .
We 've got to try to have talks , understanding that we 're not taking military options off the table .
Brokaw :
All right , gentlemen , we 've come to the last question .
And you 'll both be interested to know this comes from the Internet and it's from a state that you 're strongly contesting , both of you .
It 's from Peggy in Amherst , New Hampshire .
And it has a certain Zen - like quality , I 'll give you a fair warning .
She says , " What do n't you know and how will you learn it ? "
Sen .
Obama , you get first crack at that .
Obama :
My wife , Michelle , is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do .
And most of the time , I learn it by asking her .
But , look , the nature of the challenges that we 're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect .
It 's the challenges that you do n't that end up consuming most of your time .
But here 's what I do know .
I know that I would n't be standing here if it were n't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity .
I came from very modest means .
I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom , at one point , getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table .
Despite all that , I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country .
The same is true for Michelle and I 'm sure the same is true for a lot of you .
And the question in this election is : are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation ?
Over the last eight years , we 've seen that dream diminish .
Wages and incomes have gone down .
People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick .
We 've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college , but they just do n't have the money .
And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we 've been doing over the last eight years , that somehow we are going to have a different outcome .
We need fundamental change .
That 's what 's at stake in this election .
That 's the reason I decided to run for president , and I 'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America .
But we 're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice , the nerve to move in a new direction .
Thank you .
Brokaw : Sen. McCain , you get the last word .
Sen. Obama had the opening .
You 're last up .
McCain :
Well , thank you , Tom .
And I think what I do n't know is what all of us do n't know , and that 's what 's going to happen both here at home and abroad .
The challenges that we face are unprecedented .
Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation .
There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map , some Americans .
So what I do n't know is what the unexpected will be .
But I have spent my whole life serving this country .
I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country 's business .
My mother basically raised our family .
I know what it 's like in dark times .
I know what it 's like to have to fight to keep one 's hope going through difficult times .
I know what it 's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times .
I know what it 's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight .
That 's what America 's all about .
I believe in this country .
I believe in its future .
I believe in its greatness .
It 's been my great honor to serve it for many , many years .
And I 'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I 'll rest on my record , but I 'll also tell you , when times are tough , we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first .
Thank you , Tom .
Brokaw :
Thank you very much , Sen. McCain .
That concludes tonight 's debate from here in Nashville .
We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission on Presidential Debates .
And you 're in my way of my script there , if you will move .
In addition to everything else , there is one more presidential debate on Wednesday , October 15 , at Hofstra University in New York , moderated by my friend , Bob Schieffer of " CBS News . "
Thank you , Sen. McCain .
Thank you , Sen. Obama .
Good night , everyone , from Nashville .

It 's a Poor Carpenter Who Blames His Tools or : Xcode Sucks Again
The title is n't wholly appropriate because I 'm not going to blame my tools , per se , just complain about them a whole lot .
It occurred to me that we as programmers really do n't have any good tools , and this has been annoying me for some time .
Xcode sucks .
If you 're reading this blog then this is probably like saying " the sky is blue " .
You know already .
Big surprise .
The debugger fails all over the place , autocomplete is broken more often than it works , and the editor wo n't perform acceptably until you throw four Xeon cores at it .
But Xcode is hardly unique in this respect .
In my experience , most programmer tools are of low quality .
There 's the occasional gem , like CodeWarrior or Valgrind , but for the most part they all suck , just to different degrees and in different ways .
Compare this to other professions .
Take a look at any good mechanic 's workshop and you will find a lot of expensive , high - quality tools .
They 're not shopping at Wal - Mart , they 're spending a lot of cash for high - end brands ( whose names I do not know , not being a mechanic ) .
And the quality of these tools is such that they 're worth every penny .
In the realm of physical tools , the word " expensive " brings up certain concepts .
An expensive tool is usually solid and heavy .
It lasts forever .
If it cuts or drills , it treats the material with contempt , as if it were made from butter or perhaps cheese .
In a contest of wills between the tool and its target , the tool always wins .
Now let 's think about what " expensive " developer tools are like .
In the vast majority of cases , " expensive " automatically implies " horrendous " .
Think about it .
When was the last time you heard about somebody using a $ 5,000 specialty compiler and it was n't the beginning of a story about how said compiler was a pile of monkey ?
And the free stuff is n't all that great either .
Of course for Mac developers there 's the canonical example of Xcode , but the GNU toolchain is n't all that great either .
The best thing you can really say about gcc and gdb is that they work , and they 're available on a ridiculous number of platforms .
So why can't I go out and get a compiler , debugger , or IDE that 's the equivalent of the Hole Hawg drill ?
Free or paid , does n't matter .
I think that fundamentally it's a sign of the whole industry 's immaturity .
After all , software development has only been around for about sixty years .
The current standard platform of C plus UNIX ( Windows being just a funny sort of UNIX these days ) has only existed for about half that time , and has only been the de-facto standard for perhaps ten years .
Everyone is still preoccupied with the idea of making tools at all .
Nobody concentrates on making a truly excellent tool because it's not clear exactly what that truly excellent tool would do , and anyway there 's new languages and environments to work on .
I do n't think we 're without hope .
The clang project looks like it might actually produce a worthy C compiler , at last , and in a form which will allow it to form the base of a worthy C editor and worthy C IDE .
This is really just a baby step in the right direction , but I 'm hoping it 's the start of a trend .
I hope that someday it will be obvious what the gold standard in developer tools is , what all reasonable - minded professionals use , and I can just use those .
Until then , I 'll just muddle along , swearing and banging on keys , doing the best I can .

Sarah Palin this week mistakenly called a democratically - elected president of a foreign state a dictator .
In response , Hugo Chavez , who was in 2006 re-elected by a convincing 60 % of voters , evoked Jesus , remarking , “ Forgive her , for she knows not what she says . ” .
So now you know the story : Chavez is not a dictator , he ’s the popularly - elected leader of Venezuala .
Palin did n’t know even this most basic fact about Venezuala , and yet felt qualified to threaten that country with sanctions .
The Associated Press ’ version of this story does not once point out that Venezuala is a democracy .
Without this significant piece of context , Palin ’s innacurate assertion that Chavez is a dictator goes unchallenged .
The gaffe of Palin ’s may be unclear to many readers , and the dismissive nature of Chavez ’ comments may seem unfairly condecending and out of line without any clarifying statements .
Here ’s the story , as it appears at this moment , ( archived in full for purposes of criticism / critique ) :
Venezuela ’s Chavez : Palin a pitiful ‘ beauty queen ’
By RACHEL JONES CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP ) — Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin a “ poor thing ” who did n’t know what she was saying when she called him a dictator .
Friday ’s verbal attack was the latest in long history of creative insults by Chavez — but was not unprovoked .
In an interview with the U.S. Spanish - language network Univision aired Tuesday , Palin remarked that “ through negotiations or sanctions , if necessary , we can pressure dictators like Hugo Chavez to make it clear that they cannot mess with the United States whenever they feel like it . ”
Speaking at an event to inaugurate a thermoelectric plant , Chavez said he had heard of Palin ’s remarks .
“ The poor thing , you have to feel sorry for her , ” he said with a dismissive wave of his hand .
Palin , he said , is “ a beauty queen that they ’ve put in the role of a figurine . ”
Chavez said one must do as Christ did : “ Forgive her , for she knows not what she says . ”
Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s choice of Palin as his running mate surprised the nation and prompted questions about her qualifications to serve as vice president .
The McCain campaign had no comment on Chavez ’ comment .
Palin , the governor of Alaska , says she would take the lead as vice president in energy policy , overall government reform and working with families who have special - needs children .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 800 points to trade below the 10,000 mark Monday as nervousness over the credit crisis spread after the U.S. government 's $ 700 billion bailout and interventions in Europe only seemed to add to investor anxiety .
But hopes of a coordinated intervention to stop the bleeding in global markets helped the Dow DJIA , - 0.47 % recoup half of its losses , to close down 369 points , or 3.6 % , to 9,955 .
" We could have a bounce tomorrow , especially if we get a coordinated rate cut by the three main central banks , [ in the U.S. , Europe and the U.K. ] , " said Robert Pavlik , market strategist at Oaktree Asset Management .
" That would send a message to the market that they 're cognizant of the problems and they 're ready to do something about it . "
On the Dow , Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % fell 5.1 % , Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % dropped 6.6 % and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % lost 4.1 % .

The Dow still closed below the 10,000 mark for the first time since Oct. 26 , 2004 .
" Investors are right on the edge , " said Hugh Johnson , chairman of Johnson Illington Advisors .
" For a while it was denial , then it turned to anxiety , and now it 's closer to fear , " he said .
" I would n't call it panic , but there is some evidence of the beginning of a race to the exits . "
The market 's fear gauge , or VIX VIX , +0.30 % , earlier spiked to a record high of 57.55 , " screaming to the upside as it's supposed to when the market is in crash mode , " said Eliot Spar , market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus .

Also on the Dow , shares of aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. AA , - 4.65 % , which is expected to post quarterly results Tuesday , fell 5.9 % .
Equipment - maker Caterpillar Inc.'s CAT , - 0.18 % stock fell 4 % .
" Right now , it 's about stabilizing the financial system and then see how much collateral damage has been done to the economy , " said Owen Fitzpatrick , head of U.S. equity at Deutsche Bank .
" The clear message is that the global economy is slowing rapidly , and the magnitude of the slowdown is starting to be realized by the market . "

IN HIS hawkish July 15 foreign policy speech posted on his Web site , Barack Obama made the case for withdrawing combat troops from Iraq -- the " distraction " -- and deploying more combat troops to Afghanistan -- the " central front " in the " war on terror . "
This position is quickly becoming the consensus in Washington , and it represents an important development .
The debacle in Iraq has made the American people suspicious of the U.S. government 's military intentions beyond Iraq .
For example , a July 13 poll by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 45 percent of Americans think the war on Afghanistan was not worth it .
Foreign Affairs magazine 's Spring 2008 " Confidence in U.S. Foreign Policy Index " reports that only 12 percent of those polled said they favored the use of force or even the threat of force to deter Iran 's nuclear program .
It also reported that 69 percent of those polled think the U.S. government should emphasize diplomatic efforts in dealing with terrorism instead of military force .
Obama and the U.S. ruling class are trying to salvage the credibility of American military interventions and the war on terror by refocusing on the fight against al - Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
If the Iraqi resistance turns the heat back up in Iraq , then this strategy may fall apart .
But for the time being , Afghanistan is becoming the rallying cry for restoring the image of the American empire .
This will present a political challenge for liberals and moderates who oppose the Iraq war but who have supported some sort of American intervention in Afghanistan .
They do not see that September 11 and al - Qaeda are to Afghanistan what " weapons of mass destruction " and Saddam Hussein are to Iraq -- the pretexts for expanding the reach of the American empire in strategically vital regions .
Given these developments , the central organizing demand for the antiwar movement must be " Troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan . "
In order to be politically viable in this period and relevant to the current U.S. war plans , the antiwar movement must be clear that we want the troops out of Iraq , but we do not want to send them to Afghanistan !
It would be a strange thing indeed if an antiwar demonstration called for pulling the troops out of Iraq , but did not address a simultaneous escalation in Afghanistan .

Companies will build two solar power plants in California that together will put out more than 12 times as much electricity as the largest such plant today , the latest indication that solar energy is starting to achieve significant scale .
The plants will cover 12.5 square miles of central California with solar panels , and in the middle of a sunny day will generate about 800 megawatts of power , roughly equal to the size of a large coal - burning power plant or a small nuclear plant .
A megawatt is enough power to run a large Wal - Mart store .
The power will be sold to Pacific Gas & Electric , which is under a state mandate to get 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010 .
The utility said that it expected the new plants , which will use photovoltaic technology to turn sunlight directly into electricity , to be competitive with other renewable energy sources , including wind turbines and solar thermal plants , which use the sun ’s heat to boil water .
“ These market - leading projects we have in California are something that can be extrapolated around the world , ” Jennifer Zerwer , a spokeswoman for the utility , said .
“ It ’s a milestone . ”
The California Teachers Assn. donated $ 1 million this week to defeat a ballot initiative seeking to ban same - sex marriage in California , joining the ranks of wealthy gay rights activists and Hollywood politicos as one of the major donors to the campaign .
“ For us , it ’s a civil rights issue , ” said the association ’s President David Sanchez .
“ We do n’t believe people should be treated differently . ”
The teachers union also takes issue with advertisements by backers of Proposition 8 suggesting that the measure would stop children from being taught about gay marriage in schools .
Union leaders echoed complaints by the No on 8 campaign that the ads are misleading because California law already prohibits teaching any child health issues without parental consent .
But the Yes on 8 campaign responded that the ads show what happened in Massachusetts , where gay marriage is legal and taught to second graders in public schools after a court battle in which parents lost the right to opt their children out of the lessons .

Until now , the largest donation the No on 8 campaign had received from a labor union was $ 500,000 from the Service Employees International Union .
“ We ’re incredibly proud of the working men and women in California who are supporting the No on 8 campaign , ” said spokeswoman Ali Bay .
Supporters of the proposition said the teachers union did not speak for all of its members on the issue of gay marriage .
“ I think the California Teachers Assn. is well - known to be a political group , and it ’s not the first time it has not represented the true voice of its members , ” said Sonja Eddings Brown , spokeswoman for Protect Marriage California , the measure ’s backer .

She said she agreed that the issue is civil rights -- not those of gay couples , but rather those of children to be raised by a mother and a father .
The $ 1 - million donation comes on the heels of an internal poll by opponents of Proposition 8 showing that the campaign to defeat the measure was in trouble .
The teachers union had already contributed $ 250,000 to the campaign this summer .
Sanchez said the donations were “ a pittance ” compared with what religious groups have donated to proponents of the initiative .
Yes on 8 reported it had raised $ 25.4 million as of two weeks ago , Eddings said , but contributions have continued rolling in since then .
The group ’s major donors have been religious groups and their members .
The Knights of Columbus , for instance , has donated $ 1 million .

The No on 8 campaign stepped up fundraising efforts after realizing that it was $ 10 million behind backers of the initiative , with only about $ 15 million in donations as of Sept. 30 , Bay said .
It has since raised an additional $ 5 million , she said .

The economies of central and eastern Europe are being rocked by the crisis of world capitalism , compounded by the corrupt and pro-big business policies of their local elites .
Defying many economists and commentators , who had forecast that the region would be well placed to deal with the credit crisis due to the lower relative weight of finance capital within their national economies , much of Eastern Europe stands on the verge of insolvency and deep and protracted recession .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Stalinist states , central and eastern Europe provided global capitalism with vast new sources of cheap labour and raw materials .
In the early 1990s the recession affecting the Western economies , accelerated the flow of capital into the former - Soviet countries , with transnational corporations seeking to cut costs by outsourcing to this newly opened - up low tax , cheap labour areas .
Major global manufacturers such as General Motors , Volkswagen and Nokia invested hundreds of millions of dollars into new factories , taking advantage of the large pools of highly - skilled and educated workers , many of whom had lost jobs in the old state - owned industries that were closed following the restoration of capitalism .
Western financial institutions profited from financing the development of new industrial plants , as well as property speculation among the new bourgeois elite and foreign investors in major urban areas like Prague , Warsaw and Bratislava .
Business consultancy , Capital Economics , reports that 17 years after the restoration of capitalism and four years after most joined the European Union ( EU ) , wages in the eastern EU states are still only one fifth of the average of those in Western Europe .
An estimated five million workers have left the eastern European countries for Western Europe between 2004 and 2007 .
The mass migration from the ex-Soviet states has left key sectors of the economy and public services such as healthcare critically short of skilled workers .
Poland and Ukraine almost had to abandon their status as co-hosts of the 2012 European Football Championship due to the chronic shortages of labour needed to renew facilities for the competition .
Only a few months ago , a recession in Western Europe was viewed as a potential boon to overheated Eastern Europe economies .
Inflation , running at 15 percent in Russia and Latvia , seemed to be the greatest threat .
However , as the full impact of the global crisis unfolds , the alleged ability of Eastern Europe to weather the storm relatively better than its Western counterparts has been thrown into question .
All the economies of the eastern European region are highly dependent on credit from the international markets .
The Institute of International Finance has estimated that total private capital and credit flows into eastern Europe , the former USSR and Turkey , are likely to fall from nearly $ 400 billion in 2007 to an estimated $ 262 billion next year , a figure which may fall even further as it is based on optimistic forecasts of the effectiveness of the international governmental bailouts of the banks .
Erik Berglof , chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , stated that the eastern European countries , “ could deal with rising borrowing costs and an economic slowdown coming from the US and Western Europe , but a complete shutdown of international borrowing — nobody can withstand that . ”
The International Monetary Fund forecasts a fall in the growth rate for gross domestic product ( GDP ) for central and southeast Europe from 5 percent this year to 3.5 percent in 2009 .
For Russia and the former Soviet Union , it predicts growth of around 7 percent for this year and 5.5 percent for 2009 .
Emergency bailout for Hungary
Even these figures fail to show the full impact of the economic crisis on countries whose economies are heavily dependent on exports to the wealthier western EU .
The impact of a recession in France , Germany and Britain will be acutely painful to the eastern economies of Europe .
The Czech Republic , for example , relies on exports to the wealthier euro currency zone for 40 percent of its GDP .
As the British magazine , the Economist , stated , “ If Germany gets a headache , eastern Europe gets a migraine . ”
On October 16 , the same day countries across the EU pledged to shore up the banking system with a package whose total could exceed € 2 trillion , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) granted Hungary a bailout worth € 5 billion , saving its economy from a financial meltdown .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is poised to offer the country a further , and probably much larger , bailout loan .
Last week , Hungary put tight controls on foreign exchange lending in an effort to stabilise the country ’s troubled financial sector .
This prompted a massive drop in the value of the Hungarian currency and stock market , quickly followed by sharp rises on the news of the ECB bailout .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hungary has a very high level of foreign public debt — 60 percent of GDP — meaning that the country is less attractive to foreign investors and less creditworthy to private and international lenders .
Global credit ratings agencies Fitch and Standard and Poor ’s have lowered Hungary ’s rating to BBB + , the third lowest investment grade offered to any country .
In addition , many ordinary citizens and local firms have loans with Hungarian banks that have been packaged in complex schemes based on the speculation that the Hungarian forint would stay on the same exchange rate as the euro .
That situation is likely to change as Hungary ’s high budget and current account deficits pressure the devaluation of its currency , which is now trading at a two - year low , further destabilising its banking system .
The government of Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany has reduced its official GDP growth forecast for 2009 from three percent to just 1.2 percent , and has acknowledged it is planning a budget based on a zero percent growth rate next year .
The Hungarian government has pledged to cut its budget deficit , meaning that public services spending and wages will be driven down .
Nick Chamie , of RBC Capital Markets , has warned that much of eastern Europe is ill - equipped to bail out the financial system and may suffer the same fate as Iceland , whose financial system has seized - up with the collapse of its three major banks .
“ The three Baltic states along with Ukraine , Kazakhstan , Bulgaria and Romania — and of course Iceland — are top of the list , ” of those vulnerable to an investment exodus , Chamie warned .
Baltic states in crisis
Latvia and Estonia are officially the first economies in the eastern EU to fall into recession .
Lithuania , whose growth has been slower than its Baltic neighbours , is likely to officially enter a recession in early 2009 and has been forced to guarantee the deposits of savers up to the value of € 100,000 , double the average EU guaranteed amount .
The Lithuanian prime minister was forced to appeal for calm in early October , stating that “ There is no danger for any Lithuanian bank to go bankrupt .
We monitor the situation constantly . ”
The country ’s banking sector is dominated by the Swedish bank SEB .
The heads of government of all three Baltic states issued statements October 10 insisting that their countries were not headed for insolvency .
“ It is impossible to compare Lithuania with Iceland , ” Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas told a joint news conference with his Latvian counterpart .
Reinhard Cluse , “ emerging Europe ” economist for Switzerland ’s UBS bank , was more cautious , stating in response to the financial situation in the Baltic states :
“ Iceland was a special case , but the same rising waters that flooded Iceland first are a problem for others , too . ”

WASHINGTON --
For the last 150 years , most American war presidents -- most notably Lincoln , Wilson , Roosevelt -- have entered ( or re-entered ) office knowing war was looming .
Not so George Bush .
Not so the war on terror .
The 9/11 attacks literally came out of the blue .
Indeed , the three presidential campaigns between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11 were the most devoid of foreign policy debate of any in the 20th century .
The commander - in - chief question that dominates our campaigns today was almost nowhere in evidence during our '90s holiday from history .
When I asked President Bush during an interview Monday to reflect on this oddity , he cast himself back to early 2001 , recalling what he expected his presidency would be about : education reform , tax cuts and military transformation from a Cold War structure to a more mobile force adapted to smaller - scale 21st - century conflict .
But a wartime president he became .
And that is how history will both remember and judge him .
Getting a jump on history , many books have already judged him .
The latest by Bob Woodward describes the commander in chief as unusually aloof and detached .
A more favorably inclined biographer might have called it equanimity .
In the hour I spent with the president ( devoted mostly to foreign policy ) , that equanimity was everywhere in evidence -- not the resignation of a man in the twilight of his presidency but a sense of calm and confidence in eventual historical vindication .
It is precisely that quality that allowed him to order the surge in Iraq in the face of intense opposition from the political establishment ( of both parties ) , the foreign policy establishment ( led by the feckless Iraq Study Group ) , the military establishment ( as chronicled by Woodward ) and public opinion itself .
The surge then effected the most dramatic change in the fortunes of an American war since the summer of 1864 .
That kind of resolve requires internal fortitude .
Some have argued that too much reliance on this internal compass is what got us into Iraq in the first place .
But Bush was hardly alone in that decision .
He had a majority of public opinion , the commentariat and Congress with him .
In addition , history has not yet rendered its verdict on the Iraq War .
We can say that it turned out to be longer and more costly than expected , surely .
But the question remains as to whether the now - likely outcome -- transforming a virulently aggressive enemy state in the heart of the Middle East into a strategic ally in the war on terror -- was worth it .
I suspect the ultimate answer will be far more favorable than it is today .
When I asked the president about his one unambiguous achievement , keeping us safe for seven years -- about 6 1/ 2 years longer than anybody thought possible at the time of 9/11 -- he was quick to credit both the soldiers keeping the enemy at bay abroad and the posse of law enforcement and intelligence officials hardening our defenses at home .
But he alluded also to some of the measures he had undertaken , including " listening in on the enemy " and " asking hardened killers about their plans . "
The CIA has already told us that interrogation of high - value terrorists like Khalid Sheik Mohammed yielded more valuable intelligence than any other source .
In talking about these measures , the president mentioned neither this testimony as to their efficacy nor the campaign of vilification against him that these measures occasioned .
More equanimity still .
What the president did note with some pride , however , is that beyond preventing a second attack , he is bequeathing to his successor the kinds of powers and institutions the next president will need to prevent further attack and successfully prosecute the long war .
And indeed , he does leave behind a Department of Homeland Security , reorganized intelligence services with newly developed capacities to share information , and a revised FISA regime that grants broader and modernized wiretapping authority .
In this respect , Bush is much like Truman , who developed the sinews of war for a new era ( the Department of Defense , the CIA , the NSA ) , expanded the powers of the presidency , established a new doctrine for active intervention abroad , and ultimately engaged in a war ( Korea ) -- also absent an attack on the U.S. -- that proved highly unpopular .
So unpopular that Truman left office disparaged and highly out of favor .
History has revised that verdict .
I have little doubt that Bush will be the subject of a similar reconsideration .

Let 's say you have two families like this , the father of one family is good at hunting while the father of the other family is good at finding edible fruits and mushrooms .
Since it 's better to live on a diet of meat and fruits instead of just meat and just fruits because of the pattern of migration of the animals and the seasonality of the fruits , the two families share with each other .
But let 's say one of the families do n't provide as much of something as the other one , or not all the time , how do you determine how much fruit and meat do you share with the other family ?
What happens when the other family just eats a lot and get fat , and only bring food to you from time to time ?
So you learn to trade , the families swap fruit and meat with each other , but not in equal amounts because certain factors determine their value .
In winter it takes triple the effort to find fruits as it is to do hunting , so you learn that you need to give triple the amount of meat for the same amount of fruit during winter .
If the hunter does n't agree that value with the fruit picker , he could decide not to trade at that value .
He could either decide to stick to meat in winter or dry some fruits during summer to eat in the winter , or both .
The fruit picker wants access to meat in winter so he decides to lower his price .
Alternatively the hunter could decide that hunting is still less effort and a lot better than doing the whole dried fruit thing , so he decides that during winter it 's worth paying more meat for fruit .
In summer he has to hunt less for fruit since fruit is cheap .
Hey presto , efficiency reached , in winter the hunter works harder and ends up providing meat for his family and the fruit picker 's , and the fruit picker works harder during the end of summer so that he has enough fruit to provide for both families over winter .
All this happened without having to rely on a higher authority , campaigning or violence in order to make things fair and efficient .
Anyway , that 's Econ101 .
Unfortunately it 's hard for people to take that concept and scale it up to more complex arrangements , like we have today .
Where the hunter subcontracting the hunting duties to younger and healthier males to do the running around , where the price of meat is affected by running out of animals in the forest , where the fruit picker starts to grow foods , and find foods that can store through a whole winter , where they develop a medium of exchange ( money ) , one that can be stored and traded later , where governments starts to determine the value of the medium of exchange and can create fake money out of thin air and the distortion and loss of value is called inflation , where the hunter can give meat to the fruit picker in exchange for a promise that he 'll be given more fruit in summer , plus some extra since he had to wait so long etc .
We have the vast and complex system as we have today .
Even while it 's efficient , and everyone is better off exponentially more than before , and exponentially more than other older or failed experimental systems like socialism , communism , anarcho - syndicalism , feudalism and the likes , there are still some who suffer .
We still want to blame the winners for the losers .
Unfortunately it 's hard for people to understand exactly how and why , even many smart people .
Instead we fall back to the way we understand the system as we learned to discover it as we were growing up under our parents and while being students .
Some deny the fact that it was the system we have that gave us the platform to develop all the technologies we have today that makes life so easy for us that we can sit in an air conditioned office all day and work light and socialise with people around the world over the internet and get drunk afterwards , or at the bottom of the scale make it so cheap to produce food that there is n't a democratic and capitalistic country in the world where people die of hunger .
I hope I 'm doing a charitable deed by trying to help educate people who struggle to understand all of this , since the well intended solutions to try help those who suffer can actually bring terrible suffering to this world .
" Money is a man made creation and in itself worth nothing .
Why are we compelled to affix price tags to everything ? "
I 'm going to try to explain : is just our convenient measure of the worth of things .
It 's a bit like saying gallons are n't worth anything , but at the same time more gallons of fuel are worth more than less gallons of fuel .
Perhaps some people might benefit by having a fresh look at money to realise why we measure things in this way .
Some people have a very simplistic view ofand of economics in general .
The kind of view you develop when you 're a child in your parents ' house .
Your mother is the source of a cake and other such treats , and if your brother gets more of the cake it means there is less cake for you .
All pocketand decisions about freedom comes from your parents , and you grow up to realise the importance of some of the rules they have established with you when you were young , like not letting you run across the highway when you 're 6 years old .
for material things like video games , music , bicycles , skate boards and clothes comes from your parents , and you know that you can't have more of these things because your parents wo n't give you morefor these things , and they tell you that they do n't have moreto give , so you realise that thisis important and you learn that theat their disposal is finite just like the size of the cake is finite .
After school you might go and study , where it might be paid by your parents , or paid or subsidised from tax , you go to educational institutions filled with teachers who normally have never achieved success in the commercial world outside of academia , or only know about getting education or educating others and getting paid by their employer , the educational institution , who gets theirfrom your parents either directly or indirectly through taxes .
Up to this point you learn thatis important , and that the disposable amount that anyone has is finite , and that it 's their choice as to how much of that amount they want to give to others or not .
You know that they get theirfrom employers , and employers decide how much they get or they do n't get and that if they want to have more they have to convince these employers to give them more money .
Then you develop the belief that those who are poor are so because someone has decided to give them less , and there are others who have a lot ofat their disposal who can afford to give these people more , but do n't .
This seems all very unfair and is a bit like your mother deciding to give your brother two thirds of the cake and you only a third .
You feel that to correct this , the employer or the government has to fix it by adjusting the portion of the handouts fairly .
You also develop the idea that your mother , employer or government are what controls the allocation of money , and that you need to combine the strength of everyone in the same position in order to campaign and persuade these authorities to give you more .
For instance if you and two of your siblings tell your mother that you do n't want to eat asparagus , and want carrots instead , your mother is more likely to comply especially if you all refuse to eat or refuse to stop screaming together .
The same goes in forming unions to prevent employers from exploiting you and your fellow workers , or forming lobby groups or nationwide strikes to convince the government .
You develop the belief that this is the only way to bring chance and establish fairness .
I can easily see how this thinking develops .
It 's a product of the way we grow up and the society we grow up in .
It 's hard for us to understand how this came to be .
We learn about previous kings , dictators and rulers of the past , so there 's always been an elite class with more control over the distribution of wealth , just like our parents had more control over our lives while we were growing up .
This way of perceiving the system is familiar to us , and we see the suffering of others , just like we suffered when our mothers took away a treat , freedom , privilege or pocketif we did n't do something in a way she wanted .
We focus on those in control , since they obviously have the means , and hold them responsible for the suffering of ourselves and others .
Perhaps you can start seeing it in a different perspective if you take a society from scratch .
Let 's start with a small family , mother , father and three children .
The father goes hunting , the mother prepares food and feed the kids .
The oldest child makes sure the younger children wo n't kill themselves by going out too far and fall into the river or get eaten by lions .
The older child has learned that his mother and father is angry at him in unpleasant ways if he does n't do what they say .
They instruct and teach him to do things in this way because they want him to know what to do to stay alive and succeed , and help them stay alive and succeed at that .
The younger children learn this at the same time .
Nois involved in establishing the worth here , only love and the will to survive and better their life and chance of survival .
When facing external danger like predators or food shortages , they help each other at fighting , hunting and sharing the food .
Within the family you have natural solidarity , or socialism .
Brothers and sisters could implement some kind of measurement between each other when it comes to the value of their acts , for example if one gets more honey than the other they might fight over it to settle that and decide everyone should get an equal amount except for the one who 's hurt the others on purpose during play , but if the oldest brother gets more meat then they could all agree that it is fair since he needs to be strong in order to protect the younger children from predators .
See , even now you have to put a measurement on the worth to the older brother , even in a family structure driven by love and solidarity .
If strangers ’ snap judgments matter , you go for a bit more artifice .
Take an attractive single friend of mine .
When she moved to Los Angeles , she signed up with an online dating service , using a handy snapshot to illustrate her profile .
She got no inquiries .
Then she hired one of the many local photographers who specialize in actors ’ headshots .
With exactly the same profile information but a more professional photo , my friend was suddenly inundated with emails from prospective dates .
She did n’t even use retouching or special makeup .
The difference she says , “ was the lighting , the camera angles , plus the sheer volume of shots . ”
She had hundreds to choose from .
Partisans demand that magazine portraits glamorize their heroes for the same reason my friend hired a professional photographer .
Humans seem hard - wired to assume that good - looking means good and , conversely , to equate physical flaws with character flaws .
We may preach that beauty is skin deep , but we ’re equally certain that portraits “ reveal character . ”
In a media culture , we not only judge strangers by how they look but by the images of how they look .
So we want attractive pictures of our heroes and repulsive images of our enemies .
Consider a recent political controversy involuntarily involving this magazine .
After taking a series of shots for a conventional cover portrait of John McCain , Jill Greenberg tricked the candidate into having a picture taken in which she lit him from below , a classic technique to make the subject look evil .
Neither the candidate nor his staff noticed that the photographer had literally cast McCain in a bad light .
“ I guess they ’re not very sophisticated , ” she told the online magazine PDN , boasting further that she had n’t retouched the neutral shot she sold The Atlantic .
“ I left his eyes red and his skin looking bad , ” she said .
As this story illustrates , having a portrait taken for publication demands a great deal of trust in the competence and good will of the photographer and photo editor .
Greenberg deceived not only McCain but The Atlantic , which objected strenuously to the abuse of trust .
But suppose the magazine had been in on the ruse .
Does a portrait subject have a reasonable expectation of normal lighting ?
Most people would say yes .
In fact , except for professional models , photo subjects generally expect the wedding album standard to apply : Photos should look realistic , but as attractive as possible .
Anything else , whatever artistic justification the photographer or editor may put forward , feels like an ambush .
Nobody voluntarily agrees to an unappealing portrait .
After The New York Times Magazine used nonstandard film to shoot a 2006 cover picture of Virginia Governor Mark Warner , the publication apologized because the film altered the photo ’s colors , making Warner ’s gray suit appear maroon .
But critics objected not only to the artificial colors but to what seemed like a deliberately unnatural and disturbing image of the governor , one that Gawker described as giving “ off that smarmy politician vibe that made you turn over the magazine on your coffee table so you did n’t have to keep looking at him . ”
Lots of sesquipedalians out there , judging by the response to our feature on the man who reads dictionaries for fun , Ammon Shea .
We asked for your favourite words and were overwhelmed with nominations .
Here we list 50 of the best .
1 . To throw something ( someone ) out of a window is to defenestrate .
I love this word because it immediately brings some interesting memories to the front , not to mention makes me think of some new things to toss out of a window .
Lee Nachtigal , West Hartford , Connecticut , USA 2 .
Poodle - faker - a young man too much given to taking tea with ladies .
Jane , Pembroke 3 . Omphaloskepsis ( self - absorbed , navel - gazing ) .
I 'm not really a selfish person , but I do occasionally need someone to remind me to look up from my navel .
Plus , things that have to do with belly - buttons are generally pretty fun .
Anise Brock , San Francisco , USA 4 .
Mallemaroking - the carousing of seamen in icebound ships .
A wonderfully useful word !
How many icebound ships do we all know ?
Sue H , Tiverton 5 . Spanghew - to cause ( esp. a toad or frog ) to fly into the air off the end of a stick .
( In northern and Scottish use . )
Why ?
Well , all one has to do is imagine the myriad situations in which one might use this word .
Michael Everson , Ireland 6 . Scrimshanker - one who accepts neither responsibility nor work .
Maurice De Ville , Chesterfield 7 . Zareba - a protective hedge around a village or camp , particularly in the Sudan .
Used to great effect by PG Wodehouse in , for example , The Clicking Of Cuthbert , with his description of a Russian novelist : " Vladimir Brusiloff had permitted his face to become almost entirely concealed behind a dense zareba of hair . "
Peter Skinner , Morpeth , UK 8 .
I first heard Stephen Fry ( of course ! ) use this on QI .
Tmesis -
To break one word with another .
For example : dis -bloomin - graceful , un - flippin - believable .
Use it mainly when talking to British Gas .
Colin Rogers , Maidenhead , Berks 9 .
I love the word quidnunc , which means one who gossips because it is a word I could use to describe a lot of people who fit the definition and they would n't know what I was saying .
Katie , Hickory Hills , IL , USA 10 .
Ischial callosities is a great description , because of its precision .
It refers to the leather - like pads on a monkey 's bum .
Paul Edward Hughes , Langley , Canada 11 .
One of my favourite words is cryptomnesia because it captures the meaning of a whole process that I previously never thought could make it into a single meaningful word .
Of course it makes sense , and literally means " buried memory " .
I first came across it reading Jung when he described the process of forgetting the source of some information and assuming you 've known it all along .
That 's such an ephemeral process , and I 'm fascinated by it as much as the word used to describe it .
Alan Languirand , Ypsilanti MI , USA 12 .
One of my favourite words is urt .
Urt is almost onomatopoeic , since an urt is a " leftover bit " .
Eric McConnachie , Clear Lake , Ontario , CANADA 13 .
I like the word termagant meaning a quarrelsome shrew of a woman - because it 's just obscure enough to get mixed up with " ptarmigan " , a lovely bird .
Jan , Portland , Oregon , USA 14 .
Oxter - space under the arm ( not the armpit ) eg he walked down the street with a copy of the Times under his oxter .
David McLoughlin , Dublin , Ireland 15 .
Spelunking - the hobby or practice of exploring caves .
The word just sounds good , I love it !
Rachel , Reading 16 .
Petrichor - the sweet smell of rain on dry earth .
Although I would n't consider myself enough of a lexiphane ( another good word , meaning " one who uses words pretentiously " ) to bring it up in every day conversation .
Plus , living in Scotland , dry earth is n't a phenomenon I 'm used to .
Natalie , Glasgow 17 .
Frippet ( noun ) - A flighty young woman prone to showing off .
Could be used for the vast majority of contestants on Big Brother .
Charley , Bristol 18 .
Panglossian - Excessively or naively optimistic .
The world needs more people like this now than ever !
VJ Patel , Luton , UK 19 .
I love the word proprioception ( go ahead and look it up - I define it as knowing where you are in the world , where your body stops and everything else begins ) .
I learned it in an undergraduate psychology course , probably .
One of my favourite things about this word is that I can never remember it !
I 'll come across a use for it and then rack my brain for several minutes before having to give up and then of course suddenly remembering it ( there 's another word I have the same experience with but I can't remember what it is just now ) .
There 's a French term that I believe is tangentially relevant to proprioception - " jusqu'au bout " .
It means " to the end " but it was explained to me ( by a nice young French man , many years ago ! ) in the context of " je t'aime jusqu 'au bout " , as in to love someone all the way to the ends of their fingers and tips of their ears ( etc ! ) .
Marni Law , Brisbane , Australia 20 .
If you ever fly into the US , then one of the questions you 're asked on the entry form you have to fill in is " Have you ever been convicted of moral turpitude ? "
What a great word turpitude is !
I 've never heard it anywhere else , but I can guess what it means and that the required answer is " NO " .
Just the sound of it is faintly dubious , once you 've realised that it 's not something you use to clean your paint brushes with .
Stevie , Brighton 21 .
I like the word discombobulated .
It has a staccato , mechanical sound and conjures up an image of a robot scrabbling to hold itself together when all its nuts and bolts suddenly start to fall out .
Which is just how one feels when discombobulated !
Sally Ratapu , Auckland , New Zealand 22 .
Floccinaucinihilipilification - this word was used by Bollywood star Amitabh Bachhan 20 years ago while giving an interview .
I was struck by his choice of word and the meaning of it !
Sudip Mazumder , London 23 .
Pusillanimous ( lacking in courage or strength of purpose ) just sounds funny and derisive and insulting .
David Benning , Davis , CA USA 24 .
Sepulchral - of or pertaining to the tomb .
I just love the way it sounds and the movements my mouth must make to say it .
To be sure , I rarely have the opportunity to use it , except during Halloween .
Gregory Strucaly , Apollo , PA , USA 25 .
I love the word sphygmomanometer , which is the medical instrument used to measure blood pressure .
Try saying it after a drink or two .
Lucy , Cambridge , UK 26 .
Crepuscular , which means " of or like twilight " .
Sarah , Bedford , UK 27 .
Sinecure - a position or office that requires little or no work but provides a salary .

Mike Crompton , Hayfield , High Peak 30 .
Runcible as used in Edward Lear 's poem The Owl and the Pussycat - given in Chambers Dictionary as meaning a pickle - fork but used in our household as anything , especially cutlery , which is slightly ill - matched or bent / crooked .
Kirsty Harrison , Binfield , Berkshire 31 .
I very much enjoy palimpsest because you would never think that there was a word for something so specific as that : " A parchment or other writing surface on which the original text has been effaced or partially erased , and then overwritten by another . "
Its etymology is beautifully direct .
From Ancient Greek " palin " meaning " again " ( as in palindrome ) and " psen " which means " to rub smooth " .
William Kraemer , London , UK 32 .
I like susurrus which means a soft murmuring or rustling sound .
Terry Pratchett used it to great effect in one of his books , and I could n't help hearing the sound of a gentle breeze on tree leaves whenever I read it .
Almost like magic .
Sarah , Woking 33 .
I just like the sound of the word tintinnabulation and if you look it up in the OED , it simply describes a sound made by the ringing of a bell .
Imagine using such a word in everyday language .
Earl Okezie , Lokoja , Nigeria 34 .
Maieutic is one of my favourite obscure words .
It means pertaining to intellectual midwifery and describes as no other word does a phenomenon that happens more often than you might think .
It is very rewarding when you can match the moment to the word .
Martin Ackland , London 35 .
Crenellate - to furnish a wall with crenels or battlements , the rectangular " gaps " seen atop castle towers .
For me , this word conjures up images of seaside holidays and carefully constructed sandcastles .
Simon Bonner , Liverpool , UK 36 .
Borborygmus - the rumbling sound that comes from an empty stomach .
Rupam , Ashburn , VA USA 37 .
Fug .
I love jazz and have always thought a cellar jazz bar with a hazy atmosphere created through captivating music and hazy smoke would be perfect if called " The Fug " .
However , the smoking ban now prohibits any kind of fug .
And " The Sanitary " just does n't have the right ring .
Julian Williams , Stourport - on - Severn 38 .
Metanoia - the act or process of changing one 's mind or way of life - is so beautiful .
Sa Smith 39 .
Estivate ( the opposite of hibernate ) , because that is what I do .

Rodomontade is my favourite , meaning boastful .
Difficult to use in conversation though !
Kevin Murphy , Glasgow 41 .
Slubberdegullion is a favourite word of mine , meaning , roughly , a worthless person .
Throw it in next time you 're gossiping about someone .
Bob Baker , Dunster , England 42 .
I like erythrismal , meaning " red by nature " .
An example would be a fox or a robin's breast .
However , I am a redhead , so may be biased
Judith - Anne MacKenzie , London 43 .
Chatoyant is a word I learned from a poet / artist friend , and I teach it , or use it , whenever possible , which is quite often .
It means something that glows from deep within , like a cat 's eye ( chat ) , or star sapphires , or highly polished hard woods .
Roxann , Alexandria , MN , USA 44 .
I like enervating ( to weaken physically ) because it sounds like it SHOULD mean the opposite to what it DOES mean .
Bob , Edinburgh 45 .
Tatterdemalion - a person with tattered clothing or of unkempt appearance .
This word has , to my mind , a " bouncy " rhythm to it and use it often .
I know several people who could have this word attributed to them ...
Graham , Luton , England 46 .
Mellifluous - sweet , pleasant - sounding speech , words or music - is a my favourite word , though I suppose it could n't really be classed as obscure .
It 's so beautifully onomatopoeic .
Maura Evans , Bradford 47 .
A word I recently learned and immediately liked , is ideation .
It 's like you take a creative word and turn it into a verb , make it creatING !
Ideation means " the process of thought " or " the conceptualization of a mental image " .
Theresa , Rotterdam , the Netherlands 48 .
I used to love the word syzygy because , in the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary , its definition ( in the mathematical sense ) went something like : " A group of rational , integral functions , which , when severally multiplied together , the sum of the products vanishes identically . "
Reggie Thomson , Cambridge , England 49 .
My favourite word is sesquipedalian .
From the Latin , sesquipedalis , meaning a foot - and - a - half , it means given to using long words .
Chris Howard , Morden ... which is probably a fitting adjective for ... 50 .
I 'm disposed to immediately feel dyspathy with a secretary like Shea , but after goving at his story for a while , I begin to hansardize .
There 's no point in being philodoxical just because an apparently mundane subject deeply happifies another .
I may stroke my natiform chin sceptically at Shea 's cachinnations , but if such things truly make him tripudiate , then who am I to be the pejorist ?

CNBC just reported that the auction of Lehman 's garbage CDS assets have produced bids of 9 cents on the dollar , much less than expected .
They may go up before the close ( expected 2 PM )
Implication :
If the Lehman bids do n't change , there will have to be some MASSIVE writedowns across the industry .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street ’s finally wised up to what the rest of America has been trying to tell it for a while : there wo n’t be a consumer snap - back in the third quarter .
A man waits in line at BJ's Wholesale Club store in New York , August 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
With that in mind , analysts have slashed their earnings forecasts for the sector most sensitive to the consumer ’s ability to spend beyond the basics .
Consumer spending -- which was supported somewhat in the second quarter by the government ’s tax rebate checks -- remains under the gun .
Home prices continue to slide , the price of oil remains uncomfortably high and more and more Americans are claiming unemployment benefits .
At the beginning of the year , Wall Street analysts were forecasting a recovery in overall S&P 500 earnings in the third quarter , led by a 50 percent jump in profits at companies that sell non-necessities .
Now , the same analysts see profits at so - called consumer discretionary companies declining by 6 percent , according to Thomson Reuters proprietary data .
Over the past four quarters , the sector has recorded an average earnings growth rate of - 17 percent .
“ These numbers are more realistic than what the Street had been anticipating .
I do n’t think the buy - side was expecting the third and fourth quarter to be positive , the sell - side analysts are just slow to catch up , ” said John Massey , portfolio manager at AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City , New Jersey ,
“ Most of this is related to the macroeconomic environment , which has forced consumers to rein in their spending . ”
Consumers are also being forced to watch their spending as credit card companies , hit hard by the credit crunch , are taking a more stringent approach to their clients ’ risk profiles .
Even earnings at consumer staples companies , which make daily necessities like soap and food , are now seen falling 1 percent .
These estimate revisions reflect the overall earnings picture for the third quarter .
Wall Street has ratcheted down its view of the third - quarter outlook for nine out of 10 S&P 500 sectors , the exception being energy .
The estimated third - quarter earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 , which was 12.6 percent at the beginning of July , now stands at 2.6 percent .
And it ’s hurtling toward negative -- on Thursday , the growth rate stood at 3.2 percent .
The sector expected to see the biggest decline is , once again , the financials .
Over the past few weeks , one Wall Street firm after another has slashed their views of their competitors ’ earnings outlooks as the grip of the credit crisis showed no sign of slackening .
Tight credit conditions are also hurting companies not directly linked to the financial sector , as lenders are more reluctant to make new business loans and refinancing is tough , analysts said .
David James , senior vice president at James Investment Research in Alpha , Ohio , said that , with bank lending still under pressure , companies across a variety of industries are likely to begin to feel more of an impact on their bottom line .
“ It ’s a bear market .
The other sectors are going to feel it in their profits too , ” James said .
The price of oil , while more than 20 percent off its record peak in July , is still significantly higher than it was a year ago , and is raising production costs for many companies , warned Massey .
“ I think a lot of the negative earnings revision you have are due to input costs that are causing margins to compress , ” he said .
While most companies have hedged their input costs , some of these hedges are starting to roll off , Massey said .
The biggest boost to the overall earnings picture is still the energy sector , where earnings are seen rising 61 percent in the third quarter .
That ’s up from a 22 percent rise seen at the beginning of the year , but down from the 63 percent increase seen at the beginning of the week .
But if the price of oil continues to fall in the third quarter , this is likely to affect energy sector profits in the next quarters , said Robert Schaeffer , vice president and portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management .
Other potential pitfalls in the third quarter include the impact of a global economic slowdown and a rise in the dollar on the earnings of multinational companies , said John Schloegel , vice president of investment strategies for Capital Cities Asset Management in Austin , Texas .
“ This is the slowest train wreck in our history .
...
Everyone saw this coming but did n’t really know the impact , ” Schloegel said .
Earlier today , Aaron Brazell over at Technosailor invoked his fellow technology bloggers to speak up and become leaders through what he sees as " the darkest hour in our recent history . "
We need leaders .
We need people who are going to step up and instill confidence .
Fred Wilson did this yesterday and I want to see more from a fiscally minded individual like him ( he ’s a VC ) .
Scoble is still trying to process it all , and that ’s expected , but I hope he will come to grips and start inspiring people at some point .
All of the proverbial A - listers need to step up their games right now and be leaders .
He 's right in one sense .
I 'm not convinced that these are necessarily our darkest hours , but the real crisis may be one of confidence , rather than purely economic in nature .
Here 's the problem - and I never thought I 'd say this as a former precocious youth myself - the dominant figures in the tech business are kids .
I do n't at all have any disrespect for these ' kids ' that are doing incedibly well for themselves .
' Kids ' like Mark Zuckerberg , running a multi-billion dollar company .
Kids ' like Corvida and Alana Taylor , which do bang up jobs blogging with the big boys .
' Kids ' like my boss , Pete Cashmore .
Obviously , with that list of folks in the category of people I 'm talking about today , you know I 'm not meaning to speak ill of a whole age - group of people ( or the incredibly gifted and talented guy who signs my paycheck ) .
But the majority of the pundits , bloggers , and businessmen have no perspective or frame of reference for our current troubled times .
None of them have survived an economic downturn before .
Most of them were still in high school during the original tech bust .
Many of them were toddlers during the the market crashes in the 80's ( if they were yet born ) .
That in and of itself says wonders about the economic times we live in , but it also means that when they see the market take a down - turn like it did this week , they freak out .
They say things like
" ... this feels like a bad economy . " " ... we still have a lot further to fall before it gets better . "
" I get the sense this is major .
Like , culture shifting ... "
" This is the most catastrophic economic shift of our age . "
I 've intentionally left out people 's names on these actual quotes , because you 'd recognize the people involved , and this is n't about calling folks out .
The truth is that everything I 've quoted above lacks ' historical ' perspective .
In 2002 , that was bad for not just those of us in technology , but everyone .
At the time , I was living in Dallas , and I had been an " independent contractor " for almost a year and half .
I put that in quotes because that was the preferred politically correct nomenclature for " unemployed " at the time .
Before I and 699 other co-workers were laid off , I had been a coder at Nokia , and was instrumental in writing the standards and specifications for the mobile phone ringtone .
Over the next year or so , I scraped by with doing website design and networking gigs
On that day , my roomate and I opened up the Dallas Morning News , and on the front page was a fellow standing in the middle of I - 35 , the highway most famous for being the opening scene of Office Space , holding up a sign that said " have MCSE , will work for food . "
Here was someone who had a Microsoft System 's Engineering certification , probably who made $ 50 - 60 k before he was laid off .
If he was in a position anything like mine , he was facing the real threat of starvation , not to mention the loss of a newly built house through missed mortgage payments , and no real work in site ( technical in nature or not ) .
Here we are today , though , with an economy that despite the problems in the real estate and investment banking sectors , still employs about 94 % of us .
Relative to the total size of the US workforce , the recent layoffs have been very minor .
Overall unemployment figures are only very slightly off from where they should be for a healthy economy .
Moreover , we live in an age that thanks to the advancements in technology in the last five years or so , allows us to be entrepreneurial much more readily than ever before .
Yes , Steven and I love to crankily talk about how useless much of the crap in the Web 2.0 world is , but thanks to tools and concepts like eBay , Google Docs , co-working , social networking , cloud computing and Mechanical Turk - anyone who 's able to afford a laptop has the market capitalisation to open up a whole functioning office .
Think about it .
Sure , it 's not enterprise level , but it 'll make due in a pinch .
You can mostly get by while your business gets on it's feet with these tools .
There are hundreds of niche - specific marketplaces to sell your ideas , goods and services .
The minutia related tools for managing your business are all free now .
You do n't have to leave your couch to network with and meet the people who can assist you in your business 's growth .
Your server costs can be almost nil .
There 's even on - demand workforces for menial tasks .
A while back , I read an account of a single mom who , despite being an employed , skilled and degreed worker had to take her family to a soup kitchen .
I found the article via Chris Brogan 's link blog .
He shared it because it was a heart - wrenching tale that pulled at struck home for most of the intellectual workers who read his linkblog .
The story was introduced with the following opening paragraph :
Someone would have to be extremely cold - hearted not to be moved by some of the reports that have been appearing lately , describing the difficulties people are facing as they try to cope with the downturn in housing and the economy and the surge in food and gasoline prices .
When I re-shared the story , this is what I had to say :
I think I might be cold - hearted .
In the midst of what must be the most horrible " recession " ( by these tales ) since the fall of Rome , I 'm seeing the most opportunity and growth for everyone from the common man on up to the upper crust upper class .
Simply put , if you have the ability to send emails from the comfort of your own home telling people how down and out you are , then you have the ability to buy dinner .
When I read this story , I do n't think " Gee , what a horrible set of circumstances this person has fallen into . "
I think " This person is n't very resourceful . "
That 's the point I 'm driving at , today .
Anyone who has the capability to read this has an economic responsibility amidst all this bad news .
We have a responsibility to be encouraging to our fellow social media denizens ( and our real life compatriots ) .
We all have the tools at our disposal to carry ourselves through whatever economic crisises come our way .
In the two years prior to working for Mashable , I had made it a goal of mine to work full time as an independent journalist in the New Media sector .
During that time period , I met my then soon - to - be - wife ( and her son ) , and she and I wound up having another son .
It seemed that every financial advance I made during that time , it was gobbled up by my own increasing costs as a new husband and father .
I had to make a lot of sacrifices to make ends meet .
During that time period , I wound up selling off my very sizable comic book collection ( via eBay ) , and about three quarters of the computers and video rendering machines I 'd built over the years ( via Craigslist ) , as well as eating up almost all of the savings I 'd accrued over the previous three years .
At the end of the day , though , I 'd accomplished my goals through resourcefulness , hard work and technology .
This is n't me patting myself on the back or fishing for praise .
If you read this blog regularly , you know how to find and use these tools for your own goals , yourself .
I hesitate to use the concept made popular by John F. Kennedy for fear of reprisal by linguistic purists , but it is said that the Chinese Kanji for crisis can be broken down to two other elements : danger and opportunity .
No , what this is instead is me saying you , the reader , exercise your capability in the face of economic adversity ( no matter what form it ends up taking ) to survive this and perhaps even prosper .
It 's less important for those of us in sectors outside investment banking to pay minute attention to every movement of the stock market than it is stay nimble , practical , resourceful and to keep an eye out for opportunity .
Is that , after all , not the goal of all the great tools and services we talk about daily on these pages ?
You have the ability and the resources .
It will be OK .

Robbie Williams is currently working on a new album UK pop and rock stars are taking action to try to gain ownership and control of their work from record labels .
Robbie Williams , Radiohead , Kaiser Chiefs and The Verve are among the acts who have signed up to a new pressure group , the Featured Artists ' Coalition .
It wants artists to keep the rights to the music they create and to have a greater say in how their songs are sold - and a bigger slice of the takings .
It is a sign of a shift in power in the music industry in the digital age .
In the last 12 months , big names have seen their options multiply after a string of stars shunned traditional record contracts and found new ways of releasing music .
At the same time , many acts have felt they have been ignored when their record labels and music publishers have struck new digital deals .
A spokesperson from the BPI - the body that represents the UK 's recorded music business - said it was " looking forward " to working with the coalition .
" The UK music business is a complex community that binds performers , songwriters , promoters , managers , agents , record labels , publishers , distributors , manufactures and retailers .
" No one part of the business can function without the other .
This is a business under huge external pressure , and we are stronger united .
" The creators themselves - featured artists , session musicians and songwriters lie right at the heart of this business , and we look forward to working closely with FAC in the future . "
The Featured Artists ' Coalition 's main demands include allowing musicians to keep the copyright to their own music , which could then be leased to record companies .
I'm the only one who sees my album as this baby that I need to protect , something that 's precious
Kate Nash
Musicians enter into rights fight
At the moment , record labels normally own the rights to the music their artists make .
The coalition also wants its members to be consulted more fully on how their music is used , the ways it is sold and who gets the money .
" Record and technology companies are signing agreements to deliver music to fans in new ways , " its charter says .
" Artists are not involved in these negotiations and their interests are likely to be overlooked .
Artists should receive fair compensation as part of these new deals . "
Radiohead famously released their last album , In Rainbows , through their own website , illustrating how established acts could thrive without a record deal .
Talking about the coalition , Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien said : " For us , this is a no - brainer of an issue and we believe that all artists and musicians should be signing up to this too . "
SELECTED FEATURED ARTISTS ' COALITION MEMBERS Billy Bragg Bryan Ferry David Gilmour Jools Holland Iron Maiden Kaiser Chiefs Klaxons Kate Nash Radiohead Robbie Williams
The Verve Other artists , from McFly to Madonna , have left major labels to release their music through newspapers or live music companies .
Pop singer Kate Nash , who signed a major label deal after building up her fanbase online , is among the other artists on board .
" There are going to be people who do n't care about your rights and whether you can keep your integrity - they 're just going to want to make money out of you , " she told BBC News .
" I 'm the only one who sees my album as this baby that I need to protect , something that 's precious . "
Jools Holland , Travis , Bryan Ferry , David Gilmour and Klaxons have also joined the group .
The coalition is also intending to speak up for artists ' rights in high - profile issues in the music industry .
It wants changes to copyright law and for the rights of performers to be brought in line with those of songwriters .
When a song is played in a TV advert , on US radio or in a film , its authors are paid but the performers are not , the body said .

Enlarge By Logan Cramer , Denny 's Beer Barrel Pub via AP Brad Sciullo of Uniontown , Pa. , ate a 15 - pound cheese burger , pictured , with five - pounds of toppings including bun , lettuce , tomatoes , cheese , onions , mild banana peppers and a cup each of ketchup , mustard , relish , and mayonnaise at Denny 's Beer Barrel Pub in Clearfield , Pa. , Monday .
Sciullo finished the concoction in 4 hours and 39 minutes .
CLEARFIELD , Pa. ( AP ) 
A chef at a western Pennsylvania Italian restaurant ate a 15 - pound burger with 5.2 pounds of toppings in 4 hours and 39 minutes .
Brad Sciullo , of Uniontown , is the first person to successfully eat the huge burger at Denny 's Beer Barrel Pub , said pub owner Dennis Liegey .
The burger — called the Beer Barrel Belly Bruiser — include a bun , lettuce , tomatoes , cheese , onions , mild banana peppers and a cup each of mayonnaise , ketchup , mustard and relish .
When asked what possessed him to eat a burger that big , the 5 - foot - 11 , 180 - pound Sciullo said : " I wanted to see if I could . "
" I 've always had a heck of a capacity and I can down about two gallons of water and I can do a gallon of milk in 20 - some seconds , " said Sciullo , a chef at Pasta Lorenzo's in Uniontown .
Liegey 's pub in Clearfield — a town about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh — has become known over the years for its massive burgers .
Sciullo , 21 , ate his 20.2 - pound sandwich Monday and said he was surprised he succeeded .
He realized when he had gotten through half the burger in a half - hour that he had plenty of time to finish it up .
" About three hours into it , things got tough , " Sciullo said .
" It 's exhausting .
I chewed for five straight hours .
I did n't talk . "
As is customary in such challenges , Sciullo was appointed a pub escort .
Philip Fimon , a pub cook , stayed with Sciullo through the eating frenzy , even going with him to the bathroom three times to make sure he did n't throw up , Liegey said .
For completing the challenge in the under - five - hour time limit , Sciullo won $ 400 , three T - shirts , a certificate " and a burger hangover , as I call it , " Liegey said .

In addition , as a transgender woman , I have been in private situations with men where it would have been very , very easy for me to wind up as a victim .
I have had the thought on more than one occasion : Am I about to die ?
( Fortunately , I 'm now married to a wonderful woman and we 're together forever . )
So when Bil asked me for my take on the issue , I was intrigued into writing .
The question I want to address is whether the Colorado judge in this case can and should ban such an argument from the trial .
This is slightly outside my usual area of research - transgender workplace issues .
I 'm not an experienced criminal attorney , though I 've done some criminal work in the past .
And yet , the two areas are related , in that prejudice against transgender identity is the crux of the problem in both employment law and in this criminal law situation .
" Only when Andrade grabbed at Zapata 's crotch did he discover the truth .
But when she smiled at him and said , " I 'm all woman , " it drove an enraged Andrade to commit murder , attorney Annette Kundelius said .
" At best , this is a case about passion , " Kundelius said .
" When ( Zapata ) smiled at him , this was a highly provoking act , and it would cause someone to have an aggressive reaction . "
The gay panic defense , and its cousin , the transgender panic defense , have been criticized by many , and yet it still survives to rear its ugly head again and again .
Cases in which these defenses are raised become high profile , with prominent examples such as the murders of Matthew Shepard , Brandon Teena , and Gwen Araujo .
In fact , there have been a couple of legal conferences on the issue of gay panic and trans panic defenses in the past several years , in which prosecutors have sought to learn how to defeat it .
I wo n't review the facts of the Zapata case here ; Waymon Hudson discussed the Zapata case in great detail , Monica Roberts was eloquent about the social dilemmas inherent in the trans - panic defense , and Donna Rose was extraordinarily moving in her Bilerico post on the Zapata vigil .
The essentials of the trans panic defense
The trans panic defense is essentially a variation on the classic defense arguments negating two major elements of first degree murder - with which Andrade has been charged -- premeditation and intent .
Each state has slightly different murder statutes , and calls the elements by slightly different names .
In Colorado , where the Zapata case is pending , it 's called " deliberation " and " intent " .
The prosecution is in the same position had Andrade murdered a non-transgender woman that he met on the internet - the state has prove deliberation and intent to cause death .
As in any murder case , it will be the job of the prosecutor to say that the case is open and shut - that the evidence is clear that the defendant acted deliberately and with intent to cause death .
It will be the job of the defense attorney to muddy the waters - to say that the evidence is ambiguous .
He will argue that the defendant had no time to deliberate , and that he did n't intend to kill , but only to strike out after being provoked by the victim but going too far in the heat of passion .
The arguments would be the same if Zapata were a non-transgender woman .
The prosecutor would say he deliberated and intended to kill .
The defense would say he did n't deliberate , but only struck out at some provocation by the victim .
Almost anything might constitute provocation - an argument , accusations of infidelity or impotence , a theft , or ridicule .
The trans panic defense is a vile variation of this standard defense argument .
It says " yes , I killed , but I was provoked to such a degree by the victim 's transgender identity that either I cannot legally be held responsible for my actions , or this is manslaughter ( or second degree murder ) , rather than first degree murder . "
This takes advantage of the widespread homophobia and transphobia of many jurors and judges , who might think of their own reactions in such a situation , and their fears of being a homosexual .
A variant of this is the claim that the killing was in self - defense from a sexual assault , which takes advantage of prejudices regarding gay and transgender propensity for sexual assault .
The stakes are very high here .
For the defense attorney , his client is looking at the death penalty if convicted of first - degree murder .
On the other hand , if he is convicted of manslaughter , the minimum for that crime is 2 years in Colorado .
( I 'm not taking in account any enhancements based on the hate crime statute .
That 's a whole different area , and it merits a longer discussion . )
How will a jury determine whether he is guilty of first degree murder or manslaughter ?
It all comes down to his intent .
Let 's take a look at the Colorado murder statutes to see what the rules are .
The legal jargon can give you a headache , so I 'll give you a hint what to look for before each one .
Colorado murder statutes
First Degree Murder :
What to look for : the definition of " deliberation "
Sentence : Life in prison without parole or Death
A person commits the crime of murder in the first degree if after deliberation and with the intent to cause the death of a person other than himself , he causes the death of that person or of another person ...
( Colorado Revised Statutes § 18-3- 102 )
The term " after deliberation " means not only intentionally but also that the decision to commit the act has been made after the exercise of reflection and judgment concerning the act .
An act committed after deliberation is never one which has been committed in a hasty or impulsive manner .
( C.R.S § 18-3-101 )
Second Degree Murder :
What to look for : the definition of " provoking " and " knowingly "
Sentence : 8 to 24 years , or 4 to 12 years if the act causing the death was performed upon a sudden heat of passion , caused by a serious and highly provoking act of the intended victim , affecting the defendant sufficiently to excite an irresistible passion in a reasonable person .
A person commits the crime of murder in the second degree if the person knowingly causes the death of a person .
( C.R.S. § 18-3-103 ) A person acts ' knowingly ' with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is practically certain to cause the result .
( People v. Lee , 30 P.3d 686 , Colo. App. 2000 )
Manslaughter :
What to look for : the definition of " recklessly "
Sentence : 2 to 6 years .
A person commits the crime of manslaughter if such person recklessly causes the death of another person ( C.R.S. § 18-3-104 )
A person acts " recklessly " when he or she consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result will occur .
( People v. Medina , 71 P.3d 973 , Colo. 2003 )
Q&A about murder
So , class , let 's review .
Q : Tell me the difference between " deliberately " , " knowingly " and " recklessly . "
A : " Deliberately " means he intended to kill his victim , and exercised reflection and judgment before doing so , rather than doing it hastily and impulsively .
" Knowingly " means he did n't set out deliberately to kill his victim , but he was aware that his actions were practically certain to kill .
" Recklessly " means he was n't aware that his actions would kill his victim , but he did n't care that there was a strong risk of death .
Bonus Question :
Why does first - degree murder merit the death penalty , but manslaughter only a paltry two years ( min ) ?
The victim is dead in both cases , right ?
Answer :
As a society , we have a great deal of aversion towards those who would kill in a premeditated fashion .
The people of the State of Colorado want to remove people who kill deliberately from society permanently .
However , if someone does so on impulse , rather than deliberately , it 's still wrong , but not as heinous as the deliberate murderer .
Colorado wo n't subject to them to the death penalty or life imprisonment , feeling that 24 years in jail is probably a sufficient punishment .
Furthermore , if the killing is the result of a provocation or a reckless accident , then only a few years in jail is considered enough .
The main distinction between these crimes is the intent of the murderer .
Hypothetical case : how do these statutes work in operation ?
Let 's look at a hypothetical case .
A pulls out a hammer and hits B on the head .
B dies .
Is A guilty of first - degree murder ?
Answer :
As usual in the law , it depends on the defendant 's intent .
If the hammer is a sledge hammer , and A shouts " after thinking it over , I 've decided to kill you , " then yes , he is probably guilty of first degree murder .
If A , however , acts hastily and impulsively after an argument with B , who called him a dirty so - and - so , then he is probably not guilty of first degree murder .
However , he was aware that his actions were practically certain to kill , so even if there was an argument that prompted A to act impulsively , A is still guilty of second - degree murder .
( This usually carries a sentence of 8 - 24 years , but only 4 - 12 years if A were sufficiently provoked . )
What if , however , the hammer was a rubber mallet that would n't kill with a single blow , but A , angered by the so - and - so comment , hit his victim forty times ?
Then it 's arguable that he is only guilty of manslaughter because he was n't aware that his actions were certain to kill .
Now back to the real world , in which a real victim , Angie Zapata , has been assaulted by a real killer with a fire extinguisher .
Did he deliberate , and exercise reflection and judgment ?
Andrade 's argument that he did not deliberate , or exercise reflection , might have had some traction if he had he hit her once .
But Andrade hit Zapata many times , and when she recovered consciousness minutes later , he attacked again until she was dead .
This indicates deliberation and intent to kill .
As it so happens , the judge was asked to throw out the first degree murder charge , but he refused , apparently because he is unsympathetic to the trans panic defense .
Provocation
The next issue is that of provocation .
Provocation changes the fact pattern in two ways .
First , it negates " deliberation " by positing that the killer did not act deliberately and after reflection , but hastily and impulsively .
If the jury buys it , then he 's down to second - degree or manslaughter .
Secondly , even if he gets second degree , the statutory provocation defense means he 's out in 4 - 12 .
The statute above defines " provocation " as " a serious and highly provoking act of the intended victim , affecting the defendant sufficiently to excite an irresistible passion in a reasonable person . "
In other words , it has to be something that would drive any reasonable person to an irresistible impulse to murder .
Cases of legal provocation
Let 's take a look at the types of acts that the Colorado courts have considered legal provocation .
For example , in Cassels v. People ( 92 P.3d 951 , Colo. 2004 ) , the Supreme Court of Colorado took a look at the issue .
Cassels was unemployed and struggling when Morris , a former co-worker , agreed to let him move into his one - bedroom apartment .
Three months later , their relationship had become tense and volatile , and Cassels agreed to move out shortly .
One day when Morris returned home , he started screaming at Cassels , shouting that he was a no good son of a bitch and a low - life , and threatened to beat the hell out of him and put him in the hospital .
Morris started pushing and shoving , and positioned himself in front of the only exit from the apartment .
He stood next to an iron bar that he had previously boasted would make a good weapon .
Cassels , afraid of an imminent assault , retrieved a loaded gun with the intent to frighten Morris and cause him to calm down and stop threatening and pushing .
However , when Cassels exited his room with the gun , he " freaked out " and " lost it . "
He shot Morris nine times , emptying the gun .
Cassels did not remember shooting Morris , but when he saw Morris lying on the floor of the living room , he called 911 and told the dispatcher that he shot his roommate .
Morris did not survive the gunfire .
Cassel 's attorney attempted to argue provocation .
He wanted the judge to tell the jury that they could reduce the charge if there was provocation .
The trial judge would n't let him do it , saying that it did n't meet the requirements of the statute .
As you may recall from the second - degree murder statute listed above , it has to be something that would drive any reasonable person to an irresistible impulse to murder .
The trial judge thought that shouting and pushing was n't something that would drive any reasonable person to murder .
But the verdict was reversed on appeal .
The Colorado Supreme Court said that the attorney had to be allowed to argue provocation .
" A provocation instruction is warranted whenever a defendant shows some supporting evidence -- regardless of how incredible , unreasonable , improbable , or slight it may be -- to establish each factor described in the second - degree murder statute . "
So now , in Colorado , when a prosecutor wants to limit argument on provocation , she must show that the evidence rules out one of the elements of provocation .
As noted above in the second - degree murder statute , the five elements of a provocation defense requires that the act resulting in death 1 ) be performed upon a sudden heat of passion , 2 ) caused by a serious and highly provoking act 3 ) of the intended victim , 4 ) affecting the defendant sufficiently to excite an irresistible passion 5 ) in a reasonable person .
If Andrade can bring evidence ( including his own testimony ) to support these five elements - regardless of how incredible , unreasonable , improbable or slight it may be - then he is entitled to raise the provocation defense .
But can he ?
The provoking act of the intended victim must be " serious and highly " provoking for a " reasonable person . "
Is it ?
From the Cassels opinion , one would think that all a defense attorney has to do is raise any act of the intended victim , regardless of how incredible or unreasonable , and the judge must allow the provocation argument to go to the jury to decide .
It does n't make sense , however , to state that the act must excite an irresistible passion in a reasonable person , and then allow something totally unreasonable .
For example , if the intended victim says hello , or sneezes on the defendant , or wears a miniskirt , and the defendant claims the act was a provocation , does the court have to allow it ?
In fact , the answer is no .
Cases in which provocation defense is barred
Colorado judges have decided that , in some cases , a provocation for which there is evidence is nonetheless not permissible and cannot be argued in court .
For example , four years after Cassels , in People v. Valdez ( 183 P.3d 720 , Colo. App. 2008 ) , the Colorado appeals court held that a provocation argument could be ruled out .
Here 's what happened :
The defendant drove to his wife 's house , from whom he was separated , saw a car there of a friend of his whom he suspected was having sex with his wife .
He broke into the basement , went out into the yard , picked up a metal pipe , re-entered the house , and grabbed a knife .
He walked upstairs to the bedroom , hit the boyfriend in the face with the metal pipe , and stabbed him in the chest .
Defendant then woke up his estranged wife and told her that her boyfriend was dead and that he was going to get rid of her , too .
He said if he could not have her , nobody was going to have her .
The boyfriend survived , and defendant was arrested .
The provocation defense in the Zapata case
Okay , wife having sex with friend of husband 's - not a crime but nonetheless " provocation " within the meaning of the statute , satisfying all five elements .
The appeals court did not dispute this , but nonetheless held that the provocation defense was barred .
The court said that where a person places himself in a position , by his own actions , to encounter the provoking act , then the provocation argument is barred .
Thus , while the Cassels case seems to indicate that a provocation argument must be allowed no matter what , no matter how vile or prejudicial , that is not , in fact the law in Colorado .
Under the Valdez doctrine , it is clear that a provocation defense may be ruled out in certain circumstances , even where the intended victim committed an act that fits the statutory definition .
To my mind , Andrade 's argument that Zapata 's act of smiling is a provocation should be barred from the trial .
Firstly , there is no evidence , aside from the defendant 's self - serving account , of this alleged smile .
But we must put that issue aside under the Cassels rule .
But more importantly , the argument fails to satisfy the statutory requirement of reasonableness : would this excite an irresistible murderous passion in " a reasonable person " ?
What reasonable person would have an irresistible murderous passion because of a smile ?
I often have to tell people that I am transgender .
If I smile while doing so , and someone murders me , would a court agree I did something to provoke them ?
It should not .
Is the situation changed if I allowed them to dance with me , or touch my hand , or kiss me , or have sex ?
It is not changed , certainly not by any act of mine .
What does the term " reasonable " mean here ?
Does it mean a reasonable homophobe ?
It does not .
It can only mean a reasonably balanced person .
If the situation involved someone who murdered an African American , and the provocation offered was that the racist murderer was incensed at the victim 's smile , no reasonable court would allow the argument .
Nor would the situation be changed if the murderer had sexual relations with an African - American woman whom he thought was White , who then revealed with a smile that she was African American .
I am not aware of any court rulings on the question of whether the trans panic defense satisfies the elements of provocation .
I have also not exhaustively researched Colorado law on the provocation defense , and my knowledge of how it works in Colorado is limited to an hour 's worth of research .
An experienced Colorado criminal attorney would be much better equipped than I to discuss this issue .
The prosecutor in the Zapata case may have many cogent reasons not to try to bar the provocation defense .
But that does n't stop me from wanting to see justice done .
I would like to see the prosecution present a motion in limine ( before trial ) barring the introduction of the trans panic defense .
Interestingly , there was a law passed in California a few years ago that would instruct jurors to disregard such defenses .
In the California Assembly Bill Analysis of the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act , AB1160 , , it stated that experts estimate that nationally , similar panic strategies have been used in over 45 cases , often with success .
There is an interesting law review article on trans panic defense in the Boston College Third World Law Review , which argues that judges should not allow trans panic arguments .
I hope and pray that this is not one of those cases .
If a man met a non-transgender woman on the internet , and he killed her because she smiled at him , and then he stole her credit cards and her car , no judge would allow a provocation argument .
None should be allowed here .
15th Sept 2008 has become a black day in the history of financial market with US fourth - largest investment bank Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy .
Already Merrill Lynch has been acquired by the Bank of America and AIG is also verge of bankruptcy .
How it happened ?
How 158 years old finance giant became bankrupt ?
Today I will discuss the reasons behind this biggest incident of bankruptcy in the history of mankind .
So how Lehman started , how it became leader in financial - services and then became bankrupt .
Let ’s cover all points one by one .
Lehman Brothers founded in 1850 , is a global financial - services firm .
The firm does business in investment banking , equity and fixed - income sales , research and trading , investment management , private equity , and private banking .
It is a primary dealer in the U.S. Treasury securities market .
The firm ’s worldwide headquarters are in New York City , with regional headquarters in London and Tokyo , as well as offices located throughout the world .
In 1844 , 23 - year - old Henry Lehman , the son of a cattle merchant , emigrated to the United States from Rimpar , Bavaria .
He settled in Montgomery , Alabama , where he opened a dry - goods store , “ H. Lehman ” .
In 1847 , following the arrival of Emanuel Lehman , the firm became “ H. Lehman and Bro . ”
With the arrival of their youngest brother , Mayer Lehman , in 1850 , the firm changed its name again and “ Lehman Brothers ” was founded .
In 1850 Lehman brothers set up the merchant bank in New York after making money in railway bonds .
In this way this finance giant came into existence in USA .
The reason behind the downfall of Lehman Brothers ::
These days there is mortgage crisis in United States due to decline in prices of real - estates .
As a result , housing loans made by the bank to people with little support made these loans very risky , and when interest rates were raised by these banks , these borrowers could no more repay Lehman .
This led to huge losses for Lehman .
It caused $ 60 billion loss in bad real estate loans for Lehman Bros .
One of the main reason for its downfall was its poor relations with top banks of United States .
They refused to do business with Lehman due to over - confidence of its CEO over the Lehman financial assets .
And after big debt of $ 639 billion , when Lehman asked Barclays and Bank of America for acquisition , they simply rejected the offer .

The Mat - Su Valley Frontiersman has republished the BEST article we have about Palin ’s conversations with Mary Ellen Baker ( Emmonds ) regarding censorship of library materials !
Local reporting , at the time , including quotes from both Mary Ellen and Sarah Palin .
The Whole Article can be found here : Palin : Library Censorship Inquiries ‘ Rhetorical ’ by Paul Stuart .
Here are some interesting snippets .
It is ALL interesting , and I hope that the Mat - Su Valley Frontiersman does n’t mind my liberal quoting :
WASILLA —
In the wake of strong reactions from the city ’s library director to inquiries about censorship , Wasilla Mayor Sarah Palin on Monday was taking pains to explain her questions about censoring library material were “ rhetorical . ”
…
Library Director Mary Ellen Emmons last week said Palin broached the subject with her on two occasions in October – once Palin was elected mayor Oct. 1 but before she took office on Oct. 14 , and again in more detail on Monday , Oct. 28 .
…
Palin said Monday she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed the questions to Emmons .
…
But on Monday , Oct. 28 , Emmons said Palin asked her outright if she could live with censorship of library books .
This was during a weak when Palin was requesting resignations from all the city ’s department heads as a way of expressing loyalty .
…
Emmons said Palin asked her on Oct. 28 if she would object to censorship , even if people were circling the library in protest about a book .
…
Palin called Emmons into her office Monday [ 12/14/1996 ] to discuss the censorship questions again .
…
Emmons said the current Wasilla policy , which she described as written in more general terms than the borough ’s , also worked procedurally in a book - challenge case last year .
Emmons said then - council - woman Palin was distressed about the issue when it came up , indicating she was aware of the city ’s book - challenge policy .
Emmons said in the conversations with now - Mayor Palin in October , she reminded her again that the city has a policy in place .
“ But it seamed clear to me that was n’t really what she was talking about anyhow , ” Emmons added .
“ I just hope it does n’t come up again . ”
Wow .
It seems that Palin was VERY pre-occupied with censorship & the library challenge policy .
I cannot believe that this was just Palin studying library policy .
Palin questioned Emmonds Three Times , and seemed to force the issue .
‘ What if people were picketing … ’ ‘ Could you live with books being censored … ’
I would love to know what the meeting on 12/14/96 was like .
Mary - Ellen , if you ’re reading , you seem like a very strong and proud librarian , standing up for the rights of ALL community members against censorship .
I understand your present dilemma – If Palin is n’t elected Vice President of the United States of America , she is still in the powerful position of Governor of Alaska .
I would imagine that for your well - being , and the well - being of your library and community , you would be very careful to speak out against her .
Nevertheless , your aplomb and defense of ‘ freedom to read ’ presented in this article are laudable , and we appreciate the stand you took in 1996 .
Finally : Thank you to the Mat - Su Valley Frontiersman .
I have been trying to access this article for days .

Violence Increases as Settlers Begin Challenging Israel
A pipe bomb that exploded late Wednesday night outside the Jerusalem home of Zeev Sternhell , a Hebrew University professor , left him lightly wounded and created only a minor stir in a nation that routinely experiences violence on a much larger scale .
But Sternhell was noted for his impassioned critiques of Jewish settlements in the West Bank , once suggesting that Palestinians “ would be wise to concentrate their struggle against the settlements . ”
And the authorities found fliers near his home offering nearly $ 300,000 to anyone who kills a member of Peace Now , a left - wing Israeli advocacy group , leading them to suspect that militant Israeli settlers or their supporters were behind the attack .
If so , the bombing may be the latest sign that elements of Israel ’s settler movement are resorting to extremist tactics to protect their homes in the occupied West Bank not only against Palestinians , but against Jews who some settlers argue are betraying them .
Radical settlers say they are determined to show that their settlements and outposts cannot be dismantled , either by law or by force .
There have been bouts of settler violence for years , notably during the handover of Gaza to the Palestinians in 2005 .
Now , though , the militants seem to have spawned a broader , more defined strategy of resistance designed to intimidate the state .
This aggressive doctrine , according to Akiva HaCohen , 24 , who is considered to be one of its architects , calls on settlers and their supporters to respond “ whenever , wherever and however ” they wish to any attempt by the Israeli army or police to lay a finger on property in illegally built outposts slated by the government for removal .
In settler circles the policy is called “ price tag ” or “ mutual concern . ”
Besides exacting a price for army and police actions , the policy also encourages settlers to avenge Palestinian acts of violence by taking the law into their own hands — an approach that has the potential to set the tinderbox of the West Bank ablaze .

What is the green movement ?
The green movement as we think of it today has evolved considerably since the early days .
Since there are some popular assumptions about environmental history that are incorrect , if you have an interest in green issues this article will serve as a helpful guide to the origins and evolution of “ green ” .
To understand the modern green movement , we have to trace its origins back to the beginning .
Let ’s get started :
While many people associate the beginning of the green movement with Rachel Carson ’s breakthrough book Silent Spring and the legislative fervor of the 1970s , environmentalism is in fact rooted in the intellectual thought of the 1830s and 1840s .
In fact , the “ environmental movement ” is a significant thread in the fabric of American philosophical thought – first developed by the Transcendentalists ( most famously Henry David Thoreau ) but tangibly expanded upon during the era of American pragmatism in the latter half of the 19th century .
Environmentalism is n’t a trend , or a cult , or a form of hysteria .
It is rooted in American philosophy and , being at once innovative and practical , idealistic and active , one could easily define modern environmentalism as quintessentially American .
Environmentalism in America today is defined as :
“ Environmentalists advocate the sustainable management of resources and stewardship of the environment through changes in public policy and individual behavior .
In its recognition of humanity as a participant in ( not enemy of ) ecosystems , the movement is centered on ecology , health , and human rights . ”
But how did we get from Thoreau and Teddy Roosevelt to “ treehugging ” and finally , the eco-friendly consumer - driven developments of today ?
1. Roots of Environmentalism
Rachel Carson ( 1907 - 1964 ) certainly helped foster a reawakening of environmentalism , but it was Henry David Thoreau , in his book Maine Woods , who called for the conservation of and respect for nature and the federal preservation of virgin forests .
George Perkins Marsh was another key figure during the first half of the 19th century who championed preserving the natural environment .
Leading intellectuals of the antebellum era called into question the standard Puritan pastoral ethic – the belief that cultivating and using the land was inherently moral and leaving the land alone to be “ wild ” was wasteful and uncivilized ( this belief developed in large part because of the violent cultural clash between early Americans and Native Americans – something we tend to forget about in modern times ) .
To this day there are ingrained negative associations between preserving wild lands and pantheistic or pagan values .
This tension flares up in popular discourse from time to time ( “ environmental wackos ” , “ treehuggers ” , and so forth ) .
The classic American conflict between secular rationalism and Puritan morality is certainly not exclusive to our management of natural resources !
2. The Pragmatist Era
Though Transcendentalism was famously reverent of nature , it was the thrust of can - do American Pragmatism ( widely viewed to be America ’s original contribution to philosophical thought ) that doubtless inspired a series of steps to conserve nature .
Beginning in the 1860s , the United States government saw fit to create parks and set aside wild lands for public good .
Yosemite was claimed in 1864 ( John Muir moved there in 1869 ) .
It was made our first national park in 1872 .
The Audubon Society was founded in 1872 and Sequoia and General Grant parks were established .
The only setback during this era was the Mining Act of 1890 , which is controversial to this day .
The Forest Reserve Act finished the era of pragmatism with federal impetus .
John Muir was elected president of the new Sierra Club in 1892 .
3. Conservation and Teddy Roosevelt
Though the federal government had begun taking actions to preserve lands , it was Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir – a bit of an unlikely pair – who publicized and popularized conservation .
Teddy ’s visit to Yosemite in 1903 gained national publicity .
By 1916 the National Park Service had been established with leadership by Stephen Mather .
But just as swiftly , the World Wars – sandwiching the traumatic Great Depression – forced environmental concerns to the background of public thought .
While the Sierra Club continued to grow rapidly and became instrumental in establishing many parks during these years , environmentalism as we know it today was not a concern for most Americans – or , consequently , the federal government .
It would take disasters and threats to bring environmental issues out of the organizations and ivory towers and into the mainstream again .
In future posts , you can expect these events to be explored in greater detail .
Your questions are welcome .
4. Conservation and Catastrophe
After WWII , environmental efforts continued to be focused on conservation of land rather than more personal issues like food safety or consumer products .
That soon changed .
The 1948 disaster at Donora ( called the “ death fog ” ) prompted national outcry ; also during this time David Brower became Executive Director of the Sierra Club ( 1952 ) .
5. Things Get “ Personal ”
The technological and industrial developments of the Cold War era and a series of surprising events ( most notably Donora ) fueled a new environmental concern that went beyond saving forests and establishing parks .
Carson ’s bestseller set off a furor with its expose of toxins in consumer products and philosophical claim that controlling nature is both arrogant and morally bankrupt .
The Sierra Club prevented the damming of the Grand Canyon and an oil spill at Santa Barbara caused public outrage .
The Wilderness Act was passed in 1964 to limit the construction of dams and other structures on important lands and landmarks .
During these years the Environmental Protection Agency was founded .
The late 1960s and 1970s saw the rise , then , of the modern green movement .
6. Activism and Codification
The 1970s saw numerous steps to clean up the environment : the National Environmental Policy Act , the Clean Air Act , the founding of Earth Day , the banning of DDT , the Water Pollution Control Act , and the Endangered Species Act ( which the Supreme Court upheld in 1977 .
Disasters at Love Canal in 1978 and Three Mile Island in 1979 terrified the public with the visible consequences of toxic waste , pollution , and contamination .
The 1980s were plagued with oil spills ( the Exxon Valdez in 1989 , among others ) , and while there was continued significant backlash from industry against environmental strictures , the various Acts were not overturned .
7. Treehuggers and That Infamous Owl
The 1990s saw the offshoot of radical environmentalism in the face of corporate mistreatment of the land – and groups like PETA , Earth First and ELF got plenty of media attention .
As conservative radio hosts went on tirades about minnows and the spotted owl and the merits of clear cutting , passionate young activists famously chained themselves to or took up residence in trees – earning the nickname “ treehuggers “ .
These actions gained notoriety , but unfortunately also had the effect of politicizing and emotionally charging key environmental issues .
Environmental protection was alternately depicted as being religious , cult - like , anti-society , anti-property ownership and anti-capitalist .
Criminal stunts from fringe environmental groups did nothing to dampen the image of environmentalism as extreme .
Vegetarianism experienced a popular resurgence with ground - breaking books like Diet for a New America ( Robbins ) but it also became the brunt of many a late - night comedian ’s routine .
The concept of climate change was ridiculed by many as an overreaction from misguided “ environmentalist wackos ” .
9 . The “ New ” Environmentalism
Sobering international events , catastrophic weather , visible climate change , 9/11 and war , gas shortages and scientific consensus legitimized environmental concerns during the early years of the new century .
Al Gore ’s blockbuster film An Inconvenient Truth seared the climate crisis into the popular consciousness .
Suddenly , the problems were obvious everywhere you looked : our food was chemically treated and genetically modified , our water was contaminated with toxic chemicals , our resources were running out , our wasteful habits were filling landfills , New Orleans was virtually destroyed , and gas prices were soaring – to name but a few key issues that have spurred millions to “ go green ” .
This post merely reviews the environmental movement as it relates to the United States .
Consider : American leaders have yet to sign the Kyoto Protocol or earmark serious funding to green - collar jobs and sustainable technologies and energy .
But American citizens have taken it upon themselves join a global movement , to learn more despite the gridlock in Washington ; to conserve , to drive the development of eco-friendly consumption , to buy hybrids or use mass transit , even to telecommute .
More and more people now recycle , compost , “ go organic ” , grow gardens and understand the connection between saving money , improving health and helping the environment .
More people are interested in technology and efficient living than ever before .
And more and more people are becoming curious about the natural world in all its majesty and strangeness .
The great opportunity is that every individual can be a part of the green revolution in some way .
Everyone can learn and take a positive step in a greener direction .
No one ’s perfect , but together we can solve the problems we face .
Welcome to the “ new ” green movement .
Consider this your crash course in environmentalism .
In future articles you will learn more about each stage of the green movement , as well as learn about both international and American contributions , challenges and solutions .
Our mission is to provide interesting , educational , practical green information and ideas and we welcome everyone .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said late Friday that its short - selling ban will expire just before midnight on Wednesday .
That means hedge funds and other investors can put new bearish bets on shares of financial - services companies starting Thursday .
( CNN ) --
The Venezuelan government 's tax body has closed more than 100 McDonald 's restaurants in the South American country for two days because of alleged inconsistencies in the fast - food chain 's financial books .
The move , which began Thursday , affects some 115 branches of McDonald's .
Jose David Cabello Rondon , the superintendent of the tax body , released a statement saying that the alleged irregularities were found in the company 's purchasing and sale records and were related to taxes .
The restaurants will remain closed until Saturday , the agency said .
Alimentos Arcos Dorados , the company that manages McDonald 's in Venezuela , said in a statement that it is abiding by the government 's order .
It said the order was related to " formal issues affecting purchasing and sales records . "
It added , " The company asserts its customary and thorough respect for and compliance with all Venezuelan laws , regulations and standards . "
McDonald 's restaurants in several locations remain open , Alimentos Arcos Dorados said .
Those locations include Anaco , Ciudad Ojeda , La Victoria , Maracaibo Delicias Norte , Maracaibo Galerias , Maracaibo Sambil , Margarita Sambil , San Cristobal Sambil , San Juan de los Morros and Valera , it said .

FERRIDAY , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
The blaze engulfed Frank Morris ' shoe repair shop in minutes , bright orange flames stretching 60 feet into the air .
Morris was so severely burned , only the soles of his feet were spared .
Frank Morris was killed by a fire that tore through his shoe repair shop in December 1964 .
He clung to life for a few days before dying in a hospital .
It was December 1964 .
Morris , a 40 - year - old African - American , repaired shoes for blacks and whites in Ferriday , Louisiana , a small town near the Mississippi border terrorized by the Ku Klux Klan .
Nearly 44 years later , not a single person has been charged in the killing .
Last year , the Justice Department made investigating about 100 civil rights era killings , including Morris ' , a priority after urging from the Urban League , the NAACP , the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups .
The Rev. Robert Lee Jr. said on his deathbed , Morris never named his killers but said two " white friends " carried out the attack .
" He thought they were his friends , and he said , ' Yes , I thought they were my friends , ' " Lee , now 94 , recently said .
Lee recalls the horrible condition his friend was in right after the attack .
" The doctors wondered why he survived those two or three days .
You never seen something so dreadful looking . "

Time is of the essence for prosecution -- witnesses are dying , as are the possible perpetrators .
" The average age we believe of those who would have carried out these crimes is probably going to be in his mid-70s if he is alive , " said U.S. Attorney Donald Washington , whose district includes Ferriday .
" We are concerned about whether there are live witnesses and live subjects . "
Watch " a whole lotta people know more " »
Washington hopes publicity will help move the Morris case forward .
He wants people to think , " Do I know someone or do I know personally any information that can help these federal prosecutors ? "
Anyone with information is urged to call 318-443-5097 or 504-816-3000 .
It was in the early morning hours of December 10 , 1964 , when the front window of Morris ' store was shattered .
Someone poured gas in the cluttered building and torched it .
Morris was sleeping in a back room and tried to run through the inferno , according to authorities .
Jake Davis was a young teen back then .
He often played with Morris ' son and had begun working at the store a few weeks before the killing .
He 's still haunted by what happened .
" It bothers me to this day , and I 'm 56 .
It 's a thing constantly on my mind , " he said .

Today , Davis wears cowboy boots and jeans with a crease so sharp , it looks like it would cut your fingers .
He spends his time working on old cars and playing Zydeco music .
Davis recently shared his story with the FBI after years of silence .
He said he was simply too scared to talk about the incident at the time it happened .
He says he remembers three white men coming into the store the day before it was torched .
" I was hearing a whole lot of talking , loud talking , cursing , " Davis said .
" After a while , [ Morris ] came back up front and told me and my brother to leave and come back tomorrow .
That 's what we done .
" We did n't ask no questions .
I had an eerie feeling , but I left and went home and told my mom , ' Some white folks and Mr. Frank , they arguing and cussing ; what could we do ? '
She said , ' Ain't none of our business . ' "
The next morning , the storefront was still smoldering when Davis stopped by .
He later visited his boss in the hospital , descibing a wretched sight .
" He was burned all the way from his head all the way to his feet , " Davis said .
" When I saw him -- actually saw him -- I just turned around and walked out . "
As the years passed , he sometimes regretted not speaking up about the incident .
But growing up black in rural Louisiana meant living in fear of being tortured or killed for looking the wrong way .

" When you [ saw ] a white person , you could n't look them in the eye .
You had to look down .
You could n't walk on the same side of the street , " he said .
" Our life hung in the balance of keeping your mouth closed . "
Davis added , " As I got older , I wondered , ' Should I say something ? '
I had no one I could turn to to talk about this . "
Washington , the prosecutor , has read through the case files and says the FBI had about a dozen agents on the Morris killing in the 1960s .
He says the order came from the very top , President Lyndon Johnson and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover .
" It was handled in very professional , very aggressive manner , " Washington said .
But they came up empty .
" Maybe they could n't make the proof at the time .
Maybe there were other cases that required that they not take down this one case in order to go forward on another case , " Washington said .
Morris ' old friend , the Rev. Lee , whose grandfather was a slave , is glad the case has been reopened but laments , " Why did they wait so long ? "
" Most people who knew about that is gone .
But the few that 's left feel like , if justice could be achieved there would be a sense of satisfaction . "
Whether that is still possible remains to be seen .
Washington says this case could be unique in that there could be a point where prosecutors go to Morris ' family and say , " We can't prove it , but here 's what we think happened . "
" We have talked briefly about that with the folks in the civil rights division , " Washington said .
" It would be nearly impossible for us to do that , but if we can I think we ought to . "

Federal party leaders will look to gain traction in English Canada in Thursday night 's election debate , a day after attempting to pick up ground in the crucial Quebec battleground during their verbal - jousting session in French .
As in the French session , a significant portion of Thursday 's English - language debate at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa will focus on the economy in light of the financial unrest in the United States .
CBC Television , CBC Newsworld and CBC Radio
One will broadcast the debate live from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET .
It will also be streamed live on CBCNews.ca and Canada Votes .
CBC Newsworld 's broadcast coverage begins at 8:40 p.m. ET with host Don Newman .
Conservative Leader Stephen Harper is expected to be more aggressive in the second debate as he again tries to brand his party as the best to navigate Canada through uncertain economic waters .
A relaxed and reserved Harper spent much of the French - language debate Wednesday night fending off attacks from other party leaders over the economy , often acquiescing to his opponents ' demands to speak .
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion will look to gain momentum from the French debate .
On Wednesday night , Dion — appearing at ease speaking in his first language — outlined a five - point economic plan that he said he would implement within a month of forming a government .
There will be less at stake for Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe on Thursday night , but the French - language debate was vital for him .
He compared Harper to U.S. President George W. Bush , and attacked the Conservative leader for his $ 45 million in cuts to culture funding across Canada .
NDP Leader Jack Layton is likely to continue attacking Harper 's economic policies Thursday night after saying on the previous day that a Harper government would give tax cuts to corporations and oil companies .
Green Leader Elizabeth
May will look to be more vocal in Thursday 's debate after labouring through the French session .
She did , nevertheless , take jabs at Harper over his economic record and his tough - on - crime approach .
Dion , Duceppe rank highest in performance poll
An online poll conducted by Ipsos - Reid following the debate had 40 per cent of 637 French - speaking Canadians who responded saying Dion won the debate , compared to 24 per cent saying Duceppe won .
About 20 per cent of respondents said the leaders ' performances made them change their mind on who they would vote for on Oct. 14 .
Harper ranked third among respondents , with 16 per cent saying he won the debate .
Only 11 per cent of respondents said they believed Layton won , while only one per cent put May as the winner .
The survey has a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .
Following Thursday night 's debate , federal leaders will again take their campaigns on the road .
The debate is scheduled to run from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and will be moderated by TVOntario's Steve Paikin .
It coincides with the U.S. vice - presidential candidates ' debate between Republican nominee Sarah Palin and Democratic nominee Joe Biden .

In 1905 , Britain 's greatest puzzlist , Henry Ernest Dudeney , demonstrated his most famous creation at a meeting of the Royal Society in London .
The Haberdasher 's Puzzle is an equilateral triangle that is cut into four pieces that can be rearranged into a square .
Sounds ordinary enough .
Yet Dudeney 's genius was that he connected the pieces together with hinges to form a chain - such that folding one way gets you a triangle and folding the other gets you the square .
The " hinging " property of the Haberdasher 's Puzzle , which Dudeney had made out of mahogany and bronze , has fascinated and delighted mathematicians for more than a century .
More than 100 years later , at a conference in Atlanta , Georgia , this year , Erik Demaine , 27 , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , went one better .
Demaine , 6ft 2in , with a ponytail and beard , has for the past 10 years been tantalised with the problem posed by Dudeney .
He wanted to know if hinge dissection could be universalised .
In other words , can you dissect any straight - sided shape and then hinge the pieces together in a chain so it can be folded into any other straight - sided shape of equal area ?
" I did n't believe it was true , " Demaine said .
But , together with his graduate students , he had discovered it was .
You can transform any polygon to any other polygon of equal area through a Haberdasher 's Puzzle - style hinged dissection .
Spontaneously , the hall started clapping - a rare occurrence in the higher reaches of computational geometry .
" Applause for math ? " he asked .
In puzzle - land , however , this was about as exciting a breakthrough as you can get - the solution to an age - old problem by one of the cleverest minds of his generation .
And Demaine could not have had a more appreciative audience .
He was lecturing at the world 's premier gathering of recreational mathematicians .
To finish his talk , he blindfolded himself and performed a magic trick .
He was applauded for that , too .
To most people , the phrase " recreational maths " is an oxymoron .
Maths is generally not considered fun .
At school , maths is unloved , and the prejudice against it continues throughout adulthood .
Whereas to hate literature is to be deemed uncultured , it is cool to hate maths and fine to throw one 's hands in the air when asked to do a simple sum .
Maths struggles for acceptance for several reasons .
It is conceptually challenging .
Calculators and computers have reduced the need for finely honed arithmetic skills .
But , more than anything else , it is the legacy of tedious hours at school .
The man who has done most to make maths enjoyable for the largest number of people is a 93 - year - old American called Martin Gardner .
Between the 1950s and 1980s , he wrote a column in Scientific American called Mathematical Games that popularised the subject in an unprecedented way - not only in the US , but all over the world .
Gardner wrote about paradoxes , puzzles , magic tricks , board games and tangential areas such as linguistics and design .
His columns brought out the playfulness of mathematical ideas and expressed them in a way the layman could understand .
Without him , for example , the artist MC Escher would not have achieved the fame he did and the computer game Tetris would not have been invented .
In 1993 , one of Gardner 's biggest fans , Atlanta businessman Tom Rodgers , decided to organise a conference in his honour .
Rodgers wanted the event to bring together experts from the world of maths , magic and puzzles - three of Gardner 's principal interests .
He called it the Gathering For Gardner - or G4G .
" So many people came , we decided to do it again in 96 , " Rodgers said .
Since then , the G4G has happened every two years and is the most colourful event in the maths calendar .
Gardner showed up for the first two events , but is now too frail to attend .
On one afternoon of this year 's G4G , the delegates relocated to Rodgers ' home in the Atlanta suburbs , a bungalow designed in a Japanese style , surrounded by a forest of bamboo , pine and fruit trees in blossom .
In the garden , several guests were assembling wood and metal geometrical sculptures .
Others shuffled around for clues in a bespoke puzzle hunt .
" Aaaaairrghhhkkk ! " John Conway , maths professor at Princeton , caught everyone 's attention .
He wanted everyone to bring him 10 pine cones so that he could count their spirals for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers - these appear in sequences where any one number is the sum of the previous two numbers ( Fibonacci starts 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 ... and Lucas 2,1,3,4,7,11,18 ... ) and they are frequently found in nature .
Cone - classifying is a recent preoccupation for Conway , a Liverpudlian with a Jerry Garcia beard who became famous in the 70s for his cellular automaton Game Of Life .
He has counted around 5,000 pine cones in the past few years .
Inside Rodgers ' house , where hundreds of items from his puzzle collection were on display , Colin Wright , an Australian who lives in the Wirral , was holding court .
With his schoolboyish , ginger hair and glasses , he looks just how you might expect a mathematician to look - in fact , he is a juggler , too .
" It seemed like the obvious thing to do after I learned to ride a unicycle , " he said .
He has helped develop a mathematical notation for juggling , which has electrified the international juggling community .
It turns out that , with a language , jugglers have been able to discover tricks that had eluded them for thousands of years .
" Once you have a language to talk about a problem , it aids your thought process , " Wright said as he took out some bean balls to demonstrate a recently invented three - ball juggle .
" Maths is not sums , calculations and formulae .
It is pulling things apart to understand how things work . "
I asked if there was something self - indulgent , even wasteful , about the finest minds in mathematics spending their time working on pastimes such as juggling , pine cone counting or even puzzle solving .
" You need to let mathematicians do what they do , " he replied , and quoted the example of Cambridge professor and number theorist GH Hardy , who in 1940 famously declared that his subject had no practical applications .
Mathematicians have , in fact , been very successful in finding applications for apparently useless theorems - maths , for instance , is now the base for much internet security .
" It is unreasonable that mathematicians should be so successful in this , " Wright said .
" You really , genuinely never know what is going to work . "
It is said that doing maths averts the onset of dementia .
The G4G offered some unscientific proof .
Many of the guests were over 70 and some were in their 80s and even 90s - unsurprising for an event that was celebrating the life and work of a nonagenarian .
One reason for Gardner 's influence is that he has corresponded with thousands of readers , many of them renowned mathematicians , some of whom became close friends - among them Raymond Smullyan , 88 , who is possibly the world 's foremost expert in logical paradoxes .
( He began his talk : " Before I begin speaking , there is something I want to say . " )
Smullyan seemed also to contradict the laws of ageing .
With flowing white hair and beard , looking not unlike Ian McKellen in The Lord Of The Rings , Smullyan was frequently entertaining guests on the hotel piano .
He also performed magic tricks on unsuspecting passersby and over dinner one evening launched into a stand - up comedy routine .
Only a few years Smullyan 's junior was Ivan Moscovich , 82 , a puzzle inventor who was clutching a prototype of his newest product , You And Einstein , which will be in the shops later this year .
It is a type of " sliding block " puzzle in which you move blocks around a grid to make a desired pattern .
Moscovich 's twist is that each 3D block has a slanted mirror that reflects the box to its side , meaning that what you think is the block is actually the reflection of something else .
Moscovich is excited at the thought that You And Einstein may be a global smash .
" I believe this thing has a slight chance to take off , and not to sell 10,000 or 20,000 , but an enormous amount . "
All puzzle - makers dream of creating the next Rubik 's cube - the puzzle invented by Ernö Rubik in 1974 that has sold more than 300 million .
At the G4G there were talks on how to envisage a Rubik 's cube in four dimensions ( which drew a huge round of applause ) , new methods of making shapes fit together , the launch of a puzzle game called Doris , and demonstrations of how laser cutting is changing wooden mechanical puzzles .
Since the simplest puzzles tend to be the best , there is a certain underlying tension in discussions of supposed advances - the idea of sophistication in puzzle design is almost a self - contradiction .
The most recent puzzle craze , Sudoku , could have been invented 1,000 years ago .
Moscovich speaks with an eastern European twang and has a pencil moustache and brushed back , black hair .
An Auschwitz survivor , he remembered reading Gardner 's first article in Scientific American in 1956 , and said it shaped the rest of his life .
He comes to the G4G for inspiration .
" If you could measure creativity , then the world 's highest concentration of creativity in the smallest possible area is right here . "
One of the rooms in Atlanta 's Ritz Carlton , where the gathering was based , was given over to an exhibition of " mathematical objects " such as origami , geometrical shapes and elaborate puzzles .
In one corner was Dániel Erdély , a Hungarian , next to a table on which were displayed several light blue objects about the size of a cricket ball , ridged with intricate , swirling patterns .
Erdély had an intense manner , and treated his models with the affection that a dog breeder has for a set of puppies .
He picked one up and held it lovingly in his hand .
He pointed at the palm - sized planet 's crystalline landscape and said : " Spidrons . "
Erdély is not a mathematician .
He is a graphic designer who studied under Rubik at the Budapest College of the Applied Arts .
In 1979 , as homework for Rubik , Erdély devised a new shape made out of a sequence of alternate , and shrinking , equilateral and isosceles triangles .
He called the shape a " spidron " since it curved like a spiral .
By the time he left university , spidrons had become his obsession .
He endlessly played around with them , noticing that they could be fitted together like tiles in many aesthetically satisfying ways , in both two and three dimensions .
When , about five years ago , a Hungarian friend helped write a program to generate them on the computer , the spidron became known all around the world .
Its tessellating properties have captivated mathematicians , engineers and sculptors , and Erdély has reinvented himself as the shape 's globetrotting chaperon .
He believes it could have applications in the design , for example , of solar panels .
At the G4G , he had met a man who runs a company that launches rockets .
The spidron , he said , may be about to go into space .
At university level and above , maths is a very male affair , although at GCSE girls now outperform boys .
At the G4G , fewer than 20 % of the participants were women .
Some of them presented talks in which they applied high level maths to crochet , knitting , needlework and quilting .
It turns out that " mathematics and the fibre arts " can actually convey deep mathematical ideas in a novel way - such as what a hyperbolic space might look like , which is something that has baffled mathematicians for centuries .
Carolyn Yackel , one of the genre 's pioneers , gave a talk on how to knit a pair of hyperbolic trousers .
( You knit an octagon in hyperbolic space and then join the sides together . )
Yackel , who is young , engaging and on the right side of kooky , says , " I do n't think that maths is inherently male at all , although the atmosphere can be made to be .
I like doing this because it mixes two things I really like , which are maths and craft .
There are so many really neat ideas .
Tessellations are super - duper cool . "
Another type of craft that is , literally , on the cutting edge of maths research is origami .
Demaine made his first major mathematical breakthrough when , at the age of 17 , he and his collaborators proved that it is possible to create any straight - sided shape by folding a piece of paper and making just one cut .
It might appear that such a result would be useful only to schoolchildren making complex Christmas decorations , but in fact Demaine 's work has found uses in industry , especially in car air bag design .
Even though Gardner was in his 60s by the time Demaine was born , the young professor says he was influenced by Gardner 's books and philosophy .
" I thought [ Gardner ] had a playful respect for mathematics that is often lost in mathematical circles .
People tend to be too serious .
My aim is to make everything I do fun . "
Demaine 's father is a sculptor , and an aesthetic sense has been passed on to his son - some of his origami models are at New York 's Museum of Modern Art.
Demaine argues that mathematicians are creative artists .
Art and maths are concerned with " simplicity and beauty and trying to make things elegant ... they mix together in a nice way " .
I asked about the Haberdasher 's Puzzle and the applause he received .
" That was pretty cool .
I was surprised .
It 's a problem that I care very deeply about , having worked on it for about 10 years .
It was nice to get that validation . "
The few dozen magicians present were giving impromptu demonstrations of close - up magic .
One was " Jordini " , a 21 - year - old in a top hat , who is the first undergraduate in the US to be majoring in magic .
" Magic was one of Martin [ Gardner 's ] main interests , " said Mark Setteducati , a magician and puzzle inventor .
" There are many beautiful mathematical principles behind simple card tricks . "
A charming aspect of the G4G is that all guests are asked to bring a gift - " something you would want to give to Martin " .
In fact , you are asked to bring 300 of them , as each guest is given a goodie bag at the end containing a gift from everyone else .
This year it included puzzles , magic tricks , books , CDs , gadgets and a piece of plastic that can make a Coke can talk .
One bag was for Martin Gardner , and I took it to him .
Gardner lives in Norman , Oklahoma .
The day I arrived , storms were moving across the state .
I took a few wrong turns off the interstate until I found his home , an assisted living centre next to a Texan fast - food joint .
By his door was a box of outgoing mail .
Gardner , who does not use email , is still a prolific letter writer .
The king of recreational maths answered the door wearing a green shirt and slacks .
He is still mentally and physically fit - he works standing up .
He writes every day , has published about a book a year since the mid-50s , and continues to contribute to magazines and journals .
Gardner was widowed in 2000 , and moved here four years ago to be close to his son , who works at the university in Norman .
On the wall is a portrait of himself made out of dominoes - a classic genre of recreational maths art - and a large photo of Einstein , one of his heroes .
The shelves are full of books and on one of his desks is an old electronic typewriter .
We began talking about magic .
He described it as his principal hobby .
He still practises tricks , as far as his arthritis allows .
He showed me what he said is the only sleight - of - hand with cards he invented : a " wink change " where the colour of a card is changed " in a wink " .
He took a pack of cards and lodged a black card between the deck and the palm of his hand .
Instantly , the card became a red one .
Gardner became interested in maths through " mathematical " magic tricks - and magicians , not mathematicians , formed his main social circle as a young adult .
He liked magic , he said , because it gave rise to a sense of wonder about the world .
" You see a woman levitated and that reminds you that it is just as miraculous that she falls to the ground by gravity ... you do n't realise that gravity is just as mysterious as a woman levitating . "
Does maths give Gardner that same wonder ?
" Absolutely , yes . "
I gave him the G4G goodie bag and asked how it felt to be the subject of a conference .
" I am quite honoured , and surprised , " Gardner said - though I got the impression he felt a little awkward about it , too .
" I am not a mathematician , " he said .
" I am basically a journalist . "
I was interviewing an elderly magician in hurricane - strewn Oklahoma .
Already I had felt as if I were meeting the Wizard of Oz .
And now he had pulled away the curtain .
" Beyond calculus , I am lost , " he continued .
" That was the secret of my column 's success .
It took me so long to understand what I was writing about that I knew how to write in a way most readers would understand . "
Gardner was already middle - aged when he started writing for Scientific American , gradually getting to grips with harder concepts .
Yet , even though he inspired generations of readers to take up maths , and influenced the direction of research , he still feels like an interloper .
His lack of ego endeared him to the maths community : he brought out the wonder in their subject , and was also assiduous in crediting all the academics and puzzlists who contributed ideas .
His research and correspondence are considered important enough for his archive to be kept at Stanford University .
While he devised some puzzles himself , essentially he assembled the work of others and presented it beautifully .
Does he even like doing puzzles ?
" Not particularly - I 'm not very good at it . "
Philosophy , which he studied at university , is Gardner 's first love .
He began his writing career publishing science fiction stories in Esquire .
And before he got on to maths , he had written Fads And Fallacies In The Name Of Science , the first popular book to debunk pseudoscience , precursor to a whole genre leading to the current atheist polemics of , say , Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins .
His two other passions are Lewis Carroll and - with unexpected appropriateness - L Frank Baum , creator of The Wizard Of Oz .
His bestselling book is The Annotated Alice , a timeless compendium of footnotes to the two Alice books , and a decade ago he wrote a sequel to The Wizard Of Oz in which Dorothy and friends go to Manhattan .
It was reviewed in serious newspapers , if not very favourably .
" It is written mainly for Oz fans , " Gardner says .
He shows no signs of slowing down .
This year he will publish a book of essays on GK Chesterton , and among his many other projects he is compiling a bumper book of word games .
As I left , I wondered if the other residents of this featureless old people 's home - who were listening to a seniors ' country and western band - had the slightest inkling that such an intellectual dynamo was living among them .
Gathering for Gardner puzzles , by Chris Maslanka
1 We all know that in tossing a fair coin you are just as likely to get a head followed by a head as a tail followed by a head .
So what can the harm be in accepting David Singmaster 's offer of a simple game ?
You will toss a coin repeatedly until you get a head followed by a head or a tail followed by a head .
If it 's a head followed by a head , he 'll give you $ 2 .
If it 's a tail followed by a head , you give him a dollar .
Should you accept ?
2 Magician and scientist Bob Friedhoffer once threw me off balance with a simple question .
How many faces of a cube can you see at once ?
No , its faces are of an opaque material , and no , you do n't have x-ray vision !
Three ?
Hmm ... you can do better than that !
But you will need to think outside the box .
No , no mirrors are allowed !
Well ?
3 Al Seckel was showing me an 8 x 8 square he had cut into 4 pieces , as shown above , but in my excitement I knocked the pieces off the table .
Well , these things happen .
I hastily rearranged the pieces , but got the rectangle shown .
But hang on a minute !
The original measured 8 x 8 = 64 square units .
Whereas what I assembled had area 5 x 13 = 65 .
So where had the extra unit come from ?
A puzzle for G4G by Wei-Hwa Huang , member of the US puzzle - solving team
If one plus one is two , and twelve plus ten is twenty plus two , then what is 920197 ?
Solutions
1 If with the first two tosses you at once get two heads ( one chance in 4 ) , you will win $ 2 from David .
But if you get anything else , David wins either at once : tail followed by head , or eventually : head followed by tail , or tail followed by tail , since you cannot then get a head followed by a head without having first got a tail followed by a head .
So David wins three times as often as you .
Do n't do it !
2 Try thinking inside the box .
If you squat in the corner of a big cube ( a cubical room , say ) , you can see at least a floor , a ceiling and three walls .
3 Note that the diagonal of the rectangle is not a straight line .
In fact , the ' extra square ' is a smeared out mismatch along this diagonal .
The gap between the lower ' triangle ' and the upper accounts for the missing square .
Wei -Hwa Huang 's answer : LOVELY .
This puzzle genre is known as ' verbal arithmetic ' .
Each letter corresponds to a different number .
Families , caregivers , charities and research groups across the United States are observing September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month .
In the U.S. , over 12,000 children under the age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer every year , approximately 3,000 of them will not survive the disease .
A diagnosis can turn the lives of a family upside down - days suddenly filled with alternating moments of courage , frustration , boredom , anxiety and pain .
The objective of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month is to put a spotlight on the types of cancer that largely affect children , survivorship issues , and - importantly - to help raise funds for research groups working towards cures ( links below images ) .
Here are a few recent photos of families , all dealing with childhood cancer in their own ways .

The Qingdao government organized 400 boats and 3000 people to help remove the algae after Olympics organizers ordered a cleanup .
Experts say the algae , which has clogged the coastline of the Olympic city , is a result of climate change and recent heavy rains in southern China , according to the Xinhua news agency .

On Frigid Celtic Waves , Surfers Where Youâd Least Expect Them - NYTimes.com 3/27
SEATTLE , Washington ( CNN ) -- Clifton Mitchell helped register nearly 2,000 voters for the community group ACORN .
But not one of them actually existed .
Clifton Mitchell filled out voter cards using fake birthdays , Social Security numbers and baby - name books .
" I regret it .
I paid the price for it , " he said .
Mitchell was convicted last year and spent nearly three months in prison .
He 's one of the few ACORN workers convicted of voter registration fraud .
Today , he lives with his wife and two boys , ages 3 and 1 , in a small apartment in suburban Seattle , Washington .
Mitchell said he scammed the system because , " I needed money ; I had to support my family and I was new to the area .
It was the only job I had . "
Mitchell said ACORN threatened to close the office if he and his team did n't meet their quota to register 13 to 20 voters a day .
So , without consulting their supervisors , he said , they came up with a plan .
" We came up with the idea : Let 's make fraudulent cards .
I tell my crew , ' I do n't care how you get 'em , just get 'em , ' " Mitchell recalled .
Watch Mitchell explain how they created voters »
They took addresses from homeless shelters , used fake birthdays and Social Security numbers and took names from baby books to create voters out of thin air .
' American Morning '
All this week , CNN's " American Morning " examines potential voting problems in key battleground states in the special series " Count the Vote . "
Weekdays , 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
" Every day I 'd go to the library and get a newspaper , " Mitchell said .
" I had one guy who'd go to the phone book .
Everyone had different methods . "
The secretary of state called it " the worst case of voter registration fraud in the history of the state of Washington . "
ACORN was fined $ 25,000 and ordered to improve its oversight .
The group is under investigation in 10 states for voter registration fraud , and Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's campaign has accused ACORN of trying to rig the election for Democrats .
But University of Washington law professor Eric Schnapper says the idea of fake cards turning into real votes is a myth .
" There are no known instances of fictitious people actually voting , " Schnapper said .
" You look at some of the names : Mickey Mouse .
Dr. Seuss .
Mickey Mouse only votes in Disneyland .
He 's not going to show up at a critical precinct in West Virginia or North Carolina . "
Schnapper said that if anyone should be upset , it 's ACORN .
" The victims of this are the people who paid these workers $ 8 an hour to go out and find legitimate voters , and ... they did n't get their $ 8 worth ; they put down phony names , " Schnapper said .
Schnapper said he 's worked on Republican and Democratic campaigns and has paid people to hand out leaflets or register voters .
He said some of the workers do their jobs and some do n't .
ACORN said it has registered well more than 1 million voters , most of them Democrats .
Though the group is under investigation in a number of swing states , such as Ohio and Nevada , amid accusations that it turned in fake voter registration cards , Schnapper said there 's no evidence that any worker intended to commit voter fraud and actually take those names , produce phony identification and vote on Election Day .
Threats of criminal prosecution may scare some groups into closing voter registration drives , according to Schnapper .
It could scare actual voters away from the polls as well , he said , " and that really does affect the outcomes of the election . "
A report from the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School supports his claim .
Researchers reviewed voter fraud claims across the country and found that most were caused by technical glitches , clerical errors or mistakes made by voters .
One other finding : A person is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate another voter at the polls .
ACORN has recently released a video on the Internet called " Fight Back : The Truth About ACORN . "
It uses a mix of interviews and video to fight what the group calls Republican efforts to suppress voter turnout .
CNN asked Clifton Mitchell whether he and his team , at any point , got together to try to rig the election .
" When I did it , when my team did it , it was n't to steal any election , " Mitchell said .
" They 're just trying to keep a job .
But understand , I blame myself .
I can only blame myself . "

" It was a real find and as soon as I arrived there I knew what a special and peculiar place it was .
There is nothing around it for around 70 miles , it is literally in the middle of nowhere .
Dave Freeman , an advertising agency executive who co-wrote “ 100 Things to Do Before You Die , ” an adventure - seeking and often unconventional travel guide that personified the way he lived his life , has died .
He was 47 .
Freeman died Aug. 17 after falling and hitting his head at his home in Venice , said his father , Roy .
Published in 1999 , “ 100 Things ” was one of the first contemporary books to create a travel agenda based on 100 sites and then market it with a title that reminded mortal readers that time was limited .
The “ 100 Things ” approach later swept the publishing industry , said Neil Teplica , who wrote the book with Freeman .

The title meant “ you should live every day like it would be your last , and there ’s not that many people who do , ” Teplica told The Times .
“ It ’s a credit to Dave -- he did n’t have enough days , but he lived them like he should have . ”
Subtitled “ Travel Events You Just Ca n’t Miss , ” the book grew out of the pair ’s now - defunct travel website , which Freeman often said was ahead of its time .
Online from 1996 to 2001 , it showcased festivals and events , often in a feature called “ The Coolest Place on Earth Today , ” which became a primary source for the book .
“ This life is a short journey , ” the authors wrote .
“ How can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time ? ”
Freeman had visited about half the sites in the book .
He preferred to travel alone because he could cover more territory , said his aunt , Barbara Freeman .

The book ’s listings were adventure - based , but “ it was n’t just physical adventure , it was cultural adventure and spiritual adventure , such as a voodoo pilgrimage in Haiti , ” Teplica said .
Together , the authors had visited almost every site in the book , which included the familiar ( the Academy Awards ceremony , the running of the bulls in Pamplona , Spain ) as well as the more exotic ( the National Hollerin ’ Contest in North Carolina , Australia ’s Nude Night Surfing contest ) .
One of Freeman ’s favorite lesser - known events was “ land - diving on the tiny island in the Pacific called Vanuatu . . . .
Tribesmen climb up homemade towers . . . and it ’s sort of like the original bungee - jumping , ” he said on National Public Radio in 2001 .
Another favorite was Las Fallas , a festival in Valencia , Spain , that features huge papier - mache and plaster statues that satirize local political figures and celebrities .
“ Secretly , they ’re full of fireworks and dynamite .
. . .
At the stroke of midnight , they light them all on fire in a huge , loud . . . pyromania display , ” he said on NPR .

Freeman brought an off - kilter sensibility to the book by insisting on irreverent graphic icons .
He especially enjoyed the logos that stood for “ potential to see blood , ” “ dangerous , ” “ down and dirty ” and “ religious fervor . ”
“ We would try to have odd combinations of logos , such as ‘ gluttony ’ and ‘ Grandma approved ’ on the same thing , ” Teplica said .
“ The icons gave the book a lot of life , and people really reacted to the categories , which are kind of a snapshot into Dave ’s brain . ”
Critics said the graphics made the book fun to read .
David Stewart Freeman was born Feb. 21 , 1961 , in Whittier .
His father worked in the packaging industry and his mother sold real estate .

After graduating from USC in 1983 with a bachelor ’s degree in urban planning , he joined an ad agency in Newport Beach .
In 1986 , he moved to New York to work for Grey Advertising .
On Sept. 11 , 2001 , he was eating breakfast in his sixth - floor New York co-op when the first plane hit the north tower of the World Trade Center .
From the roof of his building , he saw the second plane crash into the south tower , just blocks away .
Deeply affected by the terrorist attack , Freeman decided to move back to Los Angeles in 2002 to be near his family .
Advertisement
He joined the ad agency TBWA / Chiat / Day as the founder and director of “ the disruption consultancy . ”
His team tried to help clients look at existing accounts in new ways , his father said .
His friend Cyndi Yee called Freeman “ amazingly fabulous at what he did , which was living big , but also as a business strategist and cultural anthropologist ” who lectured on lifestyle trends .
According to his father , Freeman was famous for saying , “ ‘ We ’re going to the future .
Do you want to come along ? ’
It always made everybody laugh . ”
In addition to his father and aunt , Freeman ’s survivors include his stepmother , Barbara , and a sister , Virginia Freeman Robb .

If they are not launching themselves at you in drug - fuelled desperation , their bloodshot eyes are searching for their next fix , pink paws scrabbling in the ground .
Sometimes they seize upon a rock of crack hidden in front gardens , and scarper to feed their addiction .
Squirrels in south London could have become addicted to crack cocaine , say residents of Brixton , who suggest the rodents have dug up drugs buried by dealers or nibbled residues of crack on pipes and vials discarded by addicts .
According to internet legend , crack squirrels have terrorised residents in New York and Washington .
But is the Brixton crack squirrel real or an urban myth ?
The Guardian began its search for the freebasing fiend near the local cinema .
" They used to hang out in the little park in front of the Ritzy , twitching ... dancing to music only they could hear and generally creating a malevolent ambience , " Londoner Rik Abel wrote in his blog .
Ritzy regulars were less sure .
" I 've never seen one , " said a staff member .
" But there might be crack foxes around too . "
On Brixton Hill , Bim is not surprised by the spectre of the Brixton crack squirrel .
" I 've only been released from prison today but I 've heard about the squirrels .
They are scoffing all the crack , more stoned than me .
Have you ever seen cats with hash ?
Cats always go for hash . "
There is no sign of a squirrel half - crazed on Class As along Coldharbour Lane or Rush Common - but , finally , a possible sighting .
" I 've just seen one jump down from an old sunflower by the Seventh Day Adventist church , " said Reg Throssell .
" I locked eyes with it and it stared back at me really confidently .
It was scavenging and it looked scrawny . "
But Brixton crack squirrels need not worry about the police yet .
" I 've no knowledge of that at all , " said a Scotland Yard spokesman , firmly .
Last weekend , I wrote about Ethiopia ’s first OLPC deployment .
We ’ve been back to the school several times since , so I have a few stories to share .
Firstly , Prof Tom Postmes and Dr Nina Hansen visited .
They are starting a research project at the University of Groningen to measure the effects of the XOs on the children .
On their journey to the school , they describe how they saw a child in a field , tending to his cattle .
In one hand , he has a whip for controlling the animals .
In the other ?
An XO .
Later in their journey , still before reaching the school , they find a child under a tree using his XO .
Unlike all the other kids , he ’s not at all excited about their presence , or them taking photos , and has no interest in seeing those photos on the camera display .
He ’s glued to his XO screen .
They peer around to see what is draining all his attention , and they see the child looking through the Nature images bundle .
This kid is fascinated by photos of the Eiffel tower , space shuttles , etc .
His horizons just exploded …
The researchers were also intrigued by the way some of the children were using the Record activity .
Some of these children do not have access to mirrors , and were using Record to look at themselves .
Being social psychologists , Tom and Nina were excited about the changes this will have on the childrens ’ self - perception and self esteem .
Back at the office , the OLPC Ethiopia team worked on creating content bundles of the regional curriculum textbooks for the school .
They have acquried 39 of the textbooks ( grades 2 through 8 ) as PDF .
On Friday , we went back to the school and showed the teachers how to install them ( using a customization key ) .
We decided to add the WikipediaEN activity along with the textbooks .
In addition to a heap of textbooks , 600 kids in the middle of nowhere now have 8500 of the most popular Wikipedia articles in their hands .
The children learn English from an early age , so I ’m confident that it will be of use .
A journalist visited , and we took him to the school on Monday .
I ’ll leave it up to him to report on his findings , although I will jump in and share my favourite quote : when asked about the parents views of the laptops , the school headteacher explained how the parents view the laptops as “ the rebirth of their children . ”
The reborn children have not yet received any tutoring about the laptops .
Although they have figured out an incredible amount for themselves , they did not seem to have figured out the collaboration features .
So , we gathered 15 or so children in a classroom , and showed them how to set up shared Chat , Distance and Write activities over the mesh .
They were ecstatic .
We told them to tell all their friends , and then we returned to Addis with high spirits .
Plans with other schools are progressing .
The Ethiopian way of life is simply less organised than what I ’m used to .
It ’s normal here for people to turn back on their plans , multiple times .
Assuming plans stick ( hah ) , I should get to see at least one more deployment .

Severe Bull Market for Gold
Seeing beyond the blind curves of bailouts and meltdowns takes the keen vision of a veteran market observer , Roger Wiegand , Editor of Trader Tracks .
In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report , Wiegand predicts a “ severe bull market ” for gold that will include both juniors and seniors .
He advises selective buying and names several of his favorites .
The Gold Report :
When we spoke in mid-July , at the height of the market , you predicted a major downward correction .
Roger Wiegand :
The call was pretty accurate , although the oversell was surprisingly deep .
The reason was the hedge funds had gotten into a position where they had to raise cash as crude oil was starting to sell with speed .
Oil was a dominant part of their investment .
When the price of crude oil fell swiftly , funds were forced to sell everything to cover investor redemptions .
Now we 're at the bottom again , and prices are basing and moving up .
The bigger question is when will things turn around ?
When oil was being sold , it was sold in a basket of commodities , which in those funds all component markets were long only .
As oil sold back to critical price levels , funds by their rules were forced to redeem millions of dollars after just five days ' notice .
With several of these funds being in the same dilemma , selling was massive and quite fast .
Keep in mind the commodity selling basket included , crude oil , natural gas , gold , silver , sugar , grains and other commodity markets .
This hurt prices across the board in all of these sectors , including the CRB Commodities Index .
Gold and silver shares , along with physical metals , were wounded pretty badly in that down draft so it usually takes an extra 90 - day quarter to get back on track .
I believe shares will recover and some have already .
The XAU and HUI look pretty good but are n't nearly as high as they should be .
Gold and silver shares should resume new rallies in January , February , and March .
One of the big problems hitting a lot of juniors today is the inability to raise cash .
Some are going to go out of business .
Those that have cash , are operating new mines , or hold reserves in locations near senior miners like Hecla Mining ( HL ) and Newmont Mining ( NYSE : NEM ) , can probably be acquired .
The other shock is inflation , which is going to become much worse .
Any miners operating costs are extremely high relative to where they were only one to three years ago .
Many are producing at an operating cost of $ 400 to $ 600 per ounce .
Not long ago , these higher costs were $ 75 to $ 200 .
With our gold price near $ 850 they can't make much money .
Silver miners are under even more of a cost squeeze .
Inflation will keep driving mining costs up .
But I think the price of gold and silver will also rise .
With global credit conditions and the stock markets in serious trouble , gold will not be denied .
On October 6 , we had a major markets ' selling day worldwide .
Gold was the only rally sector on that day .
Our technical analysis reveals a larger , major gold breakout is imminent .
Will the Plunge Protection Team sell gold this week as they prop stock index shares ?
We think they could , although with gold near $ 850 support , we suggest gold will be let to run and rally until at least 1040 resistance .
Should gold breakout above 1040 into new and higher territory , we should expect some deliberate bullion bank shorting to stop a runaway gold price .
Correspondingly , the interventionists would be buying S&P 's to prop main stream shares .
TGR : Will the cost of inflation match gold 's rise ?
RW : It 's hard to say because some miners have a much lower cost of doing business than others .
It 's going to be very rough between now and the first of the year .
Some senior miners are producing silver at a small loss right now .
This will change quickly as silver prices begin new rallies .
TGR : Can you elaborate on that ?
RW : This bailout mess is complicating matters .
Our government 's highest priority is to restore calm in the markets and cause cash to circulate .
But I do n't think this bailout will solve the problem .
It 's just a big waste of money .
You 're going to see growing inflation over the next few months .
Commodities will rise slowly except for those base metals related to industries such as automobiles , housing , and heavy manufacturing , which have experienced heavy sales losses .
So where do we go from here ?
I have word from a high - level official the dollar and our currency systems are going to breakdown before January 15th .
I hope it does n't happen , but that 's my contact 's prognosis has been correct 99 times out of 100 .
That 's pretty scary .
TGR : So if the system breaks down then what ?
RW : The dollar , bonds , and non-precious metals shares will tank .
We 'll have massive inflation , prices will go up , the economy will stagnate , and a lot of businesses will grind to a halt .
That 's a depression , not a recession .
TGR : What will gold do ?
RW : Gold will skyrocket .
TGR : And it 'll drop ?
RW : It 'll drop at first because people will be scared of any market initially .
However , afterwards , gold 's really going to take off .
Canadians are more knowledgeable about mining and precious metals ' valuations than Americans .
They own physical gold and silver and invest in shares .
It 's the backbone of their economy – oil , gas , and precious and base metals are big business in Canada and getting even larger .
Ninety percent of our U.S. population seems completely oblivious to a basic understanding of the role of gold .
Sure , they 're a little worried about their jobs and credit but until this week 's substantial market scare , any idea of buying physical precious metals or shares has been largely under the American public radar .
TGR : They do n't understand what 's going on ?
RW : They 're absolutely clueless as with each and every stock market tumble and gold rally , The Plunge Protection Team intervenes to sell gold short and prop up mainstream shares .
TGR : What specifically do n't they understand ?
RW : I do n't think they understand the depth of our credit and finance problems .
They do n't grasp the incredible potential for damage not only to our economy but also to the entire global finance system .
This week 's international events including the unfolding credit crisis disaster in Europe is waking them up .
The American public herd is moving beyond being just nervous .
Now they are getting scared .
There is real fear in the air with inflation , massive job cuts and a drumbeat of bad news .
TGR : Getting back to gold — it 's now at about $ 834 .
You see it trending up gradually over the next three months .
RW : Yes .
TGR : Where will it be in January , assuming you are right about a system breakdown on January 15th ?
When will gold soar ?
RW : Historically , between Labor Day and Christmas , you 'll get two , 46 - day complete up and down rallies in gold .
I 'm talking about a bottom to top to bottom and with a sideways trading pause after each peak .
Following that , a new cycle starts over again at a new , higher bottom and goes to a higher high and then sells off once again .
Picture two , full , 46 day cycles for the last annual trading quarter of 2008 .
We are currently in the middle of cycle number one .
It 's already started off the bottom after we had a recent , bad selling period .
For now , I 'm looking at a December , 2008 gold futures contract on real - time and its low was $ 739.70 .
The high took it to about $ 920 .
So that 's only one of the first one or two legs up in this cycle .
Based on my charts , I see a small continuation triangle on the day chart for these futures .
I expect a major rally in gold .
I expected it yesterday .
It may come next week but when it does , this rally is going to be a big one .
I think it 'll be the number - three cycle leg of the five legs up and it could easily cause gold to rise $ 100 or $ 150 .
Obviously nothing is cast in bronze , but that 's what the charts say .
Now , to answer your question , where do we go on price by the end of the year ?
Between November 15th and the 25th , December 2008 silver and gold options will expire .
And there are several stock expirations , too .
If you have stock call options on the big mining companies , those expire around the 27th of the month .
In other words , if those are December calls , they 'll expire in December but the futures options expire one month earlier .
What traditionally happens when all these people exit the trades is that the November 15 th - 18th timeframe becomes a metals price peak .
I think gold could go as high as $ 1,040 but it 's more likely to be $ 985 .
All bets are off , however , if things get too crazy with the credit bailout and its fallout .
Subsequent fear can cause market mayhem and very wider rally trading days .
TGR : But it would be on the upside , not the downside .
RW : Yes , it would be on the upside .
I think $ 985 to $ 1,040 is as high as we 'll get for this quarter .
You 're going to get a little selloff from around Thanksgiving until Christmas .
Last year gold started up again right after Christmas on December 28th and that was two weeks early for January 's cycle .
The normal next quarter rally would start from the 10th to the 15th of January , 2009 .
Now if the dollar and bonds really collapse , gold could go much higher .
For March , 2009 silver and April , 2009 gold — your two main precious metal months for trading futures — we 're looking for silver to be $ 26.50 and gold to be $ 1,290 .
I was a little higher on gold before this smash we had over the last couple of months , so we 're rising from a lower price .
Instead of $ 1,300 or $ 1,400 , I expect to see $ 1,290 - $ 1,295 for the April , 2009 gold futures contract .
For the March , 2009 silver contract , which is the big one , you might expect $ 30.71 with $ 26.50 probable .
Keep in mind physical metal prices on futures and cash are different .
Cash is today 's right - now - spot .
Futures are the price traders have determined for a given month in advance for today .
You 'll often get a different market response from the shares .
They are regularly in a rally run ahead of the futures .
On the other hand , futures can rise ahead of the shares .
When this occurs , they 're usually about two weeks out of sync in either direction ; eventually matching each other .
TGR : So you think that in the first quarter we 'll see the shares begin to take off .
RW : Yes .
TGR : Even if we have the January 15th breakdown ?
RW : That 's a tricky one to call because people can become frightened enough not to buy any shares .
But , on the other hand , the approaching election is going to pump stock markets all the way through November 15th .
After that , many investors will take profits and bailout .
Then they would expect to get back in at a lower point .
And I think they will , despite the fact that these other matters could become very severe .
TGR : Do you think the people will take the profits ?
RW : A lot of people will take profits , first of all , in November , because of the cycles .
But if the dollar and bonds cave in and people are screaming depression , are they going to buy more junior or senior shares ?
Common sense says they would n't .
On the other hand , some of those juniors with good reserves located right next to senior operating mines should be considered prime investing plums .
TGR : So if we were expecting a major devaluation of the stock market in January , would you recommend that investors who are long on senior or junior shares sell now and wait until January , then selectively come back in ?
RW : That 's a difficult call .
We have a lot of juniors in our newsletter , Trader Tracks , that are deeply under water .
The reason we 're continuing to show them is because last March and April 2008 , I told my readers they had three choices .
They can get out entirely and hold cash ; they can sell half and keep half ; or they can hang onto the whole trade knowing full well shares are going to sell way down , which is what happened .
Do people buy new trades right now ?
They can if they go to the right places and they 're very selective .
Junior and senior shares should have a nice rally along with the metals themselves this fall .
Those rallies should hold through the fall cycle , probably into November .
There may be some dips in the middle , but with all these other things happening , it wo n't amount to a hill of beans .
In a bull market , a severe bull market , which I think we 're going to see this fall , physical prices will go up most in the first cycle .
Selective share prices move more gradually .
People want to take profits when they make them , but I think a mid-cycle fall pullback will be modest and then go sideways before resuming the rally again .
So , all in all , it should be a pretty good fall .
It would certainly be much improved over the terrible sell - off we 've just experienced .
Keep in mind tax - loss selling will further sell down already beaten down juniors .
Many will be gone for good as the best rise in new rallies , gradually .
TGR : But if the dollar 's going to break sometime before the 15th of January and we expect that to correlate to a radical adjustment in the stock market , would n't those junior and senior shares move down in January ?
RW : Yes , they would but we do n't know if that 's going to happen .
The chances are much higher of that happening now than they were before .
On the other hand , people could hang on to those investments despite the fact that the stock indexes are going to come down .
Everybody 's got a different definition of what makes a crash .
I think a market crash is more than 500 or 600 points — it 's closer to 1,000 points .
On the charts we see the S&P 500 and the Dow selling down in chunks , which will be fairly large , but is that a crash ?
I do n't know .
We 're going to go down in steps and stairs .
I think it can be gradual and take place over several months and , barring any absolute disintegration with the dollar and bonds , I think it 's just going to be a normal recession probably evolving slowly into a depression .
TGR : If the dollar does break on January 15th , would that throw us into a depression ?
RW : I think it could .
There 's no question in my mind that we 're in a deep recession right now and our government does not acknowledge that at all .
Neither do Wall Street and the media .
Because of spin and jawboning , none of the major nations will admit being into a recession or even the beginnings of one .
Very soon , this will change as worse things appear in the news .
TGR : If the American public understood , we'd be in a different place right now .
RW : We sure would .
You can trace a lot of what 's happening now back to the crash of the NASDAQ in 2000 .
If Greenspan had handled that better , we would n't be where we are now .
We would n't have a lot of the derivatives that have been written since then on real estate .
Real estate derivatives are the crux of the problem .
Tom Donlan , who writes the Op Ed page in Barron 's every week , had a good solution many months ago .
He said the fastest way out of this is to let housing crash .
Let foreclosed homes go back to the banks .
Let the system flush itself out quickly .
Mr. Donlan told us prices would go back to where they belong and then we could start over .
If our leaders had taken his advice , we would have been beyond these problems of today .
Instead , they kept trying to glue the whole mess back together and it's not working .
It 's been proven before that prolonging financial agony is not a solution .
It only makes it more severe over longer time spans .
There was a little known and very short depression in the USA in 1920 - 1921 lasting roughly only 18 months .
While that one was very bad , our government let it alone and the healing process was swift .
Currently , the new bailout game only extends the correction cycle and the severity of all these problems .
TGR : Do you have some stock recommendations for these turbulent times ?
RW : I 'm recommending Clifton Star Resources ( TSX.V : CFO ) , a junior in Quebec .
This is an old mine property that was fallow for 50 years .
Two women inherited the property .
They made a deal with Clifton Star , the new operator - owner and they 've raised a lot of money .
This is a mine with fantastic geology , and being in Quebec is an advantage — it 's a favorable environment , from a permitting , operations and the tax standpoint .
Quebec is mining friendly .
We also still like Canplats Resources ( TSX : CPQ ) , which has expanded its property territory to 500 square miles .
It also has big , active , senior operators nearby .
The closest one is Goldcorp .
( GG - NYSE ; G - TSX ) ; I think , within 50 miles .
I expect Goldcorp will eventually buy Canplats .
TGR : Any idea when ?
RW : I would say within six months to a year .
TGR : Any others ?
RW : I still like Hecla Mining ( NYSE : HL ) , in spite of the beating that it took .
The company recently completed a stock offering of $ 150 - $ 160 million and rumor had it they sold all except for about $ 65 million .
Not true .
The rest of the offering was purchased and there was even an over - subscription for , I believe , another 3.5 million shares .
What an opportunity to buy a beautiful company like that ; set - up for major growth at $ 5 or $ 6 a share with a low cap rate .
I still contend they 're going to be $ 15 by next spring .
The increase will be partially inflation driven and partially market driven because of precious metals rallies in a flight to safety , security and growth .
TGR : Are you still following Piedmont Mining ( OTCBB : PIED ) ?
RW : I just checked their chart and they are on the low side for $.10 as they were hit with slow and selling precious metals markets .
The stock remains a good one .
It will be rising and vindicated probably in the first quarter of 2009 with the balance of the other gold and silver shares in a new rally .
Shares owners should not be discouraged unless a company has too much cash burn or lacks enough capital to achieve their goals on their budget and calendar .
Juniors trying to borrow money or sell stock now will be under pressure until later in 2009 .
TGR : So there is still some money to be made in the market .
It will just be more challenging with the current credit crisis ?
RW : I 'm advising investors to pare down the number of companies they own .
I would not buy stock options on some of these big companies .
In the year and a half before the 2006 election we had a great recommending ride .
The options market seemed to be up 100 % to 300 % every time I looked .
It all came to an end near the election , when the gold price was knocked down in that fall .
Now are they going to do that again this fall ?
I think interventionists try to cap gold probably at $ 1,040 .
But eventually it 's like trying to handle mercury .
You step on it and it squirts every which way and that 's the way the gold is going to go .
Investors are scrambling to own it .
A recent Wall Street Journal article talked about how it 's almost impossible to find physical silver to buy , yet silver 's price has been knocked down to $ 11 .
People are complaining about a fixed market , and I think that 's partially true .
On the other hand , there 's not a lot of silver available because demand was so high .
People were accusing the government of playing games because we can't buy silver dollars .
But when coin orders are up 1,000 % several months in a row , there 's a limit as to how much any government can produce .
The USA Mint was buying coin blanks from Canada for a while to keep production going , but they simply ran out .
Now even Canada has some waiting times for certain deliveries .
TGR : You recommend investors hold about 10 % of their portfolios in physical gold and silver .
What do investors do if they can't find any physical metal to buy ?
RW : They need to work with Kitco , or go to goldmoney.com , an internet depository , holding gold and silver in Zurich .
It 's not in your hand , but in my view it 's in a good safe location .
Also , we know of coin dealers who have product .
They cannot offer everything previously available to retail buyers but physical purchases are not impossible at this time .
TGR : How is that different than something like the Central Fund of Canada ( CEF : AMEX ) ?
RW : Goldmoney.com is similar except that Director Jim Turk has been around forever .
He 's top notch .
He started with four gold bars in 2002 .
They 've got roughly $ 300 million in their depositories now .
When I last spoke with him , he was still able to buy 1,000 - ounce bars from the Central Bank in the UK .
How long can this keep up ?
I do n't know .
The big bars are still available .
Where the pinch is coming is in the coins .
The Mexican coins , the European coins , the Austrian Philharmonic , the Canadian Maple Leafs , and the American silver and gold coins are all good ones .
Not all can be found , but when possible we like Canadian and American gold and silver coins best of all .
There are collector numismatic coins available with prices rising quickly .
For most folks we do n't recommend the extremely rare coins because that is a special field .
TGR : So we 're looking at Kitco and goldmoney.com for silver or gold .
RW : Right .
I also suggest Pat Gorman ( metalguys@aol.com ) , a coin dealer in Phoenix .
He 's been around for 40 years .
He may not have everything available and perhaps some is probably backordered , but he 's been very strong and honest and a good businessman .
David Morgan and Jay Taylor both recommend Pat and so do we .
So , it 's difficult to buy physical metal — largely because the very wealthy have bought up most of it — but it 's not impossible .
Of course , if you are n't placing a $ 100,000 order , a lot of the dealers do n't even want to talk to you .
TGR : So , what 's the bottom line for the juniors in this market ?
RW : One of my top traders closed most of his Merrill Lynch account and wrote a million - dollar check to goldmoney.com for silver .
He said he did n't like the looks of this market at all .
That does n't bode well for the juniors .
But some of them will be fine .
You just have to be very picky .
The key things to look for right now are potential cash flow , available cash in the till , and projected operating costs per ounce along with proven and inferred reserves .
If you 've got a junior with proven resources and your property is next door to Newmont or Hecla , you 've probably got a winner as long as you have enough cash to hang on to your project till they buy you out .

The commodity currencies are much weaker this morning , CAD - 2.87 % and AUD - 7.22 % .
The loonie dropped to its lowest level in 4 - years yesterday , on speculation that worldwide economic growth will slow as US investors continue to sell assets .
Month - to - date the currency has managed to lose 16 % of its value as commodities including crude oil fell , coupled with investor speculation that the BOC will need to extend interest - rate cuts ( 2.25 % ) in the face of slowing economic growth .
Earlier this week Governor Carney reduced overnight borrowing costs by 25 bp ( 2.25 % ) , less than the market had anticipated , but added that it will probably need to act again to fend off the effects of a credit crisis and global recession .
The market continues to see position covering and repatriation back to the US , which is driving the greenback higher across the board .
The BOC MPR yesterday said that the global credit crisis will be Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdeeper , more persistentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and more widespread than the policy makers had anticipated and signaled they will cut borrowing costs again as the economy teeters on the edge of a recession .
Governor Carney said Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œthat these financial headwinds will take time to dissipate , even with the extraordinary recent policy actions just announcedÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ .
Previously the BOC justified their less aggressive move in the context of how much action that has been taken since its last meeting ( 75 bps ) and the cumulative cut in rates since Dec ( 225 bps ) .
Looks like a good bet that borrowing cost could break the 2 % mark by year end .
For now the trend remains your friend , do not expect to find resistance from investors , who continue to better buyers on pull back .
One expects the AUD to underperform in recessionary times , and last night the currency finally delivered and eased vs. JPY and the greenback as tumbling equities and commodity prices prompted investors to dump higher - yielding assets .
Despite a stronger inflation report earlier in the week giving the currency some support , one can expect investors to be better sellers on rallies ( 0.6217 ) .
Crude is lower O/N ( $ 66.22 down -262c ) .
Crude prices oil rose yesterday , rebounding from a 16 - month low before OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s much anticipated meeting today in Vienna .
But , growth fear are outweighing any cut in production , thus the black - stuff has come under pressure again .
OPEC are meeting to discuss production cuts , what they will agree on is anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s guess , so far some members have already aired vastly different opinions , from shallow cuts to deep ones ( Iran ) .
The fears of a weakening global fuel demand outweighing the prospects of a production cut by OPEC has contributed to price declines thus far .
OPEC is trying to halt the 50 % slide in prices since the beginning of the summer .
It is anticipated that they may pare production by 1 m to 2 m barrels a day in stages to stabilize prices .
But , they are in a tight corner ; they cannot contribute to further economic decline and all members will be hard pressed to agree on what production cuts .
The fear or Iran and Venezuela opting out of any consensus vote remains strong , thus splitting the group .
Earlier in the week traders and investors had been getting ahead of this , but the strength of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbig dollarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ has limited advancements .
OPEC is panicking as commodity prices have tumbled on growth concerns , retreating from the highs archived in July ( $ 147.27 ) .
They still produce over 40 % of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil .
This weeks EIA report showed that crude oil stocks rose +3.18 m barrels to 311.4 m , w/w , and again another bearish weekly .
The market was expecting an increase of + 2.6 m barrels .
Analysts continue to aggressively pare their future price estimates , down from $ 90 to a year end price of $ 60 .
Sluggish demand continues to be the catalyst for rising inventories .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said that the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœidealÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ price for crude is between $ 70 and $ 90 a barrel .
Gold remains under pressure as the greenback continues to dominate the FX market ( $ 750 ) .
Gold declined once again to a new 2 - month low as the big dollar rallied vs. the EUR and global equities declined , thus reducing the demand of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative investment strategy ( $ 695 ) .
The market has forced investors to sell the precious metal to raise cash .
The Nikkei closed 8,460 down - 213 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,451 down - 79 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,007 down - 33 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 5 bp yesterday ( 3.54 % ) and are little changed O/N.
Treasuries came under pressure in the early session as global equities rose and the US government said it will sell $ 58 b in 2 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s and 5 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s next week .
Traders and convexity buying has made the curve very expensive of late .
One has to expect further slippage .
But with equities not able to hold onto ant gains , had investors once again seeking the safer heaven asset class .
Futures contracts show a 100 % chance that the Fed will cut its O / N 1.5 % target rate by 25 bp at the Oct. 29th meeting .
Treasury ’s financing announcements yesterday was smaller than the market had anticipated .
This MondayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bill sales will total $ 50 b rather than $ 51 b , as the 6 - month issue is being trimmed to $ 25 b from $ 26 b , but , the 3 - month holds steady at $ 25 b .
Those auctions will raise $ 6 b of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœnew cashÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The coupon offerings are all being held unchanged : the 2 - year note at $ 34 b , the 5 - year at $ 24 b and the 5 - year TIPS reopening at $ 6 b ( the market had expected the nominal notes to be boosted by $ 2b each - I guess we will see that develop down the road ) .

COLLEGE PARK , Md. --
If conservative Republicans are right and the $ 700 billion financial - sector rescue plan signals America 's slide into socialism , you 'd think Seth Dellinger would be celebrating .
But Mr. Dellinger , a Socialist Workers Party candidate for Congress , says that what might smell like communism to free - market purists looks like just another capitalist shell game to him .
" They can reorganize capitalism in different ways , and they will , " says Mr. Dellinger , a college graduate turned working - class meat cutter .
" But it is above all with a view toward continuing a system in which a small minority of super - rich families controls everything . "
To Mr. Dellinger , 32 , capitalism 's crisis may be socialism 's opportunity .
He 's making the case to anyone who will listen that the U.S. should adopt a Cuban - style government before the Bush administration and Congress empty the treasury in order to keep workers from storming the barricades .
" What they 're trying to do , above all , is prevent millions of workers from lining up outside banks all over the country , because they know they 'll have to send troops and cops , " says Mr. Dellinger .
" That kind of scenario could unfold quicker than people think . "
On Wednesday , as he does once a week or so , he and another Socialist Worker drove to the University of Maryland and set up a folding table outside the student union .
Mr. Dellinger , wearing black slacks , a mock turtleneck and smudged horn - rimmed glasses , taped up a few posters .
" U.S. Troops Out of Iraq and Afghanistan , " said one .
" For a Workers and Farmers Government , " said another .
Online advertising networks – particularly Google 's – are more dangerous than the fledgling plans and dreams of ISPs to install eavesdropping equipment inside their internet pipes to serve tailored ads to their customers , AT&T says .
At least that 's what the company told Congress in a letter early this week , responding to four prominent House lawmakers who are bird - dogging ISPs about their online profiling practices .
Those lawmakers asked 33 internet companies on Aug. 1 to explain some of their monitoring practices , Most have replied .
In its letter ( .pdf ) , AT&T denies that it currently digs deep into the net habits of its users " for the purpose [ of ] developing a profile of a particular consumer 's online behavior . " *
( AT&T is currently facing a class action lawsuit for allegedly helping the NSA spy on Americans ' internet usage , but that 's a different issue since the NSA does not run ads . )
However , it says it may bake this kind of surveillance into its tubes in the future using so - called Deep Packet Inspection technology .
The company rightly says could be also be used to detect copyright infringement , speed up packets of streaming video and detect child pornography .
But even if it did , that 's nothing compared to Google , it says .
" If anything the largely invisible practices of ad - networks raise even greater privacy concerns than do the behavioral advertising techniques that ISPs could employ , such as deep - packet - inspection , " AT&T wrote .
AT&T rightly points out that Google can know almost as much a snooping ISP could – which , is the case for users who install Google 's toolbar and do n't know to opt out of Google 's Web History program .
And if Google does combine its third - party cookie information , with user 's search histories , with Gmail summaries , and with Google Analytics data , among other data sources , they would be a proper domestic intelligence agency .
AT&T writes :
Advertising - network operators such as Google have evolved beyond merely tracking consumer web surfing activity on sites for which they have a direct ad - serving relationship .
They now have the ability to observe a user 's entire web browsing experience at a granular level , including all URLs visited , all searches , and actual page - views .
AT&T goes on to say then that because of Google 's singular ability to gather online data that online advertising networks are substantially similar to ISPs monitoring their customers .
Google and Yahoo are perhaps the only two online empires that AT&T could realistically point towards to make that argument .
It 's a clever argument , since online advertising cookies are nearly universally accepted and there are voluntary codes of conduct that most advertisers agree to in order to keep government regulators away .
And certainly any ISP thinking about looking at what its users are doing has got to be worried given that the House Energy and Commerce Committee is on a roll – taking on ISPs that want to or have watched what their customers do online in order to serve them targeted ads .
That roll is reportedly heading towards a long - fabled online privacy omnibus bill .
Add to that , this month 's unprecedented decision by the Federal Communications Commission to slap down Comcast for its secret and deceptive interference with file sharing traffic .
But the argument is also just wrong .
You pay your ISP to carry your traffic to and fro .
It can see everything you do online , unless you take extreme measures .
It could know where you bank , the contents of your emails and chats , what sites you shop at , what you search about –regardless of search engine – and everything you read or watch online .
Your ISP does not need to be peering into your traffic to decide whether to show you ads for hemorrhoid cream or sports bobble heads .
They just need to get that health information and that gallery of hockey 's worst bobble heads to your browser quickly .
* Threat Level readers may enjoy this full sentence from the letter : " AT&T does not at this time engage in practices that allow it to track a consumer 's search and browsing activities across multiple unrelated websites for the purpose [ of ] developing a profile of a particular consumer 's online behavior .

Abstract
The U.S. Bankruptcy code changed dramatically with the passage of The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act Of 2005 .
This act increased the costs and decreased the benefits of bankruptcy to consumers .
Supporters of the law claimed that it would benefit consumers as well as creditors , because reducing the losses faced by creditors would lower the cost of credit to consumers .
Critics of the law depicted it as special interest legislation designed to profit credit card companies at the expense of consumers .
This study tests whether the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform : ( 1 ) reduced the number of bankruptcies ; ( 2 ) reduced credit card company losses ; ( 3 ) lowered the cost to consumers of credit card debt ; and ( 4 ) increased credit card company profits .
The data suggests that although bankruptcies and credit card company losses decreased , and credit card companies achieved record profits , the cost to consumers of credit card debt actually increased .
In other words the 2005 bankruptcy reforms profited credit card companies at consumers ' expense .
By now , with the enormous hype that has been spun around it , there probably is n't an earthworm between John O'Groats and Land 's End that has n't heard about the auction of Damien Hirst 's work at Sotheby 's on Monday and Tuesday - the special character of the event being that the artist is offering the work directly for sale , not through a dealer .
This , of course , is persiflage .
Christie's and Sotheby 's are now scarcely distinguishable from private dealers anyway : they in effect manage and represent living artists , and the Hirst auction is merely another step in cutting gallery dealers out of the loop .
If there is anything special about this event , it lies in the extreme disproportion between Hirst 's expected prices and his actual talent .
Hirst is basically a pirate , and his skill is shown by the way in which he has managed to bluff so many art - related people , from museum personnel such as Tate 's Nicholas Serota to billionaires in the New York real - estate trade , into giving credence to his originality and the importance of his " ideas " .
This skill at manipulation is his real success as an artist .
He has manoeuvred himself into the sweet spot where wannabe collectors , no matter how dumb ( indeed , the dumber the better ) , feel somehow ignorable without a Hirst or two .
Actually , the presence of a Hirst in a collection is a sure sign of dullness of taste .
What serious person could want those collages of dead butterflies , which are nothing more than replays of Victorian decor ?
What is there to those empty spin paintings , enlarged versions of the pseudo - art made in funfairs ?
Who can look for long at his silly sub -Bridget Riley spot paintings , or at the pointless imitations of drug bottles on pharmacy shelves ?
No wonder so many business big - shots go for Hirst : his work is both simple - minded and sensationalist , just the ticket for newbie collectors who are , to put it mildly , connoisseurship - challenged and resonance - free .
Where you see Hirsts you will also see Jeff Koons 's balloons , Jean - Michel Basquiat 's stoned scribbles , Richard Prince 's feeble jokes and pin-ups of nurses and , inevitably , scads of really bad , really late Warhols .
Such works of art are bound to hang out together , a uniform message from our fin - de - siècle decadence .
Hirst 's fatuous religious references do n't hurt either .
" Beautiful Inside My Head Forever " , the sale is titled .
One might as well be in Forest Lawn , contemplating a loved one - which , in effect , Hirst 's embalmed dumb friends are , bisected though they may be .
Consider the Golden Calf in this auction , pickled , with a gold disc on its head and its hoofs made of real gold .
For these bozos , gold is religion , Volpone - style .
" Good morning to the day ; and next , my gold !
Open the shrine , that I may see my saint ! "
His far - famed shark with its pretentious title , The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living , is " nature " for those who have no conception of nature , in whose life nature plays no real part except as a shallow emblem , a still from Jaws .
It might have had a little more point if Hirst had caught it himself .
But of course he did n't and could n't ; the job was done by a pro fisherman in Australia , and paid for by Charles Saatchi , that untiring patron of the briefly new .
The publicity over the shark created the illusion that danger had somehow been confronted by Hirst , and come swimming into the gallery , gnashing its incisors .
Having caught a few large sharks myself off Sydney , Montauk and elsewhere , and seen quite a few more over a lifetime of recreational fishing , I am underwhelmed by the blither and rubbish churned out by critics , publicists and other art - world denizens about Hirst 's fish and the existential risks it allegedly symbolises .
One might as well get excited about seeing a dead halibut on a slab in Harrods food hall .
Living sharks are among the most beautiful creatures in the world , but the idea that the American hedge fund broker Steve Cohen , out of a hypnotised form of culture - snobbery , would pay an alleged $ 12 m for a third of a tonne of shark , far gone in decay , is so risible that it beggars the imagination .
As for the implied danger , it is worth remembering that the number of people recorded as killed by sharks worldwide in 2007 was exactly one .
By comparison , a housefly is a ravening murderous beast .
Maybe
Hirst should pickle one , and throw in a magnifying glass or two .
Of course , $ 12 m would be nothing to Cohen , but the thought of paying that price for a rotten fish is an outright obscenity .
And there are plenty more where it came from .
For future customers ,
Hirst has a number of smaller sharks waiting in large refrigerators , and one of them is currently on show in its tank of formalin in New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Inert , wretched and wrinkled , and already leaking the telltale juices of its decay , it is a dismal trophy of - what ?
Nothing beyond the fatuity of art - world greed .
The Met should be ashamed .
If this is the way America 's greatest museum brings itself into line with late modernist decadence , then heaven help it , for the god Neptune will not .
The now famous diamond - encrusted skull , lately unveiled to a gawping art world amid deluges of hype , is a letdown unless you believe the unverifiable claims about its cash value , and are mesmerised by mere bling of rather secondary quality ; as a spectacle of transformation and terror , the sugar skulls sold on any Mexican street corner on the Day of the Dead are 10 times as vivid and , as a bonus , raise real issues about death and its relation to religious belief in a way that is genuinely democratic , not just a vicarious spectacle for money groupies such as Hirst and his admirers .
It certainly suggests where Hirst 's own cranium is that his latest trick with the skull is to show photos of the thing in London 's White Cube gallery , just ordinary photo reproductions made into 100 cm x 75 cm silkscreen prints and then sprinkled ( yay , Tinkerbell , go for it ! ) with diamond dust , and to charge an outrageous $ 10,000 each for them .
The edition size is 250 .
You do the maths .
But , given the tastes of the collectoriat , he may well get away with this - in the short run .
Even if his auction makes the expected tonne of money , it will bid fair to be one of the less interesting cultural events of 2008 .
A local Republican group has distributed a newsletter picturing Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on a fake $ US10 bill adorned with a watermelon , ribs and a bucket of fried chicken .
The drawing harked back to racist images from decades ago in America that featured caricatures of blacks eating watermelon and other Southern foods , often suggesting they were lazy or unclean .
Linking Senator Obama , who is the first black presidential nominee of a major US political party , to such stereotypes drew denunciations from various Republican officials .
In part two of their interview , Paul Jay asks Prof.
Noam Chomsky to weigh - in on the dominant subject of the day , the economic crisis .
While Prof .
Chomsky agrees that the current crisis is a very serious one that will have broad implications for the broader society , he points out that the foreseeable Medicare - induced economic crisis will " dwarf " the current one in magnitude .
With the current credit freeze in U.S. financial markets Chomsky is interested in George Bush 's perspective , seeing his mentality as the source for the financial crisis .
Chomsky interprets
Bush 's proposal , " We hate democracy , we do n't want the public to be involved in decisions about things .
We want to go back to the profit motive , meaning that a private tyranny .... should look out for itself , not for the public interest . "

While on one hand , state - restricted markets are democratic by design in that they allow people to take control -- through their government -- of financial institutions to force them to include externalities and risks to the broader population in their decision - making .
The other hand is that these factors are such that profit - seeking enterprises will not accommodate them when left to their own volition , given that free markets do not put a price on these externalities .
" Do we want private concentrations of power to make decisions for their own benefit or do we want the public to be concerned to make decisions for the public welfare ? "
Chomsky says this is the question we as a country need to answer in order to return to an effective democratic process , especially in light of the current financial crisis .

Advertisement Thousands of people have been fleeing renewed fighting between African Union peacekeepers and Islamist insurgents in the Somali capital , Mogadishu .
The peacekeepers , who came under heavy attack for the third day running , said they had to use unusually tough measures to repulse the insurgents .
A local human rights worker told the BBC that up to 18,000 people had fled .
At least 45 civilians have died since Monday in some of the worst violence Mogadishu has seen in months .
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu says Islamist insurgents have been gaining ground in the city in their fight against the Ethiopian - backed government .
I have escaped from my house because throughout last night artillery shells had been pounding on us
Elderly man in Mogadishu
Peacekeepers mired in Somalia Observers say there has been a change in tactics , with Islamists switching from hit - and - run raids to sustained attacks against peacekeepers .
Somalia has been wracked by conflict since 1991 , when former President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown .
Ethiopia intervened in 2006 to help the government oust Islamist forces from the capital and surrounding regions .
The Islamists then launched an insurgency against Somalia 's transitional government and its Ethiopian allies .
' Deafening gunfire ' Tuesday 's clashes happened in the south of the city .
Our reporter says heavily armed insurgents attacked the AU base at K4 - a strategic junction in the south of the city linking the airport and the presidential palace .
The sounds of deafening gunfire and bombardments could be heard throughout the city overnight , our correspondent says .
Peacekeepers have generally been considered friendly since their arrival last year , and residents have been upset by the scale of their retaliation , our reporter says .
Maj Bahoku Barigye , an spokesman for the African Union Mission to Somalia ( Amisom ) , said the peacekeepers had not suffered any causalities and were acting in self defence .
" We are not using any heavy arms , " he told the BBC .
" We target a specific area where people are shooting at us from , and that is it , we do n't go outside , we do n't go beyond that . "
' Shocking '
Our correspondent says people living by the AU bases are fleeing their homes - on minibuses , donkey carts or on foot .
The only way out of this mess at the moment is to have a successful negotiation
Academic David Shinn
" We could no longer watch the shocking incidents and what happened to our neighbours , who were either killed or injured , my children could not bear the shelling , that is why I have decided to escape , " a mother of five told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
An elderly man said : " I have escaped from my house because throughout last night artillery shells had been pounding on us . "
Local human rights worker Ali Shiekh Yaasiin said an estimated 15,000 to 18,000 people had left the city in the past few days to join other displaced people outside the city .
David Shinn , a former US diplomat who teaches at the George Washington University , said fighters from the hardline al - Shabab militia were trying to assert their authority in order to force the Ethiopians out .
They are trying " to show that they are in a position to perhaps even take control of Mogadishu if the Ethiopian forces were to leave " , he told the BBC .
' No lost cause '
People have started fleeing the worst violence in months Maj Barigye said it was unrealistic to expect a quick resolution to Somalia 's long - running conflict .
" There is no lost cause here , " he said .
" It 's just a question of time , a question of patience , it 's a question of tolerance , it 's a question of understanding . "
Only Uganda and Burundi have contributed troops to the AU peacekeeping force , which has just 2,000 troops of the 8,000 planned .
But Mr Shinn said adding more peacekeepers would not help .
" The only way out of this mess at the moment is to have a successful negotiation between moderates and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia , the ARS , and the transitional federal government , " he said .
The UN has been leading peace negotiations over Somalia in neighbouring Djibouti , but al - Shabab has so far rejected the process .
A ceasefire due to be signed at the end of last week has been delayed for another month .

The latest version of Terracotta , an open source Java clustering framework , supports GlassFish application server , Spring framework and new features like Automated High Availability Mode , Improved Distributed Garbage Collector ( DGC ) Performance and Visibility , and Cluster - Wide Runtime Statistics .
Terracotta development team announced last week the availability of Terracotta 2.7 version .
The new release , which is a follow - on release to Terracotta 2.6 , adds support for Spring ( versions 2.0.8 and 2.5.4 ) and Glassfish server ( version 2.1 ) .
Other new features in version 2.7 include :
Automated High Availability Mode :
This feature enables Terracotta server run in an automated restart mode that can be used to automatically back up the cluster data for forensic purposes .
This ensures the safety and integrity of clustered data and makes the failover and restart operations easier .
Terracotta server cluster can be configured to run in ACTIVE - PASSIVE mode .
In this mode , one server runs in ACTIVE mode servicing requests from the clients and one or more servers run in PASSIVE mode acting as a hot standby for the ACTIVE server in case of a failure .
Improved Distributed Garbage Collector ( DGC ) Performance and Visibility :
The distributed garbage collector has been updated to use a generational collection algorithm which provides improvements in GC performance .
Generational collectors , which were first introduced in Java 1.4 , provide improvements in application performance with little to no overhead .
The distributed generational garbage collector in Terracotta server also helps with the throughput in Java applications .
Cluster - Wide Runtime Statistics : Terracotta users can now view and monitor all cluster - related statistics in a single page that provides information on runtime statistics including CPU , heap utilization and transaction rates as well as cache miss , object flush and object fault rates .
The cluster visibility features were first introduced in Terracotta 2.6 version .
Certified Patch Process :
The new release accepts certified hot patches for systems running in production environment , enabling customers to install them without having to shut down their applications .
This avoids any downtime that can occur during a full upgrade maintenance cycle .
Online ( Hot ) Backup Support : Terracotta introduces a new feature called hot backup feature which helps Web Administrators and Operators to ensure that all Terracotta data files are safely backed up for later restoration .
Hot backup features can be used from Terracotta Administrator Console .
Terracotta Integration Module ( TIM ) Update Center is another new feature that helps the administrators with tasks like managing dependencies of the integration modules , matching release versions , and setting correct configuration and installation options .
In the new release , tc.properties file which is used for controlling throughput tuning settings can be configured with other existing Terracotta settings in the tc-config.xml .
Terracotta also has Eclipse integration with the plugin .
Release 2.7 is available for download on Terracotta community website after joining the developer community by registering on their website .
More InfoQ coverage on Terracotta clustering framework can be found here .
In the next few weeks ( hint : CTIA is in three weeks )
I 'm expecting mobile operators to be offered a new tool , which will allow them to work out what on earth their mobile broadband customers are doing .
The mystery , however , is not " what is this tool , Guy ? " - all will become clear quite quickly .
What is mysterious is the answer to this question : " If mobile operators do n't know what their customers are doing , how on earth do they know what to charge for the broadband ? "
I put this question to an acknowledged expert , Simon Bransfield - Garth of CarrierIQ , who was typically forthright .
" Their pricing plans make no sense to me .
I think the carriers have little , or no idea of what people do with mobile broadband . "
The mobile broadband revolution , in short , could be a bubble .
If the carriers could provide ADSL - standard broadband for half the price of ADSL indefinitely , then the market would simply grow and grow .
But it can't , and nobody in their right mind imagines they can ; at some point , the bandwidth they offer will be swallowed up and they 'll have to find more from somewhere .
And that will cost real money .
Analysys
Mason this week offered the opinion that the last six months have seen an " explosion " of mobile broadband , and quoted quite a lot more figures than we normally get to see .
The trouble is , there 's no bottom line .
Take this cheerful - sounding statement from Matt Hatton 's analysis of the mobile network operator 's ( MNO's ) future :
" The rapid growth in mobile broadband and 3G data service adoption has far - reaching implications for MNOs ' business models .
Operators have tended to focus almost solely on providing narrowband voice and SMS , but the composition of their network traffic is changing . "
Specifically , Hatton says , the volume of data is now exceeding the volume of voice .
" T - Mobile reported in April 2008 that the volume of data traffic on its network in the UK had exceeded that of voice traffic for the first time in the first quarter of 2008 .
" Mobile broadband pioneers , 3 UK and Vodafone , are likely to announce a similar trend this year .
3 UK reported a seven­fold increase in the volume of data traffic on its network in the six months to March 2008 . "
What this tells us is that they had more 3G capacity than phone customers could use , and are now soaking up spare 3G capacity by selling bits to laptop users .
What it does n't tell us , however , is whether these are profitable bits .
In other words , when will the current growth rate reach the point where they have to start investing in new network capacity ?
And what will that cost ?
And will the broadband payments cover that ?
" Contention will definitely become an issue , " said Bransfield - Garth .
" Already , phone users will be familiar with the ' network busy ' sign when they try to place a call at rush hour .
What we need to know is whether it really is better for the MNOs to keep one BBC iPlayer viewer going , and to prevent 40 phone calls going through . "
Behind the scenes , some operators still seem to have their heads screwed on .
Vodafone , for example , is a major player in the wireless broadband business in the UK , and I 've had one of their dongles for almost a year .
I had an unofficial chat with a senior engineer , and asked , straight out : " How long can you survive in this market , competing with the wired suppliers , if your users really grow at current rates ? "
" Oh , I 'm all right , Jack , " was his reply .
Actually , the answer was phrased in gobbledegook , and I had to ask another consultant ( he wo n't let me say who ) for a translation .
His summary : " They have just done a deal with BT on the 21CN rollout , whereby they sign up early , and get a good deal for at least three years , and will be able to keep up with whatever users do . "

The man took a spectacular digger in Xiamen city after his bike hit a pot - hole submerged in rainwater .
But photographer Liu Tao was accused of lying in wait to take his pictures instead of warning people of the danger .
Readers of the Beijing Youth Daily , which published the shots , wrote in to express their feelings .
One wrote : " The pictures are well shot , but the person who shot this is disgusting .
He knew there was a pit , but was waiting there for someone to fall over . "
And another said : " The photographer should really be condemned since he knew there definitely would be other victims . "
Liu defended himself , saying : " I just knew that the city government has paved the pit , and without my pictures , the pit would not be noticed by the government , and there would perhaps be more people falling over . "
Whatever the case , photos of a man going ass - over - teakettle holding an umbrella while he flips over on his bike are pretty darn funny .

• Race behind division in US cities , says UN report •
Beijing is most egalitarian place in the world
Growing inequality in US cities could lead to widespread social unrest and increased mortality , says a new United Nations report on the urban environment .
In a survey of 120 major cities , New York was found to be the ninth most unequal in the world and Atlanta , New Orleans , Washington , and Miami had similar inequality levels to those of Nairobi , Kenya Abidjan and Ivory Coast .
Many were above an internationally recognised acceptable " alert " line used to warn governments .
" High levels of inequality can lead to negative social , economic and political consequences that have a destabilising effect on societies , " said the report .
" [ They ] create social and political fractures that can develop into social unrest and insecurity . "
According to the annual State of the World 's cities report from UN - Habitat , race is one of the most important factors determining levels of inequality in the US and Canada .
" In western New York state nearly 40 % of the black , Hispanic and mixed - race households earned less than $ 15,000 compared with 15 % of white households .
The life expectancy of African - Americans in the US is about the same as that of people living in China and some states of India , despite the fact that the US is far richer than the other two countries , " it said .
Disparities of wealth were measured on the " Gini co-efficient " , an internationally recognised measure usually only applied to the wealth of countries .
The higher the level , the more wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer people .
" It is clear that social tension comes from inequality .
The trickle down theory [ that wealth starts with the rich ] has not delivered .
Inequality is not good for anybody , " said Anna Tibaijuka , head of UN - Habitat , in London yesterday .
The report found that India was becoming more unequal as a direct result of economic liberalisation and globalisation , and that the most unequal cities were in South Africa and Namibia and Latin America .
" The cumulative effect of unequal distribution [ of wealth ] has been a deep and lasting division between rich and poor .
Trade liberalisation did not bring about the expected benefits . "
The report suggested that Beijing was now the most egalitarian city in the world , just ahead of cities such as Jakarta in Indonesia and Dire Dawa in Ethiopia .
In Europe , which was generally more egalitarian than other continents , Denmark , Finland , the Netherlands and Slovenia were classed as the most equal countries with Greece , the UK and Spain among the least .
" Disparities are particularly significant in the cities of eastern Europe , larger Spanish cities and in the north of England , " it said .
It documents the seemingly unstoppable move of people away from rural to urban areas .
This year it is believed that the number of people living in urban areas exceeded those in the countryside for the first time ever , but the report says there is no sign of the trend slowing .
" The dramatic transition between rural and urban communities is not over .
Urbanisation levels will rise dramatically in the next 40 years to reach 70 % by 2050 , " it predicts .
The most dramatic urbanisation has been taking place in China , with many millions of people moving from the countryside to cities .
The report says 49 new cities have been built in the past 18 years .
The rapid transition to an urban society has brought great wealth but also many negative results .
" China has attained some of the deepest disparities in the world with urban incomes three times those in rural areas .
Inequalities are growing , with disproportionate rewards for the most skilled workers ... and serious problems for the unemployed and informal workers . "
Urban growth rates are highest in the developing world , which absorbs an average 5 million new urban residents a month and is responsible for 95 % of world urban growth .
The report predicts that Asian cities will grow the most in the next 40 years and could have 63 % of the world urban population by 2050 .
Tokyo is expected to remain the world 's largest mega city , with 36.4 m people by 2025 .
But Mexico City , New York , and Sao Paulo could give way in the league table to Mumbai , Delhi and Dhaka .
Kinshasa and Lagos are the two African cities expected to grow the most , with each adding more than 6 million people by 2025 .
Rather than countryside to city movement , which has marked rapid population growth in the last 40 years , the UN expects more people to move from city to city .
Capital cities in particular are attracting much more of countries ' investments and are growing fast .
Some are becoming home to nearly half a country 's population .
But the report also identified what it believes is the emergence of a new urban trend , with many cities now shrinking in size .
The populations of 46 countries , including Germany , Italy , Japan and most former soviet states , are expected to be smaller in 2050 than they are now , and in the past 30 years , says the report , more cities in the developed world have shrunk than grown .
It found that 49 cities in the UK , including Liverpool and other old industrial centres in the north of England , and 100 in Russia reduced in size between 1990 and 2000 , mainly because of unemployment .
In the US 39 cities are smaller now than they were 10 years ago .
The reasons for the decline of cities was mostly economic , but the report says that the environment is now an important factor .
Air quality and pollution from mines , power plants and oil exploration have been responsible for population losses in India , Mexico and Africa , it says .
" Cities tend to struggle most with health - threatening environmental issues , such as the lack of safe water , sanitation and waste . "
Maryline Blackburn was Miss Alaska 1984 , Sarah Palin Miss Congeniality
Maryline Blackburn knew Sarah Palin before she became a household name in Alaska or the rest of the world .
The two met in 1984 during the Miss Alaska pageant .
Blackburn eventually won while Sarah Heath took second runner - up honors and was voted Miss Congeniality by her peers .
Diane Osbourne was a local pageant coach who worked with all of the girls prior to the big competition .
She remembers Sarah Heath as a soft spoken 20 year old who was unobtrusive and seemed to lack the ' go get - em ' attitude of most contestants .
She admitted to being very surprised , shocked actually , by how well Sarah performed on stage .
According the Sarah 's mother , she was n't a high heels kind of girl and found the swimsuit competition painful .
Maryline Blackburn has a different recollection .
" She was a very sweet young lady who everybody liked .
She had a look of determination , kind of a sizing people up even behind the smile . "
In any case , Sarah Palin has come a long way from Wasilla , Alaska all those years ago .
The governor of Alaska has hit the biggest stage of all , some twenty - five years later .
That 's quite a leap .
UPDATE : April 29 , 2010 ... Maryline Blackburn is setting her sights on a political title .
The Democrat announced today that she is challenging the Republican incumbent Rich Golick for his seat on the Georgia House of Representatives .
The former Miss Alaska moved to Georgia shortly after her reign and went on to a career as a singer and actress .
Check out our photo gallery and recent video footage of Maryline below .
We ask you ... does this woman seem like a good fit as a politician ?

ESPAÑOLA , N.M. —
In the early days of the presidential campaign , Senator John McCain seemed to be in a good position to win support among Hispanic voters .
He had sponsored legislation for comprehensive immigration overhaul in Congress , made a point of speaking warmly about the contributions of immigrants and was popular among Latinos in Arizona , his home state , which borders three battleground states here in the Southwest : New Mexico , Colorado and Nevada .
But less than two weeks before Election Day , those advantages appear to have evaporated .
Recent Gallup polls show Mr. McCain running far behind Senator Barack Obama among Hispanic voters nationwide , only 26 percent of whom favor the Republican .
The possibility that Mr. McCain can duplicate George W. Bush ’s performance among Latinos in 2004 , when Republicans won 44 percent of the vote , now seems remote .
Both candidates are spending heavily on Spanish - language advertising , and continue to schedule campaign events to focus on the fast - growing Hispanic vote .
Last month , Mr. McCain held a town - hall - style meeting at a Puerto Rican community center in central Florida ; a few days later , Mr. Obama , of Illinois , came to this heavily Hispanic city of 9,600 people for a rally at a plaza that dates to Spanish colonial times .
In an echo of his overall slide in the polls , some of the issues that have hampered Mr. McCain ’s candidacy turn out to have had an even greater impact on the Hispanic population .
Latinos cite the crisis in the economy as their biggest concern , trumping immigration and the social conservatism that Republicans thought would help expand Mr. McCain ’s appeal among religious , family - oriented Hispanic voters .
Leaving aside whether or not the potential Microsoft takeover of Yahoo is a good idea ( strategically ) , I ’m surprised the whole idea has n’t caused more analysis on how Wall Street works ( or does n’t ) .
The fact is , Microsoft ’s first offer back in January was a 62 % premium on the market valuation of Yahoo .
It only went up from there , but Yahoo never took the offer .
Juxtapose that fact with another fact that according to Wall Street / business schools / the financial system , corporations are expected to maximize shareholder value , and we have a problem with the current example .
Even if Yahoo is able to create enough value at some point in the future to meet the value offered by Microsoft in January , it would not be enough .
This is because of the “ time value of money ” concept that Wall Street loves .
Without diving into detailed examples , let ’s just say that one dollar today is worth more than one dollar at some point in the future .
So this means that the longer it takes Yahoo is come up with the $ 20 billion it effectively owes its shareholders ( the amout shareholders would have gained if Yahoo took the Microsoft offer ) , the more that $ 20 billion expectation will grow .
It is not a static number .
But that ’s not to say Yahoo making up that $ 20 + billion is impossible , though I personally think it ’s improbable .
Think of an example were you would not take a $ 20 billion premium for a sale of something you own a piece of .
Does Yahoo come to mind ?
Not for me , nor does anything else , for that matter .
But that may be because I ’m not a billionaire .
Let me explain .
My current theory is that billionaires running companies have their own agendas .
And these agendas generally are in sync with maximizing shareholder value .
If they were n’t , then shareholders would get pretty upset .
But even if the billionaire CEOs are shareholders themselves , if they ’re still likely to be billionaires when following an agenda outside of maximizing shareholder value … ( oh , say , an agenda of retaining or gaining power ) where ’s the disincentive not to follow their own agendas ?
I ’m not sure , but I ’m pegging the “ I do n’t care as much about more money when compared to more power ” at around a billion dollars .
I mean , generally speaking , what is there in life that you can do ( and want to do ) with two billion dollars but not one ?
All this leads me to believe that , simply put , Jerry Yang cares more about power than money .
In one sense , there ’s nothing wrong with that .
But I think there ’s nothing wrong with that only if we all admit that ’s what ’s going on .
But therein lies the catch - 22 .
Admitting that would be admitting that he is n’t maximizing shareholder value , which would be another route to him potentially losing his power .
But as it stands , if billionaire CEOs can evaporate $ 20 billion of shareholder value while claiming that they are , in fact , maximizing shareholder value …
I feel like they can basically say or do whatever they want and claim that it ’s “ maximizing shareholder value . ”
In other words , if not maximizing shareholder value is another way of maximizing shareholder value , then what is n’t ?
( Do you follow ? )
And that seems like a broken system to me .
I do n’t know what the solution is , but I think different , non-monetary incentives or consequences need to be in place for people who effectively have enough money that more is inconsequential ( my one billion threshold ) .
If the money involved is unlikely to affect their ( billionaire CEOs ) way of life as they make decisions that could affect the way of life of non-billionaire shareholders … that seems like a big problem ( to me ) .
Rhyming Dining - Five Day Plan
This is me .
The pic is courtesy of the lovely Tan XLVII from B3ta.com .
Thanks !
Being a typical woman I have pretty much tried every diet going .
From the D - Plan to the F - Plan , low fat , wheat free , weight - watchers & Atkins ...
News flash ... NONE of them work .
I am also a self - confessed obsessive compulsive , so I have decided to devise my own diet plan in the hope of dropping a few pounds before the Christmas party season requires me to fit into that little black dress I bought 3 years ago .
The OCD Diet does n't require that you count calories or grams of fat .
There is no restriction on quantities or carbs , sugar or salt .
The one single requirement is that you eat only foods in combinations that rhyme .
In the time honoured tradition of “ scientific research ” I have created a 5 - day plan menu you can enjoy at home – and for the next 5 days I will be living on that diet and posting my progress here ... starting with the dreaded weigh - in .
DAY 1 - MONDAY
Breakfast ...
Cheerios & Mini Heroes
Ingredients :
1 bowl of Cheerios
a handful of Cadbury 's Mini Heroes ( shelled )
Preparation :
Just throw them all into a bowl together .
Conclusion :
Very tasty – if a little dry with no milk .
I did begin to feel slightly nauseous halfway through the bowl and I almost lost a filling when I came across an unexpected toffee eclair , so consequently ate less than I do normally in the morning .
Result .
Lunch ... Steamed Sardines & Broad Beans
Ingredients :
1 can of sardines
1 portion of broad beans ( shelled , or canned depending on season )
Preparation :
Drain sardines and place in a steamer along with the broad beans .
Steam gently for 10 minutes , or until the beans are tender but not too soft .
Serve immediately ( preferably before you lose your nerve ) .
Conclusion :
I know a lot of people do n't like broad beans but actually , I am a big fan .
I am not , however , a fan of fish – especially not oily fish – so the smell of this cooking actually made me gag .
Dished up it is perhaps the most uninviting meal I have ever seen .
And it tastes like shit .
Seriously , really bad – even my cat would n't eat the leftovers .
Dinner ... Lemon Sole Swiss Roll
Ingredients :
1 lemon sole
1 Swiss Roll ( n.b.
If you are the homely kind you can make your own Swiss Roll , but I could n't be arsed to be honest )
A few spoons full of jam ( optional )
Preparation :
Grill the lemon sole until cooked .
Allow to cool .
Unwrap the Swiss Roll and carefully deconstruct it until it is lying flat on the work surface .
Flake the fish evenly across the surface of the jammy sponge ( adding extra jam will help it stick back together again ) .
Next , carefully re-roll the cake base .
Slice & serve .
Conclusion :
This actually tastes a lot nicer than it sounds .
The delicate flavour of the sole is completely drowned out by the sugary sweetness of the jam & cake , so apart from a slightly obscure texture , if you close your eyes it actually feels like you 're just eating cake ... only with added protein and that good - for - you - fat everyone is talking about at the moment .
Daily Round -up :
Breakfast & Dinner were OK , but lunch was pretty dire actually .
I am a little concerned that I have eaten quite a lot of sugar and not many vegetables .
I will try and fix that tomorrow – if I ever get to sleep tonight .
SUGAR RUUUSH !!
DAY 2 - TUESDAY
Breakfast ...
Hog Roast on Toast
Ingredients :
1 hog
1 slice of bread ( brown or white )
Preparation :
Ideally spit roast the hog slowly over a charcoal fire .
I live alone in a flat , so have opted instead to roast a pork chop in the oven – which is just the same but on a smaller scale .
Next , lightly toast the bread on both sides .
Place a large slice of hog ( or the chop ) on the toast & serve .
Conclusion :
A very tasty breakfast indeed , though massively more than I usually eat in the morning .
I feel totally ready for the day ahead – but a little apple sauce would n't have gone amiss .
Lunch ... Boiled Peas & Cauliflower Cheese
Ingredients :
1 portion frozen peas
1 pre-made cauliflower cheese ( again , if you 're feeling homely you can make this yourself , but life is too short for that much washing up at lunchtime to be honest )
Preparation :
Follow the instructions for heating the cauliflower cheese .
5 minutes before it 's ready throw the peas into a pan of boiling water .
Drain the peas and serve with the cauliflower cheese on a dish of your liking .
Conclusion :
Wow .. this feels just like a normal meal .
I like both peas & cauliflower cheese , and they compliment each other perfectly as the cheese sauce prevents the peas from rolling off your fork .
It does n't feel like I am on a diet at all !
I also feel very good about heading in the right direction for my 5 - a - day balanced diet - and , well ... it just looks cheerful too does n't it ?
Dinner ... Ham , Spam & Jam Flan
Ingredients :
1 sponge flan base ( I used individual ones , but when catering for a family use a large one )
1 pack of ham
1 can of spam
1 jar of jam ( flavour to taste , but I have opted for tradition strawberry because I already had it in the cupboard )
Preparation :
Slice the Spam and arrange attractively in the flan base together with the ham .
Presentation is important , so make sure you take your time and fan the sliced meat elegantly across the base .
If you 're in a hurry you could just dice & sprinkle .
Next spread the jam evenly across the top of the meat .
Refrigerated before serving .
Conclusion :
This dish is a real winner in terms of rhymability .
It also looks pretty awesome if you put a little effort in - and pardon me , but who the hell knew Spam smelt so damn good !?!
Sadly it tastes like shit .
It 's also missing vegetables , again ( I really wanted to add a yam , but they do n't sell them at Tescos ) .
I just about managed half a flan before I began to feel physically ill .
Daily Round -up :
A good start to the day with breakfast and lunch both highly palatable .
The excess of cauliflower for lunch did give me chronic wind in the afternoon though , which very was n't popular with my co-workers – and after a disastrous dinner I went to bed feeling hungry and unhappy .
DAY 3 - WEDNESDAY
Breakfast ...
Demi Sec Ready Brek
Ingredients :
1 bottle of sparkling Demi Sec
Ready Brek mix
Preparation :
This dish can be served hot or cold .
A word of warning though - sparkling wine tends to fizz a bit crazily when you heat it up , so make sure you use an over - sized pan .
It 's also worth noting that heating the Demi Sec destroys the alcoholic content , which kind of goes against the grain for me .
In the interests of science I have prepared and consumed it in both ways today .
Simply add the hot or cold Demi Sec to the Ready Brek and mix to a consistency you like .
Serve immediately .
Conclusion :
In need of cheering up after last night 's failure I was overjoyed with this start to the day – though I have to admit the cold and slightly fizzy version was a little weird on the tongue .
The hot version was surprisingly tasty , and well accompanied by a couple of glasses of the left over Demi Sec ( it is a travesty that they would put alcohol into something that tastes this crap , but after the week I have had so far , anything with booze in it will do ) .
I do feel a little squiffy heading into work now though , so have left the car at home .
Lunch ... Stir Fried Pork Pie
Ingredients :
1 pork pie
Stir fry oil ( pretty much any oil will do .
I 'm quite posh so am using olive oil )
Preparation :
Simply slice the pork pie and fry in a hot wok .
Conclusion :
This was a very greasy meal – although not too bad taste wise .
The heat from the wok melted the layer of fatty jelly you get inside a pork pie , which made the pastry a little soggy , hence the poorly presented serving .
I 'm pretty sure we 'll see this on the menu at fish & chip shops in Scotland once word gets out though .
Dinner ... Lambs Heart Treacle Tart
Ingredients :
1 pre-made pastry case ( sweet or savory .. and no , seriously , do n't bother to make your own as you wo n't be eating much of this anyway )
1 pack of lambs hearts
1 can of treacle syrup
Preparation :
Dice and lightly sauté the lambs hearts .
Leave to cool .
Next , spread evenly across the pastry base ( I have chosen the sweet version , which in hindsight was a bit of a tactical error given that this is supposed to be a “ diet ” ) .
Now drizzle the treacle over the heart & bake in a medium oven for 20 minutes .
Allow to cool before serving ( unless you want third degree burns on the roof of your mouth ) .
Conclusion :
I could only find Black Treacle in Tescos , so this dish looks exceedingly scary .
It tastes even scarier .
I strongly suggest you drain all the blood off the heart before applying it to the pastry base .
This was a bit like eating an abortion suffering from leprosy .
I only managed one mouthful before I was actually physically sick .
The evening was only marginally rescued by the fact that I found half a bottle of Demi Sec in the fridge to take the taste of vomit away before bed time .
Daily Round -up :
I am beginning to become dissolution with dinner time .
Every time I walk into the kitchen I gag .
And I realise that yet again my diet today has been very high in fat , protein , sugar & alcohol , with absolutely no vegetables or fruit included .
DAY 4 - THURSDAY
Breakfast ...
Honey Loops & Tomato Soup
Ingredients :
1 bowl of Honey Loops
1 can of tomato soup
Preparation :
I was in two minds about how to prepare this – hot or cold ?
I am not going to try it both ways like yesterday , as to be honest the prospect of eating Honey Loops steeped in tomato soup is far from appealing .
Fuck science .
To get it over and done with I just opened the can of soup and poured it straight over the Loops .
Conclusion :
After last night 's abortion ( quite literally ) I woke up feeling drained and hungry – I am pretty sure I had a nightmare about being chased through treacle by angry lamb 's fetuses .
So as disgusting as this looks , I am determined to start the day off with a decent amount of food in my belly .
And to be honest , once you get over the fact you are mixing 2 ingredients that should never , ever be served in the same time frame , it was n't too bad .
The flavour of the Honey Loops was totally overpowered by the tangyness of the tomato soup .
I just wish I had taken the time to heat it up and I could have pretended they were just croûtons .
Lunch ...
Chips , Skips & Strawberry Whips
Ingredients :
1 pack of Skips
Oven ready chips
A handful of Strawberry Whips
Preparation :
Follow the oven chips instructions to bake until golden brown .
Open Skips and arrange attractively on a plate with the chips & whips .
Conclusion :
This was a bit like being at a finger buffet .
The chips were in dire need of some tomato ketchup , but I did burp a little sick into my mouth half way through the meal that was tinged with the taste of tomato soup from this morning , which went some way towards filling that gap .
Altogether a not - unpleasant meal ( apart from the moment of sick ) .
Dinner ... Chicken Supreme & Chocolate Ice Cream
Ingredients :
1 chicken supreme ready meal ( you could make your own , but who knows what goes into chicken supreme ?
That thought actually scares me a little . )
2 scoops of chocolate ice cream
Preparation :
Follow the instructions on the package to heat up the chicken supreme .
Dish out onto a plate and plop 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream on top .
Serve immediately .
Conclusion :
Chicken supreme is rather tasty .
Chocolate ice cream is a food of the gods .
The 2 should never , ever be combined .
Ever .
It does n't actually taste too horrendous – I mean they eat chocolate sauce with meat quite a lot in some countries – but the ice cream melts way too fast and gets merged in with the general mush of the chicken supreme .
A total and utter waste of a perfectly good scoop of ice cream .
Daily round -up
Another disappointing end to the day .
Luckily there was enough chocolate ice cream left in the tub to cheer me up a little while I watched a movie before bed .
I know that 's not strictly speaking in keeping with the diet plan , as I did n't eat it with anything that rhymed with it – but I 've been so good all week I felt I deserved a little detour ... besides , it would n't be a real diet if I did n't cheat right ?
DAY 5 - FRIDAY
Breakfast ...
Belgian Waffle & Sautéed Offal
Ingredients :
1 Belgian Waffle
Some offal ( hearts , kidneys , livers , brains , whatever )
Preparation :
Dice and sauté the offal until cooked through .
DRAIN THOROUGHLY OF BLOOD ( I am not getting caught out again ! ) .
Warm the waffle under the grill & then serve with the diced offal on top .
Conclusion :
I woke up this morning with a sense of dread , as well as a churning and distinctly unhealthy feeling in the pit of my stomach .
When I planned this diet last week I had n't quite banked on how appalling the heart - tart - fuck - up would be – and in the interests of economy I had planned on using the remaining lambs hearts to complete this dish .
Looking at it sitting festering on my plate I am absolutely certain I am going to vomit when I take a mouthful ... I was right .
Lunch ... Apple Strudel Super Noodles
Ingredients :
1 homebake apple strudel
1 pack of super noodles ( any flavour will do – I chose chicken as they are my favourite )
Preparation :
Follow the instructions on the package to prepare the apple strudel .
Remove from oven and leave to cool as you prepare the super noodles ( also follow pack instructions ) .
Cut the apple strudel into manageable slices ( which is really fucking hard as it happens ) and fan attractively around the dished up noodles .
Conclusion :
Not a combination you would usually expect to find on your plate , but actually not too bad at all .
I do n't know if it is because my taste buds are becoming desensitized to the onslaught of conflicting flavours I have been bombarding them with this week , or if some part of me has given up the will to live a little .
I feel it 's probably a bit of both – and perhaps the beginnings of a mental disorder brought on by severe malnutrition due to the fact I have hardly eaten any fresh fruit or vegetables all week .
Dinner ... Baked Steak in a Cadbury Flake Lake
Ingredients :
1 Steak
Several Cadbury Flakes
Preparation :
Place the steak in an oven proof dish and crumble several flakes around it ( exact number will depend on the size of your dish & steak , but ideally the end result should leave an island of meaty goodness floating in a lake of melted chocolate .
N.B. Being too stingy with the flakes will result in either an undercooked steak or a dish full of smoking and burnt chocolate that is impossible to clean off .. & yes , I am talking from experience here ) .
Bake in a medium oven for 10 - 12 mins , or until steak is cooked to your liking .
Conclusion :
It 's Friday & the end of my diet , so I thought I 'd push the boat out with something a little fancy tonight .
Drawing once again on the “ meat & chocolate sauce genre ” , this is OCD haute cuisine at it 's very best .
It smells amazing as it's cooking – and looks rather fancy too , though the flakes did n't quite melt to create the lake I had envisaged .
It begs the question , what have Cadburys done to the genetic makeup of the chocolate in their flakes ??
Sadly I feel a little too nauseous to fully appreciate the meaty , chocolaty goodness of this meal .
All I really want right now is some plain boiled rice and an early night .
Scientific Findings ...
Having ( pretty much ) stuck to this diet all week I can honestly say that compared with other diets I have been on it was a resounding success .
I feel like shit .
I am lethargic and depressed .
I find myself thinking about food constantly and want to kill anyone I see eating anything that is n't on my menu .
I have even been dreaming about food – only unlike other diets where my dreams involve gorging myself on forbidden fruits , this week I have mostly been dreaming about being chased by various alarming produce through lakes and rivers of treacle & chocolate .
There is one final test to complete this experiment ... the ultimate litmus test of any successful diet .. the holy grail of the nutritional dictatorship ... the dreaded weigh - in .
I was 9st 11lbs at the start of this week .... / drum roll
SUCCESS !!!!
Up yours Atkins & f - you F - Plan !
I have lost a total of 3lbs this week , which is more than I ever did on your diets – although admittedly they did n't make me chunder my guts up on 2 out of the 5 days , at least I lost some weight !
And I did n't even have to go bulimic or any shit like that to get there .
Now if you 'll excuse me I am off to Maccy D's to celebrate – where I am going to order every flipping thing on the menu that does NOT rhyme with each other .
What the Doctors say ....
From Canada , more signs that the oil industry is starting to feel pinched .
Two big Canadian oil - sands producers are delaying oil - production projects and scaling back capital expenditure .
Suncor and Petro-Canada both pushed back plans to install “ upgraders ” that can turn tar sands into crude oil .
It 's unclear whether the pullback owes more ...
Honda Motor Co. wants to challenge the eco-supremacy of the Toyota Prius and bring hybrids to the masses with the dirt - cheap gas- electric Insight hatchback it unveiled today at the Paris Motor Show .
Honda is n't saying what the Insight will cost when it rolls into showrooms next spring , but it 's widely expected to go for as little as
$ 18,500 and no more than $ 20,000 .
That 's significantly cheaper than the
Prius , which starts at 22 grand but goes for an average of $ 26,672 when you can find one .
" This new Insight will give more people the chance to get behind the wheel of a high - quality hybrid vehicle , " Tekeo Fukui , Honda 's president and CEO , said in Paris .
Although the Japanese automaker was the first to sell hybrids in America when it rolled out the original Insight in 1999 , it 's been choking on Toyota 's dust since the Prius arrived in 2001 .
The green set has bought more than 1 million of them , and Toyota holds 79 percent of the global market for gas - electric vehicles .
Honda bets it can get a bigger piece of that pie by taking hybrids into what Fukui called " a new era of affordability . "
Considering Toyota can't build the Prius fast enough to meet demand , auto industry watchers expect Honda to clean up by undercutting its competition .
" Anyone who says ' We 've got a car that does what the Prius does and it's several thousand cheaper ' will sell every car it builds , " Aaron Bragman , an industry analyst with Global Insight told Wired.com .
" People will beat a path to their door . "
For all the attention they get , hybrids are still just 3 percent of the domestic market .
Their relatively high price is one reason they 've been slow to catch on , Mike Omotoso of J.D. Power and Associates told Wired.com .
The Insight could provide the price breakthrough the technology needs to take off .
" The new Insight is a good idea for Honda and for the hybrid market in general , " he said .
" It undercuts the Prius by about $ 5,000 and is within reach of the average car buyer , especially in these tough economic times . "
Honda says the car it unveiled in Paris is just a concept , but the production model we 'll see at the Detroit Auto Show in January is not expected to look significantly different .
The Insight bears more than a passing resemblance to the Prius – although the front end was clearly inspired by the FCX Clarity fuel cell vehicle , the general shape is reminiscent of the car Honda hopes to unseat as the darling of the eco-conscious set .
That is , to a certain degree , unavoidable , as General Motors discovered while designing the Chevrolet Volt .
Aerodynamic efficiency is the name of the game when going for maximum fuel economy , and the laws of physics and aerodynamics give designers only so much leeway .
Still , the Insight has sharper lines and a more aggressive look than the Prius , and it is n't so funky as the car it 's named for .
" The new Insight should do a lot better than the original because it will look more like a normal car and less like a toy , and it will be bigger , more comfortable and more powerful , " Omotoso said .
Look for it to do better than the Civic and Accord hybrids , which looked just like their gasoline counterparts but for the small " hybrid " badges on their rear ends .
One reason the Prius has out - sold Honda 's hybrids four to one is because it all but screams , " I care about the environment ! "
Honda executives have said the company reevaluated its strategy of building hybrid versions of existing models and decided a dedicated model would sell better .
The Insight , like all of Honda 's hybrids , uses a " mild " hybrid system where the primary source of power is a gasoline engine assisted by an electric motor .
The Prius , on the other hand , is a " full " hybrid system that uses battery power at low speeds and switches to gasoline at higher speeds .
Honda has n't released any specifics on the Insight 's drivetrain or performance but says it will use a 1.3 - liter gasoline engine an an updated version of the Integrated Motor Assist system found in the Civic Hybrid .
Like Toyota , Honda is sticking with nickel - metal hydride batteries because it does n't think lithium - ion technology is ready for prime - time .
No word yet on fuel economy , but Honda says it 's expected to top the Civic Hybrid 's 45 mpg .
That puts it in the same ballpark as the Prius , which gets 48 mpg city / 45 highway , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
The Insight will arrive in showrooms on April 22 – Earth Day – and Honda expects to sell 200,000 of them annually .

When most people think of portable music , they think harmonica , mouth harp , kazoo or something of that ilk .
What if you play the trumpet , you ’re about to go on vacation or a hike or something and feel that you might come across a pickup improv jazz show ?
Well thank God you brought your pocket trumpet !
A pocket trumpet is tuned the same as a regular trumpet ( b - flat ) , but is folded up into a smaller package .
Believe it or not , but if you stretch out the tubes of a pocket trumpet and the tubes of a regular trumpet they would extend to approximately the same length – the pocket trumpet just has more compact tubes .
Much to my surprise , I found out that these pockets trumpets are actually serious instruments .
Some of them are upwards of $ 1500 , like this hand - hammered Benge Colibri .
This thing sounds pretty close to a pro full - sized trumpet .
Of course there are a ton of crappy pocket trumpets out there made by companies in India .
You can usually find them on eBay for around $ 100 or so , but they are utter garbage .
There are a couple of companies that make good quality pocket trumpets for around the $ 500 - $ 600 mark if you want something that actually works and sounds good .
A company called Jupiter makes the 416BL ( made in Taiwan ) that sounds decent – the best one in this range will set you back about $ 600 .
Another company makes pocket trumpets in the Czech Republic and sells the Amati ATR 314 for $ 699 – it ’s available in all sorts of crazy colors .
Vintage you say ?
One of the more interesting things about pocket trumpets is that they have some history .
This is n’t an invention by some company in the late 80 ’s to cash in on people who want to play while they sit waiting in line to get on the ski lift .
They ’ve been around for a long time .
Here is a really interesting site with tons of vintage pocket trumpets and cornets .
Here ’s what they sound like .
Of course there are other uses for a pocket trumpet .
Who would have thought ?
Bill Gwatney Shot and Killed : Suspect Killed by Police ( Photos )
Arkansas Democratic Party Chair49was shot this afternoon in Little Rock , Arkansas .
He was at party headquarters when a lone gunman , , 50 , of Searcy , Arkansas , burst into his office and fired three shots .
Gwatney was hospitalized in critical condition and died four hours later , at 3:59 p.m .
Police Lt. Terry Hastings reported that authorities chased the suspect into Grant County , south of Little Rock , and the gunman was fatally wounded during a 30 mile chase .
Millie McLain , a reporter for the Sheridan Headlight newspaper said the suspects blue truck was turned sideways along a highway northeast of Sheridan .
Emergency crews were loading the man into a Med - Flight helicopter .
The Arkansas State Capitol was locked down for an hour until police got word that the shooter had been killed , according to a Capitol policeman Charlie Brice .
Gwatney 's aide reportedly ran across the street to a flower shop to summon help after the shooter entered Gwatney 's office and started shooting .
The chairman 's aide burst into the floral business at noon in a highly agitated state and asked someone to call 911 , according to Sarah Lee , a sales clerk .
Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton who still have strong ties to Arkansas , where Bill Clinton was governor before running for President , issued this statement after learning of the chairman 's death :
" We are deeply saddened by the news that Bill Gwatney has passed away .
His leadership and commitment to Arkansas and his country has always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him . "
" This senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chairman Gwatney 's family . "

Gag Order Imposed
Your tax dollars at work .
The Environmental Protection Agency is protecting itself from everyone , including it ’s own Inspector General ’s Office .
( IG )
In a report released by the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility website workers in the EPA ’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance were forbidden to speak with anyone in an effort to “ ensure timely responses and assist in tracking and record keeping obligations ” .
The order came in a June 16th email , stating that if an employee is approached by a reporter , the IG ’s office or GAO requesting any kind of information , to say nothing other than refer that party to the proper authority .
The EPA public affairs office released it ’s explanation of the gag order , saying it was implemented to respond to the IG ’s report , and ensure “ consistency and coordination among those responding to the IG and GAO reports ” .
The EPA has been under a lot of heat recently , in one case the IG ’s report , “ EPA Can Improve its Oversight of Audit Followup ” which was issued in May of 2007 .
The report chided the EPA for it ’s lack of accountability for correcting admitted deficiencies reported in previous IG audits .
Congress has attempted to subpoena agency files and agency director Stephen L Johnson has reportedly refused to appear before a Senate committee .
So , What Is It , A Gag Order or SOP ?
At no time during my years of employment , was I allowed to talk with any reporter or investigating group about certain details of my work , our office , it ’s internal operations or management policies .
That was standard operating procedure ( SOP ) , and it was strictly obeyed .
We were made to believe that only management personnel , or management itself , could properly respond to probing questions .
It was “ their way or the highway . ”
So far so good , but , we all know that in any company , no matter how large , there is at least one person who could run it better , has information that would “ blow this place apart ” , “ put it back in shape ” , well , fill in the blanks yourself .
That ’s where “ leaks ” come from , and they have resulted in some pretty awesome disclosures that led to prosecutions , firings , company closings , again , fill in the blanks yourself .
It appears the only way to get accountability from any public agency is to force it by any means possible .
My question is , should any government agency operate “ in a fishbowl ” as former EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus proclaimed 25 years ago , or do they have the legal right to muzzle their employees ?
What do you think ?

The Monkeysphere Project
The Monkeysphere project 's goal is to extend OpenPGP 's web of trust to new areas of the Internet to help us securely identify servers we connect to , as well as each other while we work online .
The suite of Monkeysphere utilities provides a framework to transparently leverage the web of trust for authentication of TLS / SSL communications through the normal use of tools you are familiar with , such as your web browser 0 or secure shell .
This also enhances these tools by adding the possibility for key transitions , transitive identifications , revocations , and expirations of public keys 1 .
It also actively invites broader participation in the OpenPGP web of trust .
For the Web
Everyone who has used a web browser has been interrupted by the " Are you sure you want to connect ? " warning message , which occurs when the browser finds the site 's certificate unacceptable .
But web browser vendors ( e.g. Microsoft or Mozilla ) should not be responsible for determining whom ( or what ) the user trusts to certify the authenticity of a website , or the identity of another user online .
The user herself should have the final say , and designation of trust should be done on the basis of human interaction .
The Monkeysphere project aims to make that possibility a reality .

For OpenSSH
Frequent users of ssh are familiar with the prompt given the first time you log in to a new server , asking if you want to trust the server 's key by verifying the key fingerprint .
Unfortunately , unless you have access to the server 's key fingerprint through a secure out - of - band channel , there is no way to verify that the fingerprint you are presented with is in fact that of the server you 're really trying to connect to .
OpenSSH currently provides a functional way to manage the RSA and DSA keys required for these interactions through the known_hosts and authorized_keys files .
However , it lacks any type of Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) that can verify that the keys being used really are the one required or expected .
Monkeysphere uses GnuPG 's keyring manipulation capabilities and public keyserver communication to manage the keys that OpenSSH uses for connection authentication .
To emphasize : no modifications to SSH are required to use the Monkeysphere .
OpenSSH can be used as is ; completely unpatched and " out of the box " .

For key signing
Monkeysphere people have also improved significantly the key signing workflow using the monkeysign package .

There then occurred to me the ' glücklichste Gedanke meines Lebens , ' the happiest thought of my life , ...
Federal regulators on Sunday night were pressing for the sale of yet another troubled bank  this time , the Wachovia Corporation  in a move that would concentrate power within the nation ’s banking industry in the hands of a few giant lenders .
Wachovia , the nation ’s fourth - largest bank , was negotiating to sell itself to Wells Fargo or Citigroup .
Although the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department were pushing for a sale , the government was resisting pressure to provide financial guarantees to the buyer .
A sale to either Wells Fargo or Citigroup would further concentrate Americans ’ bank deposits in the hands of just three banks : Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase and whichever bank acquired Wachovia would control more than 30 percent of the industry ’s deposits .
Together , those three would be so large that they would dominate the industry , with unrivaled power to set prices for their loans and services .
Given their size and reach , the institutions would probably come under greater scrutiny from federal regulators .
Some small and midsize banks , already under pressure , might have little choice but to seek suitors .
Three years ago , when a Democratic state legislator tried to get bipartisan support for investigating charges of unethical conduct by a senior Republican official , only one member of the GOP answered the call : Sarah Palin .
Palin pursued the allegations -- as well as ethics charges against another top GOP official -- so vigorously that both had to leave office .
The public acclaim that followed helped propel her into the governor ’s office a year later with promises of reform and a more open , accountable government that would stand up to entrenched interests , including the big oil companies .
Yet a strange thing happened on the ethics issue once Palin became governor :
She appeared to lose interest in completing the task of legislating comprehensive reform , some who supported the cleanup say .
Advertisement
The ethics bill she offered was so incomplete that its supporters had to undertake a significant rewrite .
Moreover , when it came to building support for the bill , politicians in both parties say the new governor was often unaccountably absent from the fray .
And the seeming paradox of the ethics reform fight -- the combination of bold , even courageous readiness to take on a tough issue , coupled with a tendency to drift away from the nitty - gritty follow - through -- appears to be a recurrent theme of her record .
Some lawmakers were so perplexed by her absence from a recent debate over sending oil rebate checks to Alaskans , for example , that they sported buttons at the state Capitol reading “ Where ’s Sarah ? ”
A spokesman for the governor ’s office rejects such criticism .
Bill McAllister , Palin ’s press secretary , said : “ She has always been sufficiently informed and engaged .
. . .
In just two years in office , she accomplished more than most governors in their entire careers . ”
Even her critics credit Palin with a major role in pushing a state known for its relaxed approach to political ethics into a long - overdue housecleaning .
And Palin has pushed hard to make oil companies pay more for access to the state ’s oil and gas reserves .
Advertisement
At the same time , she has fallen short of her proclaimed goals in other areas , especially concerning how she governs .
Her administration has not been marked by the transparency she promised :
She invoked executive privilege in refusing to disclose information about one ethics case , and last week she moved to hobble a legislative inquiry into her role in the firing of a state public safety official .
Several legislators also say the governor ’s office is not a place for open debate : Palin does not tolerate much dissent , they say , sometimes cutting off relations with those deemed unhelpful or critical .
And she shows only marginal interest in crafting policy proposals and getting them passed , these critics say .
Advertisement
“ Her ethics proposal had to be beefed up substantially with very basic additions , ” said state Rep. Les Gara , an Anchorage Democrat who tried to get the governor ’s attention on ethics and other issues .
It lacked such long - needed provisions as language making legislators subject to prosecution for bribery if they exchanged votes for campaign contributions .
To Gara and to some others , including Republicans who have often supported the governor , their experience on the ethics bill has proven disconcertingly similar to their experience with Palin on other issues .
“ When it comes to the real work of crafting policy , she ’s often not there , ” Gara said .
He acknowledged her broad accomplishments , but added : “ I do n’t know if she ’s disinterested in details or not comfortable with them , but the bottom line is :
She is not truly a hands - on governor . ”
During the recent debate over how much of the state ’s annual oil royalties to rebate to the state ’s citizens in the form of individual checks -- a highly sensitive issue in Alaska -- Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature said Palin took little part in the final stages of the discussion .
Advertisement
In interviews , more than a dozen Alaska politicians described Palin as a master at burnishing her image and building a popular base .
She won statewide applause for selling the state jet , rejecting a big security entourage while driving herself , and firing the chef at the executive mansion .
No one questions her readiness to fight for cleaner government either .
After she agreed in 2005 to help Democratic legislator Eric Croft get an independent investigation of state Atty .
Gen. Gregg Renkes , she immediately incurred the wrath of the party establishment .
The same thing had happened a year earlier , when she raised conflict - of - interest allegations against the state GOP chairman , Randy Ruedrich , who had sat with her on the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission .
Palin was vindicated in both cases : Ruedrich resigned from the commission and paid a $ 12,000 ethics fine .
The attorney general also resigned and received a reprimand .
A spokesman for Ruedrich and the state party said that the past was not a factor and that Ruedrich was backing the McCain - Palin ticket .
Renkes could not be reached for comment .
Advertisement
Croft , who is running for mayor of Anchorage and backing the Barack Obama - Joe Biden ticket , said he was impressed with Palin ’s willingness to join him in the case involving the attorney general .
“ She got it right away ” and never backed down , Croft said .
“ Her sense was that this was wrong and that she had to speak out . ”
Many officials are less positive , however , about her record of working with the Legislature and running the state government .
Republican state Sen. Fred Dyson , a friend and fellow reformer who praises Palin for taking up the issue , acknowledged that she was not fully engaged in the details of the ethics bill and that some legislators had been rankled by her lack of engagement in other issues as well .
Advertisement
Still , he points out , her popularity in Alaska remains undiminished .
Other legislators say that the governor has been so focused on her own priorities that she has been unwilling to consider other significant matters -- including the state ’s poor ranking in providing health insurance to children .
Alaska ranks near the bottom of the states in making children from lower - middle - income families eligible for a government insurance program .
She used the line - item veto this year to cut funding for $ 268 million in capital projects from spending bills , including money for a senior citizens center and batting cages for the Ketchikan Little League .
At the same time , the Anchorage Daily News reported , she preserved $ 2 million for an academic conference highlighting arguments that global warming is n’t threatening the survival of polar bears .
A former associate director of the governor ’s Washington office , Larry Persily , said that some of the governor ’s problems resulted from the fact that she “ underestimated exponentially how much more complex state government is than the city of Wasilla . ”
Advertisement
Palin is smart but was “ never deeply engaged , ” he said .
Though she had good instincts with the public , her approach to legislators and fellow elected officials was often counterproductive , he said .
For example , he said , when she made a four - day visit to Washington in February , she did not meet with any members of the congressional delegation .
Similarly , when she reversed her campaign decision and finally killed the “ bridge to nowhere , ” the much - ridiculed project to connect Ketchikan with the island airport that serves it , neither the mayor of the town nor the congressional delegation was notified in advance .
“ When she makes a decision , she wants it executed immediately , ” Persily said .
“ In politics , sometimes ‘ immediately ’ is not the most productive way to do it . ”
Advertisement
But McAllister , the governor ’s press secretary , praised her attention to detail .
He noted that during her second year in office , she met with legislators in groups of three to go over budget concerns for each district .
“ That shows her willingness to engage even at the level of minutiae , ” he said .
Republican Lyda Green , president of the Alaska Senate , who has clashed frequently with the governor , said : “ It has been very difficult for her to accept ‘ no , ’ and after a ‘ no ’ was spoken , going forward after that amicably was very difficult .
After that , you did n’t get in .
No conversations .
She would very much slam you in her next press conference . ”
Green , who represents the Wasilla area , is retiring from the Legislature at the end of this year , citing the conflict she has had with Palin as one reason she ’s stepping down .
McAllister dismisses Green ’s criticism as “ bitter personal resentment . ”
Advertisement
Palin has also stirred controversy over her abrupt firing of prominent officials .
State legislators were upset earlier this year , for instance , when she dismissed the state ’s well - liked public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan .
The governor agreed to a legislative inquiry by an independent investigator who was going to probe whether Palin had abused her authority in seeking Monegan ’s precipitous dismissal .
The Palins were angry because Monegan failed to fire a state trooper in the midst of a fierce custody battle the trooper was having with the governor ’s sister .
For years , the governor and her family had complained that the trooper was abusive and dangerous .
Since being chosen as John McCain ’s running mate , however , Palin has started a legal maneuver to prevent that inquiry from going forward .
State Rep. Andrea Doll of Juneau , a Democrat , says she thinks the governor is learning from her mistakes .
“ One thing she learned is that you are not a lone ranger -- you ca n’t go marching off , ignoring the people at the legislative front lines , ” she said .
“ To get something done , you need more than just the public applauding wildly . ”

At a Sarah Palin rally in LA on Saturday , the California Democratic party rented a digital billboard across the street which displayed questions for the veep candiate sent by text message .
Granted , even if Palin did read them , she would n't be able to recall which ones she read specifically .
But still , quite awesome — I hope both parties get creative with tech like this , it 's a fantastic way to reach voters .

New Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix Screenshots
Originally scheduled for a summer release , Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix did n't quite make it out on time following a beta test that ran longer than expected .
Promising that the fighting game remake is on its way to Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network " very soon " , Capcom sends along twenty new screenshots .
Kay Hagan has filed a defamation lawsuit against Elizabeth Dole yesterday , for the continued airing of this advertisement Ms Joanne posted yesterday .
In which , Elizabeth Dole is suggesting that Kay Hagan is being supported by godless heathens and that she does n’t believe in God .
Here is the statement issued by Hagan , courtesy of Politico – The Scorecard .
“ Like her time in the U.S. Senate , Elizabeth Dole has made her choices here , and that ’s her decision , ” Hagan campaign spokeswoman Colleen Flanagan said in a statement .
“ But it ’s equally our decision not to allow someone to slander Kay Hagan , impugn her character , her convictions and her faith , without any consequences . ”
Here is Elizabeth Dole ’s statement , who has run one of the most nastiest campaign ’s of this election season .
“ Kay Hagan knows that the Dole Campaign ad is accurate and she is trying to confuse voters until Election Day , ” Gidley said .
“ Yesterday she threatened to sue to get the ad off the air .
After realizing that they could not get an ad pulled that is 100 % factual , they have resorted to court room gimmicks .
Hagan ’s so called ‘ lawsuit ’ is merely a motion to file a suit within 20 days , well after the election . ”
Elizabeth Dole has declined to pull this ad , which is being described by North Carolina newspapers as “ indecent , ” a “ gross misrepresentation , ” “ dishonest , ” and “ beyond the bounds of acceptable political disagreement . ”
The ad is basically about a Kay Hagan fundraiser hosted by an atheist , hence the “ godless heathens ” reference that Elizabeth Dole is using in her ad against Hagan .
But in my research , I uncovered more about this man featured in this ad , who says he is not an atheist .
The fundraiser was actually hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen .
John Kerry and about three dozen others .
Retired Bible teacher Rick Stone is shown answering the door in grainy footage of a Sept. 15 fundraiser at the Boston home of Wendy Kaminer and Woody Kaplan .
So imagine Rick Stone ’s surprise to find himself depicted as a “ Godless American . ”
He is in fact , Charles Frederick ( Rick ) Stone III , who currently studies theology at the Harvard Divinity School .
Until his 2007 move to Boston , Stone lived in Greensboro and taught Biblical studies at Greensboro College , which is affiliated with the United Methodist Church , and Guilford College , which draws on Quaker tradition .
His courses have included Old and New Testament , religious law , and the teachings of Jesus .
Stone himself is Episcopalian and a believer in God .
This is really going to make you laugh when you find out how the two met .
Stone met Hagan in the late 1990s , when he taught Sunday school at Greensboro ’s First Presbyterian Church .
In church no less … this is why the NC newspapers are calling this latest ad dishonest and indecent .
That is a fair assessment .

Thomas writes :
Here are a few of my favorite pointers to increase productivity if you 're an Ubuntu user .
None of the tips are specific to Ubuntu , and with a little wrangling should work on any GNOME - based Linux desktop .
All are taken from my new book Ubuntu Kung Fu , which contains over 300 other tips on the topic of productivity , security , performance , image editing , the command - line , hardware , and much more .

1. Instantly Search Google for Any Word or Phrase
Have you ever been reading a document and wanted to look up something in Google ?
In Firefox you can just highlight the word or phrase , right - click it , and select Search Google .
However , what if you 're reading , say , a PDF file ?
Or a man page in a terminal window ?
A very simple but effective solution is Googlizer , which you can install using Synaptic .
Once installed , it 's added to the Applications —->
Internet menu , so you 'll have to manually drag and drop it to a blank spot on the panel for quicker access .
How it works is simple .
Highlight any text , in any application , and then click Googlizer 's icon to instantly search Google .
If a Firefox window is open , a new tab will be added showing the search results .
Otherwise , Firefox will be started , and the search results will be shown .
Try it .
It 's one of those simple things that might just change the way you work forever .
Googlizer can be personalized so that it searches the version of Google localized to your country or even a non-Google search engine .
To do this , you 'll need to discover the search URL for the engine you want to use .
To do so , just perform a search using either the localized version of Google ( for example , http://www.google.co.uk, if you live in the UK ) or a different search engine .
Then look at the URL for the part where your search term appears , and highlight / copy all that comes before it .
For example , if I search for Ubuntu Kung Fu using http://www.google.co.uk, I get the following URL for the search results page : http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=Ubuntu+Kung+Fu&btnG=Google+Search&meta= ... so I chop the end off , from the Ubuntu + Kung + Fu part onward , and I 'm left with the following , which I copy into the clipboard ( highlight the text , and hit Ctrl+c ) : http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=
Once you have the information , right - click the Googlizer panel icon , and select Properties .
In the Command line , add —url after googlizer , and then paste your Google URL .
For example , I ended up with the following , as shown in the screenshot ( note that I resized the dialog box for the purposes of the figure ) : googlizer --url http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=
You can also change the icon if you want by clicking the icon preview at the top left of the dialog box .
When finished , click the Close button , and then test the new localized search .
Here are some URLs that will make Googlizer use other search engines — - just add these addresses after the -- url part of the Command line , as described earlier : Yahoo.com : http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=
Ask.com : http://www.ask.com/web?q=
Microsoft Live : http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=

2. Turn Your Desktop into Your /home Folder
Do you use your desktop as a dumping ground for files and pretty much ignore your actual / home folder , which is where you should store things ?
If so , you might be interested in this tweak , which effectively makes Ubuntu use your / home folder for the desktop , instead of the actual / home / username / Desktop folder .
Anything saved to the desktop , such as files / folders dropped there , will be placed in your / home folder .
Additionally , anything in your / home folder will appear on the desktop .
To try this , hit Alt +F2 and type gconf - editor .
In the program window that appears , navigate to / apps / nautilus / preferences in the list on the left , and put a check alongside desktop_is_home_dir on the right of the program window .
Then log out and back in again .
Remember that the old contents of your desktop have n't vanished .
They 're still in the Desktop folder in your / home folder .

3. Scroll Without the Mouse in Firefox and Evolution Mail Windows
Both Firefox and Evolution have a hidden caret browsing feature .
This is where a cursor appears in a web page or received email , just like in a word processing document .
Just like in a word processor , its position can be controlled using the cursor keys .
When the cursor reaches the bottom or top of the screen , the page ( or email ) scrolls .
Caret browsing was designed as an accessibility feature for those who find reading difficult , but it 's proved popular for every kind of user .
This is because it allows people to navigate web pages or emails without taking their hands off the keyboard ( there 's no need to reach for the mouse scroll wheel , for example ) and also keep track of where they were last reading should they walk away from their computer .
In addition to navigation , text can be highlighted in the usual way by holding down Shift and using the cursor keys .
It can then be copied in the usual way by pressing Ctrl+c .
To activate caret browsing in either application , just hit F7 while the program is running .
The cursor will appear at the top of the web page or email preview window , although it can be repositioned by clicking the mouse anywhere .

4. Quickly Create Links to files , Folders , and / or Applications
There is a curious feature missing from the Ubuntu desktop : quick and easy shortcut creation .
For example , suppose you want to create a desktop shortcut to your Documents folder .
You can right - click it and select Make Link , but this wo n't work with all folders because the new link is created within the parent folder , and you might not have permissions to write there ( this can be an issue when creating links to system programs in the /usr / bin folder , for example ) .
You can create a desktop launcher that redirects to the folder or file , but this is annoyingly long - winded and involves working your way through a dialog box .
A solution to this problem is built into GNOME .
It 's just hidden .
Simply middle - click the folder or file , drag it to where you want the shortcut to be , and then select Link Here from the menu that appears when you release the mouse button .
This will create a new link to the folder or file .
On most modern mice , the middle mouse button is the scroll wheel , which doubles as a third mouse button .
The type of link created is a symbolic link , which is n't just a GNOME desktop shortcut .
It will also work at the command line too .
To create a symbolic link at the command line , type ln -s , specifying the original file and then the new link name ( including paths , if necessary ) .
For example , the following will create a link to the Gedit text editor ( which lives in the /usr / bin folder ) on the desktop and call it Text Editor ; this command assumes you 're currently browsing your / home folder : ln -s /usr / bin / gedit " Desktop / Text Editor "
After this , the link will act just like the original file - double - clicking it will start Gedit .
It 's worth pointing out for the nervously inclined that deleting the shortcut wo n't delete the original file .

5. Intelligently Select Only the files You Want
Imagine the following : you 're working on a project and have been saving the files in your Documents folder , which is where all your files tend to end up , regardless of project .
This particular project involves pictures ( of varying file types ) , word processing documents , and spreadsheets ...
You spend a few minutes considering how chaotic it all is , and then your boss asks you to send all the project files to him .
However , there are hundreds , and you can't sort by file extension or alphanumerically , because they 're all different .
Assuming all the files contained the project name , you could use Nautilus 's Select Pattern function , which is found on the Edit menu .
For example , assuming the project is called Falken and this word appears somewhere within the project files ' filenames , you could type the following into the Select Pattern dialog box : * falken * . *
This uses wildcards , in the form of asterisks , to indicate characters within the filename that could equate to anything .
So , the files could start with any text , could end with anything , and could have any file extension , but if it contains the word falken somewhere within it , it will be selected , as if you 'd just clicked it .
Assuming several files match the pattern , they will all be selected , and you can then click and drag them to the email you 're about to send to your boss .
Note that the pattern selection tool is case sensitive .

6. Rename Many files at Once ( aka Bulk Rename )
Have you ever been out with your digital camera and then returned home to find yourself with lots of files with names like IMG_0159.jpg , IMG_0160.jpg , IMG_0161.jpg , and so on ?
And have you then gone through one by one renaming them to something relevant ?
Well , there 's no need to ever do that again because Ubuntu can come to the rescue !
There are a handful of ways of bulk renaming files using the command line , but many are quite involved , and you 'll need to remember a chain of commands .
To save the effort , use Synaptic to install purrr ( that 's pu , followed by three r's ! ) .
This is a GUI application that allows simple bulk renaming .
Once installed , you 'll find the program on the Applications —->
Accessories menu .
1 . Start by clicking and dragging the files from a Nautilus window onto the files section of Purrr .
If you intend to bulk rename the files with sequentially increasing numbers , it 's important to first sort them into the right order before dragging across — - possibly the best way of doing this is to click View —->
View as List in Nautilus and then click the Date Modified heading to sort by the time the files were created ( this is ideal for digital photographs ) .
Alternatively , you might click the Name heading if the filenames can be sorted alphanumerically .
Then Shift - click to highlight many files at once and drag them into the Purrr window .
2 . In the Name template text field , you need to type the basic format of the new filenames .
For example , if the pictures were all taken at Disneyland , you might type that .
You 'll see the effect on the new filenames as you type , although they wo n't actually be renamed until you hit the Rename button .
3 . There are a handful of useful special inserts you can make into the filename .
Typing [ N ] causes the original filename to be added to the renamed files , while [ C ] adds a sequential number count .
[ E ] causes the file extension to appear ( necessary if [ N ] is n't used ) .
Here 's an example .
The following , when typed into the Name template box , will cause all the files to be named Disneyland , followed by a sequentially increasing number , and then followed by the original file extension : Disneyland [ C ] . [ E ]
Try it to see what happens .
The [ C ] ( count ) operator can be further configured .
A single comma inserted after C , followed by a number , sets the start number for the count .
For example , [ C,400 ] will start the count at 400 .
For an example from my test PC , see the screenshot .
Two commas causes the count to skip numbers as it counts upward .
For example , [ C , , 4 ] will name the first file with 1 , the second with 5 , the third with 9 , the fourth with 13 , and so on .
In other words , +4 each time .
Three commas causes the count to be " padded " with zeros , and the number of zeros is specified by the number that follows .
[ C , , ,3 ] will cause the count to start at 001 , then 002 , then 003 , and so on .
When the count reaches double or triple figures , the padding zeroes will disappear ( that is , Disneyland_009.jpg , disneyland_010.jpg...disneyland_099.jpg , disneyland_100.jpg , and so on ) .
4 . Once you 've typed your selection , hit the Rename button to carry out the renaming .

7. Instantly Create an HTML Slideshow of Photos
Use Synaptic to install igal .
Once installed , copy all the pictures you want to make into a slideshow into one folder .
Then switch to that folder in a terminal window , and type igal .
It 's as simple as that — - there 's no need to specify the files .
The necessary HTML files for a slideshow will be created automatically , and all you need do is upload all the files to your web site .
The main file igal creates is index.html , and you might want to rename this to something like slideshow .
html to avoid overwriting your web site 's index.html file .
You should also be aware that igal creates thumbnails of the images as hidden files ( files preceded by a period ) , and these will need to be uploaded to the web site too .
To view then in a Nautilus file - browsing window , click View —->
Show Hidden files .
There 's no reason why the slideshow will work only online .
You could also email the whole folder full of images plus HTML to others as a single compressed file and instruct them to double - click index.html when they 've decompressed the folder .
The slideshow will then open in their browser .

8. Post Blog Entries from your Ubuntu Desktop
Use Synaptic to search for and install gnome - blog .
Once installed , right - click a blank spot on the panel , and select Add to panel .
Then select Blog Entry Poster from the list .
The program is designed to work with blogs hosted at Blogger.com , Advogato , or LiveJournal .
Alternatively , you can configure the software to work with MovableType , Pyblosxon , or WordPress installations on your own web site .
When it runs for the first time , the program will ask you to set up your blog details .
You 'll need to set the blog type in the Blog Type drop - down list and then set your user name and password ( if you 're attempting to access blog software you 've manually installed on a web site , you 'll also need to provide the URL ) .
Then click the Lookup Blogs button both to confirm the details are correct and to retrieve the list of blogs that you can use the applet to contribute to .
Once the lookup has completed , select its entry from the Blog Name drop - down list .
Note that you can contribute to only one blog using the applet .
To make a new posting , just click the applet 's button on the panel .
Type the title , as prompted , and then the body of the posting into the window .
Then click the Post Entry button .
Pictures can be dragged and dropped onto the posting window for inclusion too .

9. Quickly Hide / Unhide Windows Using the Keyboard
Ubuntu can " roll up " windows to just their title bars ( known as shading ) , but the function is n't activated by default .
However , the function can be coupled to a keyboard shortcut so that you can quickly roll up a window to see what 's behind it , before unrolling it again ( for example , if you 're typing something you 've seen on a Firefox web page into a terminal window ) .
To set this up , start Keyboard Shortcuts ( System —-> Preferences ) , and scroll down to the Toggle Shaded State entry in the list .
You 'll need to use a keyboard shortcut not already in use and also one that you wo n't accidentally press .
I find Ctrl + Alt + Space works pretty well , so click in the shortcut column alongside the entry in the list , and then hit the shortcut combination ( that is , hit Ctrl + Alt + Space — - do n't type the words ! ) .
Then give it a try on the Keyboard Shortcuts window - roll it up , and then roll it down !
If you want to get rid of the shortcut , repeat the previous step to create a new shortcut combination for the entry , and hit Backspace ( not Delete ! ) .

10 .
Get a nice trash can on the desktop
By default , Ubuntu keeps the desktop clean .
I think that if your desktop is n't cluttered with icons , then you 're not human ( and may possibly be a robot ) .
To add the usual Trash , Computer , Network Servers , and other icons to the desktop , start gconf - editor ( hit Alt + F2 and type gconf - editor ) , and head to the / apps / nautilus / desktop entry in the list on the left of the program window .
Then , on the right side , put a check alongside trash_icon_visible , home_icon_visible , and so on .
The new desktop icons should appear immediately .

Fu is available from all good bookshops , or you can buy the PDF version for just $ 22 .
New digital music formats tend to increase sound quality , reduce file size , add surround sound channels or restrict via DRM .
Musinaut ’s new MXP4 format breaks the mold by re-imagining the standard , linear style of recording music in an interactive way that allows creators to pack extra beats , harmonies , genres or even artists into a single track .
Users , rather than listening to a track exactly as it was laid down , can choose between various versions in a software player or online widget .
In just one example , an artist could offer pop , rock , reggae and drum and bass versions of the same song .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The idea for Musinaut germinated when Gilles Babinet , founder of the music and ringtone distributor Musiwave , was asked by a journalist in the spring of 2006 , " What ’s the next big thing in music ? "
Musinaut CEO Trish Thomson explained , " It ’s one question he had n’t anticipated .
Sohe just blurted out , ‘ It ’ll be interactive ! ’
And then spent the planeride home trying to figure out what interactive music would really looklike . "
In the spirit of showing rather than telling , here ’s what Babinet ’s interactive music idea ended up looking like .
But the most impressive part of Musinaut ’s demonstration in our offices showed several bands covering the same song within a single MXP4 file , with the listener able to select which one plays .
Here ’s some audio I recorded from the meeting that demonstrates the concept by transitioning between several different bands covering the Beatles ’ " Come Together " as a potential cross-promotional opportunity for indie bands :
Although MXP4 files are free to listen to on the web or through the software , Musinaut MXP4 Creator will cost $ 400 but is free to use until December 31 .
The basic idea ( screenshots below ) is that the creator drags and drops segments of music into the software , picks the possible transition points , and then assigns a sequence and sets a probability that dictate which section gets played next .
Or , a song can be set up so that the user selects which section plays .
According to Charlotte from the Belgian band Soldout , whose French label contact was an early employee of the company , it ’s actually quite easy to use despite its apparent complexity .
" For us , it did n’t look so complicated because we work mostly in electronic music and we ’re pretty used ( it ) .
I thought it was really fun , and it matched my opinion on the music , because when we finish a song , we never think it ’s perfect .
We like to have different versions of our songs .
When we are in the studio , we have to choose , in the end , what we put on our CD .
But it ’s really nice to be able to use the things you like and you could n’t put on the CD . "
According to Musinaut ’s vice president of business development Mark Collins , former owner of the Mercury Club in Austin , Texas , artists can use MXP4 Creator to mine their archives for something new to present to fans , in addition to creating new works within the software .
" How many different versions or various tracks never get used ? " he asked .
" They end up deciding on one version for whatever reason , whether they think it ’s the most commercial or it ’s the one that they like the best . "
MXP4 allows them to release all of the versions within the same file .
" Just from a composition level it really opens things up , " he added .
" And it can also open you up to a wider audience , " because a rock oriented band could present their song as electronica , and so on .
Collins claims that hip hop mixtapes are particularly well suited to the MXP4 format .
" I think that this software is going to change the mixtape and the mash - up forever , " he said .
" Both of those formats are already very popular , and generate a lot of buzz .
Imagine if you had a mixtape ( in the hip hop sense ) that ’s always changing — seven different versions of the instrumental track and six different MCs that have their own version .
They could be completely different lyrics based on the same themes , then you can embed various hooks and harmonies , ( so that ) the mixtape is constantly mixing — kind of like recreating what a DJ can do live . "
Here ’s what the free downloadable version of the MXP4 player looks like ( as opposed to the online widget ) :
Although the MXP4 Creator was designed to be used with other digitalaudio workstations ( DAWs ) , you can record straight into the program , ifyou so desire .
Here ’s where you record and select the patterns ( effects included ) :
You can set up pattern , skin and soundbyte transitions here .
The numbers ( 0 - 100 ) control the probability of each option occurring :
The patterns section lets you keep tabs on what ’s going on in each skin :

Our commenter gracielynn has pointed out on one of our threads :
The one thing that I noticed that was prevalent with the John McCain debate is that he did use a lot of wrong words and word substitution .
This is upsetting because he not only is elderly but this is also unfortunately one of the first signs that Alzheimer ’s disease may be approaching .
If you watch the debate you can see he was struggling with dialogue and word choice
That made me take a closer look .
Then there was the NYT front page , discussing the health records of the candidates .
I could n’t agree more with that article .
And then there are instances like this :
and this :
And more , of course .
You just head to “ Youtube ” and search for “ McCain confused ” and you ’ll find a collection there .
Now .
I am not a doctor and I can and will not judge John McCain ’s health from rumours and “ Youtube ” clips .
There is just the fact that many people have similar concerns as gracielynn and McCain ’s choice for running mate augments apprehension in some .
As a whole I ’ve seen 72 year olds who would have crumbled when put under the stress of a presidential campaign .
By this standard John McCain holds up remarkably well .
But the office of POTUS in these times of constant crisis will be even more tasking .
And it is one thing to succumb to confusion , disorientation and judgmental error in a campaign .
It is a whole different matter when the man confused , disoriented and misjudging is the POTUS in a crisis .
For the record .
You can find the early symptoms of Alzheimer ’s disease here and more possible explanations for similar symptoms here .
John McCain and the other three candidates need to make their health records public before the election .
To know about the physical and psychological condition of a President or potential President is one of the facts that are needed to make an informed choice before voting .

A British Broadcasting Corporation
News broadcast showing speed camera traps causing crashes has now been made public .
The April 21 BBC report was meant to highlight government efforts as part of a European “ crackdown on speeding ” using video excerpts from the Norfolk Speed Camera Partnership .
The excerpts unintentionally showcased motorists ’ panic when surprised by a “ talivan ” operating from a freeway overpass .
“ He jams on his brakes when he sees the speed truck , ” BBC News reporter Mike Cartwright said in describing an October 3 , 2005 incident .
“ He smacks into the barrier and amazingly slides in between those two cars there and nobody was hurt — a very lucky escape indeed for all the drivers involved in that . ”
A second video taken June 18 , 2007 shows a vehicle surprised by a speed camera on a wet road .
“ And the same thing here , ” Cartwright said .
“ The guy jams on his brakes and he goes up the embankment . ”
Shortly after the news program aired , the BBC removed all copies of the footage from its website .
Motorist Keith Jones enlisted the help of the Association of British Drivers to urge the BBC , the Norfolk Speed Camera Partnership and the UK Information Commissioner to release the publicly funded tapes under open records laws .
The government authorities refused to do so , citing “ technical difficulties . ”
Speaking of which …
A UK Department for Transport - funded report suggests that the panic braking seen in the Norfolk footage may not be an uncommon response .
A study of speed camera usage in 29 highway construction zone projects over 450 miles of road from November 2001 to July 2003 showed that accidents increased by 55 percent in the locations where speed camera vans were used .
The DfT unsuccessfully attempted to prevent publication of the report .
Diageo , the world ’s leading spirits , beer and wine company , and The Hotline , the leading daily news briefing on American politics , have teamed up to bring you the Diageo / Hotline Poll .
The poll is conducted monthly by Financial Dynamics , a specialist communications consultancy , focusing public opinion research on important national issues to inform and stimulate debate .
An increasing majority of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction and disapprove of President Bush ’s job performance , citing his handling of Iraq and economic policy as the top reasons .
The number of Republicans who see the country heading in the wrong direction has spiked to an all - time high , and the number of Republicans “ strongly ” approving of Bush ’s job has dropped to an all - time low .
Americans across the political spectrum want new leaders to represent both political parties , with strong interest in Condoleezza Rice , John McCain , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
McCain wins the hypothetical two - way presidential match - up against Clinton , and he would beat nominees from both parties if he were to run as an Independent .
The latest Diageo / Hotline Poll of 700 registered voters , with an oversample of 100 registered Republicans , conducted by Financial Dynamics with analysis by Ed Reilly ( D ) and Ed Rollins ( R ) , found 66 % of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction , a six - point jump since last month .
Meanwhile , 41 % of Republicans say the country is headed in the wrong direction , a 12 - point spike since last month .
Bush ’s job approval among voters remains virtually unchanged at 39 % approval and 59 % disapproval .
When asked why they disapprove of Bush ’s job performance , the most common reasons are the Iraq War
and economic policies ( 31 % and 23 % ) , while recent issues like Hurricane Katrina and judicial nominations are less commonly cited ( 16 % and 9 % ) .
Among Republicans , the Iraq War was also the top reason for disapproving of Bush ’s job performance ( 34 % ) .
When Republicans are asked what is the most important issue facing America today , 10 % cite their opposition to the Iraq War – more than double the four percent who volunteered their opposition to the same question last month .
Republicans “ strongly ” approving of Bush ’s job has dropped to 37 % , down eight points since last month and the lowest rating in the past year .
In a hypothetical presidential race , voters prefer McCain to Clinton by 52 % to 39 % – with 23 % of Democrats saying they would vote for McCain .
In general , 14 % of Democrats say they would be “ very likely ” to vote for McCain if he runs for president in 2008 .
Many Americans say they would support McCain as the Republican nominee or an Independent candidate , and a majority say his party affiliation would not make a difference .
If McCain were to run as an independent against Clinton and Jeb Bush as the Republican nominee , 40 % of Americans would vote for McCain , compared to 34 % for Clinton and 18 % for Bush .
Republican strategist Ed Rollins said , “ According to these numbers , the GOP needs John McCain more than McCain needs the GOP . ”
GOP defections buffet McCain as end draws near
Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close GOP defections buffet McCain as end draws near 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Republican nominee John McCain heads into the final week of a historic presidential election beset by a wave of high - profile GOP defections and the second - guessing and recriminations from ostensibly friendly quarters that losing campaigns attract like flies .
McCain still could pull out an upset on a last - minute wave of voter hesitation about Obama , much like Hillary Rodham Clinton came back in New Hampshire after the polls counted her out , but political professionals are putting their bets on McCain going back to Phoenix , not rising like one .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell 's broadside on Sunday was only the first of the recent GOP defections .
The latest arrived Friday from former Republican Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts , who had endorsed former Gov. Mitt Romney over McCain in the GOP primary .
Now Weld endorses Obama , calling the Democrat " a once - in - a - lifetime candidate who will transform our politics and restore America 's standing in the world . "
On Thursday , former Republican Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota endorsed Obama and ripped McCain in an essay for the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Carlson said he saw in the Democrat " a remarkably disciplined and focused leader who has the potential to become a truly great president . "
Just as striking as the tone of the GOP endorsements for Obama was the noticeable chill coming from the state parties in such McCain must - win states as Virginia and Florida .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , whom McCain considered and rejected as his running mate , said he had not appeared in any McCain ads because he was n't asked .
Reports aired that the state GOP is saving some of its war chest for the next election cycle .
Similar tensions between the McCain campaign and the state party have surfaced in Virginia .
Former Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Ridge , also rejected for the vice presidential slot , offered that McCain 's chances in his state would have been better if he had been on the ticket .
" I think we'd be foolish not to admit it publicly , " Ridge said .
Pennsylvania is key
Ridge also predicted that whoever wins Pennsylvania will win the presidency .
McCain is pinning his hopes on winning Pennsylvania 's 21 electoral votes , his last shot at offsetting a string of potential losses in states that President Bush won in 2004 .
Democratic nominee John Kerry won Pennsylvania in 2004 , and a raft of polls give Obama a double - digit lead .
The McCain campaign has " virtually surrendered 21 electoral votes in New Mexico , Colorado and Iowa that were won by Bush , there 's no Kerry state he 's winning , and Bush won by 16 electoral votes , " said Pennsylvania pollster G. Terry Madonna , director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College .
" A third - grader can figure this out .
They 've decided that it 's 21 electoral votes in PA or it's over . "
A look at other Bush states shows the difficulties .
McCain is either badly behind or struggling all over the Electoral College map , where he needs 270 votes to win .
His own campaign has written off Iowa and New Mexico and is pessimistic about Colorado , Nevada and Virginia .
Obama is leading strongly in Ohio and more narrowly in Missouri .
Even solidly Republican states such as Indiana and North Carolina where McCain had comfortable leads a month ago are now toss - ups .
In the Electoral College prize of Florida , with 27 votes , McCain has slipped from a five - point lead in mid-September to a small edge for Obama .
Pennsylvania " has an electorate that is older , conservative , blue - collar , Catholic , Hillary voters , Reagan Democrats , " Madonna said .
" They picked it .
Why ?
Because they 're out of options .
They 've not only rolled the dice ; it 's the only game in town . "
Still , if McCain can win in Pennsylvania , Ohio and Florida , Obama would need a complete sweep of Western states without capturing either Virginia or Missouri .
Taking nothing for granted
That 's why the Obama campaign is taking nothing for granted .
" We understand that 11 days is a long time , and we 're not going to get overly concerned about any polls , whether they be national or state , " Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said .
" Our orientation here is that the presidency will be decided in these battleground states .
We 've always believed that these battleground states would be close , and we 're going to run through the tape as hard as we can . "
He also dismissed the notion that undecided voters might move at the last minute to give McCain an upset either nationally or in hard - fought states .
Plouffe cited Obama 's high favorable ratings and heavy early voting by Democrats .
" I 'm sure Sen . McCain will get his share of them , " Plouffe said , " but the notion that somehow these late undecideds are going to break in a disproportionate way , we just do n't see that . "
A flood of critiques and epithets flowed from inside the GOP tent , tracing much the same arc as the inside commentary on Clinton 's campaign when she struggled through the primaries last winter .
McCain joined the recrimination game himself with an all - out attack on the Bush administration published in the Washington Times newspaper on Thursday .
In it , McCain accused Bush of a litany of failures in a last - minute attempt to yank himself away from a president whose popularity has fallen below President Richard Nixon 's on the day he resigned .
McCain hit the same themes at campaign stops Friday , following up on his line in the last debate when he told Obama that if he had wanted to run against Bush , he should have run in 2004 .
The line arrived late , however , and did little to stop independents from gelling around Obama through the three debates .
McCain has tried , as Clinton did , to hit Obama 's weaknesses that show up in polling , mainly experience and trust , but has failed to land any measurable body blows .
His campaign also has come under attack for being too tactical , lurching from one impulsive move to another , from picking untested Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate to reacting to the financial crisis by threatening to pull out of the second debate .
Serious concerns
" There are still serious concerns about Obama , " Madonna said .
" There 's still the issue of race , there 's still the issue of experience , there 's still the issue of character , there 's still the issue of values ... but I think voters have generally now reached the conclusion that they can trust Obama with the White House . "
McCain is also at a serious financial disadvantage with just $ 25 million left in the bank to Obama 's $ 66 million .
A new analysis by the Nielsen television rating company of seven swing states - Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Missouri , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Virginia - showed Obama outpacing McCain advertising by 150 percent between Oct. 6 and Oct. 22 . Obama ran 53,049 advertisements to 21,106 for McCain .
Even with flawless campaigning , which almost no one inside or outside the campaign thinks it is , McCain would face daunting odds : a widely disliked two - term incumbent of his own party , a soured economy magnified by a historic financial crisis , an unpopular war and a surly mood across the land .
" There is no precedent in modern history " for a candidate winning under such conditions , Madonna said .
" You ca n't show me a time . "
