You ’ve probably had escargots .
Delicious , aromatic , filled with garlic , perhaps complemented by a nice glass of Pinot Gris .
What many people do n’t know is that American garden snails and escargots are nearly the same thing ( different species , same genus ) , and taste similar .
If you really want to eat local , take that small mental leap and turn garden pests into haute cuisine .
Here ’s how to do it .
Foraged Escargot - Stuffed Mushrooms
20 snails ( the larger the better )
5 cloves garlic , minced
1/2 bottle white wine
1/2 pound butter
1/2 cup shallots , minced
5 springs thyme ( mince leaves of two sprigs and leave the others whole )
2 ribs celery , minced
Handful parsley , minced
1. Collection
Snails are nocturnal , best collected at either dawn or dusk .
Since the only thing I get up at dawn for is seaweed collecting ( more on that in another post ) , I go at dusk .
Use a plastic container with a secure lid , or they will escape when you ’re not looking .
Punch some small air holes in the top .
Collect at least 20 snails , or it ’s not really worth it .
2. Cleaning
You ’ll need to cleanse their system before cooking in case they ate something bad , like snail bait .
This process is similar to purging mussels .
I feed them a mixture of wild fennel and cornmeal , some people use lettuce , some use cucumber , and some starve them for their last days ( which has always struck me as a bit mean ) .
House them in a large container with holes punched out of the top .
Put in their food , a small dish of water with a low lid ( so they can get in ) , and secure the top of the container tightly ( I can not stress this enough , as they will push off a loose lid , and you do n’t want to be stepping on snails in your socks . )
Wait 1 - 2 weeks , cleaning out the container about once a day .
3. Cooking
First , and most traumatic , bring a pot of well - salted water to a boil , place the snails in a strainer smaller than the width of the pot ( a chinoise if you have one ) , and dunk the snails for about a minute .
Transfer the snails to an ice bath , cool , them remove the snails from their shells .
This will be either very easy or slightly hard , depending on the size of snail .
Smaller shells tend to break , but if that happens you can just wash off the shell pieces .
Take a small fork ( the pros use an “ escargot fork , ” but I imagine you do n’t have one of those ) , stick the fork into the open end of the snail , and pull .
It ’s that easy .
Rinse the snails in cold water to get off any persistent shell pieces .
4 . More cooking
Melt 1/ 2 stick butter over low - medium heat in a medium sauté pan ; add half of minced garlic , and lightly sauté until aromatic ( you are n’t trying to brown the garlic here ) .
Pour in the white wine ; add wine , salt , thyme , pepper , and enough water so the snails will be completely submerged .
Bring to a boil , add snails , and then reduce to a low simmer .
Cover and let cook for one hour , checking periodically to make sure all your water has n’t evaporated too much .
4 . Stuff them into mushrooms
At this point you have what you would have bought in the store , if you purchased escargots .
To turn them into a fussier appetizer , preheat the oven to 400° .
Clean the crimini mushrooms with a damp paper towel , remove and chop the stems .
Chop the snails into small pieces , melt 1 / 2 lb butter over low - medium heat , add garlic and shallots to pan , and sweat ( cook without browning ) .
Once the vegetables become aromatic and lose some of their color , add the snails , mushroom stems , thyme , tarragon , celery , celery , and parsley , turn heat up to medium , and sauté for 10 minutes , being careful not to burn the garlic and shallots .
Coat each cap with butter , fill with snail mixture , and bake for 10 minutes .
5. Eat
Serve on crostini , preferably dining in the garden where you collected the snails .

LAST March , after Mexican officials took offence at warnings from their American counterparts about security south of the border , Hillary Clinton travelled to Mexico City to repair the diplomatic damage .
The secretary of state accepted blame for her country 's demand for illegal drugs , recognised its need to control the southward flow of guns and cash , and vowed that the United States would be an equal partner in the “ war ” against drug gangs and organised crime declared by Mexico 's president , Felipe Calderón .
Some of those promises have been kept , in a modest way : over the past year , Barack Obama 's administration has seized a little bit more drug money , begun to search southbound freight trains , examined its budget for trying to cut drug demand and raised it by 13 % , and shared intelligence that led to the finding ( and death ) of a top drug trafficker .
But the drug “ war ” in Mexico has intensified , with 6,600 killings last year , up from 5,800 in 2008 .
This year has started badly .
In the border city of Ciudad Juárez , 555 people have already died in 2010 , compared with 449 in the first quarter of 2009 .
The violence is starting to strike innocents .
In January 16 teenagers at a party were massacred in Juárez .
Two students at Monterrey 's Technological Institute were killed in crossfire this month ; afterwards the traffickers organised roadblocks of stolen and torched vehicles , causing chaos in the city , Mexico 's industrial capital .
In Reynosa the Gulf “ cartel ” and its former armed wing , the Zetas , concealed their violent split for weeks by threatening local journalists , killing one .
Residents were reduced to finding out about the gun battles they heard nearby on Facebook and Twitter .
On March 13th the traffickers broke a taboo against taking on the United States .
In simultaneous drive - by shootings , gunmen killed a visa worker at the American consulate in Juárez , along with her husband and that of another employee there .
Faced with such a grim panorama , this week Mrs Clinton returned to Mexico City , accompanied by the entire American national - security team .
She reiterated many of the same arguments .
But this time both sides wanted more than soothing rhetoric .
After three years of throwing some 50,000 troops against the drug gangs , Mr Calderón is now trying to broaden his strategy .
In tandem with American officials , his government has announced a new plan to fight organised crime .
This will be enacted in pilot programmes in Juárez and Tijuana , the two biggest border cities .
It includes customised attempts to dismantle each gang through intelligence ; spending on social development in violent areas ; and a promise to speed up a glacial effort to overhaul police forces and the courts .
All of this will require far greater teamwork with the United States .
American officials say that the new plan calls for more intelligence sharing , with “ fusion centres ” where American agents are embedded with Mexican analysts .
American police will step up training and vetting of their counterparts .
To try to prevent security worries clogging cross - border trade , American customs officials may be posted throughout Mexico .
“ Secure corridors ” would be set up where goods could be tracked to the border .
Mrs Clinton announced that the Mérida Initiative , a $ 1.3 billion anti-drug aid effort for Mexico involving hardware and training , will be followed by $ 331 m for social programmes and to strengthen the courts .
In the past this closer American involvement would have prompted Mexican outrage over the violation of its sovereignty .
The mood is changing .
In the run-up to Mrs Clinton 's visit both Mexico 's ambassador to the United States and the general in charge of its defence college declared that the country needed international help to win the drug war .
“ It was unprecedented for a high - level member of the Mexican army to say that , ” says Denise Dresser , a political scientist at ITAM , a Mexico City university .
“ But the situation has gotten so bad that you 're starting to see a wearing down of that reflexive , historical anti-Americanism . ”
Yet compared with the $ 18 billion - 39 billion that the drug gangs are officially estimated to send south each year , American aid to Mexico remains small .
And only $ 128 m of the money promised under the Mérida Initiative , signed in 2008 , has been disbursed .
American officials point to the relative success of Plan Colombia , a much bigger aid programme , in reducing drug - related violence in that country .
But Mexico poses some unique difficulties .
It is bigger and richer but more decentralised , with weaker police forces and courts .
Colombia has let several hundred American military advisers operate in its territory .
Some of the training of Mexicans takes place in the United States .
Mexican officials refuse to put American agents in operational roles .
“ That takes a lot of options off the table , ” says Scott Stewart of Stratfor , an intelligence consultancy .
“ There 's only so much you can do in the classroom instead of out on the streets . ”
And the Obama administration has ruled out seeking a new ban on the sale of assault weapons in American gunshops — the main source of the mobsters ' weaponry .
The new strategy looks more promising , but as always success will depend on implementation .
Polls suggest that Mexicans ' previous support for Mr Calderón 's crusade against the drug gangs is wearing thin .
In one recent poll only 21 % of respondents said that it had made the country safer , whereas half thought it had heightened the danger .
Mr Calderón 's term ends in 2012 , and his successor may not be equally committed to vanquishing organised crime .
The new long - term plan will have to show some short - term results .
If you ’re like me , you were counting the hours until the new season of Doctor Who premiered .
For those of you who did watch it , did you like it ?
How did you feel about the new doctor , played by Matt Smith ?
If you are a fan , then hopefully this bit of trivia about the show and The Doctor will help hold you over until the next episode comes on .
Notable Achievements
Running on more than 30 seasons , Doctor Who is the longest - running science fiction show in the world and considered the most successful science fiction show of all time based on ratings and sales .
In fact , more than 750 episodes have been broadcast since the show started .
( Take that Star Trek . )
Even one of the top directors of all time , Steven Spielberg has said that " the world would be a poorer place without Doctor Who . ”

Spiraling Spin Offs
In addition to re-spawning the show in 2005 , the Doctor Who series has resulted in at least five attempts at television spin - offs – the most successful of which is probably Torchwood –an anagram of Doctor Who .
( On a side note , am I the only one who considers Jack Harkness , the main character of Torchwood , to have a name that 's almost too bizarrely close to my own ?
Think about it , Jill Harness & Jack Harkness ... maybe we 're name soul mates . )
Not all of the spin - offs are so good though ; there 's a very good reason K - 9 and Company , a very 80 ’s detective - like show featuring K - 9 and Sarah Jane , never made it past the pilot episode .

Regenerations That Survive The Generations
A lot of people who are familiar with the show but who do n’t actually watch it wonder how one character can be portrayed by so many different actors .
Those of you who do watch the show know that it ’s because The Doctor is a Time Lord and his race regenerates every time they should die .
Not all fans of Doctor Who know that a Time Lord is only supposed to be able to regenerate a total of 12 times though and The Doctor has so far regenerated a total of 10 times ( he ’s on his 11th body now ) .
Assuming the show continues to do well , do you think The Doctor may be able to cheat this standard Time Lord rule and regenerate more than 12 times , like his enemy The Master ?
Unsurprisingly , the ability to regenerate was developed as a means to keep the doctor alive after the first actor , William Hartnell , announced his desire to leave the show in 1966 .
In fact , regeneration was never even conceived of until they needed an excuse to keep the show going .
A recent BBC archive release stated that the team based the regeneration cycle on bad LSD trips .
The memos said the transformation was a horrifying experience , like the " hell and dank horror " associated with a bad acid dose .

Ch - Ch - Changes
After each regeneration , The Doctor looks completely different and takes on a slightly modified personality .
This is because each body is supposed to represent a different aspect of the same character .
He always maintains the same memories , but his emotions and personality will change to some extent .
Because the purpose of regeneration is partially to allow The Doctor to enjoy a new and youthful body , his character becomes younger every time he regenerates .
Fans of the show may recall how old the first Doctors were , particularly when compared with 26 year - old Matt Smith .
Matt Smith , Meet The Doctor
Funny enough , Matt Smith is still much younger than anyone on the show or the network wanted The Doctor to be .
Few people believed that a 26 year - old could adequately portray the knowledge and life - experience that helps to define The Doctor .
Even so , when he auditioned for the role on the first day , the production team , particularly head writer and producer Steven Moffat were so blown away by his acting abilities , that they immediately knew he was the one .
When they announced their decision , they stood firm behind his casting , stating , it had “ always been Matt . ”
Because Matt was so unknown at the time , the announcement of his casting led both Reuters and The Independent to announce the news as a question , their headlines proclaiming , “ Doctor Who ? ” Image via Alun.

A British Staple or A Gorefest ?
Many people , including Caitlin Moran , a reviewer for The Times , have noted that Doctor Who is “ quintessential to being British . ”
Many fans believe part of any English childhood should be spent watching Doctor Who from “ behind the sofa ” and popping your head out when the scary parts are over .
Unfortunately , it ’s these scary bits that made the show a target for morality police during the 1970’s .
Legendary campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly filed complaints with the BBC about the show ’s frightening and gory content .
Every time she complained though , it only helped to boost the show ’s rating .
It got to the point where the show ’s producer during the 80’s , John Nathan - Turner , said that he looked forward to her comments because the show ’s ratings would jump as soon as she made them .
On the other hand , Whitehouse was definitely onto something .
A BBC study in 1972 found that Doctor Who was the most violent of all dramatic programs produced by the network at the time .
Educational Intentions
Perhaps part of the reason the show survived throughout these controversies though was its noble goal of educating children and providing a family - oriented show for all ages .
The plot originally alternated historical stories and futuristic stories in an attempt to get children interested in both history and science and The Doctor ’s original companions were even a science teacher and a history teacher .
They soon started cutting back on the historical episodes though because the production team did n’t enjoy making them as much as the sci fi ones and the ratings were never as high anyway .
( Personally , I ’m a sucker for the historical episodes , but I ’m a history nerd anyway . )

Monstrous Success Stories
Another thing that always seemed to score high with the viewers were monsters , particularly the Daleks .
To some extent , the Daleks , are even more famous than The Doctor himself .
The Daleks became so popular during the 60’s that they even spawned what was known as Dalekmania , where the public would eat up anything related to the Daleks , including the 1964 board game , " Dodge The Daleks . "
The phenomenon was so major , they even made a film titled Dalekmania in 1995 that focused on the fad obsession with the aliens .
In 1964 , there was a single released by The Go - Go ’s ( not the 80 ’s girl band ) called “ I ’m Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek . ”
The Clash even referenced them in the song “ Remote Control , ” saying " Repression — gonna be a Dalek / Repression — I am a robot / Repression — I obey . "
If you think the obsession was over , then consider the 2008 study that showed 9 out of 10 British children could correctly identify a Dalek and that Daleks were featured on an English postage stamp in 1999 .
In recent years , they were even featured in two separate , unauthorized pornographic movies .
Dalek even appears in the Oxford English Dictionary , as does T.A.R.D.I.S. , and is often used as a metaphor for authoritarian people who act robotically .

The Time And Relative Dimension In Space Box
Speaking of the T.A.R.D.I.S. , it ’s another classic Doctor Who staple that ’s become more recognizable than the actual Time Lord inside of it .
If you ’re not an avid viewer of the show , you may wonder why the spaceship looks like a police box .
All T.A.R.D.I.S.s are made with a Chameleon Circuit that allows them to blend in with the surroundings it lands in .
The Doctor ’s Chameleon Circuit broke when he was in 1960 ’s Britain when the ship was in the shape of a police box .
He liked the look enough that he decided to not bother fixing the circuit .
When the BBC tried to trademark the famed blue police box in 1996 , the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the claim , arguing that they created and owned the rights to the box design .
The Patent Office has since ruled in favor of the network , pointing out that the police never trademarked the box and that they never complained about the fact that the BBC was selling merchandise with the design for more than three decades .
It ’s also worth noting that the Doctor Who police box has never actually been a faithful replica of the real boxes used by the Metropolitan Police .
The “ dimensionally transcendental ” properties ( as The Doctor says ) of the T.A.R.D.I.S. make it much larger inside than it appears to be .
While no one has ever made a map of the interior of the ship , it is quite expansive and contains living quarters , an art gallery , a greenhouse , a library , a bathroom , a swimming pool , a medical bay , a multi-storied wardrobe , storage areas , an attic and a secondary control room .
If you ’ve ever wondered why such an incredible machine is always breaking down ( aside from its age ) , then it may be beneficial for you to know that when The Doctor acquired his ship , he actually stole it from his home planet and the Type 40 T.A.R.D.I.S. he took was already unreliable and obsolete at the time .

So Is He Really A Doctor ?
People who do n’t watch the show often wonder things like , “ what kind of a doctor steals space ships and fights off alien robots ? ”
The thing is , no one actually knows if The Doctor is actually a doctor .
At times seems to have some medical knowledge and he ’s even claimed to have studied medicine , but he also has said specifically that he ’s not a physician .
When he ’s with Martha Jones , he tends to insist on her doing anything medical - related , saying , “ she ’s a doctor ; I ’m The Doctor . ”
Perhaps the person who explained it the best was his nemesis , The Master , who quipped that it was quite sanctimonious for The Doctor to label himself as " the man who makes people better . ”
Consistent Inconsistencies
It ’s not too surprising that a sci - fi show about time and space travel that ’s lasted for so long has started to build up some inconsistencies .
Fortunately , the new head writer / producer , Steven Moffat ( who also created Coupling ) , has great ways to answer all of those burning fan questions regarding the show ’s continuity problems .
One of the biggest issues with The Doctor is the matter of age .
At first the writers decided that every time he regenerated , his age should be turned back , but this only lasted through the first regeneration and since then , his age was recorded as going forward .
At times The Doctor claims to be 450 years old , 650 years old and even 906 years old .
Steven Moffat has simply explained that The Doctor does not know his own age because his non-linear existence via time travel has made this calculation impossible .
In other situations , the entire history of races , such as the Daleks , have been rewritten as time has progressed .
Steven Moffat simply explains these concerns away by noting , " a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes and the concept of changing time can't have a continuity error — it 's impossible for Doctor Who to get it wrong , because we can just say 'he changed time ' , ” Are you a fan of the show ?
And those of you who are fans , how do you feel about the spin offs and do you know any interesting trivia I did n’t mention here ?

Guest post by Steven Goddard
Scientific American has reported that global warming may cause an increase in volcanic eruptions , due to increased magma formation at lower pressures as glaciers melt .
This caught my attention because I used to work as a volcano researcher and igneous petrologist .
That report said that about 10 percent of Iceland ’s biggest ice cap , Vatnajokull , has melted since 1890 and the land nearby was rising about 25 millimetres ( 0.98 inch ) a year , bringing shifts in geological stresses .
They estimated that the thaw had led to the formation of 1.4 cubic km ( 0.3 cubic mile ) of magma deep below ground over the past century .
At high pressures such as under an ice cap , they reckon that rocks cannot expand to turn into liquid magma even if they are hot enough .
“ As the ice melts the rock can melt because the pressure decreases , ” she said .
Sigmundsson said that monitoring of the Vatnajokull volcano since 2008 suggested that the 2008 estimate for magma generation was “ probably a minimum estimate .
It can be somewhat larger . ”
Interesting theory , but does it work quantitatively ?
Magmas , as with most solids , do show a direct relationship between the melting point and pressure .
As the pressure increases , so does the melting point .
( Ice is a noticeable exception to this , and shows an inverse relationship .
The reason that people can ice skate is because the pressure under the blade creates a thin later of melted ice which lubricates the surface .
Below is a phase diagram of a basaltic magma similar to that found in Iceland , showing the relationship between temperature and pressure .
The melting temperature does decrease at lower pressures .
From 100 km depth to 0 km the melting point drops about 300°C .
That is about 3 °C / km .
Ice is about one third as dense as basaltic magma , so the loss of 1 km of ice lowers the melting point by about 1C , or less than 0.1 % .
http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/mary.rodentice/courses/petrolpresent/Ch%2010%20Magma%20Generation%20’07.pdf
More precisely , this study from the Carnegie Geophysical Institute did an empirical measurement of the relationship for one basaltic mineral – diposide .
They found the relationship to be
Tm = 1391.5 + 0.01297 * P
Where
Tm is the melting point in degrees C and P is the pressure in atmospheres .
One atmosphere pressure is equal to about 10 metres of ice , so one additional metre of ice increases the melting point by about 0.0013 °C .
The loss of 100 metres of ice would therefore lower the melting point by about one tenth of a degree .
The thickest ice in Iceland is only 500 meters thick , so complete loss of all ice would only alter the melting point by about 0.5 °C , or less than 0.05 % .
The geothermal gradient of the earth is typically about 40 °C per km , so a 0.5 °C change in temperature is equivalent to a depth change of about 20 metres .
Near mid-ocean ridges this gradient is steeper , so the equivalent depth change in Iceland would be less than 20 metres .
Is it credible that a 0.5 °C decrease in the melting point could stimulate excess volcanic activity ?
Short answer – no .
Volcanic activity is caused by magma rising to the surface , not glaciers melting .
However , the loss of the glaciers would reduce the amount of steam and ash generated .
Ash is formed when magma is cooled and fractured by steam .
So the loss of the glaciers would reduce the size of the steam / ash cloud and make the Iceland volcanoes behave more like Hawaii volcanoes .
In short , the loss of all ice in Iceland would make the volcanoes less destructive .
BTW – On Al Gore ’s planet , the geothermal gradient is much higher , with core temperatures averaging millions of degrees .

Our state 's slogan once read , " Things Look Different Here . "
Meaning
better
.
Unless we quickly reverse course , things will not look different here for much longer .
Oregon is becoming as poor , as polarized and as paralyzed as California and many other states .
And this is occurring before we fall off the cliff that is rapidly approaching -- a $ 2.5 billion state budget shortfall .
Oregon is a small state , and we do n't have sufficient leadership in any single sector -- government , business or civic -- to solve our problems .
It 's going to take a sustained , concerted effort by a coalition of business , labor , civic and political leaders who are willing to work together in a common effort to solve Oregon 's financial problems .
Creating this coalition became more difficult with the passage of Measures 66 and 67 .
But there are three things that should give us hope .
First , we have a compelling recent example of courageous business , civic and political leadership that has come together across ideological and emotional divides to forge an eastside forest policy agreement that deserves congressional approval .
Once bitter enemies , environmentalist Andy Kerr and timber operator John Shelk came together with the leadership of U.S. Sen .
Ron Wyden to solve a long - festering problem .
Both sides realized that " small victories for either side in the forest wars were often short - lived " and that they needed each other to craft a long - term solution .
( " The right time for forest restoration , " by Andy Kerr and John Shelk , March 10 . )
Second , we have an issue uniting the self - interests of business , government and community , all aligned for the good of Oregon .
That issue is post - secondary education .
Employers need from our community colleges and universities a well - educated and trained work force as well as university research that creates jobs .
Our colleges and universities need the support of the business community to foster a belief that government resources allocated to post - secondary institutions are investments that produce a return for Oregon .
We have an opportunity to create a new " education after high school " compact with Oregonians that would allow our young people to live , work and be educated in the state if we provide the colleges and universities with the operational flexibility and the resources they need to deliver .
Third , we have no other option but to overcome the bitterness and polarization that now divide us .
If we do not , our state will sink below mediocrity , and our children will not be able to enjoy the Oregon that we value .
The timber operator and the environmental advocate have set an example of how we can overcome past differences , identify mutual self - interests , build relationships across ideological divides and unite in a common effort to solve problems .
Let us follow their example by creating a world - class education after high school compact for the sake of our children and our state .

Lester Rodney was a crusader for equality and instrumental in integrating baseball as sports editor with the Daily Worker in the 1930s , says ESPN in a recent video on its website .
The Daily Worker is the predecessor to this news website , peoplesworld.org .
At the time African American players were banned from the major leagues , says the mini-documentary .
It was Lester Rodney that had a “ simple but seemingly impossible dream ” – to end more than a half - century of segregation in the big leagues , says ESPN ’s Outside The Lines program .
For Black History Month , OTL reported on this white Communist sportswriter who “ crusaded for baseball integration a decade before Jackie Robinson broke the color line . ”
He was at the center in the fight for baseballs integration , said sports historian Larry Lester in the video .
“ There was no one in the main stream press promoting the integration of baseball like Lester Rodney was , ” he said .
“ He was a soldier and the press was his sword and he was able to galvanize masses of people . ”
At age 25 Rodney was hired as the Daily Worker ’s first sports editor .
He immediately launched a relentless campaign to end the Jim Crow policy that kept baseball segregated .
Rodney could not understand why his hometown Brooklyn Dodgers would n’t sign black players like Satchel Paige , Josh Gibson or Buck Leonard , some of the best in the Negro Leagues .
Dusty Baker , who is African American and Cincinnati Reds manager said Rodney told the truth about people in a time where people did n’t want to hear it .
“ He attacked Jim Crow in words and action , ” said Baker .
Rodney , the Daily Worker and supporters led petition drives , rallies and demonstrations for baseball ’s integration .
Rodney reported about white players and managers who also admitted it was time to integrate .
In the face of skepticism Rodney persisted and millions joined the cause .
Rodney and the Daily Worker joined forces with the African American community and its daily press forging a multi-racial coalition to put pressure on the major leagues to recruit black players .
“ It seems strange that almost halfway through the 20th century that there was absolutely no stir about an apartied ban in our national past time , ” Rodney said in a 1996 interview .
The Daily Worker at the time had a circulation in the tens of thousands .
But we had an impact much larger , said Rodney in the ESPN production .
Unlike other mainstream national newspapers at the time the Daily Worker celebrated and gave voice to African American stars and the fight for equality .
Speaking about blacks fighting in World War II Rodney said , “ If a guy is good enough to go out and die for his country , he ought to be good enough to play in its national past time . ”
In 1945 at the end of the war Jackie Robinson was recruited by the Brooklyn Dodgers to play in the minor leagues and broke the color line .
He was part of the Dodgers line - up by 1947 .
Activists and readers of the People ’s World , the Daily Worker ’s predecessor , largely remember the history and fight for equality in baseball and other movements at the time as an important part of American history .
Those struggles shaped and impacted how people of all backgrounds continue to fight against racism and racial inequality in all aspects of life today , activists note .
Lester Rodney died last year at age 98 .
“ He was a dynamite dude , ” said Baker .
It really takes some nerve to do what he did back in those days and I admire him for speaking up and fighting for equality , said Baker .
Hinting that the fight for equality and challenges still exist today , Baker said people like Rodney are important when advocating for justice .
“ There ’s a good chance that we still need guys like him around today , ” he said .

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has slammed Western backers for the second time in a week , accusing the United States of interference , The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday .
In a private meeting with up to 70 Afghan lawmakers Saturday , Karzai also warned that the Taliban insurgency could become a legitimate resistance movement if foreign meddling in Afghan affairs continues , the Journal said , citing participants in the talks .
ADVERTISEMENT
During the talks , Karzai , whose government is supported by billions of dollars of Western aid and 126,000 foreign troops fighting the Taliban , said he would be compelled to join the insurgency himself if the parliament does not back his bid to take over Afghanistan ’s electoral watchdog .
His comments came less than a day after Karzai sought to defuse tensions over his earlier anti-foreigner outburst by assuring US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton he was committed to working with the United States .
Kabul and Washington said they were putting behind them the incident which saw Karzai publicly claim last week that foreigners orchestrated election fraud .
The latest remarks were sure to further erode an already fragile relationship .
During a brief , unannounced visit to Kabul on Monday , Obama urged Karzai to rid his government of its pervasive corruption .
Karzai spent a large part of two and a half hours criticizing lawmakers for rejecting his efforts to wrestle control of the country ’s Electoral Complaints Commission from the United Nations , five of the legislators who gathered at the presidential palace told the Journal .
ADVERTISEMENT
Western officials were said to be seeking the installation of a “ puppet government ” in Afghanistan , the lawmakers said .
“ He said that the only reason that the Taliban and other insurgent groups are fighting the Afghan government is that they see foreigners having the final say in everything , ” one lawmaker told the newspaper .
The lawmakers quoted Karzai as saying the Taliban ’s “ revolt will change to resistance ” if the United States and its allies keep dictating how his government should run .

A knowledge of scales is important to any musician who wishes to understand how a melody relates to chord changes .
Such knowledge will allow one to understand what scales to associate and ' work ' with different chords .
This article focuses on the modes of the major scale , and how to use them .
You can learn more in Mark Levine 's excellent manual entitled The Jazz Theory Book .
The modes of the major scale can be understood as the particular starting note of a given scale .
Major scales have seven notes , therefore there are seven modes .
For example , by playing the seven notes of the C ( do ) major scale , starting on the third note , E ( mi ) , one would in fact be playing the C ( do ) major scale in its third mode , known as E ( mi ) Phrygian .
The alterations are those of the C ( do ) major scale , but the starting note is in fact the third note of the scale .
To learn more about the origin and history of modes , I recommend this excellent Wikipedia article .
Hence , there are seven different major scales for each note .
Here is a diagram with the seven modes of the C ( do ) major scale and their corresponding chords ( click here for an audio example ) :
Chart 1
The Seven Modes of the C ( do ) Major Scale Corresponding Chord I C Ionian - Cmaj7 Cmaj7 II D Dorian - D - 7 D - 7 III E Phrygian - E - 7 E - 7 IV F Lydian - Fmaj7#4 Fmaj7 V G Mixolydian - G7 G7 VI A Aeolian - A - 7 A - 7 VII B Locrian - B half - diminished B half - diminished
The chords are created by assembling the tonic , third , fifth and seventh of each scale .
Hence , when reading a B ( si ) half - diminished chord on a chart , for example , one may play the scale of B ( si ) Locrian ( which corresponds to the scale of C [ do ] ) .
More commonly , when reading a G7 ( sol7 ) chord , one may play the scale of G ( sol ) Mixolydian ( which also corresponds to the scale of C [ do ] ) .
In this way , there are seven modes for every note in the western chromatic scale .
By learning how and when to play each of the seven modes for all twelve major scales , one will in fact have acquired a vocabulary of 84 major scales .
Other modes , such as that of the melodic minor scale , also exist , but that will be the topic of another article .
A good exercise for one who wishes to learn all seven modes is to play all of them while starting on the same note .
The following example features all seven modes starting on C ( do ) , as well as the related major scale :

The microscopic world of the single , living cell mirrors our own in so many ways : cells are essentially autonomous , sentient and ingenious .
In the lives of single cells we can perceive the roots of our own intelligence .

Molecular biology and genetics have driven the biosciences , but have not given us the miraculous new insights we were led to expect .
From professional biologists to schoolchildren , people are concentrating on the minutiae of what goes on in the deepest recesses of the cell .
For me , however , this misses out on life in the round : it is only when we look at the living cell as a whole organism that wonderful realities emerge that will alter our perception not only of how single cells enact their intricate lives but what we humans truly are .
The problem is that whole - cell biology is not popular .
Microscopy is hell - bent on increased resolution and ever higher magnification , as though we could learn more about animal behaviour by putting a bacon sandwich under lenses of increasing power .
We know much about what goes on within parts of a cell , but so much less about how whole cells conduct their lives .

Currently , cell biology deals largely with the components within cells , and systems biology with how the components interact .
There is nothing to counterbalance this reductionism with a focus on how whole cells behave .
Molecular biology and genetics are the wrong sciences to tackle the task .
Let 's take a look at some of the evidence for ingenuity and intelligence in cells that is missing from the curriculum .
Take the red algae Rhodophyta , in which many species carry out remarkable repairs to damaged cells .
Cut a filament of Antithamnion cells so the cell is cut across and the cytoplasm escapes into the surrounding aquatic medium .
All that remains are two fragments of empty , disrupted cell wall lying adjacent to , but separate from , each other .
Within 24 hours , however , the adjacent cells have made good the damage , the empty cell space has been restored to full activity , and the cell walls meticulously realigned and seamlessly repaired .

The only place where this can happen is in the lab .
In nature , the broken ends of the severed cell would nearly always end up remote from each other , so selection in favour of an automatic repair mechanism through Darwinian evolution would be impossible .
Yet something amazing is happening here : because the damage to the Antithamnion filament is unforeseeable , the organism faces a situation for which it has not been able to adapt , and is therefore unable to call upon inbuilt responses .
It has to use some sort of problem - solving ingenuity instead .
We regard amoebas as simple and crude .
Yet many types of amoeba construct glassy shells by picking up sand grains from the mud in which they live .
The typical Difflugia shell , for example , is shaped like a vase , and has a remarkable symmetry .

Compare this with the better known behaviour of a caddis fly larva .
This maggot hunts around the bottom of the pond for suitable scraps of detritus with which to construct a home .
Waterlogged wood is cemented together with pondweed until the larva has formed a protective covering for its nakedness .
You might think this comparable to the home built by the testate amoeba , yet the amoeba lacks the jaws , eyes , muscles , limbs , cement glands and brain the caddis fly larva relies on for its skills .
We just do n't know how this single - celled organism builds its shell , and molecular biology can never tell us why .
While the home of the caddis fly larva is crude and roughly assembled , that of the testate amoeba is meticulously crafted - and it's all made by a single cell .
The products of the caddis fly larva and the amoeba , and the powers of red algae , are about more than ingenuity : they pose important questions about cell intelligence .
After all , whole living cells are primarily autonomous , and carry out their daily tasks with little external mediation .
They are not subservient nanobots , they create and regulate activity , respond to current conditions and , crucially , take decisions to deal with unforeseen difficulties .

Whole living cells are not subservient nanobots , they respond and take decisions
Just how far this conceptual revolution about cells could take us becomes clearer with more complex animals , such as humans .
Here , conventional wisdom is that everything is ultimately controlled by the brain .
But cells in the liver , for example , reproduce at just the right rate to replace cells lost through attrition ; follicular cells create new hair ; bone marrow cells produce new circulating blood cells at a rate of millions per minute .
And so on and on .
In fact , around 90 per cent of this kind of cell activity is invisible to the brain , and the cells are indifferent to its actions .
The brain is an irrelevance to most somatic cells .
Advertisement
So where does that leave the neuron , the most highly evolved cell we know ?
It ought to be in an interesting and privileged place .
After all , neurons are so specialised that they have virtually abandoned division and reproduction .
Yet we model this cell as little more than an organic transistor , an on / off switch .
But if a red alga can " work out " how to solve problems , or an amoeba construct a stone home with all the " ingenuity " of a master builder , how can the human neuron be so lowly ?
Unravelling brain structure and function has come to mean understanding the interrelationship between neurons , rather than understanding the neurons themselves .
My hunch is that the brain 's power will turn out to derive from data processing within the neuron rather than activity between neurons .
And networks of neurons enhance the effect of those neurons " thinking " between themselves .
I think the neuron 's action potentials are rather like a language neurons use to transmit processed data from one to the next .
Advertisement
Back in 2004 , we set out to record these potentials , from neurons cultured in the lab .
They emit electrical signals of around 40 hertz , which sound like a buzzing , irritating noise played back as audio files .
I used some specialist software to distinguish the signal within the noise - and to produce sound from within each peak that is closer to the frequency of a human voice and therefore more revealing to the ear .
Listening to the results reprocessed at around 300 Hz , the audio files have the hypnotic quality of sea birds calling .
There is a sense that each spike is modulated subtly within itself , and it sounds as if there are discrete signals in which one neuron in some sense " addresses " another .
Could we be eavesdropping on the language of the brain ?
Advertisement
For me , the brain is not a supercomputer in which the neurons are transistors ; rather it is as if each individual neuron is itself a computer , and the brain a vast community of microscopic computers .
But even this model is probably too simplistic since the neuron processes data flexibly and on disparate levels , and is therefore far superior to any digital system .
If I am right , the human brain may be a trillion times more capable than we imagine , and " artificial intelligence " a grandiose misnomer .
I think it is time to acknowledge fully that living cells make us what we are , and to abandon reductionist thinking in favour of the study of whole cells .
Reductionism has us peering ever closer at the fibres in the paper of a musical score , and analysing the printer 's ink .
I want us to experience the symphony .

This post by Brian J. Ford originally appeared at New Scientist .
While catching up on my news I discovered Sarah “ dumb as a rock ” Palin was at it again .
She was flapping her gums at the president this time , making foolish and nonsensical statements so reflective of her empty head .
I found this little gem buried in The Huffington Post :
Sarah Palin criticized President Barack Obama on Saturday for saying America is a military superpower “ whether we like it or not , ” saying she was taken aback by his comment .
“ I would hope that our leaders in Washington , D.C. , understand we like to be a dominant superpower , ” the former Alaska governor said .
“ I do n’t understand a world view where we have to question whether we like it or not that America is powerful . ”
Obama said earlier this week that the United States must do its best to resolve conflicts around the world before they grow too serious .
“ It is a vital national security interest of the United States to reduce these conflicts because whether we like it or not , we remain a dominant military superpower , and when conflicts break out , one way or another we get pulled into them , ” Obama said .
“ And that ends up costing us significantly in terms of both blood and treasure . ”
Palin ’s remarks came in a question - and - answer session after a speech at an event in the central Illinois town of Washington to raise money for scholarships and a community center .
She spoke to a crowd of about 1,100 .
The Republican criticized Obama throughout her speech – for a healthcare overhaul that she says wo n’t work , for the increase in the national deficit and for disagreeing with Israeli policies .
Palin said she hopes the November elections will produce winners who believe in limited government and encouraging free enterprise .
She also poked fun at the controversy over the requirements listed in a contract for her speech at a California university .
Palin thanked the organizers of Saturday ’s event for providing a straw for her water bottle – “ the bent kind , which I just read in the media that I supposedly insist upon . ”
Last October the number of photographs hosted on Flickr.com passed the four billion mark .
By the time you 've finished reading this column , several thousand more will have been uploaded to the site , each automatically resized and allocated its own unique URL for copying and pasting into emails , text messages and blog posts .
Flickr has become the world 's shoebox , a place where anyone can store their pictures , or put on an exhibition .
This is good news for most of us , but it is driving professional photographers to share the slough of despond with the increasing number of print journalists who likewise feel that their occupational world is being torn apart by technology .
Last week , the New York Times carried an elegiac piece about the plight of professional snappers under the headline " For Photographers , the Image of a Shrinking Path " .
Human interest was provided by the contrast between a young graduate of a photojournalism course , who sees his career options vaporising , and a 40 - year - old mother of six who uploads her digital pictures to Flickr from which some of them are licensed by the stock - photography agency Getty Images for a few bucks a time .
Because Flickr is so prominent , it 'll get most of the blame for the destruction of yet another venerable profession .
But in fact the rot had set in long before the site launched in February 2004 .
The main culprit was the idiot - proof digital camera , which enabled almost anyone to take a decent photograph , or at any rate one that was accurately exposed , in focus and sharp — and to delete it and try again if it had n't turned out right .
Digital cameras had a powerful " levelling - up " impact on amateur photography .
Once upon a time , only professionals could consistently deliver images that were technically excellent .
And even then , analogue technology often let them down .
I 've just been looking through a book of Henri Cartier - Bresson 's collected portraits , for example .
Out of 94 images , only 66 approach contemporary standards of sharpness and focus .
That does n't mean that most of them are n't memorable pictures ; but it does illustrate how digital technology has levelled the playing field .
Professional photography comes in various genres , each of which is being affected in different ways by changing technology .
At the top end lies photojournalism and fashion photography .
These are being undermined by the decline in print media , the rise of video and the advertising recession , and may or may not recover depending on what happens to the print publishing business .
Lower down the artistic scale we find the bread - and - butter of professional photography : routine capture of low - profile news events , product photography , pre-shot stock photography and other kinds of humdrum stuff .
All of these businesses are being undermined by Flickr and its ilk .
" Let 's say that 20 years ago , " writes one industry blogger , " a newspaper in New York was running a story about Hollywood and the editor wanted a picture of the Hollywood sign .
Rather than fly one of their photographers out there , put him up in a hotel , and pay for his meals they would go to a company that specialised in stock photography .
They would pay the company a fee for the licence to use their photo in the story and everyone is happy " .
And now ?
" The newspaper can log on to a site like Flickr , find an image they like , and run it in their paper for free with just giving the owner credit ( unless the licence is non-commercial ) .
So now you have a happy editor who saved more money and a happy photographer getting exposure for his work .
But you also have an unhappy stock photography business owner who has just been cut out of the deal . "
What 's happening to professional photography is just one instance of " the mass amateurisation of publishing " , to use a phrase coined by the cultural critic Clay Shirky , who has no time for elegies for vanishing worlds .
He sees our current angst as just the latest instalment of a reaction that 's been going on since Gutenberg upended the apple - cart .
" Most of the arguments made against the printing press were correct , even prescient , " he says .
" Readily available translations of scripture did destroy the Church as a pan-European institution .
Most of the material produced by the new class of publishers was flyweight .
Scribes did lose their social function .
And so on . "
Something similar is happening now , Shirky claims .
The internet , like printing before it , is producing " a staggering volume of new material , some good but most flyweight .
It too is upending the role of traditional gatekeepers and destroying the older economics of scarcity .
And it too is leading to a cottage industry of hand - wringing : ' Why ca n't we just get a little bit of internet , but keep most things the way they were ? ' "
Why indeed ?
Trouble is : nostalgia , like photography , ai n't what it used to be .
At ‘ Kill the Bill ’ Rally , Republicans Worry That Pelosi Might Have the Votes
Created : March 16 , 2010 12:55 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
During and after a pair of anti-health care bill rallies on Capitol Hill , I asked a few Republican members of the House — two of whom went on stage — whether they thought the Tea Parties would win out and stop the bill .
“ [ Rep . ]
Bart Stupak [ D - Mich ] ” says he has twelve ‘ no ’ votes , ” said Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) , who spoke at a 10 a.m. rally organized by multiple Tea Party groups .
“ I can count one — Bart Stupak .
I ca n’t name number two .
There ’s eleven anonymous people and you ca n’t count anonymous votes .
If you ca n’t count them , they ’re not no votes .
I think that ’s something that should have been pressed much , much harder . ”
At the rally , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) informed Tea Partiers they had “ won every inning ” of the health care fight and were in the “ bottom of the ninth . ”
After her speech , she made it clear to reporters : “ I think it ’s a flip of a coin right now whether it will pass or not . ”
Rep. Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) acknowledged — based on the history of such tough votes — that more Democrats might vote “ aye ” than were being counted in public “ whip counts . ”
He was hopeful that pro-life Democratic holdouts would be convinced by the argument that “ this will be the biggest expansion of abortion since Roe. v. Wade . ”
But he was also looking past the vote to his home state , where Republicans are looking at legislation to opt out of a health care mandate .
The most confidence I heard came from Rep. Paul Broun ( R - Ga. ) , who said that he ’d “ heard of ” Democrats being fed false information about what could be fixed in reconciliation .
“ I know they do n’t have the votes right now , ” said Broun .
“ As soon as Nancy Pelosi has 216 votes , we ’ll have the vote , even if it ’s in the middle of the night . ”
King , however , expressed more nervousness .
“ I ’d rather serve in the minority , ” said King , “ however long they send me back here to do that , that I would live under this socialism that they ’re trying to impose upon us .
I ca n’t sleep at night . ”

METHODOLOGY
The figures profiled here include money from two sources :
These contributors were either the sponsors of a PAC that gave to the politician , or they were listed as an individual donor 's employer .
Donors who give more than $ 200 to any federal candidate , PAC or party committee must list their occupation and employer .
Based on that information , the donor is given an economic code .
These totals are conservative , as not all of the individual contributions have yet been classified by the Center .
In cases where two or more people from the same family contributed , the income - earner 's occupation / employer is assigned to all non -wage earning family members .
If , for instance , Henry Jones lists his employer as First National Bank , his wife Matilda lists " Homemaker " and 12 - year old Tammy shows up as " Student , " the Center would identify all their contributions as being related to the " First National Bank " since that 's the source of the family 's income .
Although individual contributions are generally categorized based on the donor 's occupation / employer , in some cases individuals may be classified instead as ideological donors .
A contribution to a candidate may be given an ideological code , rather than an economic code , if the contributor gives to an ideological political action committee AND the candidate has received money from PACs representing that same ideological interest .
NOTE : All the numbers on this page are for the 2005 - 2010 Senate election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data available electronically on September 21 , 2020 .
( " Help !
The numbers do n't add up ... " )
WHY DON'T THE NUMBERS ADD UP ?
Sometimes it's hard to make apple - to - apple comparisons across some of the pages in a candidate 's profile .
Here 's why : Summary numbers - specifically " Total Raised and Spent " and " PAC / Individual Split " - are based on summary reports filed by the candidates with the Federal Election Commission .
All other numbers in these profiles ( " Quality of Disclosure , " " Geography " and " Special Interests " ) are derived from detailed FEC reports that itemize all contributions of $ 200 or more .
There is also a time lag in posting the information .
While summary numbers are reported almost immediately by the FEC -- and listed quickly on OpenSecrets -- processing and analyzing the detailed records takes much longer .
For that reason , summary numbers are usually higher ( and more current ) than the numbers based on detailed records .
HOW CURRENT ARE THESE FIGURES ?
The figures in these profiles are taken from databases uploaded by the FEC to the internet on the first day of every month .
Those databases are only as current as the FEC has been able to compile by that date ( see the note above about lag times for data entry ) .
The Center updates figures for " Total Raised and Spent " and for " PAC / Individual Split " a few days after the first of the month .
The remaining figures - based on detailed contribution data - is updated by the Center after the 20th of every month .
This gives us time to analyze the contributions and categorize them by industry and interest group .

The vintage Commodore 64 personal computer is getting a makeover , with a new design and some of the latest computing technologies , as the brand gets primed for a comeback .
The Commodore 64 was a home computer running on an 8 - bit processor released by Commodore International in 1982 .
The computer was one of the most popular models of all time , selling close to 17 million units between 1982 and 1994 , according to the Computer History Museum .
The revamped computer will be available through the Commodore USA online store , which is set to open June 1 , according to the company 's Web site .
The computer will be an all - in - one keyboard , with Intel 's 64 - bit quad - core microprocessors and 3D graphics capabilities , according to the site .
To conform with the times , the PC also offers up to 500GB of hard drive storage and 4GB of RAM .
Also included are a DVD - RW drive , a touchpad , four USB ports , a Gigabit Ethernet port and a DVI ( Digital Visual Interface ) port to connect monitors .
No price information was given on the Web site .
Commodore USA is a new company that has licensed the Commodore name from Commodore Gaming , which makes games for PCs and consoles .
The PC company is trying to invoke the glory of the Commodore 64's past to promote the new PC .
On its Web site , the company shows an image of the old Commodore 64 with the caption " you loved us then , " and then an image of the new PC , with the caption " you 'll love us again . "
The device is small , measuring 17.5 inches ( 0.44 meters ) wide and 2 inches ( 0.05 meters ) tall , Commodore said .
" It 's designed to take up far less room -- and use far less energy -- than any other desktop computer , " Commodore USA said .
The PC will run the Linux , Windows and Mac OS X operating systems .
But will it find buyers ?
The glorious past of Commodore PCs might not be repeated for its successor , said Roger Kay , president of Endpoint Technologies Associates .
" It 's a weird legacy thing with modern inerts , " Kay said .
Commodore PCs had a heavy following in the 1980s among hobbyists , but the glory days may not translate to better sales with price - conscious customers today , Kay said .
Commodore started selling Commodore 64 in 1982 for US$ 599 and managed to reduce the price to $ 199 over time , a revolutionary price then , said Jack Tramiel , former chairman of Commodore International , during a panel discussion in late 2007 .
During the same panel , Apple co-founders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs approached Commodore with an Apple II prototype , which was much more advanced in color , graphics , sound and games .
Apple at the time did n't have the money to make and sell the Apple II , and was hoping Commodore would push the design to market .
Commodore , however , preferred to develop the Commodore 64 as a simpler , lower - cost , black - and - white - only machine .
Commodore wanted to serve the " masses , " not the " classes , " Tramiel said during the discussion .
Commodore kept updating the original Commodore 64 design and became the first to sell more than a million PCs , but the company filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and liquidated its assets .
In the meanwhile , Apple managed to survive , and the Apple II became one of the most recognized computers in the 1980s .
Commodore computers were made for enthusiasts and came with fairly arcane software and hardware elements , Kay said .
Kay bypassed a Commodore and bought an Apple II in the early 1980s , as it had software that made the computer easier to use .
" It was n't so easy [ to use a Commodore ] , the way Apple always understood the experience should be , " Kay said .
That made the Apple II computer better for new users entering the computer market .
The Boxer - Isakson " Israel Support Letter " [ .pdf ] addressed to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and currently signed by 76 senators [ . pdf ] answers a question no one needed to ask : Does the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) have the support of the United States Senate ?
However , unlike the proverbial napkin former AIPAC bigwig Steven Rosen boasted that he could have signed by 70 senators within 24 hours , this particular piece of paper contains a slew of Likud talking points , few of which are supported by reality .
Some read an implicit rebuke of the Obama administration in the letter for the administration ’s alleged spat with Israel , though despite the new conventional wisdom that there ’s a major schism between the two , it would be hard to point to on - the - record words or actions taken by the Obama administration that translate into substantive criticism of Israeli policies .
The letter states , " Despite your [ Clinton ’s ] best efforts , Israeli - Palestinian negotiations have been frozen for over a year . "
If Clinton were truly making her best efforts to restart the peace process , she would wield the considerable U.S. leverage of aid to tiny Israel in order to rein in their increasingly extreme activities that violate even their own lukewarm prior commitments .
One commitment , the so - called settlement freeze , involves the seemingly self - evident notion that if you are serious about good - faith negotiations over borders you do not continue to expand your territory into the ever shrinking piece that is well - established as belonging to the other side .
Instead , Clinton bragged at her recent speech to AIPAC about the increase in U.S. aid to Israel in 2010 and the planned increase for 2011 .
Several paragraphs later , the letter goes on : " Israel continues to be the one true democracy in the Middle East that brings stability to a region where it is in short supply . "
How much of a " true democracy " Israel actually is is debatable , especially given restrictions on free speech , discrimination against Arab Israelis based solely on ethnicity , the disproportionate influence of the radical " settler " minority , and the apartheid system and blockade forced on Palestinians in the occupied territories .
However , the real whopper in the sentence is the notion that Israel brings any sort of stability to the Middle East .
Without a doubt the two most destabilizing forces in the Middle East are the tag team of the United States and Israel , which has a combined resumé that in the past four years includes full - scale wars waged on Iraq , Lebanon , and Gaza ; missile and bomb strikes on Syria and Yemen ; assassination in the United Arab Emirates ; and countless credible threats against Iran .
Israel ’s undeclared nuclear arsenal and refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty also undermine regional stability , especially given Israel ’s penchant for disproportionate escalations of force against its neighbors .
Seventy - six senators want the secretary of state to remember that " Israel has been a consistent , reliable ally and friend and has helped to advance American interests . …
We must never forget the depth and breadth of our alliance and always do our utmost to reinforce a relationship that has benefited both nations for more than six decades . "
While it is very kind of the senators to at least pay lip service to the interests of the people they were elected to represent , unsurprisingly there are no specifics on exactly what Israel has ever done that " benefited both nations " or " advance [ d ] American interests . "
Support for Israel has certainly exacted a heavy toll , though ; from the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing to both World Trade Center attacks , most animosity toward the United States emanating from the Middle East is a result of unconditional support , supply , and diplomatic sheltering of Israel despite its constant deviation from international norms and standards of justice .
The cost is also financial , with billions from the insolvent U.S. going to a nation that can even afford to provide universal health care .
Furthermore , most people could safely expect a " consistent , reliable ally and friend " not to spy on them repeatedly or attack and kill them as in the 1967 U.S.S. Liberty murders .
Despite all the glaring errors and omissions in this latest statement of support , the senators are not completely incorrect ; there is nothing wrong with the people of the United States and the people of Israel supporting each other if it truly benefits both nations ( though George Washington warned in his farewell address against " passionate attachment " for an ally ) .
However , in recent years the positions taken by Olmert / Netanyahu and Bush / Obama are desirable to no one but the " settlers " in Israel and the evangelical Rapture - seekers in the United States .
If the United States Senate truly wants to express its support for the Israeli people , it will stay out of the way of the peace process and stop prolonging the unacceptable status quo with a steady stream of assistance to their intransigent government .
Varlamov appears set to start Game 3
Coach Bruce Boudreau would n't say which goaltender will get the nod in Game 3 tonight at Bell Centre , but Semyon Varlamov exited the ice before Jose Theodore at the morning skate .

WARNING : If you feel offended by the folkloristic depiction of male genitalia , do not continue reading this article and do not look at the pictures .
Okay , now that we ’ve got that out of the way , let ’s take a closer look at the significance of the phallus in Bhutanese folklore and legend .
Among the many weird and wonderful things that the visitor to Bhutan will encounter , there is one that stands out ( no pun intended ) .
It is the frequent depiction of phalluses on the walls of Bhutanese houses .
You can see very realistic depictions of male genitalia painted on the outside walls of people ’s houses all over the country – even in the capital Thimphu , which is the closest thing Bhutan has to a cosmopolitan city .
Apart from painted phalluses , you ’ll often see life - sized phalluses carved of wood above the doorway of a house or hanging from the four corners of the roof .
This is supposed to ward off evil spirits .
It ’s not pornographic
For the people of Bhutan , the phalluses are neither pornographic nor erotic symbols .
And they are n’t painted on the houses as fertility symbols , either .
The phalluses are a reference to one of Bhutan ’s most popular saints , Lama Drukpa Kunley , who lived at the turn of the 15th into the 16th centuries .
Lama Drukpa Kunley is also known as the Divine Madman in Bhutan .
According to the Lonely Planet Travel Guide ,
…he felt that the stiffness of the clergy and social convention were keeping people from learning the true teachings of Buddha .
His outrageous , often obscene , actions and sexual antics were a deliberate method of provoking people to discard their preconceptions .
The Bhutanese tell countless stories about his sexual adventures , and you ca n’t help think that they immensely enjoy hearing these folktales again and again .
One of them recounts how the Lama once tamed a female demon in the mountains with his powerful thunderbolt of wisdom .
So the painted phalluses in Bhutan are more a reference to the antics of the Divine Madman than erotic or fertility symbols .
A temple of hope for childless women
The people of Bhutan love the Divine Madman so much that they ’ve even dedicated a temple to him .
It ’s located in a little village near Punakha , about two and a half hours drive from the capital Thimphu .
Childless women make pilgrimages to this temple of Chimi Lhakhang to pray ( as do tourists , who want to see what all the fuss is about ) .
Inside the shrine , there are three effigies that the infertile women have to carry around the temple : one is a small stone that strongly resembles a phallus , another is a bone in the shape of the male reproductive organ that the third is a piece of bamboo that also looks just like it , too .
Our Bhutanese guide was convinced that the blessing from the Divine Madman worked wonders .
He explained about a western tourist who made the pilgrimage and promptly got pregnant in the year after her visit to Chimi Lhakhang .
Regardless of whether you believe in the power of the Divine Madman ’s blessing or not , Chimi Lhakhang is definitely a serene and beautiful place to visit .
The temple sits on a small hill in the middle of rice paddies .
All you can hear from here are the birds singing , the wind softly blowing and the constant chime of the prayer wheel ’s bell .
As we visited , the prayer wheel was kept going by a woman who looked at least a hundred years old .
I just hope the Divine Madman will not be mad enough to bless her , but rather her granddaughter or great - granddaughter .

One known cause is a preceding trauma that came from sexual assault .
In the mad rush that is " parliamentary wash - up " , it is traditional for civil liberties to be trampled to demonstrate that no party fails the " tough on crime " test – and 2010 is no exception .
Thus it was that on 7 April , the House of Commons approved the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 ( Amendment ) Order 2010 – which categorises mephedrone and other cathinone derivatives under the control of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 , as class B drugs , from 16 April .
The next day , it was the turn of the Lords , pushing through the last stages of the Crime and Security Bill 2010 ( pdf ) , which is likely to have serious future implications through the introduction of police powers to control the movement of persons in and out of specific areas , and attempts to settle the issue of retention of DNA samples .
The control of movement , like many such proposals , is ostensibly for a noble cause .
First , there is the new Domestic Violence Prevention Order ( DVPO ) – more popularly known as a " go order " – which will give to any police officer of superintendent rank or above the power to order a person to be removed from specified premises in order to protect potential victims of domestic abuse .
On the surface , this is a good thing .
However , as Liberty notes in its briefing ( pdf ) on the subject , it is not clear what loophole such an order will plug , since existing " non-molestation " orders provide much the same powers already – but with the safeguard of court involvement .
Legal commentators will also note that as with so much New Labour law , the provisions for the DVPO are laid out in a level of operational detail more reminiscent of a management handbook than a UK Law .
Nonetheless , parliament has now spoken , and DVPOs are with us .
Similar concerns have been raised about new powers for police and local authorities to apply to a county court for an injunction against young people over 14 to prevent gang related violence .
This allows a gang member to be prevented from meeting other named gang members or going into a particular ' territory ' .
When it came to the retention of DNA samples , the precise purpose of the parliamentary horse - trading is unclear .
According to Big Brother Watch , Home Secretary Alan Johnson threatened " to remove the fixed retention time for innocent DNA profiles of 6 years from the Crime and Security Bill if the Tories and Lib Dems did not support the DNA provisions in the bill " .
The Tories blinked first , and withdrew their opposition despite previously having held out for a maximum retention of three years , in line with the Scottish model .
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling justified this reversal by his party , saying : " We will not seek to block this bill because the indefinite retention of innocent people 's DNA is unacceptable and has been ruled illegal . "
So have the Tories gone soft ( or rather , hard ) on their opposition to the retention of DNA from innocent individuals ?
Grayling added : " DNA data provides a useful tool for solving crimes .
A Conservative government will legislate in the first session in order to make sure that our DNA database will only include permanent records of people who are guilty , instead of those who are innocent , and to go further than the government to help fight crime . "
This suggests that one of the first acts of an incoming Tory government will be to over - turn the DNA provisions in the current Bill .
Watch this space .
Also opening the door to potential future abuse are provisions in the Bill for retention of DNA where an individual is re-arrested within the retention period .
While this may sound " tough on crime " , it is likely that many individuals arrested for very minor offences – or those arrested for taking part in political activity – may find themselves caught up by this provision .
On the plus side , the bill brings in a licensing scheme for wheel clamping companies and an independent appeals process for motorists who feel they have been wrongly clamped .
British citizens injured or bereaved by a terrorist attack overseas may now apply for compensation .
However , one measure that looks positive comes with a sting in its tail .
The Bill reduces the amount of information that the police must collect when stopping and searching an individual .
What the upbeat Home Office Press Release omits to mention is that the period within which an individual can now request a copy of their stop and search form is reduced – from 12 months to three . ®

The web browser was just another application five years ago .
A useful app , no doubt , but it played second fiddle to operating systems and productivity software .
That ’s no longer the case .
Browsers have matured into multi-purpose tools that connect to the Internet ( of course ) and also grant access to a host of powerful online applications and services .
Shut off your web connection for a few minutes and you ’ll quickly understand the browser ’s impact .
I got in touch with Charles McCathieNevile , Opera chief standards officer and a speaker at the upcoming Web 2.0 Expo , to discuss the the current role of web browsers and their near - term future .
He shares his predictions in the following Q&A .
MS : Will the web browser become the primary tool on computers ?
Charles McCathieNevile :
It is n’t already ?
Email , document management , device control , are all done through the browser .
Games are increasingly browser - based — while it is not the only area that has taken time to move to the web , it is one of the biggest .
There will always be applications that do n’t run in the browser , just because that is the way people are .
But there is little reason for the browser not to be a primary application already .</p.
MS : Will we even see a browser in five years ?
Or , will it simply blend with the operating system ?
CM :
We will see it , but as its importance increases it will be the part people see of their interface to the computer .
So it will be less noticeable .
Five years ago people chose their computer for the OS , and the software available for that OS .
Ten years ago much more so .
Increasingly , the browser will be the thing people choose .
MS : What has been the most significant browser advancement of the last 2 - 3 years ?
CM :
There are many I could name , from the huge increase in Javascript speed ( and capabilities ) in all browsers , to the development of native video , or the increased interoperability of XHTML , CSS and SVG .
But the most significant in the long term just might be WAI - ARIA — a technology that makes it easier to make rich applications accessible to anyone , effectively by tagging code to say what it is meant to do .
Because an important aspect of the web is its universality .
The ability to build innovative new things has always been around , and it is part of what engineers do by nature .
But the ability to make sure everyone can use and benefit from them is the prerequisite for a societal shift .
If you like , it is n’t the “ bleeding edge ” that is most significant ( although it is generally the most interesting and captures the most mind - share ) , but it ’s how the “ trailing edge ” shifts .
That what changes everyone ’s life .
MS : How important is cloud computing to the future of the browser ?
CM :
It shows a pathway for things that people want that require more power than the browser could provide at the time .
So in that sense , it is very important .
The major successes , the Web applications with million of users , are important in the sense that their user base sets some of the requirements for browser development .
MS : Will a single company achieve cloud - based lock in ?
CM : I hope not .
And I do n’t think so .
Although very few companies have the computing power to build global - scale applications that people use many times in a day , that power is not necessary for many applications .
And there are plenty of things that people are not very keen to put on a cloud at all — or at least will insist on being able to move their data from one cloud to another .
So while there will be very dominant players from time to time , I do n’t think we will see one company take over completely .
MS : Will browser innovation come from the mobile side in years to come ?
CM : Of course — in a continuation of the contribution of mobile browsing to the overall ecosystem .
While mobile is increasingly important , it will not be the only driver .
Large - screen devices , which are almost of necessity static , medium - sized devices , and different interface modalities such as voice and game controllers , will also drive innovations that will contribute to the richness of the entire web platform .
MS : What impact will tablet computing have on browsing ?
CM : It ’s another class of device .
We have seen it around for years , although it is now taking off with the shiny new toy .
So it will highlight the importance of developing for a range of platforms — and I think in large part the value of developing as much as possible with the “ One Web ” concept — making applications and content that are easy to adapt to the increasing diversity of devices people use .
MS : Will web applications catch up to mobile applications ?
CM : Oddly enough , many people still ask the question the other way around .
So I guess the real issue is whether we will see genuine convergence .
And the answer is yes .
There are new things being developed on the desktop browser , and they include the capabilities that we now see in mobile applications .
Initiatives such as JIL and BONDI were developed to “ hothouse ” specifications that could form a basis for what is now W3 C ’s Device API group , and the development of technology like Web Workers , database storage and HTML5 video is being brought to mobile as fast as we can .
Note :
This interview was condensed and edited .
Details concerning the mounting financial crisis facing the Queen have been disclosed to The Independent after ministers agreed to hand over secret correspondence between Buckingham Palace and the Government .
The documents reveal that at the same time the Queen was requesting more public money to pay for the upkeep of her crumbling palaces she was allowing minor royals and courtiers to live in rent - free accommodation .
They show that as early as 2004 Sir Alan Reid , the Keeper of the Privy Purse , had unsuccessfully put the case to the Department for Culture , Media and Sport ( DCMS ) for a substantial increase in the £ 15 m a year public funding .
But by 2005 , the papers reveal , there was mounting pressure from the Commons Public Accounts Committee for the Queen 's aides to come clean about the extent of the grace - and - favour schemes being operated by the Palace .
One letter shows that among the royals living rent - free in Kensington Palace and St James 's Palace are the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester , the Duke and Duchess of Kent and Princess Alexandra .
The Surveyor of the Queen 's Pictures and the Mistress of the Robes are two of six members of the Royal Household identified as not paying rent on their accommodation at the time .
Some of the most sensitive and embarrassing documents still remain under wraps while the Government goes to court to fight a substantial part of The Independent 's Freedom of Information request .
Today 's disclosure amounts to more than 100 letters , emails , memos and other documents .
The future funding of the Royal Family will be an issue facing whichever party wins the general election .
Under a constitutional arrangement from 1991 , the Civil List , which pays the Queen to perform her duties as head of state , must be renegotiated by the end of the year .
At the moment it is an annual payment of £ 7.9 m and the Palace is pressing hard for it to be increased .
Secret memos also show how the Palace planned to go ahead with refurbishing and renting Princess Diana 's apartment at Kensington Palace after it had lain empty since her death in 1997 .
In an email on 28 June 2005 the Palace informed the DCMS that the Royal Household intended to rent out Diana 's rooms , anonymously known as Apartment 8 - 9 .
Having previously complained that public funds were insufficient to refurbish the rooms , the royal courtier wrote : " We have now decided that Apartment 8 will play an important role for temporary office accommodation . "
But the Government was concerned about the public reaction to this re-use of Diana 's apartment after it had remained empty for so long : " Apartment 8 is , of course , more difficult and I must be guided by you on how much we can say , " said the DCMS official .
" My view is that we should be as open as possible on the difficulties in finding an economic use for the apartment .
This is an issue which is likely to attract attention and comment . "
It later emerged that Buckingham Palace had rented the apartment to Prince Charles 's charities .
A series of emails between the Royal Household and the DCMS also illustrate the lengths to which the Queen has gone to cut her bills .
In September 2005 the Queen 's advisers complained to the Government that the " commercial market price for utilities has become untenable with price rises of over 50 per cent " .
They suggest a switch to a wholesale provider of gas and electricity and plump for Inenco which also serves the Prison Service and Channel 4 .
The switch is approved by the DCMS officials who accept that the Queen has been " hard hit " by the cost of energy .
But if the Royal Household had acted sooner Palace documents show that the Queen would have made a saving of £ 142,000 between 2004 and 2006 .
Other documents reflect wrangles between the Palace and the Government over financing of the occupied palaces .
In October 2004 a senior official at the DCMS wrote to Sir Alan Reid taking issue with him over who has the rightful claim over the £ 2.5 m proceeds from the sale of land from the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensingtion .
The official wrote : " We agreed that the receipt of £ 2.5 m could affect any increased allocation which the Secretary of State is able to give to the Royal Household as result of the Spending Review .
I have to say that the settlement is very tight and Ministers are not confident of being able to offer increased funding in all areas given the competing demands of the relatively small increase in the DCMS 's budget . "
He later adds : " That makes it more important to agree how we handle the £ 2.5 m receipt .
I cannot concede that it automatically belongs to the Royal Household .
The receipts from the hereditary lands are surrendered to the Consolidated Fund [ money held in the Government 's bank account ] .
I hope we can come to an agreement on apportioning the receipt . "
In further documents it transpires that the Treasury and DCMS have rejected requests for an increase to the grant - in - aid , taxpayers ' money which finances the upkeep of the occupied palace .
Today Royal aides say the backlog of property repairs stands at £ 32 m which will rise to £ 40 m in the next decade , prompting fears of a future public funding crisis .
A mounting financial crisis : Spiralling costs
The funding of the Royal Family is a complex formula comprising government grants and Civil List payments agreed by Parliament .
Much of what is perceived to be part of the Queen 's fortune is not hers at all , but held in trust by her for the nation .
This includes the Crown Jewels , Titians , Caravaggios , and many other priceless items .
In the low - inflation 1990s , however , the Queen was able to put some £ 35 m to one side from the Civil List and it was then agreed that her payment would be frozen .
Over the past decade , Civil List expenditure has spiralled , meaning that she has been forced to take more money out of that fund each year .
Assuming the current pattern continues , the fund will be wiped out by the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 .
She is still believed , however , to possess private wealth last estimated to be more than £ 90 m .
Soon the debate over the escalating costs of the Royal Family will come to a head as the Queen is forced to go cap - in - hand to ministers for more cash to protect her constitutional position as head of state .
Palace aides have told Whitehall officials they need the extra money to offset the expense of maintaining the Royal Estate of palaces and to pay for increased staffing costs .
But in the current financial climate any increase in the annual £ 35 m state subsidy is politically sensitive .
Both sides are now engaged in a public relations battle as time runs out on negotiations that must settle the matter by the end of next year when the present deal on the Civil List expires .
A second deal on the £ 15 m paid in grants for the upkeep of the palaces is due to be finalised in 2011 .
Royal aides contend the Queen 's accommodation is in a parlous state and point to 2007 , when Princess Anne had a narrow escape after some loose masonry was dislodged from the roof on Buckingham Palace .
Another piece fell last year , missing a police officer who was on duty .
Royal expenditure :
The disclosures
Land at the Royal Garden Hotel
An email and letter exchange reveals a tussle over who has control of £ 2.5 m gained from the sale of Kensington Palace land in 2004 .
Ministers say it belongs to the state , while Buckingham Palace maintains it belongs to the Queen .
Overspends
There was a £ 40,000 overspend in the refurbishment of the kitchen and coffee room of Windsor Castle .
The kitchen is used to prepare hot drinks for the Queen and her household .
The workmen uncovered voids under the floors which might provide " rat runs " .
The refurbishment of York House ( St James 's Palace ) led to an overspend of £ 99,000 .
Hard times
In September 2005 the Queen 's advisers complained that the " commercial market price for utilities has become untenable with price rises of more than 50 per cent " .
They suggested a switch to a wholesale provider of gas and electricity , to Inenco , which also serves the Prison Service and Channel 4 .
The switch is approved by DCMS officials noting that the new contract will " undercut " traditional fuel companies by 6 - 8 per cent .
If they had thought of it two years earlier , they could have saved £ 144,000 .
Diana 's apartment
Secret memos shine a light on plans to refurbish and rent out Princess Diana 's apartment at Kensington Palace after it had laid empty since her death in 1997 .
After the work was completed , Apartment 8 , as it is refered to by Palace aides , was controversially leased to Prince Charles 's charities .
The memos warn that plans for the future use of these apartments are " more difficult and an issue likely to attract attention and comment " .
Grace and favour living

So , a shit load of my friends hang out at Excuses and a shit load of Pens were there the other night , jacked this off facebook , it has to be included here for the sheer terminator orpik eyes .
There really is a couple more that are priceless , but I have n't seen any others with Orpik , maybe it 's worth posting a couple more ?

In Graves ' disease , which is the most common form or cause of hyperthyroidism , the eyes may look enlarged because the eye muscles swell and push the eye forward .
This can only be resolved surgically by orbital decompression .
Sometimes , one or both eyes may bulge .
Some patients have swelling of the front of the neck from an enlarged thyroid gland ( a goitre ) .
Because hyperthyroidism , especially Graves� disease , may run in families , examinations of the members of a family may reveal other individuals with thyroid problems . [ 6 ]
Minor ocular ( eye ) signs , which may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism , are eyelid retraction ( " stare " ) , extra-ocular muscle weakness , and lid-lag .[ citation needed ]
In hyperthyroid stare ( Dalrymple sign ) the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal ( the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus , where the " white " of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris ) .
Extra -ocular muscle weakness may present with double vision .
In lid -lag ( von Graefe 's sign ) , when the patient tracks an object downward with their eyes , the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris , and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs , temporarily .
These signs disappear with treatment of the hyperthyroidism

But I 've left the Isle of Cedars behind , at least .
1261 pages and counting .
The timeline of this monster is going to drive me mad .
I know perfectly well that as soon as DANCE is published , some of you out there are going to attempt to correlate its chronology with that of A FEAST FOR CROWS , fit all the parts together to suggest an appropriate chapter order for a ( hypothetical , and largely impossible ) combined book , something like what the " Big Feast " might have been , before the split .
Well , good luck with that .
I 'm glad you 're doing it , not me .
With all these characters scattered over my entire world , some chapters that span hours and others many months , various journeys and voyages to account for , not to mention the demands of the dramatic chronology , an entirely different matter than the literal chronology ... well , it may well make your head explode .
It did mine .
The DANCE timeline alone is a bitch and a half .
Just musing aloud here , so do n't anyone get all hysterical ... but depending on how long the book comes out , moving some of these finished chapters into WINDS OF WINTER may make sense .
Structurally you could make a good case for making DANCE a perfect parallel to FEAST ; different cast of characters , but exactly the same time frame , so both books end on the same approximate date .
Then WINDS could pick up the action for both sets of characters the following day .
That 's not the way I have been doing it , however .
As written , I 've covered the FEAST time frame in the first 800 pages ( manuscript pages , the printed book pages will be different ) of DANCE .
Everything that follows is post -FEAST , so that 's where some of the cast from the last book start popping up again .
Not the most elegant structure , I admit ... but given how late this one is , I wanted to resolve at least a few of the cliffhangers from FEAST ... ( if only to set up the new cliffhangers ) .
So ... These are the kinds of things I grapple with .
No comments necessary , really .
I am not looking for advice , and in fact I seldom talk about such issues precisely to AVOID unsolicited advice .
These sorts of things are best resolved by me and my muse , sometimes assisted by my editors .
Just felt like rambling a little .
Anyway , there we are .
Back to the grindstone tomorrow .
What happens when an inadequate legislative process meets networking technology ?
Answer : the Digital Economy Bill ( aka Mandy 's dangerous downloaders act ) , which finally staggered , slightly frayed , on to the statute book on Wednesday night .
For those who have n't been following the story , here 's the gist .
Many moons ago , Stephen ( now Lord ) Carter , the former Ofcom boss , was commissioned to produce a report on the communications and networking strategy Britain should follow in order to drag itself into the 21st century .
He duly produced the Digital Britain report which , although remarkably unambitious on some issues , such as aspirations for nationwide broadband speeds , was also judicious and sensible on hot topics like file - sharing and " piracy " .
The stage was set for a deliberative path to legislation , probably timed for the next parliament .
Then events intervened .
Lord Mandelson was recalled from Brussels and took over the government or , at any rate , its entire industrial strategy .
He was got at by some content - industry moguls who told him that file - sharing and digital piracy must be stopped in order to protect what they quaintly call Britain 's " creative industries " .
Mandelson bought the idea and suddenly the Digital Economy Bill found itself on the fast track .
The problem was that it 's not easy to draft workable laws in this area .
When the draft bill reached the upper house , its members unpicked it with fastidious intelligence , highlighting its flaws and seeking to improve it .
The bill returned to the Commons in a state where it clearly required more work .
But then the election was called and suddenly there was a need to decide which bills would go through on the " washup " , by agreement of the two frontbenches .
Normally , this applies only to uncontentious bills , which this bill was clearly not .
Nevertheless , it was railroaded through .
The result : a fatally flawed bill will now become a fatally flawed law .
And the next government will have to pick up the pieces .
How did this fiasco come about ?
Mainly because legislatures ( both here and abroad ) deal with intellectual - property issues in ways that are corrupt , irresponsible and inappropriate for modern technology .
The corruption stems from the fact that the process is largely driven by obeisance to powerful industrial lobbies , in this case , the content industries and the trade unions , which seek only to protect business models that are being rendered obsolete by networking technology .
Legislative irresponsibility stems from parliamentarians ' failure to remember that intellectual property ( IP ) differs from other kinds of property rights , in that it 's a government - granted , time - limited monopoly rather than an inalienable " right " .
Copyrights and patents represent an attempt to strike a balance between rewarding innovation on the one hand and the larger needs of society to build on that creativity , on the other .
But in the last 50 years , the balance has become ludicrously skewed in favour of rights holders .
The internet has highlighted the extent of the imbalance that now exists .
Legislators have a responsibility to strike a balance between the competing needs of right - holders and of society .
But when it comes to copyright legislation , they ignore the public interest .
So what we have is the kind of evidence - free lawmaking represented by Mandelson 's bill .
" Imagine , " writes Professor James Boyle , a noted cyberlaw scholar , " a process of reviewing prescription drugs which goes like this : representatives from the drug company come to the regulators and argue that their drug works well and should be approved .
They have no evidence of this beyond a few anecdotes about people who want to take it and perhaps some very simple models of how the drug might affect the human body .
The drug is approved .
No trials , no empirical evidence of any kind , no follow - up .
Even the harshest critics of drug regulation would admit we generally do better than this .
But this is often the way we make intellectual property policy . "
The trouble is that in Westminster ( or on Capitol Hill ) nobody speaks for the future or for the wider needs of society .
So we wind up with biased legislation framed in a rearview mirror .
The fact that the internet makes it easy to copy and remix does indeed pose a challenge for IP regimes framed in the era of print .
But that should be a spur for rethinking the regime , not for switching off the net – because that 's what we will have to do in order to stop what 's now going on .
The dangerous downloaders act wo n't stop file - sharing , but it will certainly inhibit online creativity .
This government has legislated in haste ; it will be for the next one to repent at leisure .

The paranormal articles and ghost stories here were written by many different people .
You will read about topics ranging from demonic possession and poltergeists to haunted houses and ghost pictures and from vampires and werewolves to strange creatures and aliens .
Although the name of the site is TrueGhostTales.com we are by no means limited to just ghost stories .
While we aim to become the largest collection of ghost stories and experiences on the web we also strive to add interesting articles and stories about other " strangeness " .
The realm of the paranormal has always inspired questions about such things as ghosts , spirits , fairies and elves , extraterrestrials , and even demons and monsters and further even to the immortality of humanity and the existence of gods .
These things have been pondered upon by human beings perhaps since the dawn of time it self .
And here we continue ... seeking glimpses of the truth ... sharing our thoughts and experiences ... pondering questions like , " Is there an invisible world around us which includes beings and entities we cannot see ? " and " Is there something else beyond this life we see ?
What lies beyond the Grave ? "
Most people know of at least one ghost story that has been told as being true within their family .
Many of us even remember living near a haunted house when we were young .
As children we tend to believe these ghost stories are real , but by the time we grow up we often consider ghosts to be as mythical as Santa Claus , the Easter Bunny or the Great Pumpkin .
Humans have always been both fascinated and afraid of the unknown .
Even during ancient times people experienced encounters with the paranormal and shared their stories with others .
At True Ghost Tales we delve into the supernatural with visitor submitted true ghost stories , ghost pictures , haunting articles , EVPs , poltergeists , werewolves and more paranormal topics .
We have a lot of resources for ghost hunters and everyone interested in the paranormal world .
The blog is updated every day with new ghost stuff .
We also have an archived section of ghost stories and for those of you who like to interact with others who are into the paranormal we have a forum .
However we may explain the supernatural world , nothing prevents us from being intensely interested in real true ghost stories , haunted houses , and the realm of the supernatural .
In different stories , ghosts have been described as being benevolent , benign , or malevolent .
A benevolent ghost seems to want to help or protect in some way while a malevolent spirit will seek to inflict harm .
Benign ghosts are usually indifferent to , or unaware of , the living .
Types of Hauntings
Residual Haunting
The most prevalent type of haunting , by far , is referred to as a residual haunting .
In this type of haunting the ghostly energy goes through a cycle of actions over and over again .
It 's like a video clip that repeats itself in a loop .
Oftentimes this plays out at a specific time as though it were following a schedule .
Most commonly the scene played out will be that of a tragic event , such as a death .
This type of haunting is more like a psychic impression of energy than an actual haunting by a presence or entity .
Many true stories seem to describe this type of occurrence .
Intelligent Haunting
The second classification of haunting is known as the Classic or Intelligent Haunting ...
In an Intelligent Haunting the spirit , or ghost , demonstrates an intelligence and an awareness of its surroundings .
These ghosts have been known to communicate with humans and to interact with their environment .
In this type of haunting it is common for objects to be moved .
There have been reports of ghosts making noises , such as rapping or banging on walls , slamming doors , or making footsteps .
Ghosts have been known to move things around , or even to hide objects .
They may even turn light switches on and off .
This type of ghost will often manifest the personality of someone who has died .
Smells and odors that were commonly present with the person when they were still living , such as tobacco , perfume , or flowers , often occur in these hauntings .

For the first time in well over a year , water levels are rising at Guri Lake , the source of more than 70 percent of Venezuela ’s electricity .
At last , we can stop worrying that the power grid will collapse in 2010 .
If the weather forecasts are right , there will be plenty of water to get us through the year .
Looking forward to 2011 , things are less cheery .
Traveling last week in Guayana I was impressed with how well understood it is among workers in the metals and electricity industries that 2011 is the crunch year , not 2010 .
The problem is simple .
The crisis provoked no energy savings in the residential and commercial sectors , according to the monthly reports from CNG , which runs the power grid ( and has now deleted the damning monthly reports from its website ) .
The only sector that conserved was industrial , and even there , savings were achieved in only a small number of plants , entirely by slashing output ( without layoffs ) .
Reduced activity and shutdowns at a few iron , steel and aluminum plants saved the rest of the country its comfort .*
However , recovering the dam is going to be a long slog .
Today ’s report showed the reservoir has gained 24 cm since bottoming at 20 percent of its useful volume April 14 .
We need another 1,300 cm to get to the level we were at Jan. 1 and another 1,300 cm again to fill the reservoir , as it should be around New Year’s .
At current electricity consumption and generation levels , that will never happen .
Average water consumption from the dam this year — after conservation was imposed and water consumption rationed around New Year ’s — has been 4,574 cubic meters a second .
Average inflow into the dam in an average year is 4,500 cubic meters a second , Miguel Lara , the former president of the grid regulator ( then known as OPSIS ) , told me in a phone interview .
That means that at this year ’s average water consumption and with average rains , the water level will be lower a year from now than it is now .
With above - average rains , we can gain a few meters , but there are complications that make the situation worse .
First , industrial rationing has to end at some point .
Venalum , Alcasa and Sidor ca n’t remain at such low production forever while maintaining full payrolls with ( by Venezuelan standards ) excellent pay and benefits .
Managers at Sidor say the laborers who work in the heat of the steel mill make 7,000 to 8,000 bolivars a month , well above the salary of a Venezuelan accountant or doctor .
The mills run luxury buses to and from the job sites .
They have made some cuts in response to the losses they started to incur with the North American housing slowdown : they have slashed medical insurance and this year , in a local scandal , stopped providing new uniforms for their company sports teams .
Cuts like that are no substitute for making and selling aluminum and steel .
Second , elections are coming .
Normally , the Chavez government pushes consumption - oriented policies before elections to try and soothe the population .
More home appliances will increase , rather than decrease , power use .
Third , when the dam levels are as low as they are now , you need to use more water to get the same amount of power .
Edelca , the power utility that runs the Caroni River hydro complex , has squeezed 11.8 kilowatt - hours of electricity out of every cubic meter of Guri Dam water in the first half of April .
That is down 8 percent from the 12.8 kWh of that Edelca generated from each cubic meter in the first half of December 2009 .
This is because when the dam is more than half full , the pressure is much greater than now , with far less weight forcing water through the turbines .
In order to keep power generation average level we ’ve had for the past few months , Edelca may have to increase water consumption from the dam .
Edelca cut flows through the dam from over 5,150 cubic meters a second in December to about 4,330 this month .
It will take a lot of arguing for the managers there to convince Caracas not to boost flows again now that the rain is falling .
There are only two ways to escape this situation .
First would be to implement effective energy - saving measures , such as water - heater timers , solar water heaters , enforcement against excessive air conditioning , a massive program of weatherization of home and offices , energy audits for small industry , encouragement to shut off televisions , requiring all residences to provide clothes lines , and increased use of natural gas for cooking .
While the propaganda calling for power savings has gradually been getting better , none of these ideas are likely to be put into effect .
The other alternative is to increase power generation .
This is the government ’s plan .
It has pledged to bring between 4 and 6 gigawatts of generation on line this year , depending on who is speaking and to what audience .
Among the plans :
Generation barges parked by the Tacoa generation plant that serves Caracas .
It ’s unclear what ’s happening with them , but this week state oil company PDVSA said a barge arrived in Lake Maracaibo to provide 103.5 megawatts of power starting at the end of May .
Planta Centro recuperation .
South America ’s biggest thermal generating plant , a 2,000 - megawatt fuel - oil and natural - gas - powered beast , was supposed to be operating at increased capacity by now .
Instead , it has continued to struggle .
It has had at most one of its five turbines in service since March 26 .
It was completely down April 5 - 11 .
The challenges of getting it on line were epitomized in a rumor I heard from Jose Manuel Aller , a professor at Simon Bolívar University in Caracas .
He said repairs on one generator were almost complete on a turbine earlier this year but the startup was rushed and technicians failed to put oil in a pump .
The pump seized up and needed to be replaced .
Given Venezuela ’s difficult import environment , this took forever .
Wind turbines on the Paraguana peninsula .
Starting next year , 70 1.3 - megawatt windmills 70 meters high are supposed to start producing 100 MW of generation .
( Note that this press release for the first time quantifies how much diesel is used to generate 100 MW of power in a thermal plant : about 2,000 barrels a day , it says . )
880 MW at Sidor .
Former CVG president Rodolfo Sanz said 440 MW worth of turbines were on their way from the USA and that they ’d be in service in May .
The Nueva Prensa de Guayana reported that Sanz said the first 175 MW of plants would arrive by the end of February and the remainder two weeks later .
Delays kicked in at once .
This undated press release , posted between March 20 and April 5 , says the second ship had just arrived .
The Sidor power plant still has a long way to go before it ’s operational ; I ca n’t see how it will happen in May as promised .
So we shall see .
I think that politically , Chavez has to end the rolling blackouts by August or face serious electoral consequences .
I do n’t see the grid getting more than about 200 MW of new generation before then .
So I think Guri will recover a very limited amount this year .
There are those who are more pessimistic , and believe Guri will end the year at 20 % .
I say at least 30 % , maybe even 40 .
In any case , next year , there will be no room for the failures of conservation and delays in new construction that we ’ve seen this year .
The country will need to consume less , while running its basic industries , and with another 444,000 Venezuelans demanding their fair share of the electrons .
A challenge !
* Anglo American Plc ’s Loma de Niquel mine in Aragua state used more power in February than it has in any month since May , according to CNG ’s monthly reports .
" Ernie Sims is an impact player at the linebacker position , " Eagles coach Andy Reid said .
" He brings a lot of energy to our already energized defense .
We are looking forward to adding him to our team . "
Last season , the Eagles tried numerous combinations at linebacker .
Seven different players started at least one game at one of the tree linebacker spots .
Sims , the ninth overall pick in the 2006 draft , is a versatile player who can play three downs .
He played weakside linebacker for the Lions , and likely will compete with Akeem Jordan for the starting job in Philadelphia .
" I 've been competing my whole life , " Sims said .
" I do n't expect to come in and just be handed a job .
I expect to come in and work for my position . "
Detroit seems to have created a void at linebacker , trading Sims and choosing not to re-sign Larry Foote .
But the coaching staff may not view Sims as much of a loss .
He struggled to stay healthy last season after starting all 16 games in his first three seasons .
When Sims did play , he did n't appear to perform as well as rookie DeAndre Levy .
Denver had been shopping Scheffler since he signed his tender last week .
A four - year veteran , he has 138 catches for 1,896 yards and 14 touchdowns , all for the Broncos .
He caught 31 passes for 416 yards and two TDs last year .
Scheffler is the latest member of Denver 's exceptional draft class of 2006 to depart since coach Josh McDaniels replaced Mike Shanahan 15 months ago .
He joins quarterback Jay Cutler , who was traded to Chicago last year , and wide receiver Brandon Marshall , who was traded to Miami last week .
Scheffler was one of several holdovers from the Shanahan era who saw their roles reduced under McDaniels last season , and he was suspended for the season finale along with Marshall because of his attitude .
Still , his departure means the Broncos have a void at tight end , where Daniel Graham is almost exclusively a blocker and second - year pro Richard Quinn , a second - round pick last year , has yet to catch his first NFL pass .
Quinn 's only contribution his rookie season was returning a single kickoff for 19 yards .

The Vision
o A single - nation global human population of ten million by 2012
o Restoration of the biosphere to its state of five hundred years ago , within a century
The Mission
o To accomplish the Vision , by facilitating the establishment of a single - nation world government that embraces the vision .
Assessment of the Current State of the World , and a Proposed Long - Term - Sustainable Human Population
o Large human numbers and industrial activity are causing a causing a mass species extinction that is destroying many other large species , and is placing the very survival of the biosphere in jeopardy .
o The current world political structure , of over two hundred sovereign nations competing to produce and consume , is a major factor contributing to the destruction of the biosphere .
o The large human numbers and industrial activity are the result of tapping fossil fuels .
As fossil fuels exhaust , the human population will fall back to its pre-fossil - fuel level , which is a few hundred million or less .
The only real issue to address in the long term is : when human population declines at the end of fossil fuels , will there be no other large animals left on the planet .
( If you do n’t believe the dependence of today ’s human population and the industrial world on fossil fuel , just look around you and remove , in your mind ’s eye , everyone and everything that was produced using fossil fuel ( as a physical input or an energy input ) .
For most people alive on the planet today , almost everything and everybody will vanish from sight . )
o The world 's oil reserves are about half gone .
As production starts to decline , global war is likely , producing circumstances favorable to major world political change .
o Solar energy is capable of supporting about 200 million people at a low - energy level - of - living and about 10 million people at a high - energy level - of - living .
In order to maximize the likelihood of long - term sustainability of the human population and the biosphere as we know it , it is necessary for the human population to be small -- much smaller than it is today .
It has been proposed that a long - term sustainable population that can live in harmony with the rest of the biosphere consists of single - nation technologically advanced population of five million and a primitive ( hunter - gatherer ) population of five million distributed over the globe .
This population is called a " minimal regret " population .
Cosmologist Sir Fred Hoyle observed ( in his 1966 book , October the First Is Too Late ) that a long - term sustainable global human population would be on the order of ten million people .
To move from the present world situation of a human population of six billion to a long - term sustainable population will involve the reduction in current human population by a factor of almost one thousand .
The Strategy
o To disseminate information on the current state of the world ( " situation assessment " ) .
This information will be posted at the Internet web site http://www.foundation.bw ( or http://www.foundationwebsite.org ) and other locations .
o To advocate the desirability of a single - nation global population of ten million people , i.e. , of the minimal - regret population .
o To encourage various groups all over the world to make preparations ( " contingency plans " ) to assume control of the planet in the wake of the coming collapse of the industrial world , and to convince them of the advantage of a “ minimal - regret ” population in a biologically diverse world over a large population of desperately poor people in a biologically barren world .
It is difficult to predict who will survive the collapse of the industrial world , but if many groups are prepared for this and realize the advantage of the minimal - regret population over the current approach to planetary management , the likelihood of one such group ’s surviving and being able to assume control and move to set up a single - nation world is greatly increased .
Some Observations on Who Might Rule the Post - Industrial World
o The group to assume planetary control in the post - industrial era may arise out of a current nation , religion , or other group .
History has shown that new civilizations often arise from obscurity .
In every case , however , their rise to power is the result of military action by a dynamic culture and strong leadership .
As historian Arnold J. Toynbee has observed , high points in religious history tend to correspond to low points in secular history , so that one might reasonably believe that the demise of the global industrial world will be followed by a strongly religious era .
Some observations / speculations follow on examples of groups of the sort that might be involved in assuming a significant role in planetary management in the post - industrial world .
o Nations .
A strong nation is comprised of individuals having a common cultural heritage , language , religion , and the desire and ability to wage wars of conquest .
Current nations possessing these characteristics include Japan , Germany , and Russia .
In the wake of global war , it is difficult to say what will be left of any of these .
Another nation with a strong sense of purpose , plus indigenous technological ability , is Israel .
o Religions .
All three Abrahamic religions ( Judaism , Christianity , Islam ) have strong traditions of military conquest and suppression of competing religions .
Of these , the one having the strongest interest in eschatology ( theology dealing with the " end times " of civilization ) is Christianity .
One candidate for world leadership in the post - industrial world is Scientology .
Scientology has a world - view that is generally consistent with responsible planetary management .
Its view of the “ goal of life , ” or “ dynamic principle of man ’s existence , ” is “ survival … Man , as a life form , can be demonstrated to obey in all his actions and purposes the once command : “ Survive ! ” The “ Aims of Scientology ” are “ A world without insanity , without criminals and without war , where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights , and where man if free to rise to greater heights . ”
These aims can be achieved only in a world without multiple nations , all champing at the bit to outproduce each other .
Scientology is a dynamic , global , fast - growing religion whose religious philosophy and world - view are oriented toward making a significant difference in the world .
“ Scientology is the most vital movement on Earth today … and we will succeed . ”

The Scientology Scale of Politics is : Republic , Democracy , Social Democracy , Fascism , Communism , and Anarchy ( p. 161 , Scientology 0 - 8 : The Book of Basics , by L. Ron Hubbard , Bridge Publications , Los Angeles , 1988 ) .
“ The cycle of a nation goes in a descending spiral down this scale . ”
Scientology views a Republic as a higher form of government / social organization than Democracy .
See Plato ’s Republic for a discussion of the Republic form of government – a social organization that replaces democracy with Guardians ( Rulers and Auxiliaries ( Military / Police / Executive ) ) and national traditions with a Foundation Myth .
o Other Organizations .
Freemasonry .
The global organization with the strongest tradition of secrecy , sense of destiny , and demonstrated ability to establish nations is the Masonic Order ( Masonry , Masons , Freemasonry , Freemasons , The Craft ) .
The Masonic Order is a semipublic , semisecret fraternal organization that embraces " a system of morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols . "
That organization ( and its putative predecessor , the Knights Templar ) has demonstrated an uncanny ability to survive under incredible hardships .
Its members believe in God and the survival of the soul after death .
Its worldwide membership , bound by strong centuries - old oaths and discipline , allegiance to The Craft , and loyalty to fellow Masons , numbers many millions .
It has survived centuries with little change in its essential nature .
Because of its worldwide geographic distribution and large membership , it will survive global war and the fall of the industrial world .
Throughout its history , its members have been heavily involved in government , civil service , the military , and business .
In recent times , much of its energy has been invested in charitable causes .
Because of its sense of purpose , commitment to structure , and tradition of good works , the Masonic Order is a prime candidate for assuming leadership in the post - industrial world .
Other nongovernmental groups might also be considered as candidates , but none of them possesses the " mix " of features ( size , geographic distribution , skills , history , culture , etc. ) of Masonry , relative to potential ability for planetary management .
( Please note that I am not in any way implying that Masonry is concerned with world domination .
It is not -- it is at present a fraternal organization concerned with personal morality and charitable works .
My interest here is to identify groups that might be able to " pull things together " after global war , and address the tremendous problems that the world is now facing with respect to human overpopulation and mass species extinction .
See http://www.msana.com for information on Masonry . )
o Another group with a strong sense of purpose and destiny are the Afrikaners ( Boers ) .
The Seer Nicolaas van Rensburg prophesied that Afrikaners would eventually ( with help from Germany ) assume control of South Africa and form a powerful Christian nation in the wake of a global World War III .

Excerpts : “ The Afrikaner nation faces a great and bright future … .
We become a large republic -- larger than anyone could have dreamed of ….
... for we will be a God- fearing nation … .
One nation , one language , one crest , and one God … .
At the end of time we will also be the last country to fall … .
Our Boer nation will not be destroyed , for we have a purpose and a destiny … . ”
o The groups mentioned above whose current size is comparable to a single - nation planetary - management group ( on the order of five million ) are the Scientologists , the Masons , and the Afrikaners .
None of these groups has , however , a world - view that centers on world domination ( planetary management ) , and none is particularly concerned with global biodiversity or even the local environment .
The Republic of South Africa formerly possessed a form of government that resembled a Platonic Republic in some ways , but it relinquished it in the past decade , in “ the descending spiral . ”
o It would seem unlikely that any large group extant today will form the nucleus of a New World Order , since almost all are committed to economic development and growth , and that is what has brought about the current global disaster .
After global nuclear war , the folly of massive industrialization will be apparent to the survivors , and some will strive to set up a new , sustainable , environmentally sound global society .
The objective of The Omega Project is to increase the likelihood that this will be accomplished , and accomplished as quickly as possible , by clearly predicting the outcome of the present system , identifying an alternative system that will work , and demonstrating the advantage of an early transition to a new system .
This will be accomplished by an educational program that convincingly shows the path on which mankind is currently set and identifies a global population size and composition / organization that is sustainable in the long term .
If many people hear the message of the inevitability of failure of the current system ( economic development , multiple nations ) and the feasibility of establishing a long - term sustainable population , then the survivors of the destroyed industrial world will be motivated and able to set up a new planetary system based on a small human population .
It is not the objective of The Omega Project to form the new world order – the principals of the Project will probably be destroyed along with much of the rest of the industrial world as it collapses .
Rather , the objective is that so many people will understand the reasons for the industrial and environmental collapse of the world that they will seek to set up a better world in the future , and know what its characteristics are .
o In writing about a future World Order in 1955 , Arnold Toynbee observed that it would inevitably be very different from the United Nations Organization .
His view was that the new World Order would more likely take shape through the development of some other " older and tougher ' going concern ' . "
History has borne this view out .
Current efforts to effect a " world government " along the lines of the United Nations has proved to be a tragic and dismal failure , with respect to saving the planet 's ecology and assuring mankind 's long - term survivability .
" World peace " and a " community of nations " and " economic development " are rapidly destroying the planet 's biodiversity and ecological stability ( " balance of nature " ) .
As Toynbee noted , the world has witnessed incredible technological and economic success , but has failed politically and culturally .
As fossil fuels exhaust , global war is inevitable .
The future will belong to a group that is not afraid to wage war .
The fate of the biosphere -- and mankind -- will depend very much on whether those who assume control of the post - industrial world are committed to maintaining a small human population .
The goal of The Omega Project is to ensure that those who assume control of the post - industrial world will possess a commitment to a small , environmentally sustainable , global human population , and the knowledge to bring it about .
The Synarchic Movement
As the remarks of the preceding section indicate , there is at present no single organization that would appear to possess the characteristics required to play a significant role in planetary management in the post - industrial world .
There is , however , a long - standing movement whose goals and objectives are directed specifically toward the activity of planetary management .
That movement has had many names and manifestations throughout history , but in recent times ( the last 130 years ) its principal manifestation has been known as the synarchic movement , or synarchy .
The history of synarchy is rather long and complicated , and it is not the purpose of this article to describe it in any detail .
Some Internet web sites that present historical information on synarchy ( including earlier manifestations in concept but not in name ) are the following :
Saint - Yves d’Alveydre : Synarchy and Secret Societies , by Milko Bogaard , at http://www.rennes-discovery.com/Rennes_Alchemist/synarchy__by_milko_bogaard.htm .
New World Order : The Secret History , at http://www.geocities.com/newworldorder_themovie/theosophy.html .
New Dawn Magazine : Mystery of Shambhala , Part One , by Jason Jeffrey , at http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/mystery_of_shambhala_part_one.html .
An Introduction to the Ordre Martiniste et Synarchique , at http://www.orderofthegrail.org/introduction_om&s.htm .
Because knowledge of synarchy is not widespread , I will summarize some of its basic history / features / premises ( see Milko Bogaard ’s article for details ) .
Marquis Joseph Alexandre Saint - Yves d’Alveydre ( 1842-1909 ) , a French philosopher and political scientist , was alarmed at the rise of anarchy in the world , and developed the socio-political concept of synarchy in the early 1870s as a counter to it .
He presented the concept of synarchy in several books written in the 1880s .
The basic concept of synarchy is the establishment of a world government that is led by one institution and is based on fundamental spiritual and social principles .
In developing his concept of synarchy , Saint - Yves analyzed many different forms of government .
His ideas are similar to those expressed by Plato in his Republic , in that government is controlled by an elite group of enlightened individuals ( “ initiates ” ) .
This governing elite controls the religious , social , political and economic institutions .
A major source of inspiration for Saint - Yves was the Knights Templar ( predecessors of the Masons ) , which he regarded as history ’s ultimate expression of synarchism .
Another example of a synarchic society is the ancient Celts , whose leaders were the Druid wise men .
Because of the central role of religious philosophy , synarchy is a form of theocracy .
In 1885 , Saint - Yves was visited by a group of Indian philosophers , who introduced him to Indian - culture socio-political concepts stemming from the legend of Agharta ( or Agartha or Agarttha , or Shambhala , or Shangri-la ) .
Saint - Yves was impressed with these concepts , and in his later life wrote much on ancient culture .
He extended his original concept of synarchy to include the concept of hidden spiritual masters , adepts , and initiates .
His later writings did much to popularize Eastern occult culture to the Western world , and he strongly influenced many religious philosophers , including Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky , the founder of the Theosophical Society , and Gérard Anaclet Vincent Encausse ( “ Papus ” ) , founder ( with Saint - Yves ) of the Groupe Indépendent d’Etudes Esotériques ( “ School for Occult Sciences , ” later renamed Ecole Hermétique ) , the Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose + Croix , and the Ordre Martiniste ( “ Martinist Order ” ) .
Saint - Yves ’ writings influenced not only Blavatsky ’s work , but also that of Alice A. Bailey , Rudolf Steiner ( philosopher , scientist and educator ; founder of Anthroposophy , Waldorf Education , inspiration for Rudolf Steiner College ) , Max Heindel ( founder of the Rosicrucian Fellowship ) and many others , and heavily influenced today ’s “ New Age ” movement .
Synarchy was the essence of the social philosophy of the Martinist movement , which became very influential in the early part of the twentieth century , especially in Russia .
In 1934 , one of Papus ’ followers established the Ordre Martiniste et Synarchique .
Because of its similarity to Masonry , as the philosophy of Synarchy grew it attracted the attention of many Masons and there was some interaction between these organizations .
In 1934 an international federation of initiatic orders ( Rosicrucian , Martinist , and pseudoMasonic ) was established that accepted Synarchy as one of its principles ( the Universal Federation of Initiatic Orders and Societies , or ( from French initials ) FUDOSI ) .
In the early 1900s , a number of synarchist organizations were founded , including the International Synarchist Movement ( 1919 ) , the Pan- European Movement ( 1922 ) , and the Synarchist Empire Movement ( 1932 ) .
Through the 1920s and 1930s , initiatic orders were considered a growing threat to the governments of France and Germany , and all initiatic orders , societies and brotherhoods ( including Freemasonry ) were outlawed by the Vichy government .
The Ordre Martiniste et Synarchique exists today ( in small numbers ) in a number of countries .
The best - known synarchic organizations of the past are Freemasonry and Theosophy .
Freemasonry is large ( five million members worldwide ) , but Theosophy is small ( estimated 10,000 members worldwide ) .
Today , however , the most vibrant synarchic movements are the New Age Movement , Hinduism , Islam , and Judaism .
( In general , the Christianity of today is not a synarchic movement , since it embraces separation of religion and state .
It does , however , expect and await a New World Order and single planetary government . )
Organizations such as the United Nations , the European Union , and the North America Free Trade Association are not synarchic ( in the sense of Saint - Yves ) , since they have no theological basis ( nor are the latter two global in scope ) .
It is noted , however , that Saint - Yves viewed that the first step toward the establishment of a synarchic federation of states would be the establishment of an economic federation of states , such as the case of the European Union .
Saint - Yves described the concept of “ root races ” and the “ Great White Brotherhood , ” which were discussed at length by Blavatsky and others ( e.g. , Edgar Cayce ) .
A “ root race ” is a human species that occupies the planet for a long time .
The current human species ( homo sapiens ) is the fifth root race .
The term “ Great White Brotherhood ” ( or Universal White Brotherhood ) refers either to a legendary group of spiritual masters who monitor and guide the planet ’s human activities , or to various extant organizations that promote synarchic principles and approaches .
See the writings of Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov ( web sites http://www.videlinata.ch , http://www.prosveta.com , or http://www.revelation37.freeserve.co.uk/contents/aivanhov.htm ) for more information on the Great White Brotherhood and its philosophy .
There are many Internet web sites on root races .
Mme .
Blavatsky interpreted the concept of root races in a rather different sense from that which is generally accepted .
Her views on the relationship of the “ Aryan ” race to the “ fifth root race ” contributed to the philosophical foundations of Germany ’s Third Reich .
The point to this observation is not whether she was right or wrong , but that synarchy can have a tremendous impact in human affairs ( e.g. , its role in motivating Germany in the Second World War ) .
Concluding Remarks
o As global fossil fuels exhaust , human population will drop back to pre-fossil - fuel levels – on the order of a hundred million people .
Without positive action , the global population will decline to a large number ( e.g. , 100 million ) of very poor people , and all other large animals will be gone .
With positive action – effective planetary management – a human population of ten million people can be established , none of whom are in poverty : neither the five - million high - technology nation nor the five - million low - technology ( primitive , hunter - gatherer ) population distributed over the globe .
People who are not in poverty have better potential for spiritual development .
And , with early action , the planet ’s biodiversity can be saved .
o If a long - term sustainable population is to be established after global war , it will be necessary to destroy all remaining industrial facilities , planet - wide , except for those in the single - nation industrial population .
Many people have moral or religious objections to planetary management .
No major world religion is concerned with saving the planet ’s biodiversity .
The synarchic movement is concerned with the establishment of planetary government by a single organization controlled by authorities subscribing to religious principles .
The Church of Nature sets forth a theology that justifies and promotes responsible planetary management .
Its religious philosophy differs from classical synarchy in that it has no role for economics as a major element of a planetary management system .
o The Omega Project does not advocate or promote war as a solution to the planet ’s current environmental and ecological crisis .
It is the author ’s personal opinion that global war ( or some other major catastrophe ) is an inevitable consequence of global industrialization , and that the sooner such a war occurs the better it will be for the biosphere .
That opinion , however , is not the point .
The objective of The Omega Project is to ensure that , in the event that global war does occur and destroys or cripples global industrial civilization , the survivors will see the desirability of establishing a minimal - regret population on Earth .
If global war never occurs , The Omega Project will have probably been of little impact – a security precaution or contingency plan that was never needed , like a vaccination for a disease that never occurs , or a lifeboat for a ship that never sinks .
It is not clear how a minimal - regret population would ever be established unless some catastrophic event ( caused by human global industrialization ) occurred to motivate and enable it .
If global war does occur , however , The Omega Project will have served a crucially useful function – it will have clearly and unequivocally demonstrated the folly of large human population and global industrialization ( since global war did in fact occur ) , and it will have prepared ( sensitized , educated , and motivated ) the survivors to establish a minimal - regret population .
o The world has gotten itself into a terrible predicament , and monumental and immediate change will be required to fix the problem and save the biosphere from significant degradation ( and assure mankind ’s long - term survival as part of it ) .
Because of the “ overshoot ” phenomenon it is expected that industrial civilization will collapse very suddenly and to a very high degree ; and when it does , it is the intention of The Omega Project that the survivors will be prepared to move quickly , and with purpose and conviction and certainty , to a long - term sustainable world of responsible planetary management .
Mankind was doomed when its activity reached the point at which it significantly affected , and began to cause significant changes to , the planet ’s biosphere .
The minimal - regret population will represent a return to a situation in which mankind ’s presence has a negligible impact on the biosphere .
The pollution and massive species loss will stop .
The gross intermingling of humanity that has led to the HIV / AIDS pandemic will cease .
At that point , mankind ’s long - term survival will be assured .

Longtime followers of the Southern California punk rock scene should well remember the Cuckoo ’s Nest , one of the key punk clubs of the late ' 70s and early ' 80s and one of the few places a punk band could find a paying gig .
The Cuckoo 's Nest and its colorful owner , Jerry Roach , are the focus of a new documentary , " We Were Feared , " that 's slated for a pair of screenings at the upcoming Newport Beach Film Festival .
The club hosted touring acts including the Ramones , Iggy Pop and David Johansen and Southland stalwarts such as Black Flag , Fear , the Circle Jerks , the Vandals and TSOL during its brief three - year life as a punk rock haven .
It closed in 1981 following ongoing disputes with neighbors and city officials who objected to leather - jacketed , spiky haired kids with tattoos who frequented the club .
Full disclosure :
As a writer assigned to covering pop music in Orange County for The Times starting in 1981 , I covered the Cuckoo 's Nest regularly and was one of many sources interviewed by the makers of " We Were Feared , " although I have n't seen the film yet .
One of my most vivid memories of the wild nights of slam dancing and stage diving I witnessed at the Cuckoo 's Nest was at a show headlined by Fear .
I was milling around the concrete floor in front of the battle - scarred stage waiting for the band to go on when a firm hand clamped down on my shoulder .
An ominous - looking guy with an equally ominous - sounding voice said , " Are you Randy Lewis ?
Lee Ving wants to see you . "
Immediately I started wondering whether something I 'd written earlier in the week about the group 's upcoming show had angered the group 's volatile lead singer .
Instead , when I found Ving backstage , he was all smiles and simply wanted to thank me for giving the group some attention in The Times .
The sigh of relief I let out is probably still hovering somewhere over Costa Mesa .
" We Were Feared , " directed by Jonathan W.C. Mills and produced by Roach and York Shackleton , will screen April 25 and April 29 at Edwards Island Theater at Fashion Island in Newport Beach .
Roach also produced a short documentary in 1983 about the punk scene at the Cuckoo 's Nest ; that one was called " Urban Struggle . "
Of the irony of the premiere in tony Newport about the gritty scene three decades ago in an industrial section of Costa Mesa , Roach quips , " They ’ll be sorry for inviting me back . "

DETROIT —
The first detailed financial report from General Motors since its bankruptcy showed a company that has largely stanched the hemorrhaging in its day - to - day business , but is still cleaning up problems left over from its collapse last year .
G.M. said Wednesday that it had positive cash flow of $ 1 billion in the six months after it emerged from bankruptcy protection last July , but that it lost $ 4.3 billion in that period , mostly because of the cost of settling with the United Auto Workers union over retiree health benefits , one of the burdens that helped bring the company to its knees .
The automaker said that with those matters behind it and the economy improving , it could make a profit in 2010 , echoing previous predictions .
Officials said the company made progress toward that goal in the first quarter , without being specific .
“ It would be a really impressive achievement if they were able to make a profit , ” said Rebecca Lindland , an analyst with the research firm IHS Global Insight .
“ They ’ve been able to do an awful lot , and all of those things should lead to a profitable picture . ”
Kratos is starting to look long in the tooth .
His gruff growl , his single - minded pursuit of the gods , his willingness to destroy everything between himself and his goal ... at the beginning of God of War 3 we already know who he is .
We know how he got there .
The only question for the Ghost of Sparta is simple : what next ?
As God of War 3 begins , Kratos is laying siege to Mount Olympus , leading an attack on the gods using the Titans as living weapons .
Zeus and a few others look down at the coming threat , and begin their defense .
Riding on Gaia 's back , aching for blood , it seems Kratos is close to achieving what passes for his dreams .
I 'm playing God of War 3 , taking notes on what I 'm seeing in the first moments of the game .
The first section dares the player to ask " if this is how it begins , how the hell will it end ? "
You know this game
If you have played a God of War game in the past , you 'll be perfectly at home in this world .
The controls are what you expect , meaning you can jump in and start perfecting your combos instantly .
The quick - time events that continue to split gamers are back in full force .
The formula is not shaken up in the last game of this trilogy .
The difference in God of War 3 is the power of the PlayStation 3 .
Beautiful graphics can't make a bad game good , but they can certainly make a good game great .
The scale of the first minutes of the new God of War is indescribable .
You 're riding on the body of a great moving Titan , the ground shifting and turning as Gaia climbs the mountain .
You 're attacked by Poseidon , who assaults both you and the Titan with a swirling , chaotic , watery horse that has the legs of a crab .
Poseidon attacks both you and the Titan you 're riding , and some of the Titans you 've mustered have already fallen .
The gods are n't called such ironically .
You 'll fight Poseidon in multiple guises , in multiple places , and there is some light puzzle solving .
There 's nothing that will come as much of a surprise ; the game reminds me of watching Avatar for the first time .
There is so much going on around the screen , with so much attention to both scope and detail — when many games struggle to deliver one or the other — your eye can see something interesting almost anywhere .
The game is exhausting to play on a big - screen television with a surround sound system — the intensity is so numbing .
So what has changed ?
The gameplay is back from previous games , with a few tweaks .
Now the button presses from the quick - time events pop up on the sides of the screen , on their respective sides .
This is a very nice trick , as it allows you to keep your eyes focused on the middle of the screen where the action is taking place without missing the button presses .
You can now respond based on placement instead of having to look to see what button to hit .
Quick - time events are what they are , but this adjustment does make them more tolerable , and what Kratos does to his enemies as you hit these buttons makes their inclusion worthwhile .
Like other God of War titles , the violence is front and center .
When you finally overcome the opposition of Poseidon , fighting through and watching some achingly beautiful scenes , you simply beat the god to a bloody pulp with your hands .
The twist ?
You watch this savagery through the eyes of Poseidon himself , watching the blows coming at you .
At the end , you 're asked to press down on both analog sticks in a sick attempt at verisimilitude : when you push down on both stick Kratos pops the eyes of Poseidon with his thumbs .
There ends the section I 'm allowed to discuss .
The game is in reviewers ' hands , and we 're all excitedly playing what is one of the most anticipated games of the year .
The opening section of the game is so breathless , so large and impressive , that there remains the fair question of how it can be topped later in the game .
Of course , we 've said the same thing before about past releases in this series , and we know the team is up to the task .
God of War 3 is out , exclusively on PlayStation 3 , March 16 .
April 26 , 2010
I 'M DESTROYING freedom .
Jim DeMint says so -- in his appropriately titled book Saving Freedom : We Can Stop America 's Slide into Socialism .
I 'm not destroying freedom alone .
I have help .
For example , from a majority of the U.S. population -- DeMint calls them " drug addicts " ( page 44 ) who can't stop using the government .
Also in on the plot is " almost all of the organized political power in America today , [ which ] is on the side of a larger , more centralized , more socialist government " ( page 50 ) .
So ... that 's me , 150 million - plus people , " almost all " of the U.S. political establishment -- we 're all of us driving the country into the abyss , according to the Republican senator from South Carolina and toast of the Tea Partiers .
Still , I come in for a larger share of the blame than most .
In Saving Freedom , DeMint has decided to illustrate what 's wrong with socialism by quoting from an old edition of my book The Case for Socialism .
Early on ( page 10 ) , he focuses on an especially sinister statement by me :
Socialism is based on the idea that we should use the vast resources of society to meet people 's needs .
It seems so obvious -- that if people are hungry , they should be fed ; that if people are homeless , we should build homes for them ; that if people are sick , all the advances in medical technology should be available to them .
A socialist society would take the immense wealth of the rich and use it to meet the basic needs of all society .
The money wasted on weapons could be used to end poverty , homelessness , and all other forms of scarcity .
To the untrained eye , that might not sound so bad .
It might even sound like a good idea .
Perhaps feeding people who are hungry could even advance the cause of freedom -- by liberating them from , you know , starvation and death .
Not so .
The vision of a society without hunger and homelessness , based on the principles equality and solidarity -- this , DeMint insists , is a perversion of freedom , a distortion of " this elusive treasure [ that ] has thrived in the United States " and made America " the envy of the world . " ( pages 57 , 31 ) .
We socialists -- in spite of our " good intentions " ( page 11 ) - - have twisted the meaning of freedom :

Socialists are now marching under the banner of a new secular - progressive style of freedom : the freedom from responsibility , the freedom to behave destructively without moral judgment , the freedom from risk and failure , the freedom from want , the freedom from religion , and the freedom to have material equality with those who work harder and accomplish more .
( page 8 )
WHEN I first read about this banner of bad - freedom that I 've apparently been marching around with , I wondered if maybe DeMint had me confused with someone else .
Like maybe a Wall Street executive , or the head of the coal mining company Massey Energy .
Because the bad - freedoms that we socialists supposedly champion seem like pretty apt descriptions for how those in charge of a capitalist society operate every day .
" Freedom from responsibility " ?
Massey Energy CEO
Don Blankenship spends millions of dollars on politicians , judges and lawyers to make sure he does n't bear much , if any , responsibility for the fate of the people who mine coal for him .
Or the fate of a planet suffering from the climate change that Blankenship thinks is an environmentalist hoax .
" Freedom to behave destructively without moral judgment " ?
That 's exactly what the Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Goldman Sachs of doing when it created mega - investments that were designed to fail -- for the benefit of some hedge fund managers and , oh yes , the bankers who collected huge fees from everybody involved .
" Freedom from risk and failure " ?
The big banks that were pulled back from the brink when the U.S. government bailed out Wall Street are up to their old tricks again by all accounts , because anybody who 's paid attention for the past two years knows they 're " too big to fail . "
And if Republicans like Jim DeMint get their way , the bankers wo n't even have to abide by the Democrats ' way - too - tame financial reform proposals .
" Freedom to have material equality with those who work harder and accomplish more " ?
The ranks of the super - rich are filled with people who never had to do an honest day 's work in their lives and whose only " accomplishment " worth speaking of was getting born to super - rich parents .
They do n't have " material equality " with the rest of us -- they 're much , much better off than the vast majority of people who have to scramble to get by .
That 's the problem with freedom in the world according to Jim DeMint .
Some people have a lot of it -- but for the rest of us , not so much .
The bankers , the CEOs , the trust - fund children , the political elite that shuttle back and forth between Washington and the corporate boardrooms -- they have the freedom to do most anything they choose , to live where they want and how they want , to satisfy any whim .
For the majority of people who do n't live in this world of wealth and power , our freedoms are much more limited .
We 're free not to work for a particular company , but we 're not free not to work .
We 're free to spend or save what we earn from working , but we 're not free to expect that either will necessarily meet all our needs , even after a lifetime of work .
We 're free to buy environmentally sustainable products , but we 're not free to change the wider economic system to make it sustainable .
In short , most people in society are n't free to determine their destiny in any number of ways .
They 're subject to conditions of life that they have little say about -- conditions that are mostly shaped by that little group of people who have a lot of freedom , and keep it to themselves .
THE PROBLEMS with Jim DeMint 's freedom double standards become more obvious when he presents his view of American history ( a questionable view , but a concise one - - he gets from 1776 to the Reagan years in under nine pages ) .
To him , the first germs of the coming socialist contagion took hold " soon after the thirteen states ceded ' limited ' power to the federal government in 1787 . " ( page 30 )
In fact , according to DeMint , America was only really free before it was the United States :
Before the American Revolution , freedom was second nature to Americans .
It was bred into our DNA long before the Declaration of Independence and the signing of our Constitution .
Established as trading colonies , America was built on capitalism and free trade .
Americans were people of good character and strong faith who came to the New World seeking freedom of religion .
( page 30 )
Personally , I 'm not sure I 'd vouch for the good character of every person who " came to the New World . "
But more significantly , you 've probably noticed a few omissions in that passage .
Such as : If Americans were the people " who came to the New World , " what about the people who lived in the " New World " before it was the " New World " ?
What about the Native Americans ?
In the name of capitalism and free trade , they were driven from their homes , killed outright in horrific numbers , and forced into penal colonies with the innocuous - sounding name of " reservations . "
Their freedom appears to have been expendable .
And another question :
What about the slaves ?
They did n't come to the " New World " seeking freedom of religion , " did they ?
They were kidnapped from Africa by the millions , forced to endure the unspeakable brutality of the Middle Passage and , if they survived , perform backbreaking labor , without freedoms of any kind , nor the prospect of attaining any .
Unsurprisingly , slavery does n't figure in DeMint 's version of U.S. history .
The topic comes up exactly once , in a half - sentence a page later : " After the Civil War , which was the result of America 's failure to apply our principles of freedom to slave labor ... " ( page 31 )
There 's more to the rest of that sentence -- something about expanding government bureaucracies , blah , blah .
But I 'm sure you 'll agree that the first part raises a few questions .
" Failure to apply our principles of freedom to slave labor ... "
Does it give DeMint any pause to consider that half of the America where " freedom was second nature " -- the more prosperous and politically powerful half -- had " failed to apply the principles of freedom " ?
What about the fact that the author of the document he swipes as a preface for his book -- Thomas Jefferson 's Declaration of Independence , of course - -" failed to apply the principles of freedom " ?
And what exactly does it mean to " apply our principles of freedom to slave labor " anyway ?
Could that be done in any other way except by abolishing slavery ?
If not , then does DeMint think the Civil War was a good thing ?
A bad thing ?
There 's actually a lesson here -- though you wo n't find it in DeMint 's book .
In the case of the abolition of slavery , the expansion of freedom required a vast struggle against a political system in the South that claimed to stand for freedom .
That struggle did n't just happen .
It took the actions of millions of people -- slaves themselves , the abolitionists who opposed slavery , Northerners in the Union Army - - to achieve freedom .
The same has been true throughout the history of the U.S. or any other country -- from the abolition of slavery , to women winning the right to vote , to workers gaining the right to organize unions , and on and on .
To quote Frederick Douglass -- whose expertise on the subject of freedom is much superior to Jim DeMint 's : " The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle ...
If there is no struggle , there is no progress . "
Jim DeMint 's freedom fraud becomes clear when you see whose freedom he cares about , and whose he does n't .
He cares about " saving freedom " for the few -- especially the freedom of the few to own and control the biggest economic institutions in a capitalist society , and therefore to subject much larger numbers of people to having less freedom in every aspect of their lives .
THAT'S NOT the only problem I have with the world according to Jim DeMint .
There are so , so many others .
Maybe I should start a blog .
For example , DeMint seems to be under the impression that I 'm a member of the Democratic Party .
He quotes my book again -- on the importance of socialists organizing at the grassroots ( page 49 ) -- in the midst of a section about the alleged crimes of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party .
But Obama is quite insistent that he is n't a socialist , and I think he has a point .
If you go through the list of the senior officials in his Treasury Department , for example , very few would call themselves socialists .
Many , on the other hand , would call themselves former executives of Goldman Sachs .
The reason that DeMint throws my case for socialism into a chapter about the Democrats is because he identifies socialism with " big government , " and the Democrats , he insists , are the party of " big government . "
This is where the real purpose of Saving Freedom becomes clearer -- as a calculated contribution to the right wing 's current political strategy .
DeMint and the Republicans want to smear the policies they oppose with the lingering taint of 1950s McCarthyism .
Thus , DeMint gives a highly misleading definition of socialism as " a socioeconomic system in which property and the distribution of wealth are subject to control by the government . " ( page 28 )
It 's true that socialism is associated with state control of the economy .
But that does n't mean that all state control is socialist .
The first question to ask whenever the government has a role in the economy or society is :
Who owns the state ?
If the state is shaped by business interests that exert their influence through campaign contributions and lobbying -- or if the state is run by a small class of party bosses , using the name of socialism , but presiding over a system of repression and exploitation , as in the ex-USSR -- then that is n't socialism .
Any more than this society deserves to be called a democracy because most , but not all , the people who live in it get to vote every few years .
There is n't a serious discussion about socialism in Saving Freedom - - not in a book where every fact is twisted to serve DeMint 's agenda , and every political question is jammed into the confines of his narrow world .
It 's telling that the chapter on how DeMint got involved in national politics starts with a solemn retelling of an episode of the old Andy Griffith Show - - one that ends with Andy 's son Opie learning a lesson about standing up to bullies , which DeMint claims has guided his political career .
Now , it 's weird enough when a grown man claims to have learned life lessons from a fictional child on a sit - com made half a century ago .
But when those lessons have political overtones , things get really creepy .
As you may remember , the Andy Griffith Show is about life in a fictional small town in North Carolina .
It broadcast its first show in October 1960 .
Something else happened in North Carolina in 1960 .
On February 1 , four Black students sat in at a segregated Woolworth 's lunch counter in Greensboro .
They set off a tide of sit - in protests that swept across the state and then the South in a few months , kicking the civil rights movement into high gear .
The years during which the Andy Griffith Show was broadcast ( 1960 to 1968 ) were years when history was made -- when one of the most significant grassroots struggles in the world triumphed over the system of American apartheid .
But you 'd never know it from the Andy Griffith Show .
It was set in the South during the high point of the civil rights struggle , and never portrayed a Black character in any prominent role .
That gives you a sense of the world according to Jim DeMint .
It 's not one that necessarily welcomes Black people , for one thing -- and it 's certainly not one that values dissent or struggle .
But hey , maybe I 'm wrong .
Maybe Senator Jim can explain to me why the Andy Griffith Show is inclusive , like his vision for America .
Maybe he can convince me why it 's a dire threat to freedom to look forward to a socialist society that ends hunger and homelessness and poverty forever .
I invite him to respond .
I have some pull at SocialistWorker.org -- we 'd happily publish a debate on our Web site .
I 'll meet for a public forum in Washington , or maybe on neutral turf somewhere between South Carolina and Chicago .
Let 's thrash this out .
He thinks that socialism is destroying freedom .
I think that capitalism makes a mockery of any possibility of genuine freedom or democracy .
Bring it on .
One of the challenges in rationally implementing higher parking fees for periods of higher occupancy is the instinctive feeling , typically by merchants , that this will hurt their business .
I ’m all for the plight of the small merchant but , as per John Van Horn ’s usual line of thinking ( e.g. , this post ) , there ’s usually a problem with this : 1 . ) Charging more for places where parking is dear helps create more parking , and more customers ; and 2 . )
Those same small merchants are often the ones occupying the parking that scarce parking .
This latter observation is drawn from many sources , including what ’s right in front of me :
The white Lexus that the guys at the pork store across the street tend to park there for hours on end ( they drive in from one of the islands , Staten or Long ) .
This usual dynamic was on display in an article about ( no ) Park Slope ’s recent “ Smart Parking ” demonstration program , as reported by my local rag :
Schaller had come to the meeting seeking feedback on the Park Smart program , which hiked parking fees last April as part of an effort to reduce traffic and create turnover at parking spots on Fifth Avenue between Sackett and Third streets , and on Seventh Avenue from Lincoln Place to Sixth Street .
But the feedback from the roughly 25 people in attendance was near - unanimous : “ Do n’t raise the fee ! ”
“ Merchants are suffering , ” said Irene Lo Re , the director of the Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District .
“ I ’ve never seen a year as bad as 2009 .
People change their behavior over a couple of dollars — are you going to completely push us out of business ? ”
Couple of problems here .
Merchants are suffering , indeed , but so is everyone else :
There ’s a recession on .
Second is that given that driving in New York City is a decidedly luxury endeavor ( I ’ll send you my insurance bill ) , people driving cars should n’t be worrying about spending an extra 50 cents to park at peak hours — and if they are , they need to examine their finances a bit more carefully .
Lastly , another way to look at this is that many people , myself included , go out of their way to avoid Park Slope for any kind of consuming activity , precisely because there is never anywhere to park .
Given all the opposition ( or at least the 25 people ) , the program must have failed , no ?
Still , Lo Re had to admit that the numbers did show that Park Smart had improved available parking in the neighborhood , thereby opening spaces for more potential customers .
A study by the city compared parking behavior before the program was implemented and November — and found that people parked for five minutes less on Fifth Avenue and nine minutes less on Seventh Avenue .
Success equals failure — only in parking .
Former Goldman
Sachs clients are coming out of the woodwork with complaints that the notorious bank bet against them too .
Including the country of Ghana -- or rather its former largest company , Ashanti Gold ( via Credit Writedowns ) :
Ghana Web :
In 1998 , Ashanti Gold was the 3rd largest Gold Mining company in the world .
The first " black " company on the London Stock Exchange , Ashanti had just purchased the Geita mine in Tanzania , positioning Ashanti to become even larger .
But in May 1999 , the Treasury of the United Kingdom decided to sell off 415 tons of its gold reserves .
With all that gold flooding the world market , the price of gold began to decline .
By August 1999 , the price of gold had fallen to $ 252 / ounce , the lowest it had been in 20 years .
Ashanti turned to its Financial Advisors - Goldman Sachs - for advice .
Goldman Sachs recommended that Ashanti purchase enormous hedge contracts - " bets " on the price of gold .
Simplifying this somewhat , it was similar to when a homeowner ' locks in ' a price for heating oil months in advance .
Goldman recommended that Ashanti enter agreements to sell gold at a ' locked - in ' price , and suggested that the price of gold would continue to fall .
But Goldman was more than just Ashanti's advisors .
They were also sellers of these Hedge contracts , and stood to make money simply by selling them .
And they were also world - wide sellers of Gold itself .
In September 1999 ( one month later ) , 15 European Banks with whom Goldman had professional relationships made a unanimous surprise announcement that all 15 would stop selling gold on world markets for 5 years .
The announcement immediately drove up gold prices to $ 307 / ounce , and by October 6 , it had risen to $ 362/ ounce .
The full article at Ghana Web tells how Ashanti was driven to bankruptcy and sold to AngloGold .
What really gets at the Ghanaian author and several hundred commenters is that every character in the story , down to the British gold company , was represented by Goldman Sachs .
Of course , there 's nothing necessarily illegal about betting against a client -- Ghana or ACA .
It depends on the exact circumstances .
But this is the aspect of the Goldman SEC charges that will piss off past and future clients .

Oregon , the first state to decriminalize marijuana in the modern era and one of the first to approve a medical marijuana law , could become a battleground for marijuana reform again this year .
Two separate initiatives , one aimed at improving the state 's existing medical marijuana program , and one that seeks to legalize and regulate marijuana and hemp , are campaigning to be certified for the November ballot .
The medical marijuana initiative , I - 28 , would create a system of state - regulated dispensaries and state - licensed medical marijuana producers .
Dispensaries would have to be Oregon nonprofits , and pay a $ 2,000 license fee and a 10 % tax on gross sales .
Licensed producers would have to pay a $ 1,000 license fee and the 10 % tax .
Patients registered under the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program would be able to buy their supplies at any dispensary , and dispensaries would be able to buy from any licensed producer .
I - 28 would not stop patients from growing their own , nor would it impede them from resorting to a caregiver , as they can do currently .
" Our medical marijuana law lacks an effective supply system , " said John Sajo of Voter Power , the group behind both the passage of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act in 1998 and the current initiative to reform it .
" The law is pretty good on keeping patients from getting arrested , but has produced very mixed results in terms of actually getting patients their medicine .
A supply system that relies on patients producing their own medicine is primitive .
Instead , we 'd like to do it like California , where they can go to a dispensary and have myriad choices , " he said .
The current system , which does not allow for medical marijuana sales , results in thousands of patients begging their medicine from other patients , Sajo said , and leaves thousands more with without an adequate supply or with no supply at all .
" The law works well for you if you live on a farm or have good social skills , but if you 're terminally ill in a hospice , you might be out of luck , " he said .
But the California dispensary system is often criticized in Oregon as little more than money - grubbing capitalism at odds with Oregon values that exploits patients .
The Oregon medical marijuana community contains a sizeable contingent that holds to beliefs and values that might seem quaint or unusual in the rest of the country , especially in light of the recent debate over health care reform : that patients should not have to pay for their medicine and that no one should be profiting from sick patients .
" We face a barrage of criticism that we will be exploiting patients and selling medicine at top dollar , but we 've done everything we can to structure the system to avoid that , " said Sajo .
" We will be taking the best from California and avoiding the worst .
There are places there , like Harborside and the Berkeley Patients Group , that are excellent members of the community , that fund social services , that provide high - quality labeled medicine .
I think our Oregon dispensary system , with its uniform statewide regulation , will tend to create a system like that rather than one like in Los Angeles , with its fly - by - night dispensaries . "
Competing with I - 28 for the interest and dollars of the marijuana community , as well as national reform groups , is the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act ( OCTA ) initiative campaign , which would legalize and deregulate hemp production , provide for licensed marijuana cultivation with the crop to be purchased by the state , and provide for sale to adults through a system of state stores .
Its ballot summary reads as follows :
" ... Measure replaces state , local marijuana laws except medical marijuana and driving under the influence laws ; distinguishes ' hemp ' from ' marijuana ' ; prohibits regulation of hemp .
Creates agency to license marijuana cultivation by qualified persons and to purchase entire crop .
Agency sells marijuana at cost to pharmacies , medical research facilities , and to qualified adults for profit through state stores .
Ninety percent of net proceeds goes to state general fund , remainder to drug education , treatment , hemp promotion .
Bans sales to , possession by minors .
Bans public consumption except where signs permit , minors barred .
Agency to regulate use , set prices , other duties ; Attorney General to defend against federal challenges / prosecution .
Provides penalties .
Effective January 1 , 2011 "
The charge for OCTA is being led by Oregon NORML .
The time is right , said Oregon NORML executive director Madeline Martinez .
" Our position is that our initiative is the right initiative at the right time , " said Martinez .
" We are emphasizing the Oregon cannabis control commission and the industrial hemp angle .
With hemp , we can get some green jobs going . "
" Paul Stanford is funding a lot of this effort , " said Martinez , referring to the medical marijuana entrepreneur who operates clinics in four states -- Oregon , Washington , Colorado , and Michigan -- under the auspices of The Hemp Cannabis Foundation .
Stanford also heads the Campaign for the Restoration and Regulation of Hemp ( CRRH ) , a political action committee , which will be helping to fund the initiative effort .
But while signature gathering for I - 28 is well underway , OCTA has yet to begin signature gathering -- and the clock is ticking toward a July 2 deadline .
OCTA has been delayed by a last - minute challenge to its ballot title , which the Oregon Supreme Court just resolved yesterday .
That leaves I - 28 much better positioned at this point to actually make the November ballot .
" Oregon law requires that we turn in signatures gathered by paid signature gatherers monthly , " said Sajo .
" We turned in 60,000 signatures in January , 7,000 more in February , 8,000 more in March , and an additional 15,000 signatures gathered by volunteers .
That means we 've collected over 90,000 signatures , and since we only need 82,000 to qualify , now we 're working on the buffer .
We are aiming at 120,000 to 130,000 .
If we turn in signatures by May 21 , the state will verify those we 've turned in and tell us how many are valid , and we will still have until the July 2 deadline to collect any more that we need . "
" We have a little over 90 days to gather all the OCTA signatures , and that will put a squeeze on us , but our campaign is ready and we 've got everybody at the starting gate ready to run out and gather them once we get the go - ahead , " said Martinez .
" We are still confident about our prospects . "
" We are currently in the process of collecting pledges from people who really want to sign the petitions , " said OCTA director of field operations Kyndall Mason .
" Our ballot title was challenged , and that 's being deliberated on the fast - track by the state Supreme Court , but this delay is not helpful .
Still , we 've been laying low and building grassroots support . "
It 's not just grassroots support .
In addition to the dollars coming from Paul Stanford , OCTA can also count on some out - of - state support , including a series of six concerts by musician John Trudell , and appearances by national NORML officers .
NORML founder Keith Stroup has already been out campaigning , the organization has committed to a small campaign donation , and NORML will hold its annual conference this year in Portland , or " Potland , " as some Oregon activists are referring to it .
And OCTA activists continue to seek support .
" We 're in the process of outreach to national groups , " said Mason .
" We 're getting individual donations , and we have some house parties lined up , but thanks to Paul Stanford we have a lot of funding right now . "
Like I - 28 , OCTA needs 82,769 valid signatures by July 2 to make the November ballot .
But because of the ballot title challenge , OCTA is going to have to collect them in a compressed time period .
" We think we 'll start signature gathering in mid-April , and we 're pretty confident we will be able to turn in enough to qualify .
We want to collect 125,000 signatures to have that margin of comfort , " said Mason .
" We do n't see any reason to postpone this at this point .
All of us really agree that now is the time to capture the momentum that is out there . "
As with OCTA , money is a concern for I - 28 , too .
Voter Power is taking on the bulk of responsibility for financing the campaign , said Sajo .
" We did get a Marijuana Policy Project grant and we just got a small grant from the Drug Policy Alliance ( DPA ) , but otherwise , we 're just raising money from small contributors and from our medical marijuana clinics . "
" Our grants program approved $ 25,000 to help I - 28 qualify for the ballot , " confirmed DPA executive director Ethan Nadelmann .
" We 've done our due diligence , and our sense is that this initiative is a winner .
It will help resolve a bunch of issues with the Oregon medical marijuana program . "
Voter Power operates four clinics in Oregon , said Sajo , but he also noted that the medical marijuana business has become more competitive .
" Our market share is declining at the same time we are trying to fund this political effort , " he said .
There is some tension between the two initiative campaigns -- OCTA supporters accuse an I - 28 advocate of doing the last - minute ballot title challenge that has delayed their signature - gathering -- and leaders of both campaigns are striving to minimize them , but have n't quite mastered that old adage about " if you ca n't say something nice ... "
" Oregon NORML does n't take a stand on I - 28 , " said Martinez , but could n't resist adding : " Dispensaries are so '90s .
There is such a small segment of Oregonians who could create revenue from the dispensaries in comparison to the 357,000 Oregonians who consume cannabis .
If we 're looking at this from a revenue perspective and we 're serious , it 's only logical to look at the larger population , and that 's cannabis consumers , not medical marijuana patients . "
" We have n't taken a formal position on OCTA , " said Voter Power 's Sajo .
" Informally , we 'd like to see something like that happen , but we 're not sure the timing is right to do it this year .
We do support taxing and regulating marijuana , and we 'll vote for it if it qualifies , but in terms of strategies for our movement , trying to do two initiatives at the same time divides our resources and creates confusion .
We do n't think OCTA is ready for prime - time . "
But for many Oregon activists the internecine sniping is beside the point .
" We absolutely support both initiatives , " said Melanie Bariskis of Southern Oregon NORML , " but the problem is that OCTA is not yet ready for circulation .
Right now , we are pushing I - 28 and gathering signatures for it .
We support OCTA philosophically , and we will support it with signature gathering when it is ready . "
We will know by early July whether either , neither , or both initiatives make the November ballot .
Perhaps by then , Oregon 's medical and recreational marijuana communities can take those rifles they 're using in their circular firing squads and begin aiming them at their real foes .
A Democrat - sponsored bill before the House of Representatives represents the most sweeping effort at deficit reduction in over a decade .
Said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer :
It is the largest deficit reduction measure … since Clinton ’s budget in 1993 , which ushered in the great economy of the 1990s .
This historic move to lower the US deficit reduces it by $ 138 billion in just a single decade and is projected to save the country an unprecedented $ 1.2 TRILLION over the next 20 years according to Congressional Budget Office estimates released this week .
As usual , this impressive legislation to reduce our national deficit is being condemned across the board by Republicans .
Rep. Phil Gingrey ( R - GA ) said :
“ It costs too much . ”
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Tanfast ) strangely suggested on Thursday that Americans should demand that Congress NOT lower the national deficit :
“ It ’s not too late for the American people to continue to speak up .
They need to yell a little louder , and we can stop this . ”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) issued a direct threat to Democrats over their attempt to reduce the country ’s skyrocketing deficit :
“ Every election this fall will be a referendum on this bill ”
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor went a step farther :
“ Make no mistake this vote that …this …is a betrayal of the American people …
As the leader said we ’re going to do everything we can to make sure that this bill does not pass . ”
Sources note that this historic deficit - reduction package has a side benefit of ensuring 95 % of Americans have health insurance .
I ’m just sayin ’ …

Thanks !
-- When Mikael Samuelsson signed with the Vancouver Canucks as a free agent last summer , it was n't exactly an attention - grabbing move on par with Marian Gaborik and the Rangers , or Marian Hossa and the Blackhawks .
But at three years and $ 7.5 million , Samuelsson has been a bargain .
Teammates rave about what he 's brought to the Canucks after spending four seasons with the Detroit Red Wings .
Besides leadership and Stanley Cup experience , he also contributed a career - high 30 goals while playing mostly on the second line , a stark contrast to his time in Detroit , where Samuelsson was a third - line player who did n't get anywhere near as much power - play time as he has in Vancouver .
" He 's been great that way , " Henrik Sedin said of Samuelsson 's offense .
" We know he 's kind of an offensive talent to score more than he has .
He was put in a different situation here , playing on the second line , more power play , and he 's stepped up .
" It 's carried over to the Stanley Cup Playoffs , too .
Samuelsson leads the League with 7 goals during the postseason -- he 's scored in each of the first five games -- and he scored twice in the Canucks ' 7 - 2 victory in Game 5 Friday that gave Vancouver a 3 - 2 lead against the Kings in their Western Conference Quarterfinal series .
The series shifts to Los Angeles for Sunday night 's Game 6 at Staples Center ( 9 p.m. ET , Versus , CBC ) .
" When pucks go in for you , you see a lot of net .
And I see a lot of the net right now , " Samuelsson said .
" I 'm not going to lie .
I feel comfortable and I feel comfortable with my shot and the way I play .
" The Canucks went to the first intermission of Game 4 trailing 1 - 0 , and coach Alain Vigneault decided to make a move .
He replaced Alexandre Burrows with Samuelsson on the top line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin , and it paid dividends in the third period .
Samuelsson tied the game at 4 - 4 early in the third period , and while he was n't on the ice for Henrik 's game - winner with 2:52 remaining , the line clearly had life it was lacking for most of the previous two games .
" Sometimes you 've got to make some adjustments here and there , " Vigneault said .
" Samuelsson was going well and the twins needed to pick up their game a little bit , and I thought that sparked them a little bit for the remainder of the game .
" When asked if his presence on the top line was what made the difference , Samuelsson deadpanned , " Pretty much , " before eventually cracking a smile .
" No , no .
Absolutely not .
Once in a while , it 's both mental and you need to see something else , I guess .
It 's going to be good for both me and the twins .
" Samuelsson 's offensive punch has been a bonus .
It 's not as though he was n't expected to score at all when he got to Vancouver , but it was his influence in the locker room -- and maybe even his sarcastic sense of humor -- that was a big selling point for the Canucks .
In that sense , he 's been worth every penny .
" I think over the course of the season , he 's been great , " Henrik said .
" There 's a lot of ups and downs , and I think going through it in Detroit , where maybe he did n't have a lot of downs , but in the playoffs he knows what it takes .
He knows it 's not going to be an easy road .
You 're going to be down in games and down in series .
Sometimes you 're going to think you 're out of it but you have to keep doing the same things . "
" Mikael 's one of our veteran players with a lot of playoff experience , " Vigneault said .
" He 's real good on the ice but he 's also real good in the room with helping our guys handle the moment , and obviously ( in Game 4 ) he had another real big game for us .
" In our meetings where we discuss certain elements that we need to do , he always has a good knowledge of what 's going and he 's not afraid to share it with the group .
" When he 's asked about his time in Detroit or how this Canucks team compares to his Red Wings teams that went to the Stanley Cup Final the last two seasons , Samuelsson does n't exactly jump to answer them .
He usually says politely that he'd rather not talk about Detroit and he'd rather keep the focus on the Canucks , a team he believes can go the distance this year .
" I see obviously a good team , " Samuelsson said .
" I do n't see just one good line .
We have depth here .
If we play our system like we should , we should go far . "

Ever since Nick Clegg launched his line on a hung Parliament – that he would talk to the party that won the “ strongest mandate ” and was keeping all options open – the question has been asked ( though not by the public ) : does that mean the party with most votes or the party with most seats ?
And ever since Nick has been asked that question , he has studiously refused to answer it .
He stonewalled Paxman on Monday , and at the Lib Dem manifesto launch today .
And you know what ?
He ’s absolutely right to refuse to be drawn .
Here ’s why : the crazy British electoral system throws up so many possible permutations , it is impossible to give a definite answer .
Let ’s just take one example of a plausible election result to show why Nick Clegg should decline the kind invitation of the media to tie himself in pointless knots of speculation .
Conservatives 36 % , Labour 34 % , Lib Dems 22 %
This scenario would see the Tories win most votes , yet emerge with perhaps only 255 MPs to Labour ’s 310 – which would mean that even with the Lib Dems ’ c.60 seats , any kind of Lib Dem - Tory deal would lack a majority in the House of Commons .
Labour certainly would n’t have the strongest mandate in that case – but the Tories would n’t have enough seats either .
I could go on all night working through the various psephelogical possibilities … and that ’s fine because I ’m just a blogger on the internet .
But the idea that Nick Clegg , as leader of the UK ’s third largest political party , should waste time in interviews setting out how he might respond according to each and every result is ludicrous .
I have my disagreements with the Lib Dem leadership on the question of a hung Parliament : I think the party should have ruled out a coalition in advance .
But Nick is 100 % right not to take the media bait , and bog himself down in unknown unknowables on an issue which means diddly squat to the public .
WASHINGTON — Sixteen utilities and a trade association sued the Energy Department on Monday to halt the government ’s collection of nuclear waste disposal fees , arguing that the country no longer had a disposal plan after ruling out Yucca Mountain , Nev. , as a repository .
The utilities , which filed the lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , jointly pay about $ 750 million a year — amounting to a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour — into the fund .
It now stands at about $ 24 billion and earns about $ 1 billion annually in interest .
The money was supposed to pay for the development of the Yucca Mountain repository , about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas , but the Energy Department said last month that it was formally seeking to withdraw its application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate the site .
President Obama had promised while campaigning for office that he would kill the project , in large part at the urging of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , now the majority leader .
But it was also far from clear that the site was technically suitable for waste disposal .
Drug War
L.A.'s Pot Revolution
How Los Angeles became the " wild West " of medical marijuana - and lived to tell the tale .
On a warm , bright winter day in January , I spent a few hours driving around two neighborhoods in Los Angeles , looking at marijuana stores .
You know , marijuana stores .
Where you ( well , not necessarily you ) can walk in and , if you can prove a doctor has recommended marijuana to you for relief of an ailment , walk out with a brown bag full of buds , pot brownies , or cannabis candy bars .
Los Angeles has more than 500 of these stores .
My companions on the drives were two citizen activists who did n't like seeing so many marijuana shops and who regularly let the Los Angeles City Council know of their unhappiness .
Michael Larsen , a 43 - year - old family man , is public safety director for the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council .
He does n't like to discuss his day job in the press , saying it has drawn too many hostile medical marijuana supporters to his work - related websites in the past .
Eagle Rock , a neighborhood in northeast Los Angeles , is visibly aging but remains dignified and distinct , with commercial areas occupied mostly by low - slung , pale old buildings housing storefront doctor 's offices , service businesses such as beauty salons and tax preparers , and independent restaurants and boutiques rather than chain stores .
As we cruise a mile or so up and down Eagle Rock , York , and Colorado boulevards , Larsen points out more than 10 pot dispensaries .
" Eagle Rock is about being a small community with a small - town feel , and we want to retain that , " he says .
Responding to criticisms he 's received from medical marijuana activists , Larsen insists : " I 'm not being uncompassionate .
I may be a NIMBY , but I 'm fine with that .
Eagle Rock is struggling to maintain the character of the neighborhood , for my kids or other people and their kids . "
Larsen tells me about the healthy - looking young men who sometimes congregate in parking lots or on streets near dispensaries , smoking pot or blasting music .
He points out one such young man entering AEC , a dispensary on Colorado Boulevard , while we are in its parking lot .
He tells me about a local woman in her 80s who can't understand what kind of world she 's living in , where marijuana is sold on her corner .
Larsen also points out some grubby - looking auto repair shops along his neighborhood 's main strip and tells me how the locals managed to curb their profusion through the city 's planning process .
He talks about the auto repair shops in much the same way he discusses the pot shops .
He does not think either should be completely eliminated , but he believes they constitute a blight on the neighborhood when they are too conspicuous .
Larsen and I pass one marijuana dispensary , the Cornerstone Collective , that I visited the day before .
If you did n't know it was there , you would n't know it was there .
It has no pot leaf images , no neon signs announcing " Alternative " or " Herbal , " no commercial signage at all .
The owner , Michael Backes , told me with amused pride that a while back , when a runaway car plowed straight through his wall , a local news crew identified the place as a " dentist office , " which is what it looks like from its waiting room .
Backes is " doing it right , " Larsen tells me .
My drive through Studio City , in the southeast San Fernando Valley just over the mountains from Hollywood , is similar .
Barbara Monahan Burke , a 64 - year - old horticulturalist who serves as the neighborhood council 's co-chair for government affairs , does n't say anything about increases in crime associated with the marijuana dispensaries ( a connection often asserted by public officials ) , but she does complain about occasional pot smoking in front of them , which can annoy commercial neighbors .
" I personally believe in compassionate use of medical marijuana and voted for it , " she says .
Within a couple of miles on Ventura Boulevard , a dozen dispensaries seem to be open for business on this weekday afternoon .
( Burke told me in mid-February that by then she was only sure that six of them were still open for business . )
" It 's about preservation of communities , " she says .
" We want this to be a place where families can live .
It 's about , what do the people who live here want our branding to be as Studio City ? "
That branding , she thinks , should not be linked to green crosses and billboards for Medicann , a medical marijuana doctors ' consulting service , every couple of blocks on her neighborhood 's major commercial strip .
The Wild West of Weed
Newsweek dubbed Los Angeles " the wild West of weed " in October 2009 , and that phrase often echoed through the city council 's chamber as it haggled over a long - awaited ordinance regulating the dispensaries .
Both the Los Angeles Times and the L.A.
Weekly regularly jabbed at the city council for fiddling while marijuana burned , supplied by storefront pot dispensaries that were widely ( but inaccurately ) said to total 1,000 or more .
On January 26 , after years of dithering and months of debate , the city council finally passed an ordinance to regulate medical marijuana shops .
In addition to dictating the details of lighting , record keeping , auditing , bank drops , hours of operation , and compensation for owners and employees , the ordinance requires a dramatic reduction in the number of dispensaries .
The official limit is 70 , but because of exemptions for some pre-existing dispensaries the final number could grow as high as 137 .
The ordinance allocates the surviving dispensaries among the city 's " planning districts " and requires that they be located more than 1,000 feet from each other and from " sensitive areas " such as parks , schools , churches , and libraries .
It also requires patients who obtain marijuana from dispensaries to pick one outlet and stick with it .
As those rules suggest , city officials are not prepared to treat marijuana like any other medicine , despite a 1996 state ballot initiative that allows patients with doctor 's recommendations to use it for symptom relief .
It 's hard to imagine the city council arbitrarily limiting the number of pharmacies , insisting that they not do business near competitors , creating buffer zones between parks and Duane Reade locations , or demanding that patients obtain their Lipitor from one and only one drugstore .
Such restrictions reflect marijuana 's dual identity in California :
It is simultaneously medicine and menace .
At the same time , the regulations do serve to legitimize distribution of a drug that remains completely prohibited by federal law — a stamp of approval welcomed by many dispensary operators .
When I asked activists , businessmen , or politicians why L.A. 's medical marijuana market needed to be regulated , they almost invariably replied , " It was unregulated . "
When I delved beyond that tautology , I found motives little different from those that drive land use planning generally .
The activists who demanded that the city bring order to the " wild West " of medical marijuana were motivated not by antipathy to cannabis so much as mundane concerns about " blight , " neighborhood character , and spillover effects .
While responding to these concerns , every member of the city council voiced support for medical access to marijuana in theory , and none openly sided with the federal law enforcement officials who view the trade as nothing more than drug dealing in disguise .
Los Angeles became the medical marijuana capital of America thanks to a combination of entrepreneurial energy and benign political neglect .
What happened here is instructive for other jurisdictions that already or may soon let patients use the drug .
In the last 14 years , the voters or legislators of 14 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for at least some medical purposes .
Medical marijuana campaigns , via either legislation or ballot initiative , are active in 13 other states .
National surveys indicate broad public support for such reforms .
An ABC News / Washington
Post poll conducted in January found that 81 percent of Americans think patients who can benefit from marijuana should be able to obtain it legally .
But L.A. 's experience also shows that majority support for medical marijuana is not necessarily enough .
An October poll of Los Angeles residents commissioned by the Marijuana Policy Project found that 77 percent supported regulating dispensaries , while only 14 percent wanted them closed .
But patients and the entrepreneurs who served them still had to contend with a noisy minority , clustered in political institutions such as neighborhood councils , the police department , and government lawyers ' offices , who resisted the normalization of marijuana .
That process culminated in an ordinance with onerous restrictions that could nearly eliminate the current medical pot business and cause great hardship for tens of thousands of Los Angeles residents who use marijuana as a medicine .
Still , for those who lived through the ferocious cultural and political war over pot during the second half of the 20th century , it 's amazing that the strife in pot-saturated Los Angeles has had more to do with land use regulation than with eradicating an allegedly evil plant .
Even with pot readily available over the counter at hundreds of locations to anyone with an easily obtained doctor 's letter , the most common complaints were essentially aesthetic .
The Road to the Corner Pot Shop
When California voters agreed in 1996 to legalize pot for medical use , the initiative campaign emphasized marijuana 's utility in treating AIDS wasting syndrome , the side effects of cancer chemotherapy , and other grave conditions .
But the initiative , known as the Compassionate Use Act , also allowed pot to be recommended for treatment of " any other illness for which marijuana provides relief . "
That language strongly influenced how the politics and culture of medical marijuana evolved in Los Angeles .
The federal government did not yield to the judgment of California 's voters .
The Clinton administration threatened to prosecute or revoke the prescription privileges of doctors who recommended marijuana , only to be rebuked by a federal appeals court on First Amendment grounds .
From the late 1990s into the first year of the Obama administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) raided medical marijuana growers and suppliers , without regard to whether they were following California law .
Last November , the Justice Department instructed U.S. attorneys that they " should not focus federal resources " on " individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana . "
Yet as of February , the DEA was still raiding medical marijuana shops in the L.A. area .
Ambiguity is built into the Justice Department 's new policy , thanks to uncertainty over what exactly it means to comply with state law .
The Compassionate Use Act allowed patients or their " primary caregivers " to grow marijuana for medical use .
The Medical Marijuana Program
Act , a law passed by the state legislature that took effect in 2004 , imposed limits on how much marijuana patients or their caregivers could possess , while allowing local jurisdictions to establish higher ceilings .
In January the California Supreme Court rejected those limits , saying patients should be allowed to have whatever amount is " reasonable " for their medical needs .
Most important in understanding what happened in Los Angeles , the 2004 law said patients may join together to " collectively or cooperatively " grow marijuana and distribute it to each other .
The law did not define collectives or cooperatives , but guidelines issued by Attorney General Jerry Brown in 2008 said they should be deemed legitimate as long as they were operated by patients , served only members of the collective , and did not take in more revenue than was necessary to cover their operating expenses .
Ostensibly , the storefront dispensaries that opened in cities such as Los Angeles , San Diego , San Francisco , and Oakland were collectives operated by and for patients , providing them with their medicine as permitted by state law .
But given the ease of obtaining a doctor 's recommendation and becoming a collective member , critics viewed the dispensaries as thinly disguised pot shops that sold marijuana to the general public for recreational as well as medical purposes .
As you are frequently reminded by people in Los Angeles who are angry about the way the dispensary system developed , Californians who voted for the Compassionate Use Act had in mind patients with cancer , AIDS , or other serious conditions , people who needed marijuana to relieve agonizing pain , fight debilitating nausea , or restore their appetites so they could take in enough nutrition to stay alive .
Voters who supported the initiative did not have in mind milder , vaguer , and less verifiable complaints of the sort that seem to be far more common among people with doctor 's recommendations .
Austin Elguindy , a partner in an L.A. medical pot recommendation practice called Consulting and Care for Wellness , tells me his top three reasons for recommending marijuana are lower back pain , insomnia , and anxiety .
Regulation of the dispensaries was left to local jurisdictions .
Some , such as the politically liberal cities of San Francisco , Oakland , and West Hollywood , experienced an early proliferation that was quickly curbed .
San Francisco set a limit of 23 dispensaries , while Oakland and West Hollywood each settled on four .
About 120 cities banned pot storefronts entirely ( although a lawsuit that is before a state appeals court challenges their authority to do so ) .
Los Angeles , by contrast , declined to address pot dispensaries at all .
Medical marijuana entrepreneurs began moving into L.A. in 2003 .
In May 2005 , when City Councilman Dennis Zine ( a former cop ) first asked the police to look into the dispensaries and asked the city attorney 's office to help the council draft regulations for them , just a handful were around .
By the end of 2006 there were nearly 100 .
Zine blames the delayed reaction on resistance from then –City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo .
Don Duncan , a leading medical marijuana activist and operator of a West Hollywood dispensary that opened in 2004 , also blames the city attorney 's office .
He says Delgadillo and his successor , Carmen Trutanich , did not want to legitimize an industry they viewed as illegal .
Both took the position , contrary to Attorney General Brown 's guidelines , that state law does not allow the exchange of medical marijuana for money , no matter how the distributor is organized or labeled .
In a January ruling on a civil nuisance case brought by the city attorney 's office against a dispensary called Hemp Factory V , a Superior Court judge agreed with this narrow reading of the law .
Joe Elford , a lawyer for the medical marijuana activist group Americans for Safe Access , says this contradicts state appellate decisions that acknowledge the legality of not - for - profit sales .
The complaints that prompted Zine to consider regulating the dispensaries were not terribly alarming .
Citizens were annoyed by pot smokers congregating outside dispensaries .
Some parents did n't like the message they believed the dispensaries communicated to their kids : that marijuana was an ordinary commodity that could be sold openly without fear of legal repercussions .
They also worried that kids might obtain marijuana from patients , which local journalists have found happens occasionally .
Mostly , marijuana just kind of freaks some people out .
In August 2007 , the city council rushed through an " interim control ordinance " ( ICO ) that declared a moratorium on new pot shops .
The ordinance also required existing dispensaries to submit paperwork proving they had seller 's permits from the state Board of Equalization ( which expected them to collect taxes on marijuana sales ) , a tax registration certificate from the city , and a legitimate commercial lease or property deed .
One hundred eighty - three dispensaries filed their paperwork before the November 2007 deadline , of which 137 were still operating when the council passed its new regulations in 2010 .
By the time the ICO was passed , many dispensaries had been forced to close by the DEA 's tactic of sending threatening letters to landlords who rented space to pot shops .
Worried that their property would be seized by the federal government , dozens of landlords evicted marijuana dispensaries .
Many of these sellers sought to reopen by applying for a " hardship exemption " under the interim control ordinance .
The city let the applications pile up without examining them , and dispensary operators who were not in business prior to the moratorium filed the same forms , hoping they could slip by .
Many others , known as " rogues " in the medical marijuana community , opened without bothering to file any paperwork .
By mid-2009 hundreds of what came to be known as " post - ICO " pot shops had opened .
Local and national media outlets began to notice .
In July a Wall Street Journal story looked askance at the " unchecked growth " of pot shops in L.A .
In October , the same month Newsweek dubbed L.A. " the wild West of weed , " a New York Times story tut - tutted that there were " more marijuana stores here than public schools . "
The city council could no longer avoid the issue .
Making a Hash of an Ordinance
According to dispensary critic Michael Larsen , Los Angeles was " a national laughingstock " because of the proliferating pot shops .
Based on a combination of hysterical hearsay and applications for exemptions that never turned into functioning storefronts , politicians , journalists , and perturbed neighbors were regularly claiming the city had something like 1,000 dispensaries — more than the number of Starbucks locations .
The L.A. Weekly — an alternative paper that might have been expected to side with the dispensaries , especially given how many of their ads fill the paper — helped lead the negative coverage , as part of a general crusade against what it sees as the city government 's fecklessness .
The paper in November tried to get an accurate count of the dispensaries and found that 540 or so were operating when the council began reconsidering the issue .
To a politician who did n't have to worry about where he could obtain a medicine that helped make his life livable , that must have seemed like an awful lot .
Even though the city council had been considering the issue , on and off , for nearly five years , the ordinance it produced after a contentious back and forth between the council and the city attorney 's office seemed half - baked in many respects .
It imposed draconian restrictions with little thought to how they might affect patients who had come to rely on marijuana to relieve their symptoms .
Some of the provisions are mild and largely supported by the medical pot community , which was begging for bearable regulations that would legitimize the dispensaries .
The relatively uncontroversial requirements include demands for twice - daily bank runs , no plants visible from the street , and unarmed security guards patrolling a two - block radius around each dispensary .
Other provisions seem difficult to enforce and / or comply with , such as the rule that each patient can be a member of no more than one collective ( meaning he can obtain marijuana from just one location ) , a demand that all the pot distributed go through " an independent and certified laboratory " to be checked for pesticides ( dispensary operators insist that no such lab exists in Los Angeles ) , and a requirement that dispensaries store what could amount to tens of thousands of pieces of paper with patient and transaction information in fireproof vaults on site .
Most ominously for the future of the medical marijuana business in L.A. , the ordinance creates 1,000 - foot " buffers " between the dispensaries and a list of " sensitive uses " : schools , churches , libraries , parks , youth centers , substance abuse centers , and other pot dispensaries .
A last - minute addition to the bill also bans dispensaries from land " abutting " residential property and specifies that " no collective shall be located on a lot …across the street or alley from …a residentially zoned lot or a lot improved with residential use . "
If the ordinance survives legal challenges and goes into effect , that last provision will force nearly all of the existing dispensaries to move , and they will have few places to go .
Almost all of L.A. 's standard commercial space is separated from homes or apartments merely by an alley behind them .
In the weeks after the ordinance passed , various sources in the medical marijuana community told me landlords lucky enough to have space that complies with the new rules have tripled their rents and started demanding five - figure " signing fees " from dispensaries scrambling to find new locations .
Pot Civil War
The regulatory debate divided the medical marijuana community , pitting older dispensaries against new competitors , those seeking legitimacy against the open outlaws , those happy with the medical - use status quo against those who want complete legalization .
Pot sellers who were in business before the 2007 moratorium — which a state court overturned on technical legal grounds in October — believe , probably correctly , that the industry could have continued to thrive under the media and political radar if not for the hundreds of Johnny - come - latelies .
" Pre - ICO " and " post - ICO " dispensaries are the Sharks and Jets of the L.A. pot world .
Bill Leahy is general manager of a three - location chain of dispensaries known as the Farmacy , which began operating in West Hollywood in 2004 .
He meets me at the West Hollywood branch , which features cheery attendants , warm wood , mystical art , and one of the metropolitan area 's widest arrays of cannabis - enhanced tinctures , sprays , drinks , packaged foods , and gelatos .
Leahy , a 63 - year - old former print shop operator with the air of a steel - hard but gallant Western sheriff , is understandably proud of his comfortable shopping environment with doors open wide to the cool , sunny L.A. winter .
The Farmacy does not have the unsettling mantrap quality of many dispensaries , where you are locked into enclosed space after enclosed space between you and whoever hands you the goods ( after examining and confirming your doctor 's recommendation and asking you to fill out forms to join the collective , assuming the dispensary is trying to be legit ) .
Leahy makes sure I notice a rival shop across Santa Monica Boulevard , which opened in 2005 .
He gently chides its garish signage and unfriendly layout , which includes one of those off - putting enclosed entry areas .
Leahy is on the steering committee of the Greater Los Angeles Collective Alliance , a trade association dominated by the pre-ICO shops .
Don Duncan , a prominent activist in the association , represents Americans for Safe Access as well as his own West Hollywood dispensary .
An overwrought November L.A. Weekly story painted Duncan as the drug kingpin guiding council members such as Dennis Zine and Ed Reyes to let legalized pot dealing ruin their city , describing Duncan as " the most important man in City Hall regarding medical marijuana policy " with " tremendous influence . "
The article suggestively noted that Duncan " was n't vetted to determine whether his pot sources and profits are illicit or legitimate , " though it presented no evidence that he fails to comply with state law .
Since March 2009 , Dan Halbert has run the Rainforest Collective , a pot shop on Venice Boulevard in West Los Angeles with a bright and airy front room , floors covered in Astroturf , and walls painted with murals that suggest you are sitting in a vaguely Greek temple situated in a jungle .
Halbert is president of the Green Alliance of Patients and Providers ( GAPP ) , a trade group representing post - ICO dispensaries .
The organization raised the ire of the city council gadfly John Walsh , a perpetually angry , perpetually arm - pumping shouter who was the most consistent and loudest anti-dispensary voice at city council meetings .
At a January city council meeting , an appalled Walsh pointed the council 's attention to a line in a GAPP pamphlet that said the dispensaries wanted to craft and pass , via city referendum , regulations " for the industry by the industry . "
Walsh bridled at the word industry .
Was n't medical marijuana supposed to be about medicine and compassion ?
Halbert understands that the pre-ICO pot entrepreneurs paved the way for people like him , braving the risk of federal arrests .
An entrepreneur from Arizona , he says he did not feel safe moving into the market until he believed the Obama administration would n't come after him .
He can see how old hands such as Leahy and Duncan would resent the new competition .
Still , Halbert says , " We brought the prices down .
When there were only 186 [ dispensaries ] , things were expensive , and [ the shops ] were making a lot of money , which is against the whole intent of this . "
Halbert 's jab at the profits of his older competitors seems somewhat at odds with his group 's description of medical marijuana distribution as an " industry . "
But it fits with the anti-commercial mentality reflected in the attorney general 's guidelines , which say collectives should not turn a profit ( although they are not required to incorporate as nonprofit organizations ) .
That same attitude led to the half - baked wage controls in the new ordinance , which bans bonuses and says operators and workers must receive " compensation commensurate with reasonable wages and benefits paid to employees of IRS - qualified non-profit organizations " with similar qualifications and duties .
' That Other Thing '
We 've been talking about the politics of medical marijuana , a more or less civilized activity in which business people and activists on both sides lobby politicians , who consider their input , along with public comments and negative press coverage , when they formulate policy .
That 's one thing .
But as drug lord Avon Barksdale told his lieutenant Stringer Bell in the HBO series The Wire , there 's also " that other thing . "
Barksdale says this in the context of Bell 's attempts to turn the drug trade into a rational business — much as Don Duncan and Dan Halbert , in a more aboveboard way , are doing in Los Angeles .
" That other thing " is the part of the drug trade Barksdale is more comfortable with : the part with guns and threats , intimidation and violence .
That other thing also plays a role in L.A. 's medical marijuana market , but how big a role is unclear .
Although the text of the new ordinance alleges an " increase in and escalation of violent crime " associated with dispensaries , the city 's crime rates were dropping in almost every category while the shops proliferated .
In a January interview with the Los Angeles Daily News , L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck admitted there was no evidence the dispensaries had contributed to criminality .
" I have tried to verify that because that , of course , is the mantra , " Beck told the paper .
" It does n't really bear out . "
One guard was murdered by robbers at a Pico Boulevard dispensary in October 2008 , the sort of tragedy that can be expected in a big - city business that deals mostly in cash because its transactions are prohibited by federal law .
City Attorney Carmen Trutanich says about 200 L.A. dispensaries have been robbed .
Patrick Duff , proprietor of three L.A. - area marijuana dispensaries that have been raided by the police for various reasons , thinks the actual number of robberies is much higher because dispensary operators are often reluctant to call cops they believe are corrupt .
Police and politicians often claim dispensaries get their pot from Mexican drug cartels .
( To comply with state law , everything a pot dispensary sells is supposed to be provided by its own patient - members , and all the dispensary operators I talked to or who stood up for themselves at city council meetings insist that 's how they do it .
The council briefly considered requiring the dispensaries to do all their growing on site , the kind of demand that would have been seen as obviously absurd if applied to any other market or pharmacy . )
Capt .
Kevin McCarthy , the Los Angeles Police Department 's commanding officer for gangs and narcotics , tells me that getting to the bottom of such connections , if they exist , would be " labor intensive to do , and we do n't have resources to do it . "
McCarthy notes that the city claims to have found pesticides used only in Mexico on pot seized in at least one dispensary raid .
One old - fashioned grower from Mendocino County who was accustomed to dealing with pot-savvy dispensary operators in the pre-ICO days laments that he is now supplying " Boris with the gold chains , " who cares only about price points and does n't understand the product .
( There is no legal reason growers from up north can't be patient - members of a dispensary in L.A. )
Some anti-dispensary activists worry that they may be interfering with the interests of people who are not afraid to use violence when crossed , but there is no hard evidence to support that fear .
When it comes to intimidation and violence in the medical marijuana scene , the leading offender , however , is clearly the government : the DEA , plus local police and sheriff 's departments .
They send small armies of heavily armed , Kevlar - clad , dark - helmeted men into the stores and homes of dispensary operators and medical marijuana growers , terrorizing their children , shooting their dogs , digging up their yards , roughing them up , and taking their money .
As of early February , Americans for Safe Access has counted nearly 70 medical marijuana raids in the Los Angeles area since 2006 .
Federal raids usually do not result in criminal charges ; the DEA typically settles for shutting down dispensaries and seizing their assets .
State and local authorities are slightly more inclined to prosecute .
Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley , like City Attorney Trutanich , maintains that all pot sales are illegal .
Still , most cases end in plea agreements , which means defendants ' claims to be operating within the law are never considered by a jury .
Meital Manzuri , a Sherman
Oaks defense attorney who represents dispensary operators , says it 's generally in the interests of both the state and the defendants to stop medical marijuana cases before they go to trial :
Trials are expensive and , when a medical defense is involved , risky for both sides .
One dispensary operator who is likely going to trial on state charges is the 60 - year - old accountant Clay Tepel , a veteran of L.A. 's counterculture as a former business manager at the original Los Angeles alternative weekly , the L.A. Free Press .
In August local police arrested Tepel for possession with intent to sell at Kush Korner , his pot shop in a strip mall on Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana .
His sign still hangs between " I Sold it on EBay " and " Kids Hair Shop " in front of the strip mall , and the wrecked storefront stands empty next to a Domino 's Pizza outlet .
Tepel still has the lease and keys , and we chat in the front room of the former dispensary , where natural light seeps into the electricity - deprived space .
The possession with intent to sell charge darkly amuses him :
Why else would he have a seller 's permit from the state Board of Equalization ?
Tepel 's lawyer , Allison Margolin , says that the case may result in her challenging the legality of the state 's demand that dispensaries have to operate not - for - profit .
Tepel 's store was a family operation .
One of his teenaged daughters and his wife helped run the shop , which he insists was not only not making a profit but was in fact sucking money from his accounting income .
Both of his teenaged daughters were around when a squad of heavily armed cops burst into his house at the same time the store was raided .
Tepel tells me he and his family are negotiating with a major TV network to produce a reality show about his " Brady Bunch with bongs " once his legal troubles are behind him .
Tepel says he has no idea why he was raided or why he is one of the unlucky few with a court date .
He says the lead cop on the raid told him they were " coming to get all of them . "
In mid-February , after the new ordinance passed but before it took effect , local officials started to deliver on that threat .
On February 18 , the city attorney 's office sued three L.A. dispensaries , seeking to shut them down as public nuisances .
The operator of one dispensary named in the lawsuit , Organica in West L.A. , was arrested on state charges of selling marijuana in a raid that involved the DEA .
On the same day , 18 other dispensaries received letters from the city attorney , threatening them with eviction for selling marijuana .
Assistant City Attorney Asha Greenberg told the L.A.
Weekly that all the shops were targeted for selling pot to undercover cops who presented doctor 's recommendations .
The city attorney 's office continues to insist that exchanging medical marijuana for money is illegal in all circumstances , even though the city council just passed an ordinance that explicitly allows nonprofit sales .
The Lie of Medical Marijuana
California 's medical marijuana law created a special category of people who are allowed to do something that others would be arrested for doing , and it gave a guild of licensed professionals the nearly unlimited power to define this category .
Although physicians who issue recommendations for nonmedical reasons theoretically can be disciplined by the state medical board , that has happened only 12 times since 1996 , and only one doctor lost his license as a result .
The discretion permitted by the law is so broad that proving misconduct is very difficult .
That broad discretion helps patients who might be denied their medicine under a stricter regime , and at the same time it helps people who want pot for recreational purposes .
Medical marijuana activists often say that all marijuana use is essentially medical , if that category is understood to include quotidian psychological and emotional problems that the drug alleviates .
If physicians can prescribe pharmaceuticals to treat stress , anxiety , shyness , and depression , the activists say , why can't they recommend marijuana for the same reasons ?
Stephen Gutwillig , California state director of the Drug Policy Alliance , offers a partly tongue - in - cheek take on the question : Given how bad for your health it is to get caught up in the criminal justice system because you have marijuana , he says , removing that threat is a form of preventive medicine .
Politically , though , the malleability of the medical category is a problem .
Anyone who locates a sympathetic , trusting , or simply greedy doctor can obtain the legal right to possess pot in California .
That fact , plus the hundreds of outlets that sprang up in Los Angeles to supply those patients , fostered a fairly accurate public perception that during the last few years anyone willing to put in a little effort could travel a short distance and buy pot over the counter .
The medical model attaches great importance to motive and state of mind , which is why dispensary operators often say , when justifying themselves to politicians or the press , that they 're in the business " for the right reasons , " unlike some of their competitors .
Combined with the federal ban on marijuana , medicalization leads to a world where customers can shop at only one store ; where the cash they pay for a product is not the price but a " contribution to the collective " ; where businesses are expected to avoid turning a profit ; where a medicine is subject to sales tax , unlike other pharmaceuticals , and is n't regulated like any other pharmaceutical ; where you are complying with the law if what you possess is " reasonable " related to some need that may have been invented by a doctor to begin with ; where it 's legal for you to have pot but you are still apt to be arrested for growing or transporting it .
The medical model also fosters a weirdly contradictory attitude toward pot use , one that seemed to animate the L.A.
Weekly 's surprisingly negative coverage of the issue :
Even people who do n't care about pot smoking in general get upset when they think stoners are gaming a system that is supposed to serve patients with doctor - certified needs .
The L.A. Weekly angrily reported in November that 70 percent of the people its reporters saw entering dispensaries were " young men— corroborating D.A.
Cooley 's claim that the real market for all this activity is everyday users , not people suffering serious disease . "
( Medical activists tend to respond to that sort of talk with the riposte that all sorts of maladies for which pot provides relief are n't diagnosable by strangers watching from yards away . )
In Los Angeles , such outrage over pot being used for the " wrong " reasons led to a bad and unsustainable ordinance .
In March , Americans for Safe Access challenged the new regulations in state court .
Its lawyer Joe Elford said in a press release that " The requirement to find a new location within 7 days [ if the old one is zoned out of compliance ] is completely unreasonable and undermines the due process of otherwise legal medical marijuana dispensaries . "
The suit seeks to have the ordinance declared " unlawful and unconstitutional . "
The ordinance also faces a challenge in the form of a citizen referendum spearheaded by Dan Halbert , who needs 27,000 signatures to get it on the next available L.A. ballot in 2010 .
But as long as medical use is the only marijuana use officially permitted , dispensaries will remain hamstrung by stupid and unworkable restrictions .
Full legalization , an idea long avoided by many medical marijuana activists , may be the only way to make sure all patients who can benefit from the drug have access to it without creating the sort of situation that gave rise to the crackdown in L.A .
While the latest ordinance may or may not succeed in shutting down hundreds of functioning storefronts , the freewheeling culture of quasi- legal pot will be harder to crush .
L.A. is home to at least four ad - filled magazines serving the pot community , a branch of " Oaksterdam University " where potrepreneurs and patients learn medical marijuana science and law , an endless series of cannabis - related expositions and conventions , and websites such as Weedtracker ( featuring discussions of dispensary quality and local politics ) and weedmaps.com ( which finds the dispensary nearest you ) .
The Medical Cannabis Safety Council meets at Oaksterdam on occasional Saturday nights to discuss , among other things , the molds that can bedevil growers and self - regulation as a way of fending off heavy - handed government interference .
Is America ready for a world in which pot is as culturally and physically prevalent as it has become in L.A. ?
In a national Zogby poll conducted in April 2009 , 52 percent of respondents supported treating marijuana more or less like alcohol , while other recent polls put the percentage in the 40s .
Support for legalization is higher in California : A Field Poll of California voters taken the same month as the Zogby survey put support for legalization at 56 percent statewide and 60 percent in Los Angeles County .
This fall we will see whether those opinions translate into voter support for a California ballot initiative that would , at long last , legalize and tax adult possession of marijuana .
Don Duncan , as dean of L.A. 's medical marijuana suppliers and activists , does n't want to opine about full legalization .
But his take on why all sides have fought so ferociously over the city 's medical pot ordinance applies to the legalization debate as well .
" The normalization of medical marijuana — certain elements in law enforcement and other civic leaders see it as a threat , " he says .
" If L.A. is in fact a medical marijuana town with safe access regulated , then that ends the debate for California .
… Once the state 's largest and most populated community has sensible regulations , foes of medical cannabis in law enforcement know they 've lost the battle in California .
They see it as a line in the sand , so ideologically they can't give up L.A .
By the same token , that 's why ideologically we can't either . "
The fight to define what happened in L.A. during the " wild West " days of what amounted to legal over - the - counter pot is the same sort of battle .
If the complaints that led to the regulatory crackdown are understood as arising from anti-pot prejudice , NIMBYism , and the occasional sighting of " undesirables , " rather than real threats to public order and safety , it will seem pretty silly to continue spending billions of dollars and millions of man-hours each year to stop people from exchanging money for pot .
The accidental result of a city attorney who did n't want to legitimize marijuana and a city council that did n't want to think about it could be the realization that it 's better to allow a pot free - for - all than to continue to wage war on marijuana .

In late 2008 I wrote about my experience using the first generation 80 GB Intel X25 - M SSD — my first SSD .
I had to pay the early adopter tax for that SSD , so it cost me around 700 .
The speed boost alone justified the price to me .
Fast - forward about a year and that SSD stopped working .
I 'm not quite sure what died — the controller or something else — but I RMA'd it with Intel and they sent me a new , second generation X25 - M that week .
The second generation ( G2 ) X25 - M is based on 34nm fabrication compared to the 50nm first generation .
The G2 is also substantially cheaper at roughly 299 and noticeably faster due to a new controller and firmware .
Intel still claims the same " up to 250 MB / s " sequential read speed and " up to 70 MB / s " sequential write speed but the G2 brings improved ( 2 x for 80 GB , 2.5 x for 160 GB version ) random 4KB writes .
The second X25 - M G2 SSD prior to installation in a 17 - inch Unibody MacBook Pro
But I digress , this post is not about why I love Intel 's SSD , but rather how using just one SSD was not fast enough .
( It should be noted that the X25 - M will not be top dog forever and will be getting stiff competition from OCZ and their " SandForce " controller that can compress data beforehand in the Vertex 2 Pro SSDs . )
Getting to the point , I put two 80 GB Intel X25 - M G2 SSDs in my unibody 17 - inch Apple MacBook Pro and then set them up with RAID 0 — striped data for better performance .
How this is possible ?
MacBook
Pro laptops only support one hard drive / solid state drive .
Well , I had to remove the optical drive .
Not a big deal for me as I rarely used it and if I ever need it I can use it with an external USB enclosure .
What You Need
Laptop of your choice : that uses a SATA interface for its optical drive .
If you 're using a Unibody MacBook Pro you should be good to go .

If you 're using a Unibody MacBook Pro you should be good to go .
2 Solid State Drives of your choice :
For optimal results , ensure they are the exact same brand , model , capacity and generation .
Intel has the 80GB ( ~289 ) and 160GB ( ~489 ) flavors of the X - 25 M .
Make sure to spring for the G2 second generation ( linked ) .
Kingston has their SSDNow V - Series : 64GB ( ~149 ) or 128GB ( ~269 ) I mentioned the new OCZ Vertex 2
Pro earlier but at the time of this writing I could not find one for sale to link to .
For optimal results , ensure they are the exact same brand , model , capacity and generation .
MCE Optibay ( 99 ) : The Optibay is the special ingredient in this How To .
It fits properly in the optical drive bay slot and lets you securely attach your second SSD to it .
It is important to note that you need to buy the SATA version if you have the same Unibody 17 - inch MacBook Pro as I do .
Prior models used IDE for optical drives and the respective Optibays had onboard IDE » SATA converters that resulted in slower performance ; definitely not what you want with a RAID setup .
When I ordered my Optibay it came with a USB 2.0 enclosure for the SuperDrive I was taking out .

Tools :
The usual small ( #00 ) Phillips head will do but there is also one screw that is very difficult to remove unless you remove a small T6 Torx screw in front of it .
I have been quite happy with a small tool with changeable bits called the Teeny Turner .
These two tools have helped me void many gadget warranties over the years .
No regard for Apple warranty : Unless you are have mastered the art of deception , if you ever take your MacBook Pro in for warranty repair they will likely notice that you have opened it up before .
You can always claim the work was done by a Certified Apple Specialist but they might call your bluff .
Or you could meticulously undo the RAID setup and put the optical drive back before walking in for an unrelated repair .

You will want to make sure your SSDs have the latest firmware .
Most SSD manufacturers require that you burn a disc and boot your computer into their software .

[ Intel SATA SSD Firmware Update Tool ] External USB / FireWire hard drive :
It 's always a good idea to have an external hard drive drive dedicated to backing up your computer , not storing excess media files and documents .
In this case of this guide , the external drive will be used to boot off of during a phase of setup .
I use a cheap 500GB My Book I bought years ago , but anything large enough will work .
Hardware Install
Unfortunately , swapping / adding hard drives in the 17 - inch Unibody MacBook Pro ( without user - removable battery ) is a bit more involved than the simple procedure on the 15 - inch Unibody MacBook Pro with removable battery .
You will need to be comfortable taking out the entire back panel of the laptop .
Detailed instructions for taking apart your MacBook Pro can be found at ifixit.com
For my MacBook
Pro there were ten Phillips screws in my way before I could take off the back panel .
The opened up 17 - inch Unibody Apple MacBook Pro
Since I had previously already installed an 80 GB X25 - M G2 SSD in place of the hard drive the laptop came with , my next objective was removing the SuperDrive .
Removing the optical drive .
Inset : disconnect bluetooth module first
The SuperDrive had a few more Phillips screws but there was also a display cable and Bluetooth module in the way .
The Bluetooth module has a tiny cable that can be gently tugged and removed .
Then you can remove the two screws holding the module in place .
Push the display cable out of the way and remove the grounding pad near the hinge .
Gently try to lift the optical drive up .
When you have enough wiggle room disconnect the SATA cable from the SuperDrive .
Next , unbox the MCE Optibay and screw in the SSD into it .
MCE Optibay with SSD installed
Then position the Optibay , connect the SATA cable , screw in the Optibay , put the grounding pad back and reattach the Bluetooth module .
Here 's the bad news — the screws for the Bluetooth module do not fit into the holes in the Optibay .
The good news — the Bluetooth module is so tiny and lightweight that it's not the end of the world that it is n't screwed in .
If you 're really worried about it use some Polyimide / Kapton tape to keep it in place or find appropriate screws .
Bluetooth module does n't screw into the Optibay using either the provided or original screws .
And finally , reassemble the laptop and put the ten back panel screws back .
Boot the laptop to make sure all is well .
Open Disk Utility to see if the new SSD is listed .
Place the SuperDrive you removed into the external USB 2.0 enclosure provided with the Optibay .
Install the latest SSD firmware
So the new SSD is seen by OS X and all is well .
Great !
If you have n't already burned the firmware updater tool provided by Intel ( or whatever company makes your SSDs ) , do so now .
Boot up to the burned disc byon boot when the gray screen is shown .
Follow the on screen instructions and 5 minutes later both of your SSDs should be loaded up with the latest firmware .
Usual firmware updating precautions apply — make sure all of your data is backed up on the off - chance the SSD gets bricked .
Software Config
[ My Situation ]
One of the SSDs has already been loaded up with OS X and the other is empty .
Both SSDs are new and empty .
There is no OS loaded on either .
Now you have two working SSDs in your MacBook Pro .
You are currently in either one of two situations :
If you are in situation # 2 , I am guessing ( not tried it personally ) that you need to :
put your OS X disc into the SuperDrive you placed into the provided external enclosure and connect it to your MacBook Pro
hold down C and boot into the installer
close the installer window and go to the top menu to open up Disk Utility
create the RAID array and proceed installing OS X onto it
However , I have heard of some issues where the computer will not see the RAID array when you are booted off of the OS X install disc .
You might need to create the array while booted off of another external OS X install or on a working OS X install already present on one of the SSDs — that 's why I recommend having an external hard drive lying around just in case .
To clarify , it seems if you have the computer booted off of OS X on another drive , insert the install disc , run the initial setup from the inside - OS X installer that auto - reboots for you , that it should work .. if that makes sense .
If not , leave a comment .
If you are in situation # 1 like myself , then things are a bit trickier .
In a nutshell , I cloned my OS X installation onto an external USB 2.0 hard drive , changed the startup disk to that external drive then booted from it , created the RAID array , cloned the external drive onto the new RAID array , changed the startup disk to the RAID array and rebooted .
While you can do the drive cloning back and forth like I describe below I always recommend doing a fresh OS X install whenever possible .
Alrighty , here we go .
Download and install Carbon Copy Cloner ( SuperDuper works too ) .
Connect your external hard drive .
I have had a cheap Western Digital My Book hard drive solely for Time Machine backups .
I had plenty of extra space on the drive so I partitioned it so that I could maintain both Time Machine backups and a Carbon Copy Clone of my OS X install .
If you want to do the same and use your external drive for both Time Machine and a bootable OS X drive clone , connect the drive and open Disk Utility .
Click the external hard drive on the left pane and then click the Partition tab on the right .
Resize the current Time Machine partition to make room for a second partition .
Apply changes and name the new partition .
Fire up Carbon Copy Cloner and select the internal SSD with OS X as the source drive and the new partition you just made on the external drive ( if you did that ) as the target drive .
Make sure the drive will be bootable .
It should say " This volume will be bootable . "
Click Clone .
Somewhere around 30 minutes to a few hours later , drive cloning will be done .
Now we want to boot OS X off of that new external clone .
Go to System Preferences » Startup Disk and select the external drive .
Click Restart .
After successfully booting into OS X on the external drive , open Disk Utility once again .
You may opt to first erase both SSDs before proceeding .
Select one of the SSDs in the left pane ( the root device that says INTEL SSD ... , not the partition disk1s .. ) and select the RAID tab on the right .
Select Striped RAID
Set for RAID Type , and keep Format as the default " Mac OS Extended ( Journaled ) . "
Drag each of the SSDs on the left into the open section on the bottom right .
About to create the RAID array
Click Options .
For RAID Block Size select 128 K and then click OK .
As for why I selected that value , I find it to be a great all around compromise for performance and versatility with files of all sizes .
If the block size was smaller , it would perform slightly better with smaller files ( versus just letting one SSD in the RAID 0 array receive the data of a file that is smaller than the block size ) but it would not be as effective with larger files .
If you 're still curious about this , feel free to ask me for a more in - depth explanation in the comments .
Selecting RAID array block size .
Click Create , then click Create again in the next window .
Your new RAID 0 SSD array will be made momentarily .
Creating the RAID 0 SSD array
Sweet !
The RAID 0 array is working and online .
There 's still no OS on the RAID array so we 'll need to fire up ye olde Carbon Copy Cloner again .
This time select the external drive as the source disk and the new RAID array as the target disk .
Make sure " Backup Everything " is selected .
Again , check to see that CCC says " This volume will be bootable . "
Click Clone .
If it gives you a warning about deleting files on the target volume , click Continue .
Do n't use the computer and go grab a bite to eat or get a quad - shot cappuccino or something .
Or comment on this article saying how you 're following along and all is going well and you 're super excited about the new speeds your laptop is about to see .
Cloning OS
X from external drive to new RAID 0 SSD array underway - Carbon Copy Cloner
After cloning finishes , open up the Startup Disk pane in System Preferences again .
Select the new RAID array you made as the startup disk .
Click Restart .
Boot off of your new RAID array
When the computer boots up into OS X again , this time from your new RAID array , eject and unplug the external drive .
One last time , open up Disk Utility .
Click on the RAID array , select the First Aid tab and click Repair Disk Permissions .
After that is done click Verify Disk and then Repair Disk if deemed necessary .
RAID Array First Aid
Now , one last check to make sure everything is running a - okay .
Select the RAID array in Finder and hit Command + I ( Get Info ) .
Expand the Sharing & Permissions section at the bottom .
Click the little lock and type in your password to gain access .
Make sure that both " system " and " admin " have Read & Write privileges set .
Performance
I 'll let the numbers speak for themselves .
You may click any of these screenshots for a larger version .
Benchmarks were carried out by QuickBench after a fresh reboot and the numbers presented below were calculated as an average of 10 runs .
Tests from 4KB all the way up to 100 MB are shown below .
Without Cache Effects and Asynchronous I/ O enabled , standard averages varied slightly from the test above : 206.885 MB/sec ( seq reads ) , 106.755 MB/sec ( seq writes ) , 162.901 MB/sec ( rand reads ) , 72.378 MB/sec ( rand writes ) .
Without Cache Effects and Asynchronous I/ O enabled , max reads and writes were 520 MB/sec and 170 MB / sec , respectively .
If numbers are n't your thing , how about some typical day - to - day tasks :
Photoshop CS4 loads in 2 seconds and only takes another 7 seconds to load 5 hi-res images ( each around 5 - 8 MB )
It takes 6.5 seconds to load Photoshop CS4 , Illustrator CS4 and Fireworks CS4 simultaneously .
What other daily tasks do you do ?
Let me know in the comments and I will update this post with the results .
However , bootup times are not remarkably fast as it seems to take a while for the RAID array to get recognized .
Not the biggest deal if you only happen to reboot every 50 days or so like I do .
Verdict
the X25 - M is already outdated by the new SandForce controller SSDs , as well as offerings with Samsung or Indilinx drive controllers with caching , currently emerging on the market the 160GB version of the X25 - M has faster sustained reads and writes than the 80 GB X25 - M the X25 - M is MLC .
while more storage at the expense of performance made it acceptable for a single SSD , having a RAID setup makes it easier to get two 64GB SLC SSDs and have much greater speeds
This RAID 0 SSD setup in my 17 - inch Unibody MacBook Pro is just the way I like my cars and computers : .
I give the 2x80 GB Intel X25 - M RAID SSD setup in my MacBook Pro .
It 's not a 10 out of 10 because :
Q : So is this hardware or software RAID ?
A : This MacBook Pro ( or other Apple laptops for that matter ) do not seem to have hardware RAID controllers , such as ICH10R and their ilk .
As such , this RAID array is software .
That just means that intense disk I/O is also accompanied with some increased CPU activity .
Q : OMG how do you live without an optical drive !!?!?
A : Easily .
The last time I used my optical drive for anything was to burn a music CD for the car and that was just because I was too lazy to sync and charge my iPod Nano .
Optical media is slowly dying .
Although I would like to see the next Core i5 Apple laptops come with the option of a Blu-ray drive .
Q : But you 're running twice as many drives .. does n't that suck a lot of power ?
A : I have n't noticed any changes in battery life .
Most SSDs have better power consumption profiles compared to their mechanical counterparts in most scenarios .
For example , SSDs easily outperform spinning disks under high load situations in terms of power consumption .
Q : What about TRIM ?
A : Well first off , TRIM is n't even supported by OS X as of Snow Leopard so it 's not like that 's a big deal .
However , while you could boot into Windows 7 previously if you had a dual - boot system and run TRIM from there ( edit : but even that is of limited utility as Windows 7 can't run TRIM on HFS + ) , that is n't possible with an SSD RAID array .
It is not possible to TRIM a RAID array now for a few reasons .
No RAID controller ( and this array is software too , so there is not a physical RAID controller ) currently supports TRIM on RAID and it is not possible to TRIM each SSD separately since the file system needs to be seen and the RAID layer on top of that kind of abstracts it .
This does not mean that TRIM on SSD RAID arrays will not be possible in the future but it requires that the OS , RAID controller and SSDs all support TRIM , which will invariably take some time .
In short : not being able to run TRIM is only a substantial concern once the entire volume has been written to once .
I am currently using less than half of the array 's storage space so this is not a huge concern right now .
Also this array will probably only exist on my computer for 9 months , then I 'll upgrade it with something faster .
Now that you 've read all of this , here 's a bit of a warning : back up your stuff often .
SSDs are kind of flaky in terms of lifetime .
My first one died in under a year ( I believe Intel claim 5 years of writing 100 GB / day - correct me if I 'm wrong - but still the controller can go out and random events ) , and it does n't help that I am now running 2 of them in RAID 0 without any way to run TRIM .
Thoughts ?
Is this something you would do with your laptop or desktop ?
Do you currently use a Solid State Drive in your main computer ?
Do you have the need for ( computer ) speed ?

When American kids reflect upon their childhoods decades from now , snacks may figure more prominently in their memories -- and around their waists -- than meals shared around a table .
From 1977 to 2006 , American children have added 168 snack calories per day to their diets , a study finds .
They ’re munching cookies after school , granola bars on the way to piano lessons , chips after an hour of soccer practice and peanut butter and crackers while waiting for dinner .
For some , those extra 1,176 calories a week could amount to as much as 13 1 /2 pounds of body fat a year .
Those non-meal noshes now account for more than a quarter of their average daily caloric intake , said Barry M. Popkin of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Health Affairs .
The research establishes just how much the omnipresence of snacks -- and the $ 68 - billion - a - year industry that sells them -- has contributed significantly to an epidemic of excess weight among U.S. children .
But even as public health officials remove sodas and fat - and salt - laden snacks from school vending machines , parents hoping to roll back the tide of snacking face some daunting challenges , including a food industry dedicated to satisfying the nation ’s voracious between - meal appetite with snack wraps , burger bites and miniature candy bars marketed as midafternoon pick - me-ups .
Charlene Miller , a South Pasadena mother of two boys , said , “ There ’s a lot of peer pressure ” to ply kids with treats .
At the beginning of basketball season this year , the coach of her 6 - year - old son ’s team ignited a parental rebellion when he said there was no need for an organized snack after the kids ’
Saturday morning games .
“ Some parents got really upset and said , ‘ But our kids expect a snack , ’ ” Miller said .
The coach relented , and each of Charlie Miller ’s teammates regularly gets a “ snack bag ” -- often chips , a packet of fruit - flavored candy and a sports drink -- before going home to lunch .
Dr. Judy Palfrey , president of the American Academy of Pediatrics , said the study ’s findings pointed to one of many factors that had pushed the nation ’s rate of child obesity to 16.4 % in 2007 -- an increase of roughly 10 % since 2003 alone .
“ We see milk intake and meal intake are going down ; the consumption of fatty and salty foods is going up .
Everybody is very busy , on the go all the time , not having three meals at home , ” Palfrey said .
American families need to “ think about healthier replacements ” for between - meals food , she says , and they need to hear those messages from their children ’s physicians .
“ Remember the days when we used to get quartered oranges ?
Bring those back ! ” Palfrey added .
In 1977 , just under 75 % of kids between 2 and 18 consumed at least one snack between meals , according to the new study , which tallied the responses of 31,337 children and adolescents to four federally funded food surveys .
In 2006 , the proportion of kids who snack reached 98 % .
That surge in snacking has pushed kids ’ overall intake of daily calories to an average of 2,099 a day -- up by 100 calories a day since 1977 , the survey reports .
By 2006 , 27.3 % of the total calories -- just under 600 calories a day -- came in the form of snacks , the North Carolina research team found .
Meanwhile , calories consumed at mealtimes have begun to slide slightly since the last food survey was conducted in 1994 .
The result : U.S. children are consuming more fatty , sugary and salty foods and less of the dairy , protein and produce that predominate at mealtime .
Sweet snacks such as cookies , cereal bars and cakes continue to supply the largest share of snacking calories , but the number of calories consumed in salty snacks such as popcorn , crackers and chips more than doubled from 1977 to 2006 , the study found .
Study coauthor Carmen Piernas , a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , said very active kids could burn snack calories through growth and physical activity , but children who are inactive , whose growth has slowed or whose diet is otherwise high in fat , will pack more of those calories not as muscle but as fat .
The snacking habit starts early , she added : Children 2 to 6 had the highest rate of snacking of all the groups surveyed .
Overall , snacks have become an integral part of American children ’s mobile and highly programmed lives :
Toddlers en route to play groups are plied with nibbles in the car to stave off tantrums ; school - age children are met with energy bars for the ride to lessons or sports activities ; older kids graze as they contemplate homework and check their Facebook pages .
“ They come home from school , they have a snack ; we go somewhere in the car , we have a snack .
We might get caught somewhere , and we should have some snacks just in case , ” says Katie Scrivner , a Los Angeles mother of three .
“ It ’s never - ending snacks around here . ”

A group of Papua New Guineans has demonstrated outside the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby , calling for the choice to become Australian citizens .
Most want to stay in PNG but believe Australian citizenship may bring access to better health care and education .
Several hundred people waved Australian flags and sang the Australian national anthem in their local language .
Most were born before 1975 when PNG became independent from Australia .
Jonathan Baure from the Papuan Plaintiff Group says they want the choice to become Australian citizens .
" What the dispute is that when independence came , whether we lost that or not , we do n't believe we lost it because we never renounced it , " he said .
" That choice has to be given to us . "
A representative from Australian High Commission told them the High Court of Australia has already rejected their claims .
The District of Columbia 's plastic bag tax of 5 - cents generated only $ 150,000 in January , far below analyst 's expectations .
But that 's the good news .
The number of bags handed out by supermarkets and other establishments plummeted 85 % , from 22 million to 3 million .
The revenue will go to cleaning up the Anacostia River .
As Atlantic colleague Megan McArdle mentioned during the morning meeting , it would imprudent to read too much into these early returns .
It 's possible that some consumers , shocked by the initial pricing of the bags , elected to carry their few groceries by hand or linen bag in the weeks after the tax debuted .
Still they might eventually decide that 5 - cents per plastic sack is a small price to pay for convenience .
That might be right .
But if the dramatic drop - off holds , the immediate lesson for local policymakers is straightforward .
Consumers react to prices , and when the price change is from zero , the impact is particularly acute .
You do n't need to enact something as steep as a 20 - cent bag tax , as Seattle recently tried and failed to do .
The presence of a new signal can be enough to change incentives and decisions .
It 's true that this tax , like just about any tax , comes with its bizarre exemptions and complications .
Bookstores that sell so much as a mint get hit with the tax ( bookstore Politics and Prose stopped selling novelty mints in reaction to the measure ) .
Establishments with food and seating are exempt , but only for paper bags .
Anti-tax hawks like the Washington Examiner are making some rather silly claims about how Marylanders cannot " afford " this tax because it is " unfair , unwarranted and unreasonable . "
Baloney .
A five - cent Pigouvian tax to account for the negative externality of pollution -- the Anacostia chokes with 200 tons of trash from plastic bags every year , according to the WSJ -- is fair , warranted , reasonable and utterly affordable .

We will learn how to identify triads in the same manner as scales and intervals .
We will begin with major triads .
Major Triads
You will recall that triads are made by stacking thirds .
Its members are called the root , third and fifth .
It ’s useful to know the interval content of a major triad : it has a major third and perfect fifth above the root .
The distance between the third and fifth is a minor third .
We often name a triad by its root note and quality , for example , C major :
Learning to identify major triads by sound , is as simple as learning how to sing them .
If we use solfege , the syllables are do mi so .
We will continue to use the same methods as in the previous two articles .
Start by singing a major scale up to the fifth : do re mi fa so Now sing re and fa silently : do ( re ) mi ( fa ) so And finally sing do mi so .
With triads you could also sing them both ascending and descending : do mi so mi do .
Now that you can sing back a major triad , try reproducing the following four major triads .
You will first hear a triad with some time to sing it back , then you will hear the next one
You may also wish to pause the player after each triad if you need more time :
Minor Triads
Now we can take a peek at minor triads .
Minor triads have a minor third and perfect fifth above the root .
The interval from the third to the fifth is a major third :
The solfege for minor triads is la do mi .
Give yourself a starting pitch and sing the first five scale degrees of a minor scale , then work up to the triad as before :
la ti do re mi la ( ti ) do ( re ) mi la do mi
Listen and sing back the following minor triads :
Now you can test your skills .
You will hear six triads – identify whether the triad is major or minor :
Harmonic Form
Before moving onto diminished and augmented triads , we should spend a little time with non-arpeggiating triads .
The following example has three major triads followed by three minor ones .
Play the complete example , just listening to quality of the chords :
Now play the first chord only .
See if you can hear and sing back its three pitches .
You may have to fish around a bit , but that ’s okay .
You may also wish to work with you instrument .
Play the chord , and sing a pitch from it .
Figure out if you are matching the root , third , or fifth , then sing the rest of the triad .
Replay the chord , and sing it from the root through to the fifth .
Allow yourself the time that you need to develop this skill .
It only takes a few seconds to read this paragraph , but it might take a few practice sessions to develop this skill .

On the heels of my wish for a C++ version of printer - applet , Dantti announced just such a project .
He invited me to contribute , so I did .
Since print - manager is a from - scratch project , it needed a tray icon daemon .
Well , it sorta had a stub based on KPackage Kit ’s tray icon daemon , but nothing really functional .
A few weeks ago I ported the stub to KStatusNotifierItem and left it in an uninstallable , never - tested state .
( This was because at the time I was not hacking in a place where I could print things )
Today I fiddled around with library names and . desktop files until the KDED module loaded .
The result ?
Every 5 seconds
I ’d get a new printer icon ! 😀
So today I cleaned up the code .
I got it to the point where it pretty much has feature parity with the applet included in KDE 4.4 .
In fact , it ’s a bit more , nifty , even ; it now tells you the name of the printer currently printing as well as the name of the document it is printing .
Neat !
Things work mostly as before .
As long as your jobs are consolidated to a single printer , clicking the icon will load up the queue for that printer .
But since print - manager currently can only show the queue for one printer at a time , if the active jobs are spread across multiple printers , clicking the tray icon will make a context menu with all the printers pop up , and clicking these menu entries will open up the print queue for that printer .
I should note that I ’ve not actually tested this , for the lack of two printers .
I am wondering , though ; is the amount of documents in queue important enough to include in a third line in the tooltip ?
I could see how it might , and it should be easy enough to do so .
The last thing on the todo list is to fix a pretty nasty bug .
Since this tray icon is spawned by the KDE Daemon ( KDED ) , the “ quit ” action automagically added to the icon ’s context menu will quit the whole of KDED , bringing down services such as PowerDevil , KHotkeys and so forth .
I ’m at a loss on how to get around this .
Setting a custom context menu wo n’t work , as the setContextMenu ( ) function of KStatusNotifierItem just adds your custom Menu to the preexisting menu that comes by default .
Any bright ideas would be welcome here .
So , perhaps not the most exciting blog post on Earth , seeing as I ’m just replacing already - existing functionality , but hopefully a few of the new features are a bit interesting .
It ’s certainly been quite interesting to code . 🙂

Over the last 25 years my work has been in the public arena .
I began with an inner city Christian newspaper that I founded , moved on to start my current organization CURE - Coalition for Urban Renewal and Education , wrote three books , and have written a weekly opinion column for the last five years .
I ’ve spoken at over 200 universities and in 49 of 50 states .
All of this effort has been aimed to deliver one basic message .
That the barrier between America ’s chronically poor and the American dream is the welfare state socialism which was supposed to be our answer to poverty .
As a young woman I was on welfare myself .
I saw from inside the perverse and destructive culture it created .
A dehumanized culture of dependence and irresponsibility that encourages behavior exactly the opposite of what a successful life demands .
The result speaks for itself .
Fifty years and a trillion plus dollars in spending after President Johnson announced the War on Poverty , poverty rates are unchanged .
I ’ve often been approached to run for public office .
However , I always deferred because I felt I could make the greatest difference delivering my message as a free agent , outside the formal structure of politics .
But things have changed and now I ’ve decided to run .
We ’ve totally reversed the direction we started in after we reformed welfare in 1996 .
As I wrote a little over a year ago : “ I thought we were on the road to moving socialism out of poor black communities and replacing it with wealth producing American capitalism .
But , incredibly , we are going in the opposite direction .
Instead of poor America on socialism becoming more like rich America on capitalism , rich America on capitalism is becoming like poor America on socialism . ”
The leaders of many of our largest corporations , whose founders were among our nation ’s great entrepreneurs , are now bureaucrats content to bargain away our nation ’s future , happy to play ball with government , if it means carving out politically protected profits for themselves .
The government health care takeover which has just been forced on an unhappy America could not have happened without the cooperation of our large pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies .
They should be ashamed of themselves .
Just a few weeks ago , the chairman of Citigroup , one the largest banks in the world , came to Washington to testify and thanked American taxpayers – you and me – for bailing out his bank .
There is a reason why eight of ten Americans say that our nation is on the wrong track and why , according to Gallup , only 28 % of voters now believe most members of congress deserve to be re-elected .
Most citizens retain their common sense because they run a household and have to pay their bills .
They see through the duplicity and deception that our political class tries to pass off as governing .
It ’s estimated that our national debt plus unfunded obligations of Social Security and Medicare is now $ 100 trillion .
As with the health care bill , those holding power in Washington will try to deal with this through even greater tax increases and expansion of government – sealing for good the welfare state transformation of America .
I ’m challenging a Black Caucus incumbent in a district that political pundits rate “ safe ” for Democrats .
But this year no Democrat representing low income Americans should feel safe peddling the same plantation policies that already have produced our broken schools , broken families , and broken spirits .
Now they ’re bringing these bankrupt ideas to the whole country .
Even California Senator Barbara
Boxer recently admitted that this year no seat is safe .
Will we resign ourselves to an America where freedom and prosperity are distant memories and where 40 % out - of - wedlock births and abortion as birth control are our new social norms ?
I wo n’t .
It ’s why I ’m stepping into this race .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Federal security workers are now free to snoop through more than just your undergarments and luggage at the airport .
Thanks to a recent series of federal court decisions , the digital belongings of international fliers are now open for inspection .
This includes reading the saved e-mails on your laptop , scanning the address book on your iPhone or BlackBerry and closely scrutinizing your digital vacation snapshots .
Unlike the more common confiscations of dangerous Evian bottles and fingernail clippers , these searches are not being done in the name of safety .
The digital seizures instead are part of a disturbing trend of federal agencies using legal gimmicks to sidestep Fourth Amendment constitutional protections .
This became clear in an April 8 court ruling that found admissible the evidence obtained by officials who had peeped at a passenger ’s laptop files at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston .
According to court documents , FBI agents had identified an individual suspected of downloading child pornography on an Internet chat room .
The G - men , however , did not want to take their evidence before a judge to obtain a search warrant , as the Constitution requires .
Instead , they flagged the suspect ’s passport and asked officials at the Department of Homeland Security to seize and search his computer at the airport - without a warrant .
Three incriminating images were found during the examination , but this case is not about whether a particular person is a scumbag .
It ’s about abusing a principle that applies to all Americans .
U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller found in this case that neither probable cause , justification nor warrant were required to seize and examine the suspect ’s laptop .
Judge Miller , in accord with a 9th Circuit appellate ruling handed down two years ago , explained that “ the court finds that reviewing the files of a computer does not rise to the level of invasion of the privacy and dignity of the individual to make the search non-routine . ”
In other words , simply because a U.S. citizen is returning from a foreign country by airplane , the government thinks it is a “ routine ” matter to download sensitive business documents , personal correspondence and any other information that might be saved on a laptop or cell phone , regardless of whether there is any reason to suspect the traveler of a crime .
The danger of this chain of reasoning is magnified by the courts ’ expansive definition of “ border , ” which now includes checkpoints operating up to 100 miles from Canada or Mexico .
Those traveling on the highway between Los Angeles and Phoenix , for example , may find themselves stopped by Department of Homeland Security officers who , literally , ask travelers to show their papers .
Drug dogs also can be brought in to search vehicles without probable cause .
The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of Americans to be “ secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects ” from unreasonable and unwarranted government intrusion .
It is obvious that this right is meant to apply equally to papers that happen to be stored in digital form on a personal hard drive .
Such protections do not disappear merely because one happens to be at a real - or imaginary - border .
Because the courts have been derelict in their duty to uphold this fundamental right , it is up to Congress to prohibit the thinly veiled attempts to create Constitution - free zones where Americans find their privacy invaded .

A North Korean Army officer has testified that the North Korean military attacked the South Korean Navy corvette Cheonan before it sank in the West Sea on March 26 , the head of a South Korean activist group claimed Monday .
Choi Sung - yong of the Family Assembly Abducted to North Korea said , " It seems that the Cheonan was sunk in a premeditated North Korean operation . "
Choi published a transcript of a telephone conversation with what he says is a senior North Korean Army officer .
According to the transcript , the officer says , " Thirteen commandos who left from Cape Bipagot sank the Cheonan .
Many people as well as military officers already know who attacked the ship . "
The officer claims the motive was revenge .
" After the North lost the sea skirmish in November last year , Kim Jong - il gave an order to take revenge .
He gave the order when he visited the naval fleet command in Nampo . "
The officer according to the transcript claims Gens .
Kim Yong - chol and U Dong - chuk traveled between Pyongyang and Nampo frequently to visit the fleet command to work out an operational plan .
" Navy Commander Jong Myong - do stayed in Nampo until the mission was accomplished , " he added .
Kim Yong - chol , the director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau in charge of espionage operations against the South , has been consistently fingered by South Korean intelligence agents as the man behind the attack .
U Dong-chuk , the senior deputy chief of the State Security Department and a member of the National Defense Commission , and Navy Commander Jong Myong - do were promoted to full generals on Kim Il - sung 's 98th birthday last Thursday .
They were two of the four lieutenant generals who were promoted the same day .
Their promotions stoked suspicions here since U was promoted to a full general only a year after he was promoted to lieutenant general .
Jong was promoted unexpectedly after his position became uncertain following North Korea 's ignoble defeat in the sea skirmish last year .
" Some of the 13 commandos who left Cape Bipagot before they sank the Cheonan are acquaintances of mine , " the alleged officer claims according to the transcript .
" It seems it was such an important mission that a semi- submersible which was made originally for a crew of three was remodeled for the mission . "
He claims the Cheonan 's sinking lifted soldiers ' morale and the 13 commandos " are being treated as heroes . "
" They apparently spent a lot of time practicing camouflage by sneaking around fleet of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats operating near Baeknyeong Island , " the officer says .
" It seems lik ely that a bigger event will occur in the future given that they are operating also in the East Sea , camouflaging themselves there . "
Commenting on North Korean broadcasts ' denial of the North 's involvement , the transcript has him saying , " It 's natural for them to deny involvement , is n't it ?
We 're tired since we 've always been on emergency alert . "
Across the world 's sunbelts , concentrated solar power is emerging as a blindingly obvious answer both to global power – and local water – needs .
But can it reach the scale required , asks Duncan Graham - Rowe
Desertification is a dirty word , but deserts are not entirely without their uses .
Plans are underway to transform swathes of the Sahara into a glimmering sea of mirrors , with the goal of piping cheap , clean and efficient solar energy into the heart of Europe .
Dubbed the Desertec Industrial Initiative , it will create vast fields of concentrated solar power ( CSP ) plants – arrays of mirrors which focus the sun 's energy to turn water into steam , and so drive electrical turbines .
From there , the power will flow through a network of low loss transmission cables to pipe electricity into the existing European grid , via Spain .
The £ 240 billion venture , which brings together such big energy names as Siemens and E.
On , is designed to meet as much as 15 % of Europe 's fast - rising electricity demand by 2050 .
And the first electrons could be coming onstream in as little as five years ' time …
This , says Jonathon Porritt , is something of a second coming for CSP .
" It was first introduced after the oil shocks of the 70s and early 80s , but as soon as oil prices fell , all investment in that particular technology stopped . "
But now that the cost of carbon is playing into the economics of energy production , CSP is looking increasingly promising .
According to Keith Bowen , director of engineering at UK - based Circadian Solar , it holds two trump cards : efficiency and scale .
" It scales extremely well , " he says .
As the size of the plant increases , the relative costs come down .
Large CSP plants can produce power for a quarter of the cost of that generated by standard solar photovoltaics , adds Bowen .
Efficiency is improving rapidly , too .
Twenty years ago , the maximum efficiency you could get from the sun was 15 - 20 % , compared with over 50 % for fossil fuels .
" Today , " says Bowen , " [ CSP is ] closer to 40 % . "
And for those who live in or near deserts , that means it can also play a role in securing another vital asset : water .
CSP is ideally suited to powering desalination plants .
Taking salt out of water is a simple enough process , but one that uses a lot of energy .
For developing countries where power shortages are a growing problem , as well as luxury resort islands where resources are scarce , Bowen argues , CSP could be an ideal solution – producing clean water and power at the same time .
A common criticism directed at both solar and wind power is that they 're inherently intermittent : the sun only shines in the day , the breeze does n't always blow .
But recent advances in CSP could keep the power flowing all night long .
Desertec is designed to operate 24 hours a day by superheating water to temperatures of 260ºC , sufficient to create steam at high enough pressures that it will keep driving turbines and generating electricity long after the sun has set .
An alternative approach , which is being explored by Solar Reserve in California , is to use the thermal energy to melt salt .
Molten salt retains heat long enough to drive a turbine for much of the night .
The company is hoping to build a 150 MW solar plant in the Sonaran Desert , which would use 17,500 mirrors , each 24 metres wide , to heat salt to 565ºC .
This would be enough to store up to seven hours of the sun 's energy .
There 's a lot of promise in this sort of approach , says Bowen .
" It 's been around for a while and is fairly well developed . "
But , he says , like other forms of CSP , it tends to work best on a grand scale , typically plants of 50 MW or above .
Another development that should also help to spur CSP is the availability of better solar maps .
These are detailed layouts of the earth 's surface that show historical information about the amount of sunlight different locations receive .
These data sheets have long been available from places like the US Government 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado , quantifying typical solar trends in different geographic regions .
Now companies like 3TIER in Seattle , Washington , are making it possible to target locations for solar power not just by general region but at much higher resolutions .
This enables prospective CSP developers to zero in on ideal sites .
3TIER 's maps are the first to take into account not just solar activity but also the impact of long - term and seasonal wind variations .
These can be significant between locations just a few kilometres apart , and affect the energy required to continually readjust the position of the mirrors .
Using this sort of approach , it has become possible to choose sites that will optimise energy output , says Gerry Wolff , Coordinator of DESERTEC-UK , an independent advisory group of CSP enthusiasts .
In fact , he says , it 's been calculated that a single patch of the Sahara , just 114,090 square kilometres in area , receives enough sunlight to meet the entire world 's electricity demands through CSP .
So what 's stopping us ?
Partly cost , says Wolff .
Hovering at around 10 - 20 US cents per kilowatt hour , CSP " looks a little bit on the expensive side " , compared with gas at about 5 cents .
But this is likely to change when the volumes increase , he says .
Indeed , three studies carried out by the German aerospace industry suggest that CSP could eventually become one of the cheapest sources of electricity in Europe .
" Until about 2017 , electricity from CSP will probably be more expensive , " concludes Wolff .
But then , as economies of scale kick in , it will become cheaper and increasingly attractive .
It is certainly attracting growing interest .
The World Bank recently announced it is investing $ 5.5 billion into the development of CSP across North Africa .
And last year , Morocco , the only North African state with no oil production of its own , declared its intention to become a pioneer in CSP as a way of cutting reliance on oil and gas imports .
It plans to build five plants with a total energy production of 2,000 MW by 2020 .
In light of such investment , the Desertec Industrial Initiative seems less of a leap of faith .
The technology to transmit the electricity across the vast distances to Europe has been well established for decades , says Wolff .
But realistically , it only needs to reach as far as Spain , since Europe already has an international electrical transmission grid .
This , Wolff adds , acts a bit like a pond , in the sense that it does n't matter where you fill it up from .
" So countries as far north as Sweden would immediately benefit . "
The consensus on CSP now , says Jonathon Porritt , is that although it 's extremely ambitious , it 's also quite realistic .
Besides the potential to generate vast amounts of electricity , the growing need for renewable sources of desalinated water makes CSP an excellent candidate for support , he says .
The irony is that in years to come we may find ourselves looking to deserts not just for power , but also for water .
Solar , lighter
CSP may be a simple idea , but it does n't come cheap .
It 's not easy building in the middle of a desert , and there are fairly substantial costs involved in constructing all the mirrors and central receiver towers , which have to withstand extreme temperatures and continuously pump water up to the collector .
One solution to this is to dispense with the steam turbines and instead concentrate the light on highly efficient photovoltaic solar cells – the approach taken by Circadian .
Another novel approach , under experimentation at the Tokyo Institute of Technology , is to construct cheaper lightweight towers , containing a second set of mirrors at the light collection point .
These are used to redirect the light to heat water at ground level , precluding the need to pump it up the tower .
Shall we play a game ?
I wanted to learn more about Silverlight , WPF , and Xaml ( in the context of F# , of course ) , so I wrote a fun little game you can play in your browser ( or on your desktop ) .
It ’s a knock - off of a dozen other similar games , as you can probably tell from this screenshot :
What you do n’t get from the screenshot are the amusing sound effects or the fun game play , so why not go try it out in your browser right now ?
I ’ll still be here when you return .
( Do n’t forget to come back and keep reading ! )
< waits patiently for your return >
It ’s kinda fun , right ?
I was pleased with it , especially given that it is just the second Silverlight app I ever wrote ( you might recall the first , here ) , and it ’s also my first real foray into interactive game programming .
How I wrote it
I really had little clue what I was doing .
I had some pictures sketched out on paper of what I wanted the app to look like .
But I have little experience with WPF , and so I spent a bit of time looking up APIs for things like how to draw a circle on the screen , or a line .
The basic math for keeping track of ball velocities and bouncing off walls is pretty straightforward , so I coded that all up .
I had no idea how it would perform in real time , so I did the simplest thing – I wrote a game loop that just updates the state of the world every 20 milliseconds .
Of course I used F# async to simplify authoring the UI logic and reacting to keyboard / mouse events .
But I kept it as simple as possible ; all the code runs on the UI thread .
By the end of an evening I had the basic game app working , which amazed me , as I had no idea how long it might take .
Despite blundering through new - to - me Silverlight and WPF APIs and having to read lots of docs , I had a playable game in less than six hours of coding .
It was running a little slow , so the next time I sat down with it , I added some “ # if SILVERLIGHT ” bits to the code so that I compile it as either a desktop app or a Silverlight app .
Maybe there is a way to profile Silverlight code , I dunno , but I do already know how to use Visual Studio ’s profiler on desktop apps .
So I put the desktop version through the profiler , found one place where I was hemorrhaging memory ( creating lots of extra work for the garbage collector ) , fixed that ( with one line of code ) , and then the app was pretty snappy .
This pleased me to no end ; you can have 3200 WPF objects moving around on the screen in a simple game loop , and it still runs smoothly , even in Silverlight , in the browser , on a laptop .
I ’d really thought I was going to have to do a lot of work to get good runtime performance out of the game I had envisioned , but in fact I just did the most straightforward thing and the perf was already good enough .
WPF and Silverlight do not suck !
Since then I ’ve done a little more work : some refactoring and cleanup , as well as adding the sound effects ( I searched the web for public - domain sounds and picked four that I liked ) .
I also added the startup screen and the pause button .
There is a lot more I might like to do with the app ( add scoring , different levels , different fun aspects of the game play ) , but my teammates on the F# team have pointed out that it ’s already a nice “ F# sample app ” and I should just go ahead and publish it already .
So here we are .
Did I mention it ’s only 400 lines of code ?
It ’s only 400 lines of code .
And it ’s pure F#. Actually , those are both lies ; there are 373 lines of F# code , and 20 lines of Xaml .
So it ’s less than 400 lines total , and not quite pure F# because I wanted to try out Xaml and so I coded a little in Xaml to learn a little more about that .
The source code
The full source code is below , for those who just want to read it here in the blog post .
I also zipped up the Visual Studio 2010 solution , which you can download from this page .
The solution contains two projects , the F# WPF app and the F# Silverlight app , that compile from the same source code .
( Note that if you try to run the Silverlight project using ‘ F5 ’ in Visual Studio it will not work ; it will open the browser to the ‘ bin ’ directory , rather than ‘ bin \ Debug ’ or ‘ bin \Release ’ , due to a product bug .
But you can just build the project , and then manually open the generated test page HTML in your browser .
Also , sometimes when I open the Xaml file in the designer , it gives me an error , but then if I reload the file again , it works .
( There is a reason we did not ship an F# “ Silverlight Application ” template in the box – we still have a number of little tooling bugs we need to fix . )
If you want to do things on your own , I ’d recommend creating a “ C# Silverlight Application ” project that uses an “ F# Silverlight Library ” project , for a smoother tooling experience inside Visual Studio .
But I was stubborn and wanted only F# , so I did this .
Anyway … )

I ’d be interested to see people do fun enhancements to this code .
I ’d also be interested to see people author a similar app on other platforms ( iPhone , Android , HTML5 Canvas / Javascript , …) – I think perhaps the .NET platform is terrific in terms of languages and tooling to write this kind of stuff , but I have no comparative experience of my own , and I am curious to know how easy or hard it would be to mimic this app on another platform .
A new study led by Ohio University scientists suggests that early Native Americans left a bigger carbon footprint than previously thought , providing more evidence that humans impacted global climate long before the modern industrial era .
Chemical analysis of a stalagmite found in the mountainous Buckeye Creek basin of West Virginia suggests that native people contributed a significant level of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere through land use practices .
The early Native Americans burned trees to actively manage the forests to yield the nuts and fruit that were a large part of their diets .
" They had achieved a pretty sophisticated level of living that I do n't think people have fully appreciated , " said Gregory Springer , an associate professor of geological sciences at Ohio University and lead author of the study , which was published a recent issue of the journal The Holocene .
" They were very advanced , and they knew how to get the most out of the forests and landscapes they lived in .
This was all across North America , not just a few locations . "
Initially , Springer and research collaborators from University of Texas at Arlington and University of Minnesota were studying historic drought cycles in North America using carbon isotopes in stalagmites .
To their surprise , the carbon record contained evidence of a major change in the local ecosystem beginning at 100 B.C.
This intrigued the team because an archeological excavation in a nearby cave had yielded evidence of a Native American community there 2,000 years ago .
Springer recruited two Ohio University graduate students to examine stream sediments , and with the help of Harold Rowe of University of Texas at Arlington , the team found very high levels of charcoal beginning 2,000 years ago , as well as a carbon isotope history similar to the stalagmite .
This evidence suggests that Native Americans significantly altered the local ecosystem by clearing and burning forests , probably to make fields and enhance the growth of nut trees , Springer said .
This picture conflicts with the popular notion that early Native Americans had little impact on North American landscapes .
They were better land stewards than the European colonialists who followed , he said , but they apparently cleared more land and burned more forest than previously thought .
" Long before we were burning fossil fuels , we were already pumping greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere .
It was n't at the same level as today , but it sets the stage , " Springer said .
This long - ago land clearing would have impacted global climate , Springer added .
Ongoing clearing and burning of the Amazon rainforest , for example , is one of the world 's largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions .
Prehistoric burning by Native Americans was less intense , but a non-trivial source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere , he said .
Coastguard Ian Goodwin said : " We passed on relevant safety advice and advised him that the best way to Southampton would be by train .
However , he said he would get some fuel and get underway but asked us if he went left or right when he came out of the Swale . "
JAKARTA , Indonesia
HOTMAN PARIS HUTAPEA is , by his own reckoning , the freest lawyer in Indonesia .
In a country where bribes play an integral part in the legal system , where attorneys and judges usually hide part of their wealth to deflect unwanted attention , Mr. Hutapea has never denied gaming the system .
On the contrary , he has reveled in his success by wearing fat diamond rings and carrying , until laws changed a couple of years ago , a gun in a hip holster .
His office buildings here are adorned with signs that scream in big , bold letters : HOTMAN PARIS .
He is a regular on television gossip shows that link him to one starlet or another .
Colleagues may prudently choose to drive conservative cars , to court at least .
But Mr. Hutapea hops into his new red Ferrari California — the first one sold in Indonesia , for $ 630,000 — and parks it right in front of court buildings .
To his critics , the car and its owner are a prime symbol of the cancer infecting the legal system ; to Mr. Hutapea , the Ferrari amounts to an honest acknowledgment of the system ’s imperfections .
“ If I say I ’m a clean lawyer , I ’ll be a hypocrite , that ’s all I can say , ” he said .
“ And if other lawyers say they are clean , they will go to jail , they ’ll go to hell . ”
Not surprisingly , some rival lawyers and watchdog groups have pointed fingers at Mr. Hutapea as the Indonesian government has stepped up efforts to clean up the legal system and rid it of the so - called judicial mafia .
In a byzantine world populated by corrupt officials and middlemen , money is often funneled to prosecutors and judges to reduce a charge or tip a verdict .
Blockbuster is ' bleeding to death '
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Blockbuster is in a heap of trouble with nearly $ 1 billion in debt , and its latest fixes might not be enough to keep the company from filing for bankruptcy .
The movie rental company launched its newest enterprise on Wednesday , beating rival Netflix to the punch in mobile movies .
Blockbuster is now offering on demand video via T - Mobile 's new HTC HD2 smart phone .
The new service is also expected to be available on Android and Windows Mobile phones soon .

T- Mobile debuted the HTC HD2 on Wednesday , which is the first phone to feature Blockbuster 's on demand movie service .
That news follows the company 's announcement on Tuesday that it signed a new agreement with movie studio Warner Bros. , which is owned by CNNMoney.
com 's parent company Time Warner ( TWX , Fortune 500 ) .
The deal will continue to allow Blockbuster to offer the studio's new releases about a month before its chief competitors , Netflix ( NFLX ) and Coinstar 's ( CSTR ) Redbox .
Blockbuster 's latest moves are steps in the right direction .
But to overcome nearly $ 1 billion in debt , unprofitable stores and continued losses , what the company really needs is a major turnaround .
Blockbuster said last week it may have to file for bankruptcy protection if it cannot lower its debt by other means .
" Blockbuster is trying to keep itself from bleeding to death , but they 're putting on a lot of Band - Aids , " said Michael Pachter , Blockbuster analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities .
Blockbuster ( BBI , Fortune 500 ) did not return multiple requests for comment .
Struggling for survival
Blockbuster has been saddled with massive debt since media conglomerate Viacom ( VIA ) spun the company off in 2004 .
As part of the deal , Blockbuster had to pay Viacom shareholders a $ 5 per- share dividend , and the movie rental company accumulated about $ 1 billion of debt in the process .
At the time , the company was making profits of about $ 500 million a year , so Blockbuster assumed that it would be able to pay down that debt quickly .
But questionable business decisions -- like canceling all late fees -- ate into the company 's profits .
So did Netflix .
As Netflix 's movies by mail and streaming video services began to catch on in the last decade , Blockbuster was unable to catch up .
By the time Blockbuster 's competing service , Blockbuster Mail , launched in 2004 , Netflix had already been around for six years and had became synonymous with movies by mail .
" Asking if Blockbuster can compete with Netflix online is like asking if Best Buy can compete with Amazon online , " said Pachter .
" The answer is no .
It does n't matter how well capitalized you are , if the branding is n't there , you 're not going to be able to compete . "
Blockbuster is also taking aim at Redbox , launching a new partnership with NCR to place 10,000 DVD kiosks around the country by the end of the year .
But competing will be difficult : Redbox already has 20,000 kiosks in place , and the company 's revenues rose a whopping 99 % in 2009 .
Solutions
Despite its failure to catch up to the competition so far , Blockbuster may not be a lost cause .
While rumors continue to circulate about a Netflix iPhone application , Blockbuster got to market first today with mobile movies .
The new service allows users to download movies to buy or rent , similar to Apple 's ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) iTunes service .
Eventually , customers will be able to watch a movie on their phone , and then pick up where they left off on their Blockbuster On Demand enabled TV or Blu-ray player .
Analysts applaud Blockbuster for trying the new venture , but they say its impact will be minimal .
Pachter said he expects the company 's mobile service will add no more than $ 5 million to Blockbuster 's revenues .
Last year , Blockbuster lost $ 355 million on revenues of $ 4.1 billion .
To solve its debt problems , Blockbuster has to get its core in - store retail business stabilized .
One way the company is doing that is by continuing to shut down underperforming stores .
By the end of the year , the company will operate about 3,000 stores in the United States , down from about 4,500 at the start of 2009 .
But analysts say the deal with Warner Bros. is the most encouraging news the company has had in a while .
In addition to giving Blockbuster a one - month head start over Netflix and Redbox on new releases , the terms of the deal will also ease the company 's financial strain .
" There 's still demand for physical video stores , but that will go away if Blockbuster were to fail , " said Charles Wolf , Blockbuster analyst at Needham & Co .
" The movie studios realize that , and they realize that there is an important role to be played by Blockbuster 's stores . "
Though the financial terms of the deal were n't released , Pachter said the revenue - sharing agreement will allow Blockbuster to pay less money up front for its inventory of movies , and in turn , it will give Warner Bros .
a higher percentage of revenues from the rentals .
" That 's the right idea , " Pachter said .
" Blockbuster will gladly sacrifice profitability if they can have more cash up front to pay down their debt . "
Monitoring and analyzing performance is an important task for any sysadmin .
Disk I/ O bottlenecks can bring applications to a crawl .
What are IOPS ?
Should I use SATA , SAS , or FC ?
How many spindles do I need ?
What RAID level should I use ?
Is my system read or write heavy ?
These are common questions for anyone embarking on an disk I /O analysis quest .
Obligatory disclaimer : I do not consider myself an expert in storage or anything for that mater .
This is just how I have done I/O analysis in the past .
I welcome additions and corrections .
I believe it ’s also important to note that this analysis is geared toward random operations than sequential read / write workloads .
Let ’s start at the very beginning … a very good place to start .
Hey it worked for Julie Andrews …
So what are IOPS ?
They are input output ( I/O ) operations measured in seconds .
It ’s good to note that IOPS are also referred to as transfers per second ( tps ) .
IOPs are important for applications that require frequent access to disk .
Databases , version control systems , and mail stores all come to mind .
Great so now that I know what IOPS are how do I calculate them ?
IOPS are a function of rotational speed ( aka spindle speed ) , latency and seek time .
The equation is pretty simple , 1 / ( seek + latency ) = IOPS .
Scott Lowe has a good example on his techreplublic.com blog .
Sample drive : Model : Western Digital VelociRaptor 2.5 ″ SATA hard drive
Rotational speed : 10,000 RPM
Average latency : 3 ms ( 0.003 seconds )
Average seek time : 4.2 ( r ) /4.7 ( w ) = 4.45 ms ( 0.0045 seconds ) Calculated IOPS for this disk : 1/(0.003 + 0.0045 ) = about 133 IOPS
It ’s great to know how to calculate a disks IOPS but for the most part you can get by with commonly accepted averages .
Of course sources vary but from what I have seen .
Rotational Speed ( rpm ) IOPS 5400 50-80 7200 75-100 10 k 125-150 15 k 175-210
Should I use SATA , SAS or FC ?
That ’s a loaded question .
As with most things the answer is “ depends ” .
I do n’t want to get into the SATA vs SAS debate you can do your own research and make your own decisions based on your needs , but I will point out a few things .

As with most things the answer is “ depends ” .
I do n’t want to get into the SATA vs SAS debate you can do your own research and make your own decisions based on your needs , but I will point out a few things .
These factors are key considerations when choosing what kind of drives to use .
What RAID level should I use ?
You know what IOPS are , how to calculate them and determined what kind of drives to use , the next logical question is commonly RAID 5 vs RAID 10 .
There is difference in reliability , especially as the number of drives in your raid - set increases but that is outside the scope of this post .
Raid Level
Write Operations Read Operations Notes 1 1 Write / Read : high throughput , low CPU utilization , no redundancy 1 2 1 Write : only as fast as single driveRead : Two read schemes available .
Read data from both drives , or data from the drive that returns it first .
One is higher throughput the other is faster seek times .
5 4 1 Write : Read -Modify - Write requires two reads and two writes per write request .
Lower throughput higher CPU if the HBA does n’t have a dedicated IO processor .
Read - Modify - Write requires two reads and two writes per write request .
Lower throughput higher CPU if the HBA does n’t have a dedicated IO processor .
Read :
High throughput low CPU utilization normally , in a failed state performance falls dramatically due to parity calculation and any rebuild operations that are going on .
6 5 1 Write : Read -Modify - Write requires three reads and three writes per write request .
Do not use a software implementation if it is availableRead :
High throughput low CPU utilization normally , in a failed state performance falls dramatically due to parity calculation and any rebuild operations that are going on .
As you can see in the table above , writes are where you take your performance hit .
Now that the penalty or RAID factor is known for different raid levels we can get a good estimate of the theoretical maximum IOPS for a RAID set ( excluding caching of course ) .
To do this you take the product of the number of disks and IOPS per disk divided by the sum of the %read workload and the product of the raid factor ( see write operations column ) and % write workload .
Here is the equation :
d = number of disks
dIOPS = IOPS per disk
%r = % of read workload
%w = % of write workload
F = raid factor ( write operations column )
Wait a second , where am I supposed to get %read and % write from ?
You need to examine your workload .
I usually turn to my favorite statistics collector , sysstat .
sar -d -p will report activity for each block device and pretty print the device name .
I am assuming you already know what block device you are looking to analyze but if your looking for the busiest device just look in the tps column .
the rd_sec/s and wr_sec /s columns display number of sectors read / written from / to the device .
To get the percentage of read or writes divide rd_sec /s by the sum of rd_sec /s and wr_sec/s .
The equations :
An example from my workstation :
Average for sdb rd_sec/s = 1150.80
Average for sdb wr_sec /s = 1166.53
As you can see my workstation read / write workload is pretty balanced at 49.6 % read , and 50.3 % write .
Compare that to a cvs server ( do n’t get me started on how bad cvs is , its just something I have to deal with ) .
Average for sdb rd_sec/s = 27.78k
Average for sdb wr_sec /s = 2.07 k
This server workload is extremely high on reads .
Ok time to analyze the performance .
In and of itself being a heavy read workload is not a problem .
My problem is user complaints of slowness .
I note ( again from sysstat collected metrics ) that the tps or average IOPS on this device is about 574 .
Again thats not an issue in and of itself , we need to know what we can expect from its subsystem .
This device happens to be SAN based storage .
The raid set its on is comprised of 4 10 kRPM FC drives in a raid 10 .
Remember from the table above that IOPS for a 10kRPM drive are in the 125 - 150ish range .
We need to calculate the expected IOPS from that raid set using the IOPS equation above , our measured workloads for read / write , the number of disks , and the raid level ( 10 and 1 are treated the same ) .
Using the high end of the scale for 10 kRPM IOPS per drive results in a maximum theoretical IOPS of 561.79 , thats pretty close to what I am observing ( remember cache is not taken into account ) .
So based on these numbers it looks like my storage subsystem is saturated .
I guess I better add some spindles .
Unfortunately there is no historical data for this system so I have no way of knowing how many tps I need to aim for .
Do n’t get stuck where I am and have to guess how many spindles need to be added to reduce the pain , start recording your trends now !
Even better , once you start collecting your statistical information go ahead and set an alert for 65 % or 70 % utilization of theoretical max IOPS for an extended period as well as increasingly bothersome alerts going up from there .
It ’s never good to have to react to performance issues , always better to be proactive .
There was absolutely nothing wrong with the sizing of this example raid set 2 - 4 years ago .
Had it been under monitoring the entire time with proper thresholds set a proper plan could have been made , and spindles could have been added before causing users any pain .
If you want to use sysstat like I did , you might find this Nagios plug - in that I wrote helpful check_sar_perf .
I use it with Zenoss , but it could be tied into any NMS that records the performance data from a Nagios plug -in .
Go forth , collect , analyze and plan so your users are n’t calling you with issues .
CHIMOIO , Mozambique —
The lines of small bushy plants stretch out across the rolling hills of central Mozambique , dew - covered and shining in the morning sunlight .
Peter Whitehead walks down the rows smiling like only a father can at the somewhat scrubby , greasy little jatropha shrubs .
Whitehead , a forester from Knysna , South Africa , is starting up a farm of jatropha trees as a source of biofuel oil .
Jatropha 's origins are murky , with some experts suggesting it is a Central American or African crop , but Whitehead believes it comes from the Indian subcontinent and has been grown there for centuries .
The bush becomes a tree about the size of a large cherry tree and , although its fruits are inedible , they produce very fine oil .
The oil can be used to power diesel cars , trucks , ships and even airplanes .
Sun Biofuels , a British company , has been planting thousands of acres of jatropha at a former tobacco farm here and in other sites in Africa .
The company hopes the jatropha oil will help it cash in on the high price of fuel as well as offer an alternative fuel for companies that want to clean up their emissions and their image by investing in green energy .
A few years ago , biofuels were part of the worldwide craze for green energy , but after the food price shocks of 2008 , which saw global food commodity prices double or triple in much of the developing world , the idea of planting fuel has lost some of its shine .
Plowing up thousands of acres of maize , and planting an inedible crop like jatropha in a poor country like Mozambique , where many people are hungry , is problematic to many people .
But like much of the climate change debate , the issues around jatropha are not clear cut .
Mozambique has massive unemployment and it's one of the world 's 10 least developed countries .
The local and national government ministers in Mozambique all came to the launch of the farm , and said they hope this sort of project will be a success and lure more investors to their country with other new ideas .
Mozambique only cultivates 20 percent of its arable land , one of the lowest cultivation rates in Africa .
Sun Biofuels argues there should be room for all sorts of farming , particularly ones that bring education and employment .
At their Mozambican operation , Sun Biofuels took over an old tobacco farm and became the main employer in the area .
Shouting above the noise of the big Toyota bouncing between row after row of green little bushes , Whitehad explained that the project is an experiment in the making .
" No one has ever done this in Africa , and there are only a few farms in the world .
We are working with new seed , a whole new crop that has never been tamed . "
He explained that the project supports a school , a police station and trains workers in different aspects of the operation of the farm .
Other biofuel projects have had troubles .
British Petroleum ( BP ) took a big loss when it sold out the world 's biggest jatropha farm in Brazil last year .
D1 Oils , which bought the farm , is still in business and they should remain so at least until the end of 2010 , according to their financial statements .
Many investors have been lured to jatropha because it seemed to do everything .
It could live on marginal land , so crops were not affected , it had a huge oil content , it needed little water , the yields were high , and it could be inter- cropped , planted next to coffee or tea , or on the margins of roads .
But all of this is speculation .
None of these things are known , even five years into farming jatropha .
Whitehead , now one of Africa 's experts on the plant , explains that only when the trees reach maturity on this new plantation and a few similiar ones around the world , will the facts on Jatropha be known .
The huge buzz around this obscure little bush does not die away in a puff of smoke .
To promote jatropha as a green alternative for jets , Air New Zealand , Boeing and Rolls Royce have tested it for use as jet fuel , flying into Houston to help make their point .
About 37 percent of a jatropha seed is oil .
This oil can actually be burned in a diesel engine without much refining , and there is potentially a lot of it per acre .
How much ?
No one knows .
The tree has never been matured in a farm field , planted in rows , tended to like a precious fruit tree .
It 's a gamble , but one that Whitehead is clearly enjoying .
His big farmer 's hand stretches out to the startling vista across the hills as he points out one of the granite peaks before stopping for a photograph .
" We are doing our best here , literally breaking new ground , and I suppose that if it does n't work , we will plant something else " .
He smiles , he eyes returning with something like love to shrub at his feet , " but I think it will . "
As he strides off towards a bright horizon where a warm sun is rising , a voice - over by Tennant says : '' We have been through tough times , but by staying on the right road , we can make Britain the country we all want it to be , to build a future that is fair for all of us . ''

Players make unreasonable , impossible requests

The Global Trade Station ( GTS ) , the innovative feature of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that allows players to connect to Nintendo 's Wi-Fi network and request and submit Pokémon for trade , is exciting and useful at first glance .
However , once one delves deeper , one finds the novel premise has been ruined by a myriad of players making unreasonable and often impossible requests .
Nintendo could be doing more to curb such greed .
GTS could be useful for making more - or - less equal trades , such as those involving version exclusives , such as Mime Jr. and Bonsly .
However , offers like this are surprisingly scarce .
Instead , searchers are met with impossible and thoroughly unreasonable requests for low - level , fairly common Pokémon .
When one searches for a Pokémon on GTS , a group of up to seven offers appears on screen .
Each offer comes from someone almost anywhere on Earth .
A quick survey reveals the downfall of the system .
For example , when searching for an Aipom , with no restrictions on gender or levels , I received these requests :
Lv. 100 Palkia
Any Milotic
Lv. 9 and under Skuntank
Lv. 90 and up Empoleon
Any Celebi
Who would trade such rare Pokémon as Palkia and Celebi for an Aipom ?
On top of that , Skuntank is not even available until it evolves from Stunky at Lv. 34 .
Nintendo should set proper limits so impossible requests such as this one can not be made .
They are a waste of the Wi-Fi network 's resources and a waste of every player 's time .
Of course , impossible requests such as a Lv. 9 Skuntank are not so impossible with the " help " of cheating devices .
On GTS it has become extremely difficult to determine whether one is trading for a legitimate Pokémon or one that has been hacked .
If only Nintendo could include a detector of some sort that weeds out hacked Pokémon , we would be better off and would feel better about trading on GTS .
At the very least , the company should do more to educate players on how GTS works and encourage fair trading .
A Palkia for a Dialga is fine , but for an Aipom ?
A microbiologist who supervised the work of accused anthrax killer Bruce E. Ivins explained to a National Academy of Sciences panel Thursday why the arithmetic of growing anthrax did n’t add up to Ivins ’ mailing deadly spores in fall 2001 .
“ Impossible , ” said Dr. Henry S. Heine of a scenario in which Ivins , another civilian microbiologist working for the Army , allegedly prepared the anthrax spores at an Army lab at Fort Detrick .
Heine told the 16 - member panel that Ivins would have had to grow as many as 10 trillion spores , an astronomical amount that could n’t have gone unnoticed by his colleagues .

According to FBI calculations , Ivins accomplished this working after - hours in a special suite for handling lethal agents designated B3 , for Biohazard Level 3 .
A bar chart released by the bureau ( PDF ) when it closed its nearly 9 - year - old Amerithrax case in February showed that in August and September 2001 , the months immediately before the first anthrax letters were mailed , Ivins logged 34 more hours in the B3 suite than his combined total for the previous seven months .
“ That ’s more than 8,000 hours ( close to a year ) short of what he would have needed to grow the anthrax , ” Heine told ProPublica in an interview after his NAS presentation .
Heine , one of the few scientists at the Army lab with the skills to grow large batches of anthrax , told ProPublica it would have taken around “ 100 liters of liquid anthrax culture , ” or more than 26 gallons , to grow all the dried spores that killed five Americans and infected 17 others .
“ He could n’t have done that without us knowing it , ” said Heine .
Other biodefense scientists who did n’t work with Ivins have done the same calculations and reached the same conclusion as Heine .

The FBI declined to comment on this latest challenge to its decision to end one of the most expensive manhunts in the bureau ’s 102 - year history .
In closing the case , the agency said Ivins alone was responsible for the anthrax letters .
Ivins committed suicide in 2008 .
Many of Ivins ’ colleagues and some federal lawmakers protested that the FBI was premature in closing the books on Ivins before the academy had completed its review of the science undergirding the bureau ’s case .
“ To this day , it is still far from clear that Mr. Ivins had either the know - how or access to the equipment needed to produce the material , ” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y. , in written remarks published in March .
The day Heine and his Fort Detrick colleagues learned of Ivins ’ suicide in July 2008 , Heine said they conferred and feared the F.B.I. would then blame the attacks on someone who could no longer speak in his own defense .
“ And the very next day , the bureau named Bruce the mailer , ” Heine recalled .

Because of an FBI gag order , Heine said he was unable to discuss these details until he left his job at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , at Fort Detrick , where Ivins also worked developing anthrax vaccines .
Heine left in February and is now senior scientist at the Ordway Research Institute , Inc. Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infections in Albany , N.Y .
Heine said his expertise in growing anthrax made him a suspect like Ivins .
He said FBI agents gave him a polygraph exam and took statements from him several times between 2001 and 2003 .
The FBI was never far away , he said .
A former scoutmaster , Heine said that on campouts his Boy Scout troop used to keep a “ black Suburban watch , ” looking for the vehicles driven by the agents keeping Heine under surveillance .

“ The FBI went after our weakest link , ” Heine said , referring to Ivins and other scientists at Fort Detrick , in Maryland .
He called Ivins “ fragile ” and especially vulnerable to bureau attempts to extract a confession from him .
“ If Bruce did it , we would ’ve turned him in for a million dollars in a heartbeat , ” said Heine , referring to the government reward for information leading to the capture of the anthrax mailer .
“ Seriously , though , reward or no reward , we would ’ve stopped him because that would ’ve been the right thing to do . ”
The FBI linked Ivins to the crime , in part , because of a genetic match between the anthrax spores kept by Ivins and those in the letters .
Documents released by the bureau said that samples of the same anthrax strain were shipped by Ivins to at least four different U.S. laboratories before the attacks .
ADVERTISEMENT
That does n’t exonerate Ivins , Heine conceded , but he said Ivins ’ guilt is also far from certain .
The spores in the anthrax letters were in a dry powder form that spread easily .
“ When you dry spores , they fly everywhere and you ca n’t see ’em , ” said Heine .
“ Had Bruce made it during all those late nights in the hot suite , we would ’ve been his first victims . ”
IBM scientists have created a 3D map of the earth so small that 1,000 of them could fit on one grain of salt . *
The scientists accomplished this through a new , breakthrough technique that uses a tiny , silicon tip with a sharp apex -- 100,000 times smaller than a sharpened pencil -- to create patterns and structures as small as 15 nanometers at greatly reduced cost and complexity .
This patterning technique opens new prospects for developing nanosized objects in fields such as electronics , future chip technology , medicine , life sciences , and optoelectronics .
To demonstrate the technique 's unique capability , the team created several 3D and 2D patterns , using different materials for each one as reported in the scientific journals Science and Advanced Materials :
A 25 - nanometer - high 3D replica of the Matterhorn , a famous Alpine mountain that soars 4,478 m ( 14,692 ft ) high , was created in molecular glass , representing a scale of 1:5 billion .**
Complete 3D map of the world measuring only 22 by 11 micrometers was " written " on a polymer .
At this size , 1,000 world maps could fit on a grain of salt .
In the relief , one thousand meters of altitude correspond to roughly eight nanometers ( nm ) .
It is composed of 500,000 pixels , each measuring 20 nm2 , and was created in only 2 minutes and 23 seconds .
2D nano - sized IBM logo was etched 400 - nm - deep into silicon , demonstrating the viability of the technique for typical nanofabrication applications .
2D high - resolution 15 - nm dense line patterning .
The science behind the technique
The core component of the new technique , which was developed by a team of IBM scientists , is a tiny , very sharp silicon tip measuring 500 nanometers in length and only a few nanometers at its apex .
" Advances in nanotechnology are intimately linked to the existence of high - quality methods and tools for producing nanoscale patterns and objects on surfaces , " explains physicist Dr. Armin Knoll of IBM Research -- Zurich .
" With its broad functionality and unique 3D patterning capability , this nanotip - based patterning methodology is a powerful tool for generating very small structures . "
The tip , similar to the kind used in atomic force microscopes , is attached to a bendable cantilever that controllably scans the surface of the substrate material with the accuracy of one nanometer -- a millionth of a millimeter .
By applying heat and force , the nano - sized tip can remove substrate material based on predefined patterns , thus operating like a " nanomilling " machine with ultra -high precision .

Similar to using a milling machine , more material can be removed to create complex 3D structures with nanometer precision by modulating the force or by readdressing individual spots .
To create the 3D replica of the Matterhorn , for example , 120 individual layers of material were successively removed from the molecular glass substrate .
Comparing to e-beam lithography
The new IBM technique achieves resolutions as high as 15 nanometers -- with a potential of going even smaller .
Using existing methods such as e-beam lithography , *** it is becoming increasingly challenging to fabricate patterns at resolutions below 30 nanometers , where the technical limitations of that method are reached .
What 's more , compared to expensive e-beam - lithography tools that require several processing steps and equipment that can easily fill a laboratory , the tool created by IBM scientists -- which can sit on a tabletop -- promises improved and extended capabilities at very high resolutions , but at one - fifth to one tenth of the cost and with far less complexity .
Yet another advantage of the nanotip - based technique is the ability to assess the pattern directly by using the same tip to create an image of the written structures , as the IBM scientists demonstrated in their experiments .

Potential applications range from the fast prototyping of nano - sized devices for future computer chips to the production of well defined micron - sized optical elements like aspheric lenses and lens - arrays for optoelectronics and on -chip optical communication .
Materials breakthrough
In the two publications , the scientists describe their novel 3D - nanopatterning methodology for two very distinct and promising types of substrate materials : a polymer called polyphthalaldehyde and a molecular glass similar to substrate materials used in conventional nanofabrication techniques , so - called resists .
Identifying these two materials was a key factor for the breakthrough performance and reliability of the technique .
In their search for suitable and efficient substrate materials , the scientists concentrated on organic materials that could be used as resists , thereby following the same philosophy as used for today 's semiconductor technology , which is important for further integration .
" The material was a ' make it or break it ' issue , " explains Jim Hedrick , scientist at IBM Research -- Almaden .
" We had to find and synthesize materials which form mechanically tough glasses and yet can be easily thermally decomposed into non-reactive volatile units . "
The molecular glass that was used in the Matterhorn experiment consists of snow - flake - like molecules , measuring about one nanometer and having an almost spherical shape .
At a tip temperature above 330 degrees C ( 626 degrees F ) , the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together break , allowing the molecular parts to become mobile and to escape from the surface .
A particular strength of the material is that the patterned molecular glass can be transferred by means of conventional etching techniques to , for example , silicon , which is common in the semiconductor industry .
Molecular glass was first proposed in the late 1990s by Mitsuru Ueda of Yamagata University , Japan , for use as high - resolution photoresists and was thereafter developed by Chris Ober of Cornell University .
The nanosized 3D world map was created in a polymer called polyphthalaldehyde , a polymer originally developed by IBM Fellow Hiroshi Ito in the 1980s .
Exposed to substantially elevated temperatures , the components of this chain - like organic molecule unzip and fall into volatile pieces .
A self - amplified reaction causes the molecule to decompose and then accelerates the entire patterning process by being even faster than the mechanical motion of the tip .
IBM and nanotechnology
IBM has been a pioneer in nanoscience and nanotechnology ever since the development of the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) in 1981 by IBM Fellows Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer .
For this invention , which made it possible to image individual atoms and later on to manipulate them , Binnig and Rohrer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 .
The atomic force microscope , an offspring of the STM , was invented by Binnig in 1986 .
The STM is widely regarded as the instrument that opened the door to the nanoworld .
In fact it was 20 years ago this month that IBM Fellow Don Eigler reported the first controlled movement of individual atoms , famously using a scanning tunneling microscope to spell out the letters " I B M " with 35 xenon atoms .
These historic breakthroughs laid a solid foundation for IBM 's continued research in nanoscience .
Contributing to this rich history for years to come , a new world - class collaborative nanoscale research lab is currently under construction on the campus of IBM Research -- Zurich .
This state - of - the - art nanotech center , which will open next year , is part of a strategic partnership in nanotechnology between IBM Research and ETH Zurich , one of Europe 's leading technical universities .
Notes
* Taking 0.3 mm as the average size of a grain of salt , 1000 maps would span the diameter .
** One nanometer in the vertical pattern corresponds to 57 altitude meters .
***
This method selectively exposes a surface to a beam of electrons , thereby creating patterns in a film , called a resist .
The resist serves as a template for transferring the pattern to various materials , for example silicon , by means of etching .
It is one of the most versatile and mature methods used today , but it is very costly and complex .
In an analysis of the past 1.2 million years , UC Santa Barbara geologist Lorraine Lisiecki discovered a pattern that connects the regular changes of Earth 's orbital cycle to changes in Earth 's climate .
The finding is reported in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience .
Lisiecki performed her analysis of climate by examining ocean sediment cores .
These cores come from 57 locations around the world .
By analyzing sediments , scientists are able to chart Earth 's climate for millions of years in the past .
Lisiecki's contribution is the linking of the climate record to the history of Earth 's orbit .
It is known that Earth 's orbit around the sun changes shape every 100,000 years .
The orbit becomes either more round or more elliptical at these intervals .
The shape of the orbit is known as its " eccentricity . "
A related aspect is the 41,000 - year cycle in the tilt of Earth 's axis .
Glaciation of Earth also occurs every 100,000 years .
Lisiecki found that the timing of changes in climate and eccentricity coincided .
" The clear correlation between the timing of the change in orbit and the change in the Earth 's climate is strong evidence of a link between the two , " said Lisiecki .
" It is unlikely that these events would not be related to one another . "
Besides finding a link between change in the shape of the orbit and the onset of glaciation , Lisiecki found a surprising correlation .
She discovered that the largest glacial cycles occurred during the weakest changes in the eccentricity of Earth 's orbit -- and vice versa .
She found that the stronger changes in Earth 's orbit correlated to weaker changes in climate .
" This may mean that the Earth 's climate has internal instability in addition to sensitivity to changes in the orbit , " said Lisiecki .
She concludes that the pattern of climate change over the past million years likely involves complicated interactions between different parts of the climate system , as well as three different orbital systems .
The first two orbital systems are the orbit 's eccentricity , and tilt .
The third is " precession , " or a change in the orientation of the rotation axis .
It 's the big day for the digital economy bill - 6 April , second reading and perhaps some debate in the house of Commons .
Gordon Brown is also expected to take a trip to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve parliament so there can be a 6 May election .
( Blimey , hope she 's at home . )
The Open Rights Group has already taken out adverts in the Guardian and Times newspapers demanding that MPs give the bill " proper " debate - asserting that
" On Tuesday , the digital economy bill , with all its myriad problems , will be voted on its second reading – after the election has been declared .
It will then be pushed through ' wash - up ' – and become law without full scrutiny "
Certainly there is a lot of concern among people who see multiple flaws in the bill as presently set up – and as it seems to be altered by the new clause 18 being introduced by the government .
There is also opposition to the bill from photographers , who complain that its treatment of orphan works is unfair .
All sorts of questions remain : will the Liberal Democrats be able to derail it from moving into , and through , the wash - up ?
If it passes , will hotels and libraries and teashops and McDonalds shut down their open Wi-Fi ?
And if it passes and a Tory government comes in , and slices and dices Ofcom as it has indicated it would want to , will its effectiveness in monitoring processes in the bill be affected ?
If you need a reminder of the major points in the bill , do n't be embarrassed .
It 's a very complex and very controversial piece of legislation – probably the most unpopular to have ever been proposed for pushing through in the wash - up .
Delays after pigs trailer overturns on M4 in Wiltshire

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Thirteen pigs were killed and a number injured when an animal transporter overturned on the M4 in Wiltshire .
The accident happened on the westbound carriageway of the motorway between Leigh Delamere services and junction 18 , the turn off for Bath , earlier .
The vehicle had been carrying more than 100 animals .
Police closed part of the motorway while the pigs were rounded up and injured ones were treated .
The road has since reopened .
They will need to be rested , they will be looked at again to make sure there are no injuries developing
Graham Hibbert , Hale Veterinary Group
A Wiltshire Police spokesman said the animals were being transported in a double - decker lorry when the crash happened at about 1020 BST .
" A large number of the pigs fell out .
Thirteen have died and a number were injured , " he said .
" The remainder have been recovered into a second transporter .
" No other vehicle was involved and there have been no human casualties . "
He said two vets were called to the scene to deal with the injured animals .
Main concern
The surviving pigs have been taken to a farm to recuperate .
Graham Hibbert , from Hale Veterinary Group , attended and said the main concern was making sure making sure the surviving pigs were fit to travel .
" They went off in the other lorry - they will need to be rested , they will be looked at again to make sure there are no injuries developing , " he added .
" They will not have been fit for slaughter because of the stress so they 'll be kept separately and looked after . "
The M4 was closed at junction 17 and initially caused tailbacks of nearly 20 miles ( 32 km ) .
At about 1400 BST there were tailbacks of up to two miles ( 3 km ) .
Two lanes of the westbound carriageway reopened at about 1500 BST and police said traffic had returned to normal just before 1700 BST .
Roof split
One witness , Tracy , who had been driving on the M4 and saw the crash scene , said : " We passed the lorry , it must have been just after it happened .
" There were about half a dozen pigs on the road trying to be ushered to the side to stop them running around .
" The lorry was on its side with its roof partially split open .
" There were dead pigs in the road and they were hosing it down and the traffic was horrific . "

A Claregalway school was last night thanking its lucky stars after serious injuries were averted when a 20 - ton juggernaut left the road and ploughed into the schoolgrounds just as infants were being collected after school .
There was chaos at Cregmore NS about three miles from Claregalway yesterday afternoon when the truck went out of control and smashed through the wall , destroying almost a dozen cars .
Screaming children were pushed aside to safety by parents and teachers as the truck careered through the wall , and pushed 11 cars into one another .
The emergency services rushed to the scene and five people were hospitalised yesterday for injuries which were last night described as not serious .
The accident , which happened as parents were collecting children from the infant classes at 1.40 pm yesterday , saw the truck go out of control and plough through a wall and into the set down and pick up area for parents ’ cars .
The young children were shaken after the incident and had to be comforted in the school by parents and teachers as the emergency services helped the injured and attempted to clear the scene in the schoolyard .
Quick - thinking parents and teachers had to grab children and jump out of the way as the lorry careered into cars in the parking area , sending shards of glass and debris before it .
Five people , including the driver of the truck and two children , were brought to UHG following the accident .
All five were said to be in a stable condition yesterday evening .
The road at Cregmore Cross is a popular rat-run between the N18 and the N63 roads , allowing commuters and truck drivers to avoid the congestion of Claregalway village .
However , the road is woefully inadequate for anything other than school and local traffic and this latest incident is bound to lead to calls for greater control on the heavy goods traffic which use it .
The road at Cregmore Cross was closed for a time yesterday as the emergency services worked to clear up the debris from the crash , and schoolchildren were kept in the school building until the area was cleared .
School principal Joe Kennelly , who witnessed the accident , said it was a miracle no - one had been killed in the accident , and revealed the school had held an impromptu prayer service when the parish priest visited shortly before the accident .
“ Somebody was looking after us without a doubt , ” he said .
“ There were children and parents all over the pick - up area . ”
He paid tribute
Meanwhile gardaí have launched an investigation into the circumstances of the crash .
Proof , if you ever wanted it , that Apple is mos ’ def ’ getting into the idea of RFID technology for its devices .
The firm has lodged a patent called Concert Ticket + that will enable it to get into the gig market , selling gig tickets over iTunes .
As well as gigs , consumers will be able to buy tickets for sporting events , theme parks , and even wedding invitations –more about that in a bit–and even use their iPhones to get through the turnstiles .
( Backup battery power : now a must . )
Kinda blows this out of the water , does n’t it ?
The patent also shows a management system which lets the user ’s mobile device to sync with their other devices , such as a desktop or laptop computer–and , although it ’s not mentioned , the iPad .
Apple has added a whole load of extra functions to Concert Ticket + that go way beyond paying for , and entering , an event .
There ’s the potential to offer live CDs to the concertgoers , discounts on products , and the ability to pay for merchandise and drinks directly via their phones , access to song lyrics and buying the artist ’s songs during the gig , and even pre-paid , discounted parking .
Hopefully Apple will supply a free lighter app to use during the slow numbers .
As for the wedding market , well , imagine being able to access tux - hire stores , maps to the event , the program , buy the music featured during the party , as well as the wedding video , or photos .
If you thought there was no way Apple could monetize someone ’s nuptials , you ’re wrong .
All of this is proof of just how Cupertino envisages the future–and it ’s totally iPhone and iTunes - dominated .
In a decade , are we going to be able to buy just about everything quick and disposable via Apple ’s media portal .
It ’s a whole lot more simple to use than PayPal , for example ( although the only way you can currently receive money from iTunes is through its gift certificate system–in 50 years ’ time , perhaps our employers will be paying our salaries via iTunes ?
Possibly , when all the banks have migrated there .
Do n’t forget , Apple has got $ 50 billion in cash–and it ’s thinking very hard how to spend it .
Property and Plunder
Frederic Bastiat ( from pp. 6 - 7 of the FEE edition of The Law ) :
“ Man can live and satisfy his wants only by ceaseless labor ; by the ceaseless application of his faculties to natural resources .
This process is the origin of property .
“ But it is also true that a man may live and satisfy his wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of others .
This process is the origin of plunder .
“ Now since man is naturally inclined to avoid pain — and since labor is pain in itself — it follows that men will resort to plunder whenever plunder is easier than work .
History shows this quite clearly .
And under these conditions , neither religion nor morality can stop it .
“ When , then , does plunder stop ?
It stops when it becomes more painful and more dangerous than labor .
It is evident , then , that the proper purpose of law is to use the power of its collective force to stop this fatal tendency to plunder instead of to work .
All the measures of the law should protect property and punish plunder .
“ But , generally , the law is made by one man or one class of men .
And since law cannot operate without the sanction and support of a dominating force , this force must be entrusted to those who make the laws .
“ This fact , combined with the fatal tendency that exists in the heart of man to satisfy his wants with the least possible effort , explains the almost universal perversion of the law .
Thus it is easy to understand how law , instead of checking injustice , becomes the invincible weapon of injustice .
It is easy to understand why the law is used by the legislator to destroy in varying degrees among the rest of the people , their personal independence by slavery , their liberty by oppression , and their property by plunder .
This is done for the benefit of the person who makes the law , and in proportion to the power that he holds . ”

Ovi talks Game 3 , Price and power play
Here is a portion of Alex Ovechkin 's transcript of his press conference prior to Game 3 :
How important is it to win tonight to go back to Washington up 3 -1 ?
" Yeah , it 's an important game for us right now and we have to be mentally ready .
We have to push right away and be strong . "
Carey Price is in goal for them tonight and he 's bigger than Jaroslav Halak .
Is there a different approach when a bigger guy is in goal ?
" For us I think it does n't matter who is going to be in the net , Price or Halak .
They are both good goalies and they know what they have to do .
The key is for us to play a simple game , shoot the puck , go to the front of the net and find the rebounds in traffic . "
Is there a sense that you have to test him and pepper him right off the bat to see if there are any holes ?
" Well , if you 're going to shoot from the blue line or red line he 's going to save it .
If we 're going to shoot from the blue line we have to make some screens in front of him .
It 's going to be a very interesting and very tough game for us . "
Aside from the power play , what you guys were able to accomplish last game , is that where the Washington Capitals should be as far as your game ?
" Yeah , and on the power play I think we just have to play simple .
We tried to be so casual and it's not like we always play .
We just have to play our game . "

It 's Carey Price 's turn to see if he can swing momentum back to Montreal 's side in this best - of - seven series against the Washington Capitals Price will make his first start of the playoffs Wednesday night ( 7 p.m. ET , TSN ) when the Canadiens and Caps play Game 4 at Bell Centre .
Washington leads the series , 2 - 1 , and can give itself a chance to close it out at home Friday by beating Price tonight .
" When he's hot he's one of the best , " Capitals defenseman Mike Green said of Price .
" He 's so calm and it does n't seem like anything affects him , so we have to make sure we get guys going to block his vision , to create traffic in front of him so he can't see it .
That 's the only way we 'll score .
" Price poses a different threat than the dispatched Jaroslav Halak , who was pulled from Game 3 after giving up three goals on four shots in a span of 7:27 in the second period .
Price is bigger than Halak -- 6 - foot - 3 vs. 5 - foot - 11 -- so he covers more of the net .
According to Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau , Price is also " a really good puck handler whereas Halak is an average puck handler , so that makes a big difference . "
" We can't make soft dump-ins , " Capitals left wing Brooks Laich said .
" We have to make sure we get them around the boards hard .
" Montreal coach Jacques Martin did n't reveal much when asked why he is going with Price over Halak .
The players , who have defended Halak in recent days , saying he 's the reason they are even in the playoffs , expressed their excitement that Price will be in net .
" We love it , we 're excited , " Habs left wing Michael Cammalleri said .
" Not to take anything away from Jaro because he 's done a great job and he can still do a great job for us , but we 're excited about Carey .
"
If you 're asking me , I think Carey Price is a top goaltender and I 'm a huge Carey Price fan .
I 'm excited about him being in the net .
" Price , who made 21 saves in relief of Halak in Game 3 , has a fairly decent history against the Capitals .
He 's 3 - 1 - 2 lifetime against them , and in 2007 he beat some of the current Capitals ' in the AHL's Calder Cup Final as the goalie for the Hamilton Bulldogs , who beat the Hershey Bears in five games .
Boudreau was the coach of the Bears that year and Tomas Fleischmann David Steckel and Jeff Schultz played for him .
"
The big difference is when we were in the Calder Cup he would n't have said anything because there is no media as compared to this , " Boudreau said of Price .
" I did n't know him at all except he stopped everything we shot at him , but his demeanor , when you see him doing interviews now , he always seems to be calm and never rattled .
There is no difference in his demeanor ( on or off the ice ) .
" Price has n't started a game since March 31 , so the Capitals ' goal is to get to him early and try to plant the seed of doubt in his mind .
However , as Laich said , they try to do that against any goalie .
" Well , if you 're going to shoot from the blue line or red line he 's going to save it , " Alex Ovechkin said .
" If we 're going to shoot from the blue line we have to make some screens in front of him .
It 's going to be a very interesting and very tough game for us .
" Montreal will make at least one other change for Game 3 as well .
Defenseman Ryan O'Byrne confirmed that he will make his first appearance of the series after being a healthy scratch for the first three games .
Who sits in his place remains a question mark ?
Jaroslav Spacek has not skated since Monday night and Martin said he 'll be a gametime decision .
Even if Spacek plays , it 's possible the Habs still dress seven defensemen and use Marc - Andre Bergeron in a forward position .
"
It 's been tough watching three games , " O'Byrne said .
" You want to be out there to help your teammates so it 's a chance for me to play physical , play strong in front of the net and just do what makes me successful .
I can't go out there to try to get a hat trick , obviously .
That 's not my game .
" Washington may also have a change on its blue line .
John Erskine or Tyler Sloan -- possibly both , even -- could be in .
Shaone Morrisonn and Joe Corvo both skated today after not skating Tuesday and although Boudreau said he does n't anticipate any changes , Morrisonn confirmed to the Washington Post that he 's a game - time decision .
" As far as I know we do n't have any injured defensemen , " Boudreau said .

Two clerks cleaning out a closet have uncovered the original handwritten minutes of a coroner 's inquest taken just days after the famous shootout at the O.K.
Corral , including testimony from witnesses and survivors , The Arizona Daily Star reports .
The 36 pages of yellowed and taped documents have been turned over to the state archives .
In the famous shootout in 1881 , lawman Wyatt Earp , along with Doc Holliday and others , took on four outlaw gunmen , killing three of them .
The documents had been stored away and forgotten for half a century until the two clerks were cleaning out a closet of exhibits of Cochise County Superior Court in Bisbee , Ariz .
See KOLD - TV 's video report here .
The documents had been photocopied decades ago , but the technology was so primitive , the material was hard to read .
KOLD - TV reports that the material includes a housekeeper 's account of the gunfight that broke out while she was shopping for meat .
Another witness observed that Doc Holliday was carrying his weapon under his coat , The Daily Star says .
State librarian GladysAnn
Wells tells the newspaper that she had always thought that in Holliday 's era , people wore guns strapped to their hips .
Wells said she found that information to be interesting , considering that Arizona Gov Jan Brewster has recently signed a measure to let virtually all adults carry concealed guns without getting state permits .
Update at 10:09 a.m. ET : The archivists have not provided extensive quotes from the material so far .
However , NPR reports the fragile paper will first be stabilized and scanned , and the first pages should be published on the Internet within a week .
Correction :
The reference in the original story to the governor signing a measure to allow most adults to carry conceal guns clearly refers to the recent act by Gov. Jan Brewer , and now as it appeared in our original posting .
I have corrected the text above to reflect that .

Around 50 people have suffered injuries in Peru after part of a glacier broke off and burst the Hualcan River banks in a disaster the local governor attributed to climate change .
The mass of glacial ice and rock fell into the so - called " 513 lake " in the northern Ancash region , causing a ripple effect down the Hualcan , destroying 20 nearby homes .
" Because of global warming the glaciers are going to detach and fall on these overflowing lakes .
This is what happened today , " Ancash Governor Cesar Alvarez told reporters , linking climate change to the disappearance of a third of the glaciers in the Peruvian Andes over the past three decades .
A 2009 World Bank - published report warned Andean glaciers and the region 's permanently snow - covered peaks could disappear in 20 years if no measures are taken to tackle climate change .
According to the report , in the last 35 years Peru 's glaciers have shrunk by 22 per cent , leading to a 12 per cent loss in the amount of fresh water reaching the coast - home to most of the country 's citizens .

Längst haben andere Abgeordnete das Erbe von Wiefelspütz angetreten .
Mit ihren Antworten bringen sie Bürger gegen sich auf , sie provozieren und teilen aus - aber sie stecken eben auch ein .
Und so entwickelt sich ein lebhafter , mitunter auch unterhaltsamer Austausch zwischen Wählern und Gewählten , der einer Demokratie , die ganz maßgeblich auf Meinung und Gegenmeinung und dem Wettstreit von Argumenten beruht , gut tut .
Man braucht nicht derselben Meinung zu sein wie diese Abgeordneten , man kann manche ihrer Positionen sogar für gefährlich für unsere freiheitliche Gesellschaft halten .
Aber man muss anerkennen , dass sie sich der Auseinandersetzung mit ihren Kritikern stellen anstatt sich hinter weichgespülten Textbausteinen wegzuducken .
Einer dieser Abgeordneten ist Hans - Peter Uhl .
Mit seinen Positionen zur Sperrung von Kinderpornoseiten hat er längst die gesamte Blogosphäre gegen sich aufgebracht .
Auch Blogger und Netzaktivisten , da sind sie sich mit Uhl ausnahmsweise mal einig , wollen Kinderpornographie aus dem Internet verbannen .
Doch sie sehen vor allem die Gefahr , dass eine staatlich angeordnete Sperrung von Kinderpornoseiten nur der Einstieg ist in eine weitreichende Zensur anderer Netzinhalte .
So prallen auf abgeordnetenwatch .de zwei Welten aufeinander , und Hans - Peter Uhl denkt gar nicht daran , einer Diskussion auszuweichen :
Wenn
Sie einen so schweren Vorwurf wie " aktiver Täterschutz " nicht vernünftig plausibel machen können , sollten Sie es lieber bleiben lassen .
Denn es könnte Ihnen als unsachlich , beleidigend und ehrverletzend ausgelegt werden .
Bevor
Sie hier eine öffentliche Frage stellen , sollten Sie sich vergewissern , nicht einem so eklatanten Denkfehler aufzusitzen .
Stellen Sie sich folgenden Wortwechsel vor : A sagt : " Wir sollten Zugangssperren gegen Kinderpornographie einsetzen . " B sagt .
" Igitt , bloß keine Zugangssperren . "
Merken Sie was ?
Wer derart austeilen kann , muss auch damit leben können , wenn diese Äußerungen von mir für - gelinde gesagt - " sehr gewagt " und angreifbar gehalten werden .
Die ganze pseudo - bürgerrechtsengagierte Hysterie von Pseudo - Computerexperten , man müsse um jeden Preis ein " unzensiertes Internet " verteidigen etc. - vgl. www. ccc.de - , fällt für mich in die Kategorie : juristisch ohne Sinn und Verstand und moralisch verkommen .
Das sind ungeschminkte Worte in einer Profession , in der es normal ist , dass vor der Veröffentlichung eines Interviews jede Ecke und jede Kante bis zur Unkenntlichkeit des persönlichen und politischen Profils abgeschliffen wird .
Antworten von Hans - Peter
Uhl aber sind authentisch .
Den verbalen Nahkampf mit Bloggern und Netzaktivisten sucht auch Sebastian Edathy .
Vor einigen Tagen berichtete er in einer Antwort auf abgeordnetenwatch .de von einer unliebsamen Postsendung :
Auf meinen Namen wurde vor ca. einem
Jahr über das Internet bei einem recht bekannten Flensburger Erotik - Versand eine künstliche Vagina bestellt , über deren Eintreffen in meiner Privatwohnung ich sehr überrascht war .
Ist es legitim , herausfinden zu wollen , ob der Besteller identifiziert werden kann ?
Ich meine : Ja. Das Versandhaus , das die Ware zurücknehmen musste , wurde finanziell geschädigt und ich belästigt .
Wie ich feststelle , ist das von mir genannte Fallbeispiel in einer Reihe von Internet - Foren aufgegriffen und zum Thema gemacht worden .
Die Form , in der dies geschieht und die zugehörigen Anmerkungen verstärken bei mir den Eindruck , dass sich etliche Internet - User , die sich zum Thema Vorratsdatenspeicherung äußern , nicht gut auskennen .
Gerade im Internet - Zeitalter scheint dies aber kein Hinderungsgrund dafür zu sein , sein Unwissen gleichwohl , zudem mit selbstgefälliger Attitüde , zu artikulieren .
In Blogs und sozialen Netzwerken wie Twitter wurde die Edathy - Antwort mit Hohn und Spott quittiert , vor allem deshalb , weil Edathy den unbekannten Auftraggeber der Erotiklieferung am liebsten per Vorratsdatenspeicherung ausfindig machen würde , einem Gesetz , das die Netzaktivisten gerade mit einer Klage beim Bundesverfassungsgericht teilweise gekippt hatten .
Anstatt die Sache auf sich beruhen zu lassen , legte Edathy kurze Zeit später noch einmal nach :
Persönliche Kränkung und das Gefallen an öffentlicher Auseinandersetzung mögen in diesem Fall zusammenkommen .
Anzuerkennen ist aber , dass Abgeordnete wie Edathy und Uhl für ihre Überzeugung kämpfen , auch wenn diese unpopulär ist .
Wer mit seinen Argumenten nun recht hat , die Fragesteller oder die Abgeordneten , das mögen die Mitleser am Ende selber entscheiden .

The pressure to provide housing will be a key policy challenge for government Since 1997 , record levels of immigration have boosted our population by more than 2 million , accounting for half the total estimated rise in population of about 4 million .
So is Britain getting full ?
With immigration projected to drive two thirds of our population growth , the polls suggest voters think the answer is " Yes " .
Next to the economy , immigration is the second most important issue , beyond even crime and the NHS .
In last week 's televised election debate , all three main party leaders said they would be tough on immigration .
The Office of National Statistics say that over the next two decades the UK population is on course to grow by eight million to 70 m .
That is roughly the equivalent of adding eight new cities , each the size of Birmingham .
Quality of life
If that happens it will have profound implications for public policy : England expects to take 90 % of that growth .
Yet , aside from Malta , England is already the most densely populated country in Europe , according to UK and UN statistics .
UK POPULATION STATISTICS 1960 : 52.3 m 1990 : 57.2 m 2010 : 62.2 m ( projected ) 2029 : 70.2 m ( projected ) 2033 : 71.6 m ( projected ) Source : ONS
Where will all the new houses and shops be built ?
And from where will come the tens of billions to build the infrastructure - the sewers , water treatment plants , power stations , railways lines , roads , schools , and hospitals ?
This , at a time when we are about to enter one of the most deep and sustained periods of public spending cuts in our history .
Most of the new homes are needed because more people are living longer or alone .
But four of out of every 10 new households will be accounted for by immigration - the only factor amenable to government control .
How might our quality of life be affected ?
Many of us could end up feeling distinctly squashed - new houses being built today already have the smallest dimensions in Europe .

BBC One , Monday , 19 April at 2030BST
Or watch it later on the BBC iPlayer .
The average commuting time to work is now among Europe 's longest .
That is likely to grow as the number of households forming continues to out pace new home completions , driving up the price of properties and forcing people further from major towns and cities .
For families not able to buy or rent privately , our growing population and the mass sale of the most desirable socially rented homes have contributed to an acute shortage of council housing .
In the London borough of Barking and Dagenham , up to 600 families compete for every three - bed home that becomes available .
Katy Thorndike has been on the waiting list for more suitable accommodation for herself and her five children for five years .
Her flat is riddled with damp and when it rains she says the carpets squelch .
She was born and raised locally but she believes migrant families have been getting preferential treatment .
Housing crunch " We do see a lot of migrants coming into the borough and getting the properties straightaway , " she said .
" I do think it 's unfair .
I 'm stuck in a slum like this . "
The far right BNP is challenging here , in what has been a traditionally safe Labour seat .
The population is projected to grow by 8 m by the year 2029 Miss Thorndike said she will not be voting BNP but added : " I 'm not a racist , each to their own , but I do think that maybe people from this borough should be given preference over people who are not . "
Barking and Dagenham council insist migrants do not get preference over housing allocations .
But inevitably , increased numbers of migrants lengthen the queue , resulting in increased competition .
Since we interviewed Miss Thorndike and her family , Barking and Dagenham council have rehoused them .
Across England , there are now 1.8 m households waiting for social housing .
Schools are also feeling the stress from our fast growing population .
At Mount Carmel Primary in north Manchester head teacher Patricia Ganley has had to turn her office into a classroom .
" There 's been a big explosion of people coming into the area , " she said .
" We 've had a lot of families from overseas . "
How many marks out of ten did she give the government for planning ?
" About a two or three " she answered .
Across the UK , births are up by 11 % since 2004 .
At North Manchester General Hospital , Denise Woods , Community Midwifery Matron , said 2,800 women are giving birth a year - an increase of 600 a year from 2002 .
A higher birth - rate among new immigrants is contributing significantly to this rise .
In England , one in four births - 170,000 a year - is now to a mother born abroad .
Points system However , immigration minister Phil Woolas does not give the ONS population projection much credence .
The ONS ' projections are disputed by the Labour government " I do n't believe we will get to 70 m " he said .
The government has no control over EU migrants .
But Prime Minister Gordon Brown has insisted that the government 's new points based system allowing in only economic migrants and students from other countries who score sufficient points through their skills , jobs and financial status is reducing net migration .
ONS projections do not take account of such changes in government policy .
On the other hand , its recently retired head Dame Karen Dunnell says : " We have actually greatly improved the quality of statistics over the last five years . "
The latest finalised ONS statistics - for 2008 - do show a fall in net migration from 2007 .
But since then immigration has still added around 300,000 to the UK 's population .
So what are the differences between Labour and the Conservatives ?
Not , perhaps , as sharp as Mr Brown and Conservative Leader David Cameron might wish voters to think .
The Tories say they will impose an overall cap on the number of work permits wherever they impact adversely on public services .
Yet that limit may not , in practice , be very different from the numbers allowed in by Labour .
Shadow immigration minister Damian Green said : " I do think government should control that .
I think the immigration rate should be substantially lower than it has been under the current government . "
But he declined to give a figure on what the work permit cap should be , except to say that net migration - the difference between immigration and emigration - would be cut from the current 163,000 to " tens of thousands " .
Under both Labour and the Conservatives , permits are likely to be dictated primarily by the level of skills shortages in the economy as independently assessed by officials .
Where does all this leave the ONS projection of 70 million ?
Crowded southeast Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman , said the fact that Thames Water is having to build a desalination plant in the Thames Estuary to increase the water supply vividly demonstrates how the population of London and the South East are " reaching clear environmentally sustainable limits " .
Even so , for Mr Huhne the issue is not whether the UK reaches " 65 m , 70 m ( or ) 75 m " .
What matters is how migrants are distributed across the country , he said .
The Liberal Democrats under Leader Nick Clegg , he said , want to restrict them to less densely populated parts of the north and Scotland to help rebalance the economy away from the south east and financial services towards more traditional forms of wealth creation , such as manufacturing .
John
Ware surveys the sprawl in Britain today By contrast , Phil Woolas said : " I do n't think our country could cope easily at all with 70 m . "
Given the vicissitudes of the economy , precisions by any of the parties about the annual reduction in net migration is not possible .
But to avoid getting to 70 m , the reduction will have to be substantial - down from 163,000 to , at most , an average of 50,000 .
Whichever party wins the election , the ONS population projection will present them with an acute dilemma - without substantial falls in immigration , house prices and rents will go yet higher , increasing the divisions of an already deeply divided society .
The alternative is a massive building programme .
But that would mean borrowing even more at a time when national debt is already at record levels .
Politics is , indeed , about tough choices .

Via : AP :
Four municipal trucks were set ablaze in a rural Riverside County town plagued by bizarre booby trap attempts to kill police officers , and authorities said Wednesday the fire may be linked to the earlier attacks .
“ Everyone is worried , everyone is being careful , ” Hemet police Lt. Duane Wisehart said .
“ You get scared a little bit and then you get angry .
It keeps happening . ”
Someone called police around 11:10 p.m.
Tuesday to report a fire in the parking lot at Hemet City Hall , located within two blocks of the police department , Police Chief Richard Dana said .
No one was hurt .
Police were working with state and federal investigators to determine the cause of the blaze , which sent flames several feet above the trucks in the cab and hood area .
The white trucks were for use by code enforcement officers .
Early indications were that some kind of flammable substance was used and not an explosive , Dana said .
Hemet , a traditionally quiet retirement city about 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles , has been rocked by a series of booby trap attacks against police officers in recent weeks .
“ We are operating under the theory ( the fire ) is connected to the other assaults , ” Dana said .
On Dec. 31 , a natural gas pipe was rerouted into the headquarters of a gang task force .
The building filled with flammable vapor , but an officer smelled the danger before anyone was hurt .
In a second attack , some kind of ballistic device rigged to a security fence at the same building went off when an officer opened the gate , but the bullet missed .
The third attack involved a deadly device found under a police officer ’s unmarked car after the officer drove to a convenience store .
Dana said there has been at least one other booby trap uncovered , but he declined to release details .
In the past week or so , officers have received threats daily , either on their non-emergency telephone lines or via e-mail .
“ They say things like , ‘ It ’s too bad they missed , the next one ’s gonna get you , ' ” Dana said .
Investigators believe the attacks are the work of more than one individual , partly because of the sheer volume of activity .
Wisehart said a confidential informant last week overheard two people talking about how they were going to blow up a Hemet police car over the weekend .
The informant told the Riverside County Sheriff ’s deputies , who notified Hemet authorities .
Agents were working to determine if all the trucks in Tuesday ’s fire were set ablaze at once or if the fire had gone from one vehicle to the next , said Keith Krolczyk , resident agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives in Riverside .
He said the vehicles were “ severely damaged . ”
Police initially suspected the Vagos , California ’s largest outlaw motorcycle gang , may be involved in the booby trap attacks .
Authorities last week arrested 35 members of the Vagos in Riverside County as part of a crackdown across the state and in Arizona , Nevada and Utah .
The district attorney ’s office was still reviewing cases and did not immediately know how many people had been charged .
Gang enforcement officers monitored a group of gang members at a funeral two days before the first attack , leading investigators to wonder if the gang felt affronted .
But Dana on Wednesday distanced himself from the theory .
“ We have since started looking at other things ” he said .
“ They are a group that is on the investigation list but there are other groups , too . ”
A $ 200,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the attacks .
Expert 's warning proves Catholic church should have known about failings in dealing with abuse cases , says lawyer
A former pope was warned that paedophile priests should be removed from active ministry and repeat offenders expelled from the church , according to a clerical communique that has emerged following a US lawsuit .
The letter , written in August 1963 by the head of an order that specialised in the treatment of priests accused of abusing children , suggests that the Vatican and Pope Paul VI should have known about failings in procedures for dealing with such cases , according to the lawyer who produced it .
A senior church official swiftly dismissed the claim , suggesting it was unlikely the document would have been seen by the then pope nearly 50 years ago .
The letter has been released as plaintiffs in Kentucky attempt to sue the Vatican for allegedly failing to alert police or the public about priests who molested children , part of a series of abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic church and left the current pope , Benedict XVI , struggling to defend its reputation .
The document , produced by Anthony DeMarco , a lawyer who acted for plaintiffs in a separate US compensation claim settled in 2007 , was written by the Rev Gerald MC Fitzgerald , the head of the Servants of the Holy Paraclete , an order based in New Mexico .
His submission appears to have been drafted at the request of the pope .
Fitzgerald opens the five - page letter by thanking the pope for an audience the day before and says he is summarising his thoughts at the pope 's request on the " problem of the problem priest " after 20 years working to treat them .
He tells Paul VI that treatment for priests who have succumbed to " abnormal , homosexual tendencies " should include psychiatric , as well as spiritual , counselling but goes on to warn about the dangers of leaving those individuals in ministry .
" Personally , I am not sanguine of the return of priests to active duty who have been addicted to abnormal practices , especially sins with the young , " Fitzgerald wrote .
" Where there is indication of incorrigibility , because of the tremendous scandal given , I would most earnestly recommend total laicisation [ defrocking ] , " he wrote .
" I say ' total ' … because when these men are taken before civil authority , the non-Catholic world definitely blames the discipline of celibacy for the perversion of these men . "
A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles defended the church , insisting it was unlikely Paul VI had ever seen the 1963 letter .
" The fact of the matter is , the prevailing ideas at the time about how to deal with abusive behaviour were not adequate , " he said .
" Clearly , society and the church have evolved new understandings of what causes sexually abusive behaviour and how to deal with it . "
The Catholic church has come under sustained criticism across Europe and in North America for its practice of transferring priests accused of sexual abuse to other parishes , rather than reporting the abuse to civil authorities and removing them from ministry .
DeMarco maintained that Fitzgerald 's letter showed the pope had known how pervasive and destructive the problem was .
" He says the solution is to take them out of the priesthood period , not shuffle them around , not pass them from diocese to diocese , " the lawyer added .
Fitzgerald 's views about how to treat abusing priests have been highlighted before .
At one stage he proposed buying an island where priests attracted to men and boys could be segregated .
He even made a $ 5,000 down payment on a Caribbean island .
In 1960 , he sent two priests from the Paracletes to the island of Tortola to investigate the location but his dream ended when the new archbishop of Santa Fe overruled him .

Tehran , Apr 17 : An Iranian cleric has proclaimed that inappropriately dressed women leading to extramarital affairs are the resons behind the devastating earthquakes that frequently rattle the country .
Speaking to worshippers at the Friday prayers here on Apr 16 , senior cleric Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi said , " Many women who dress inappropriately ... cause youths to go astray , taint their chastity and incite extramarital sex in society , which increases earthquakes . "
" Calamities are the result of people 's deeds ... We have no way but conform to Islam to ward off dangers , " the teligious leader is quoted as saying in newspaper reports .
The Islamic laws prescribe a strict dress code for women .
Females are expected to cover hair and bodily contours in public or face punishment and fine .
However , the cleric was probably referring to the women who appear on the streets with well - fitted clothes and layers of make - up as the evil forces behind the natural calamities .

Rat Rods are cool , and I am here to tell you my top 10 reasons why :
1 ) They are cheap to build –
You do n’t need rust free metal , so you are often able to put cars back on the road that never would have been restored otherwise .
2 ) You can build it yourself –
It gives you an amazing sense of pride to drive something that you built , and even more when you get a “ thumbs up ” from a fellow gearhead .
3 ) Lowered cars and trucks are cooler – That ’s just a fact .
4 ) Raw metal – Unpainted metal is a great way to show off your fabricating skills .
5 ) Simplicity – These cars work off the bare essentials .
Windows , heat , seats and suspension are optional .
6 ) No Fear –
You do n’t have to worry about parking your clean car in a grocery store parking lot .
If somebody swings their caravan door into it , it does n’t even matter !
7 ) Wiring –
All you need is power for the ignition coil , alternator , lights , and a horn .
That is like 8 wires .
Anybody could handle that .
8 ) Typically a two seater –
This means you do n’t have to cart your friends around all over town .
“ Can you give us a ride to blah blah somewhere place ?……. ” “ nope sorry , I only have two seats … . ”
9 ) Exposed engine – Watching mechanical things move is awesome on every level .
There is no denying it .
10 ) Part availability –
All parts that you will ever need can be found in a junk yard , swap meet , home depot , or convenience store .

Scientists have measured the most powerful current that helps drive the circulation of the Southern Ocean , paving the way for more accurate climate models .
Australian oceanographer Steve Rintoul from the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research in Hobart says the current is impressive .
" The current carries about 8 million cubic metres per second of water to the north and that 's about the equivalent of 40 times the flow of the world 's largest river , " Dr Rintoul said , referring to the Amazon River .
Scientists have known there are three currents that transport water from Antarctica towards the equator .
These currents are driven by cold , oxygen - rich water that sinks to the deep ocean at Antarctica and flows northwards .
" This current that we 've measured is part of a global pattern of ocean currents , which we often call the ' overturning circulation ' or sometimes the ' ocean conveyor belt ' , " Dr Rintoul said .
Such currents are important in revitalising the oceans with oxygen .
They also affect the climate system because they determine how much heat and CO2 are stored and transported by the ocean .
The slower the current , the less heat and carbon dioxide they can transport .
The current measured by the scientists flows at a depth of about 4 kilometres along the coast of Antarctica from Ross and Adelie before heading north around the edge of the Kerguelen Plateau , which supports Herd Island .
Dr Rintoul says it flows at an average speed of 22 centimetres per second , which is 10 to 20 times larger than the greatest average speeds ever measured in water of this depth .
Climate models
Dr Rintoul says the new measurements will serve as a " benchmark " by which global climate models can be fine - tuned .
" Climate models will need to reproduce this current if they 're going to capture correctly how the ocean transports heat and therefore be able to provide reliable climate predictions , " he said .
Dr Rintoul says current climate models have assumed a much weaker current .
" A stronger overturning circulation would transport more heat from the lower latitudes towards the poles , " he said .
But he says it is not possible to tell how exactly inclusion of these updated figures will impact on climate because of the complexity of the climate system .
The researchers measured speed , salinity and temperature over a period of two years .
They used measuring devices attached to a 3 - kilometre - long wire that was anchored to the ocean floor by old train wheels , along the path of the current .
Speed and salinity measurements helped them to identify the source of the currents in Antarctica .
Salinity measurements will also help to verify other scant data suggesting that oceans have become less salty since 1970s .
Dr Rintoul says that as water becomes less salty it becomes less dense and is less likely to sink , slowing down the currents .
Dr Rintoul and his colleagues report on the current today in Nature Geoscience .
( CNN ) --
If you 're in New York City with only $ 10 in your pocket , Julio Ortiz - Teissonniere has you covered .
Get an unlimited day pass MetroCard , he says .
" It 'll take you from the Bronx Zoo down to Coney Island and everywhere else in between for just $ 8.25 .
Just make sure you 're done by 3 a.m. of the day after you bought it -- otherwise you 'll spend a lot more than $ 10 on a yellow cab . "
If you 're in Italy , Diana Corridori could show you where to get a fantastic breakfast of cappuccinos , chocolate croissants and cookies for a ten - spot .
And Jon Regas of Switzerland could help you dig up more than 40 singles on vinyl for that price .
In Bhutan , Deki Dorji could feed you with fresh vegetables for a week .
Yes , the economy 's down , but $ 10 can still buy you quite a bit -- if you know where to look .
This was our challenge to CNN iReporters last weekend :
Go to the ATM , get $ 10 , and see how far it can take you .
That 's it .
It was the ultimate in thrift and simplicity , and iReporters from around the world found endlessly creative ways to get the most out of their tenner .
Some went for the basics .
Sherbien Dacalanio , Monica Lee and Melissa Melcombe all used their money to stock up on groceries .
Exactly how much they were able to stock up , though , depended on where in the world they were .
Lee and Melcombe live in Los Angeles , California -- known for its high cost of living -- but both made the most of it .
Lee clips coupons , which her local grocery store doubles , and looks for specials every week .
She came home with a huge stash of yogurt , spaghetti sauce and frozen dinners .
And Melcombe got enough food for four meals at Whole Foods , which she considered a victory .
" I am always going to Whole Foods to see what 's on sale , " she said of the retailer , which , to some , has a reputation of being expensive .
" I am a foodie , and I love a good deal . "
Dacalanio lives across the world , between Makati and Pasay cities in the Philippines .
For $ 10 -- or about 450 Philippine pesos -- he filled his fridge with chicken , ham , fruits , veggies and spices .
And then there 's Dorji , from Thimphu , Bhutan , who shelled out 443 Bhutanese ngultrum at the local farmers market for a week 's worth of vegetables .
" I always found it funny how you were able to buy so much here in Asia and so little in North America for the same amount of money , " said Dorji , who went to college in Canada .
" But we have to also look at how much people earn in their respective countries .
Ten dollars a week on vegetables is how much we in Bhutan spend on an average , but I know in North America , for $ 10 , I could n't get very far into the week . "
Tony Coolidge 's shopping trip in Tainan , Taiwan , helps prove her point .
He got 24 new pairs of socks and 10 new ties , all for 300 New Taiwan dollars .
That amounts to about $ 9.50 in the U.S .
" I know I would have spent much more than that in the USA , even at Wal - Mart , " he said .
" I have always enjoyed an amazingly affordable cost - of - living , living in Taiwan .
... I moved here a year ago with a wife and three kids and enjoy a high quality of life that costs 40 percent of what it cost to live in Florida . "
For the ultimate in food thrift , some iReporters put their Alexander Hamilton toward growing a vegetable garden .
Larry Cooper and his wife have been growing vegetables in their Black Earth , Wisconsin , garden for years .
They spent their $ 10 on 350 spinach seeds and the supplies to grow them .
Cooper said it gives them a connection to the land and makes good financial sense .
He spotted 5 - ounce bunches of spinach for $ 4.99 at a local grocery store .
" If a single plant produces only 5 ounces , and each seed germinates and grows to maturity , 350 plants would have a produce department value of $ 1,746.50 , " he calculated .
" Not a bad return on $ 10 , and there 's no Ponzi , no pyramid ; nobody loses . "
Looking to try out something a little more exciting than the basics ( but equally thrifty ) ?
Turns out there 's lots of fun to be had for $ 10 or less .
In Los Angeles , you could ride the world 's shortest railway 40 times .
Angel 's Flight , which has been around since 1901 ( and used to cost only a nickel ) , will take you up or down a hill for a quarter .
And in Vero Beach , Florida , you can still see a movie for under five bucks , which means Cynthia Falardeau could take her son to the latest Miley Cyrus flick and have enough left over to get him a chocolate milk .
Cliff Olney had a similar idea .
The Watertown , New York , native spent his $ 10 on gas for a friend 's fishing boat and took his 12 - year - old twin boys fishing on the nearby Black River .
" Each ended the day with eleven sizable fish and a big smile on their faces , " he said .
" [ It ] was the best ten dollars I 've spent in a long time . "
There 's also the ever - popular art of vintage shopping , which can yield some of the best bargains of all .
Christina Santiago of Rockville , Maryland , picked up a vintage American Tourister travel case , a floral dress and three silk scarves to create an adorable under - $ 10 outfit .
Theresa Link found a store in Shakopee , Minnesota , where you pay $ 10 for all the clothes you can stuff in a bag .
She was able to fit in enough for a summer weekend getaway .
In Sydney , Australia , Charyn Bello spent $ 10 on a variety of glass beads to make homemade jewelry .
And vintage does n't just mean clothes -- Jon Regas of Switzerland always checks out a local half - price bookstore when he visits his family in Indianapolis , Indiana , to buy records .
This time , he snagged 40 singles on vinyl for just 25 cents each .
Finally , some iReporters decided that the very best way of all to spend $ 10 was to give it away .
" Giving a helping hand is more fun than buying more stuff , " wrote Brian Bossard , who donated the money to United Way in Butte , Montana .
" I felt like I could stretch my $ 10 even further by giving [ it ] away to someone who needed it more than I , " agreed Monika Szymanska in New Haven , Connecticut .
" The first thing that came to my mind when spending my $ 10 was two $ 5 footlongs .
The idea must have come from those catchy Subway commercials ... so I went on the hunt in my hometown for a couple people who would appreciate a free meal . "
She gave the first meatball marinara sub to a " charming old man " known as Papa Joe , who lives on the streets of New Haven .
The second went to a man she met at the Salvation Army who was donating furniture , clothes and other items .
" So , to sum it up , my $ 10 got me two $ 5 Subway footlongs and the gratification of helping those in need , " Szymanska said .
" This definitely made me think twice about how I spend ... each dollar . "
An artificial pancreas system that closely mimics the body 's blood sugar control mechanism was able to maintain near - normal glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia in a small group of patients .
The system , combining a blood glucose monitor and insulin pump technology with software that directs administration of insulin and the blood - sugar - raising hormone glucagon , was developed at Boston University ( BU ) .
The first clinical trial of the system was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) and confirmed the feasibility of an approach utilizing doses of both hormones .
In their report , appearing in Science Translational Medicine , the researchers also found unexpectedly large differences in insulin absorption rates between study participants , differences they were able to account for by adjustments to the system .
" This is the first study to test an artificial pancreas using both insulin and glucagon in people with type 1 diabetes .
It showed that , by delivering both hormones in response to frequent blood sugar tests , it is possible to control blood sugar levels without hypoglycemia , even after high - carbohydrate meals , " says Steven Russell , MD , PhD , of the MGH Diabetes Unit , who co-led the research team with Edward Damiano , PhD , of the BU Department of Biomedical Engineering .
In type 1 diabetes , the insulin - producing beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system , requiring insulin treatment to regulate blood sugar levels .
Intensive glucose control involving frequent blood sugar testing and insulin administration can delay or prevent long - term complications - such as retinal damage , kidney failure , or cardiovascular disease - but is extremely demanding and difficult to maintain .
Continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps can help , but patients remain at risk for hypoglycemia , a potentially life - threatening drop in blood sugar caused by too much insulin .
Because any administration of insulin , even by an artificial pancreas system , has been associated with the risk of hypoglycemia , BU investigators Damiano and lead author Firas El - Khatib , PhD , developed a system that both accounts for the rate of insulin absorption and also incorporates glucagon , a hormone naturally released by the pancreas to raise blood sugar levels .
While the alpha cells of the pancreas that produce glucagon are not destroyed in people with type 1 diabetes , the cells no longer release glucagon in response to low blood sugar .
" Large doses of glucagon are used as a rescue drug for people with severely low blood sugar , " explains Damiano .
" Our system is designed to counteract moderate drops in blood sugar with minute doses of glucagon spread out throughout the day , just as the body does in people without diabetes . "
In 2007 Damiano 's team tested the system in diabetic pigs , which led to FDA approval of the human trial .
The current study enrolled 11 adults with type 1 diabetes and was primarily designed to test the software that controls the system .
To get the most accurate glucose levels , the system used a monitor that directly reads blood sugar through a sensor placed into a vein instead of a continuous glucose monitor that takes readings under the skin .
Participants ' blood sugar was controlled by the system for 27 hours , during which time they ate three standardized , high - carbohydrate meals and slept through the night at the hospital .
While the system kept glucose levels close to the target range for six participants , five others experienced hypoglycemia significant enough that they needed a dose of orange juice to raise their blood sugar .
Close analysis of participants ' blood - insulin levels revealed a nearly fourfold difference in the rate at which individuals absorbed and cleared the fast - acting insulin used in the study , with some rates of absorption being much slower than anticipated .
Since the controlling software determined dosage based on the expected rate of insulin absorption , participants who absorbed at a slower rate received excessive doses , leading to hypoglycemia .
A test of participants ' response to a single insulin injection verified that some had consistently slow and some consistently fast rates of insulin absorption .
Rates of absorption also varied too much from experiment to experiment , even on an individual basis , to allow participant - specific dosage calculations .
After globally adjusting the software parameters to a slower insulin absorption rate , the researchers conducted repeat experiments in the same participants .
This time none of the slow - absorption participants experienced hypoglycemia significant enough to require intervention .
Blood - sugar levels were only slightly higher in repeat experiments involving participants with fast insulin absorption , showing that the adjusted software parameters were effective for all study participants and may be adequate for everyone with type 1 diabetes .
The elimination of episodes of hypoglycemia in repeat experiments involving the same participants affirmed that the initial mismatch between parameter settings and insulin absorption rate had been the cause of the hypoglycemia .
All previous reported studies of artificial pancreas systems have included episodes of hypoglycemia , but this is the first study to confirm and address the cause of that hypoglycemia .
Later this spring the researchers will begin a follow - up study with a system using the revised settings and driven by an FDA - approved continuous glucose monitor .
Those experiments will last more than 48 hours and include children as well as adults .
The investigators also plan to compare the insulin / glucagon system with a version that uses only insulin .
" The device we ultimately envision will be wearable and incorporate a glucose sensor inserted under the skin that communicates wirelessly with a pump about the size of a cell phone , " says Russell , who is an instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School .
" The pump would administer insulin and probably glucagon , and would contain a microchip that runs the control software . "
Damiano , whose 11 - year - old son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 1 , adds , " A system like this would replace the need for people to constantly check their blood sugar and to make treatment decisions every few hours .
It would need to be maintained but could take over the decision - making process , closely emulating a functioning pancreas .
It would n't be a cure , but it has the potential to be the ultimate evolution of insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes . "
Damiano is an associate professor of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University .

East Harlem pizza - delivery guy Assami Semde fought off a gun-toting punk — and still managed to deliver two piping - hot pies .
Semde , 19 , was headed to the 25th floor at Taino Towers on East 123rd Street carrying two pizzas from a Famous Famiglia parlor last Friday when he was accosted in the hallway .
Waiting for an answer at the door where he was to deliver the pies , Semde was cornered by two teens wearing hoodies and bandannas — and packing heat .
One of them “ put a gun to my head and said , ‘ Give me the pizza . ’ ” Semde recalled .
“ I thought it was a strange game . ”
The 6 - foot - plus Semde put the pizzas on the ground , but , he said , when the gunman bent to get them , “ I punched him and pushed him against the elevator . ”
The other would - be thief joined the scuffle , but Semde got the best of them .
The gunman screamed and ran off , and Semde held the other teen , Albert Alvarez , until cops showed up , authorities said .
Alvarez , 19 , was arrested for attempted robbery , authorities said .
Semde ’s boss , Frank Grecco — a retired NYPD detective with 22 years on the force — called the teen “ very courageous ” but added , “ I told him , ‘ Next time , leave the pizza ! ’
“ He now realizes that he may have done something a little bit crazy , ” said Grecco , who owns the East Harlem Famous Famiglia .
Semde agreed .
“ It ’s crazy .
I think it ’s better not to fight , ” he said .
Semde , who arrived from his native Burkina Faso four months ago to study English , said that although the West African country is one of world ’s poorest , it is “ better emotionally ” than the United States .
“ How can kids get guns ?
In my country , even for adults it ’s hard to get guns , ” he said .
Grecco said he was amazed his intrepid deliveryman pulled through the encounter .
“ I saw many delivery guys get hurt , ” he said .
“ The main thing is that Assami did n’t get hurt . ”
Semde got the message .
“ I was n’t that scared [ before ] , but now I ’m scared too much , ” he said .
It was n’t just Semde ’s happy ending .
Before the brave teen went to the police station to file a robbery report , he delivered two pizzas as ordered :
One pepperoni , one cheese .
Both still hot .

A massive operation is under way in and around the Gulf of Mexico to halt a leak from a blown - out oil well and prevent the spread of the slick .
The graphic above shows the scene 1,524 m ( 5,000 feet ) beneath the waves where oil is leaking out of the damaged remnants of the oil well apparatus .
Below we explain the various attempts to stem the leak from the damaged oil lines on the sea bed .
Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125 - tonne , 18 - metre ( 59 feet ) high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor .
However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice - like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy .
Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site .
Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak .
To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas .
The top hat is 1.5 m ( 5 feet ) high and 1.2 m in diameter .
Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe .
This should prevent the build - up of hydrates .
Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface .
BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface .
This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build - up of hydrates .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
Meanwhile , four robotic submersibles have been trying to activate the blow - out preventer , a set of huge valves designed to seal the well .
Experts believe the blow - out preventer ( BOP ) must have partially triggered otherwise the flow of oil to the surface would be more extreme than it is .
In an unusual move , BP , the British oil giant which contracted another company to drill the well , has also started using dispersant chemicals down at the leak site as well as on the surface .
A long - term solution is also in progress - drilling a relief well which can tap into the leaking well and take the pressure off the broken well .
However , it could be three months before this is operational .
Up to five thousand barrels a day are thought to be leaking from the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig which sank on 22 April after an explosion in which 11 workers lost their lives .
The delicate eco-system of the gulf coastline is rich in wildlife including the brown pelican , many species of duck , turtles , and whales .
There are fears that the disaster could reach the scale of the 11 m gallon Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska in 1989 .
How the oil has spread
Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May TACKLING THE OIL SLICK Emergency teams are using several methods in attempts to deal with the oil at the surface , which has created a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles ( 5,200 sq km ) .
More than 275 vessels , including skimmers , tugs , barges and recovery vessels , are being used .
Skimmers , which skate over the water , brushing up the oil are also being employed and more than 90,000 barrels of oil - water mix have been removed .
Around 190 miles of floating boom are being used as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast .
A US charity is even making booms out of nylon tights , animal fur and human hair .
Hair donations have been sent from around the world to help make the special booms , which will be laid on beaches to soak up any oil that washes ashore .
Dispersant chemicals , rather like soap , are being sprayed from ships and aircraft in an effort to help break down the oil - which is also degraded by wind and waves .
Burning is another method used to tackle oil spills - although it can be tricky to carry out and has associated environmental risks such as toxic smoke .
So far emergency crews have had little success in containing the spill using those methods .
New underwater technology aimed at stopping crude oil rising to the surface at the site of the leak has had some success .

[ Erick Erickson of RedState : Image courtesy of Joeff Davis at Creative Loafing . ]
As if there is n't enough insanity on the airwaves , enter CNN to the fray .
They 're rolling out a new 7 PM ET show featuring John King ( John King USA ) , and bringing on " balance " in the form of Red State 's Erick Erickson .
From the Political Ticker :
Under Erickson 's leadership , RedState.com has become the preeminent right of center community online .
Prior to leading RedState.com , Erickson practiced law for six years and managed a number of political campaigns , and he currently serves as a member of the Macon , Georgia , city council .
Wow .
Right of center ?
Only if you 're reaching around from the back with your left hand .
Calling Red State right of center is a little like calling the Tea Partiers Reagan Republicans .
Oh , wait .
" Erick 's a perfect fit for John King , USA , because not only is he an agenda - setter whose words are closely watched in Washington , but as a person who still lives in small - town America , Erick is in touch with the very people John hopes to reach , " said Sam Feist , CNN political director and vice president of Washington - based programming .
" With Erick 's exceptional knowledge of politics , as well as his role as a conservative opinion leader , he will add an important voice to CNN 's ideologically diverse group of political contributors . "
Conservative opinion leader ?
Agenda - setter ?
What demon , pray tell , has possessed Mr. Feist ?
Let 's have a look at some of his opinions and agendas he 's leading :
C'mon , CNN .
Red State is the heavily - funded , longstanding arm of the Republican wingnut online noise machine .
Erickson is a propaganda - spinner , a liar and a troll .
When I had little kids , I was really careful about what they watched on TV , because a steady diet of violence really does cause kids to be desensitized to it .
CNN 's hire of Erickson follows the same principle :
By hiring someone who is bombastic , a liar , and a right - wing noise machine trumpet , they actually mainstream views that are rightly considered the province of the fringe and the whacko .
It 's serious , what they 're doing .
They actually want us to wish Lou Dobbs were back on the air in that hour .
When I worked for CNN Interactive , RedStaters Freepers were paid to troll our political discussions and disrupt them , especially during the Clinton impeachment proceedings .
Back then , CNN locked them off the site .
Now they pay them the same calibre voice to troll in real time , on the air .
Got a quote from Erickson that will shame CNN ?
Post it here .
You can register a complaint with CNN here .
Note :
This post was edited to clarify the date difference between when CNN online communities existed and when RedState came into existence .
Yes , at the time the trolls were Freepers . - K
POLAND today agreed to a new version of a deal on stationing an American missile shield which will be aimed essentially at potential threats from Iran .
Warsaw " accepts signing a protocol modifying the accord signed by the Polish and American governments on the installation on our territory of anti-ballistic missile interceptors concluded in Warsaw on August 20 , 2008 , " the government said .
In September , President Barack Obama shelved a plan by his predecessor George W. Bush to deploy a missile shield in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic by 2013 .
Russia had slammed the plan as a grave security threat .
The US has insisted the system was in no way aimed against Russia but was aimed at countering potential attacks by so - called " rogue " states , such as Iran .
The Obama administration later said it wanted to deploy a new SM - 3 anti-missile system in Poland and the neighboring Czech Republic in 2015 .
A first batch of United States Patriot missiles will be deployed in Poland in April , defense ministry spokesman Janusz Sejmej said Saturday .
The United States has also spoken with Romania about hosting 20 missile interceptors as part of the new U.S. missile shield in Europe , Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi said on Saturday .
All but two of Mogadishu's 15 radio stations used to broadcast music
Most radio stations in Somalia have stopped playing music , on the orders of Islamist Hizbul - Islam insurgents who say that songs are un -Islamic .
The stations said they had to comply with the ban as if they did not , they would be putting their lives at risk .
The BBC correspondent in Somalia says this latest order has strong echoes of the Taliban in Afghanistan .
In the past , militants in some areas have banned watching films and football and forced men to grow beards .
Somalia has not had a functioning central government since 1991 and the Islamist militants control large parts of its territory .
The transitional government - backed by African Union troops and UN funds - controls only a small part of the capital , Mogadishu .
' Losing listeners '
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu says the order to stop playing music and jingles was issued 10 days ago .
All but two of the city 's 15 radio stations used to broadcast music .
We are using other sounds such as gunfire , the noise of the vehicles and birds to link up our programmes and news
Tusmo radio's Abdulahi Yasin Jama
Somali anger at threat to music Residents can now only hear music from the government - controlled radio station and another Kenya - based UN - funded radio station , which has a FM transmitter in Mogadishu , he says .
" We are using other sounds such as gunfire , the noise of the vehicles and birds to link up our programmes and news , " said Abdulahi Yasin Jama , Tusmo radio's head of the programmes .
Another radio controller said he feared they would lose listeners and advertisers .
Pop music is genuinely popular in Mogadishu and many people resent being told what they can hear on the radio , our reporter says .
Last week , al - Shabab , the country 's other big militant group , closed down BBC radio relay stations in five cities in southern Somalia , including Mogadishu .
On Tuesday , it issued a statement explaining that it ordered the seizure of BBC transmitters in response to sanctions imposed on the group by the UK government .
But Jerry Timmins , head of the BBC World Service 's Africa region , said the equipment belongs to the BBC which is independent of the government .
He said the broadcaster 's job was to report impartially and accurately and from all sides , including al - Shabab , and the closures deprived Somalis in the south of a vital source of information .
Meanwhile , the UN has warned that hospitals in Mogadishu are being overwhelmed by casualties from fighting in the city .
World Health Organization spokesman Paul Garwood said that last month alone at least 900 injuries were reported at the city 's three main hospitals .
" Health care workers are struggling to cope ; they are overwhelmed with the huge increase in wounded .
It is stretching an already weak health care system to the limit , " Paul Garwood told Reuters news agency .
WHO figures show that only 250 qualified doctors and fewer than 900 nurses are working in Somalia .

Solomon 's solicitor has advised him to avoid programmes like Question Time
A man who repeatedly disturbed his neighbours by shouting at political programmes on his television has been jailed for 16 weeks .
Bristol Crown Court heard that former merchant sailor Martin Solomon , 64 , had admitted repeatedly ignoring legal orders to keep the noise down .
Solomon , of Stroud , said he had no quarrel with neighbours but shows like the BBC's Question Time made him angry .
Last week , in another court appearance Solomon admitted breaching an Asbo .
Judge Martin Picton sentenced him at that hearing to 200 hours of community work over a 12 - month period .
But after his arrest on the weekend following further complaints about bad language , Judge Picton told Solomon that he had no alternative but to jail him .
A Chinese ship that spent nine days stranded on the Great Barrier Reef gouged a three - kilometre ( two - mile ) scar in the coral that could take decades to recover , a top expert said on Tuesday .
David Wachenfeld , chief scientist at the body overseeing the heritage - listed marine park , said the Shen Neng 1 coal carrier had been grinding against and crushing the reef after it veered off course and smashed into it on April 3 .

Officials have expressed anger over the incident and accused the crew of the ship , which was refloated late on Monday and towed away , of taking an illegal route .
“ This is by far the largest ship grounding scar we have seen on the Great Barrier Reef to date , ” Wachenfeld told public broadcaster ABC .
“ This vessel did not make an impact in one place and rest there and then was pulled off .
This scar is more in the region of three kilometres long and up to 250 metres ( yards ) wide . ”
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called the accident , which also leaked about two tonnes of fuel oil into the pristine seas , an “ absolute outrage ” .
“ It is still an absolute outrage that this vessel could ’ve landed on the Great Barrier Reef , ” he said .
“ We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to finding out how that happened . ”

An approaching storm hurried authorities into refloating the 230 - metre ( 750 feet ) ship — the length of two football pitches — after nightfall on Monday .
They pumped compressed air into its bunkers and pulled it free using tugboats .
Officials said the rescue had been carried out without adding to the initial oil spill , which created a three - kilometre slick .
Divers were due to assess damage to the ship , still carrying 68,000 tonnes of China - bound coal , which has been towed to a nearby island .

But concern on Tuesday focused on the plight of the reef , which was also left plastered with toxic anti-fouling paint from the ship ’s hull .
Divers “ have found significant scarring and coral damage .
They ’ve also found quite a lot of anti-fouling ( paint ) spread across the reef , ” Russell Reichelt , chairman of the marine park authority , told ABC radio .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It is a concern because it ’s designed to be toxic and stop things growing on ships .
We ’ve already seen observations where anti-fouling paint that ’s been scraped off onto the reef is killing corals in its vicinity . ”
Officials have promised to investigate allegations that ships have been taking short - cuts through the world ’s biggest reef , which covers 344,000 square kilometres ( 137,600 square miles ) off the east coast and is a major tourist draw .
On Monday , three crew members from another large carrier appeared in court on charges of entering a restricted part of the reef without permission , and were bailed to reappear on Friday .

Conservationists say the incidents highlight the risk to Australia ’s environment posed by rocketing resource exports to Asia , which are fuelling a strong recovery from the global financial crisis .
The reef , which is visible from space and is one of the world ’s foremost ecological treasures , has already come under pressure from rising sea temperatures and pollution .

Off recently unearthed a bunch of old hymnals while digging around in our attic , and , coincidentally enough , we also unearthed a box of metal albums we 'd meant to mail to the Backstreet Boys several years ago but never got around to it .
We put the albums in our rotation and leafed through the hymnals and realized , hey : Thematically , these can be kind of similar .
In fact , they can be damn near indistinguishable .

Romulus , Remus & So Much More …
Ok , so I was doing some reading in Lostpedia to brush up , and I stumbled into something quite interesting …
I started digging and digging , pulling the string , and I kept running into more and more … well , “ coincidences ” … and I was thinking to myself : “ this is too much , there ’s too many links here for this to be purely arbitrary ” …
So let me know what you think , but I ’m having a hard time thinking this is pure chance .
This may not be what the writers end up using as explanations for what ’s going on , but I certainly think that they are using a lot of this stuff to build on the LOST world , and give it some solid background …
I ’m quoting here a lot of stuff researched on the web , mostly Lostpedia and Wikipedia , but also other places .
I ’ve tried to acknowledge quotes everywhere , but apologies if I missed something .
I ’m merely “ connecting the dots here ” , and trying to relate well - established historical facts to our “ Lost Universe ” in an attempt to make some sense of this all , and perhaps shed some light on what might be behind this whole mystery … .
Some days ago I was investigating the “ latin ” element in Lost ( I seem to be obsessed with this lately ) , and started by doing that simple search in Lostpedia : “ latin ” .
First hit : Tabula Rasa …
Ludi Incipiant ( let the games begin ) …
Tabula Rasa and John Locke
( Tabula Rasa is the title of the 3rd episode in Season 1 , right after the two Pilots ) .
Wikipedia tells us that the term tabula rasa literally means “ blank slate ” , and is a philosophical thesis that states that individuals are born without built - in mental content and that their knowledge comes from experience and perception .
In the 12th century , the Andalusian - Islamic philosopher and novelist Ibn Tufail demonstrated the theory of
tabula rasa as a thought experiment through his novel Hayy ibn Yaqzan , in which he depicted the development of the mind of a “ feral child ” ( I ’ll get to this in a minute ) from a tabula rasa to that of an adult , in complete isolation from society on a desert island ( really ??
an island ??!! ) , through experience alone .
The Latin translation of his philosophical novel , entitled Philosophus Autodidactus , published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671 , had an influence on John Locke ’s ( hmmm , I ’m sure I ’ve heard that name before … ) formulation of tabula rasa ” in his work “ An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ” .
As understood by Locke , tabula rasa meant that the mind of the individual was born “ blank ” , and it also emphasized the individual ’s freedom to author his or her own soul ( I ca n’t help thinking , after reading this , of Lost - character - Locke ’s famous phrase : “ do n’t tell me what I ca n’t do ! ” ) .
Some further research on this Ibn Tufail in Wikipedia shows that his works and ideas influenced people like ….
John Locke ( as im you - know - who ) , David Hume ( as in Desmond ) , Jean - Jacques Rousseau ( as in Danielle ) …
So , as a starting point , interesting to see what the writers titled this first episode after the pilot , hinting that everything that may have happened before the crash did not matter : it was a new beginning for all the survivors .
A clean slate .
A tabula rasa .
Literally for convict - Kate in her first “ centric ” episode , or for Locke with his new set of legs … but implicitly for all the other survivors .
What they did from then on would define their future .
It was up to them …
I am convinced this was intentional and a direct wink to the school of empiricism …
But if my reasoning does not convince you , check out the more recent quote by Jacob while speaking to Richard in front of the fire after his arrival in the island :
“(…)
That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it is in their very nature to sin .
I bring people here to prove him wrong .
And when they get here , their past doesnt matter . ”
… need anything more specific ?
Feral Children and The Noble Savage
So , what ’s this thing called a “ feral child ” ?
Wikipedia explains that a “ feral child ” is a human child who has lived isolated from human contact from a very young age , and has no ( or little ) experience of human care , loving or social behavior , and , crucially , of human language .
These mythical children are often depicted as having superior strength , intelligence and morals compared to “ normal ” humans ( hmmm , remind you of our favourite white - and black - shirted friends ? ? ) , the implication being that because of their upbringing they represent humanity in a pure and uncorrupted state : similar to “ the noble savage ” …
The myth of “ the noble savage ” , again from Wikipedia , talks about the concept of the natural man , unencumbered by either civilization or divine revelation .
The idea that in a state of nature humans are essentially good is often attributed to the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury , who postulated that the moral sense in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular religion .
For him , humans were neither good nor bad , but they possessed a moral sense based on the emotion of sympathy , and this emotion was the source and foundation of human goodness and benevolence .
Like many of his contemporaries , Shaftesbury was reacting to Hobbes ’s famous formulation ( in justification of royal absolutism ) , that in a state of nature men are depraved and their lives are “ solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short ” .
Wow , so one side thinks that , in a state of nature , humans are essentially good … and the other side believes that in the same state of nature , men are depraved .
This is beginning to sound more and more like our adorable Jacob and MIB …
Let ’s see that quote again :
“(…)
That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it is in their very nature to sin .
I bring people here to prove him wrong .
And when they get here , their past doesnt matter . ”
Anthony Cooper Times
Two
But wait , there ’s more … .
Wanna know who else thought that man was born with the potential for goodness ?
How about Jean - Jacques Rousseau … ?
And guess who saw in JJ Rousseau their source for philosophical inspiration ….?
The Jacobins of the French Revolution !!!
Well , this is simply too much …… or is it ?
No , no , no ….
there ’s more , much more !
Wanna know the name of that Shaftesbury who defended the intrinsic “ goodness ” in men ?
Anthony Ashley - Cooper , 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury and grand - son of Anthony Cooper ( 1st Earl of Shaftesbury ) , who had diametrically opposing views on the nature of men and defended that men were essentially bad .
Oh , and by the way , his marriage to Lady Dorothy Manners was arranged by none other than …
John Locke ( !!!! ) , who incidentally played a key role in teaching Latin to the 3rd Earl … !!!
Wow , is this for real ???
So , let ’s recap … .
We have a man called Anthony Cooper who believes that men are essentially bad , who is very close friends with John Locke , and whose latin - speaking grand - son ( also called Anthony Cooper ) promotes Locke ’s views that men are in fact essentially good …
Does this ring any bells in terms of the thoughts and beliefs of the Lost - Universe Anthony Cooper and John Locke ??
If that ’s not direct correlation , then what is …???
Feral Children Revisited
So , back to this concept of the “ feral child ” because it looks very promising from a “ Lost - Universe ” point of view …
There are many such children myths throughout history ( Mowgli from Kipling ’s “ Jungle Book ” , Tarzan from Rice Burroughs ’ “ Tarzan of the Apes ” , Enkidu from “ The Epic of Gilgamesh ” , Atalanta from Greek mythology … ) , but the one case in particular that inevitably drew my attention here is that of the twins Romulus and Remus .
From Wikipedia : Roman legend has it that Romulus and Remus , twin sons of Rhea Silvia and Mars , were raised by wolves .
Rhea Silvia was a priestess , and when it was found that she had been pregnant and had had children , the local King Amulius ordered her to be buried alive and for the children to be killed .
The servant who was given the order set them in a basket on the Tiber river instead and the children were taken by Tiberinus , the river god , to the shore where a she - wolf found them and raised them until they were discovered as toddlers by a shepherd ( hold on , is that “ shepherd ” or “ Shephard ” ? ? ) named Faustulus .
He and his wife Acca Larentia , who had always wanted a child but never had one , raised the twins , who would later figure prominently in the events leading up to the founding of Rome ( named after Romulus , who eventually killed Remus in a fight over whether the city should be founded on the Palatine Hill or the Aventine Hill ) .
Ok , so we have two “ feral children ” ( twins , to be exact ) , Romulus and Remus , with superior powers , who are raised by a shepherd and eventually one kills the other over an argument …
Let ’s try and rephrase that : we have two children , MIB and Jacob , with superior powers , who are raised by a ( Christian ) Shephard and eventually one kills the other over an argument …
When was the script of Lost written again …??
Is It Really Them , Though ?
Well , I ’m not saying it is …
But check this out , if you ’re not convinced that MIB and Jacob might just be a modern version of Romulus and Remus , here ’s another “ wink ” from the producers :
The knife that MIB gives to Richard to kill Jacob … .
the exact same knife given by Dogen to Sayid to kill MIB …
Guess what ’s engraved on the side of the knife … ?
Well , if it ai n’t a depiction of the she - wolf Lupa suckling Romulus and Remus ?!?!?!?!
( You can check this out on Lostpedia ) .
Re-Cap Before My - Nap
Now …..
I ’m definitely not sure how all of this fits together with Lost , and what parts might be genuinely hinted at by the producers , or which parts may not .
But there definitely are toooooo many coincidences for this to be simply that : a coincidence …
1 . The philosophical struggle between innate benevolence or depravation , good and bad , within a human soul , supported by John Locke and Anthony Cooper — both inside Lost , and in real history …
2 . The thought experiment by Ibn Tufail about a “ feral child ” in a desert island developing from a tabula rasa to an adult … mimicking the trips that each and everyone of the island inhabitants is going through since their arrival at the island …
3 . The super - powered , latin - speaking “ feral ” twin brothers Romulus ( MIB ) and Remus ( Jacob ) , raised by a ( Christian ) Shephard , with fratricidal blood in their veins …
I think this could give some meaning to the Latin-element in Lost and its importance in everything Jacob - related …
4 . By all means , it looks like Jack will be the candidate to replace Jacob .
And , incidentally Jack = Jacob in some historic references , and Jacob comes from the Hebrew “ he who supplants ” …
So , will Jack “ supplant ” Jacob / Remus ??? …
And will he give in to his “ fratricidal tendencies ” and kill his way - out - there sister Claire in an attempt to prevent her from killing Kate ?
( Now , there ’s a thought !!!)
5 . All those names popping up and interacting both in Lost and in real life ….
Rousseau ….
Hume ….
Cooper …. Locke… .
Shephard …..
What are the odds ?
Madurai , India ( CNN ) -- Narayanan Krishnan was a bright , young , award - winning chef with a five - star hotel group , short - listed for an elite job in Switzerland .
But a quick family visit home before heading to Europe changed everything .
" I saw a very old man eating his own human waste for food , " Krishnan said .
" It really hurt me so much .
I was literally shocked for a second .
After that , I started feeding that man and decided this is what I should do the rest of my lifetime . "
Krishnan was visiting a temple in the south Indian city of Madurai in 2002 when he saw the man under a bridge .
Haunted by the image , Krishnan quit his job within the week and returned home for good , convinced of his new destiny .
" That spark and that inspiration is a driving force still inside me as a flame -- to serve all the mentally ill destitutes and people who cannot take care of themselves , " Krishnan said .
Krishnan founded his nonprofit Akshaya Trust in 2003 .
Now 29 , he has served more than 1.2 million meals -- breakfast , lunch and dinner -- to India 's homeless and destitute , mostly elderly people abandoned by their families and often abused .
Do you know a hero ?
Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes
" Because of the poverty India faces , so many mentally ill people have been ... left uncared [ for ] on the roadside of the city , " he said .
Krishnan said the name Akshaya is Sanskrit for " undecaying " or " imperishable , " and was chosen " to signify [ that ] human compassion should never decay or perish .
...
The spirit of helping others must prevail for ever . "
Also , in Hindu mythology , Goddess Annapoorani's " Akshaya bowl " fed the hungry endlessly , never depleting its resources .
Krishnan 's day begins at 4 a.m .
He and his team cover nearly 125 miles in a donated van , routinely working in temperatures topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit .
He seeks out the homeless under bridges and in the nooks and crannies between the city 's temples .
The hot meals he delivers are simple , tasty vegetarian fare he personally prepares , packs and often hand - feeds to nearly 400 clients each day .
Krishnan carries a comb , scissors and razor and is trained in eight haircut styles that , along with a fresh shave , provide extra dignity to those he serves .
He says many of the homeless seldom know their names or origins , and none has the capacity to beg , ask for help or offer thanks .
They may be paranoid and hostile because of their conditions , but Krishnan says this only steadies his resolve to offer help .
" The panic , suffering of the human hunger is the driving force of me and my team members of Akshaya , " he said .
" I get this energy from the people .
The food which I cook ... the enjoyment which they get is the energy .
I see the soul .
I want to save my people . "
How to nominate a CNN Hero
The group 's operations cost about $ 327 a day , but sponsored donations only cover 22 days a month .
Krishnan subsidizes the shortfall with $ 88 he receives in monthly rent from a home his grandfather gave him .
Krishnan sleeps in Akshaya 's modest kitchen with his few co-workers .
Since investing his entire savings of $ 2,500 in 2002 , he has taken no salary and subsists with the help of his once - unsupportive parents .
" They had a lot of pain because they had spent a lot on my education , " he said .
" I asked my mother , ' Please come with me , see what I am doing . '
After coming back home , my mother said , ' You feed all those people , the rest of the lifetime I am there , I will feed you . '
I 'm living for Akshaya .
My parents are taking care of me . "
For lack of funding , the organization has been forced to halt construction on Akshaya Home , Krishnan 's vision of a dormitory where he can provide shelter for the people he helps .
Despite the demands and few comforts his lifestyle affords , Krishnan says he 's enjoying his life .
" Now I am feeling so comfortable and so happy , " he says .
" I have a passion , I enjoy my work .
I want to live with my people . "

This week the beautiful spring weather brought along with it some relatively happy news for cycling advocates in slow - moving Toronto .
BIXI bike sharing has being revived , and our first segregated bike lanes will operate on a pilot program this summer on University Avenue .
But not everyone is happy about installing more bike lanes .
In February – along with iBikeTO.ca – we revealed that Toronto ’s imminent BIXI bike sharing program had been been jeopardized .
Disappointed by this news , we partnered up with other cycling advocates in the city – with leadership from the Toronto Cyclists Union – to urge citizens to put pressure on their local Councillors and revive the prospect of bike sharing in Toronto .
Our voices were heard , councillors felt the pressure , and City Hall staff pulled its magic strings to get BIXI back on the table to be implemented by May 2011 – one year later than its original planned launch date .
BIXI to launch in 2011 with 1,000 bicycles at 80 stations
The original BIXI plan called for 3,000 bikes and 300 stations to match Montreal ’s original launch in May 2009 .
The new plan calls for only 1,000 bikes at 80 stations .
Although positive news , it is still somewhat disappointing because the most important criterion for bike sharing to succeed is convenience .
If there are n’t enough bike stations conveniently located around the city , people wo n’t use them .
With only 1,000 bikes at 80 stations , the city needs to be very cautious not to cover too large a radius , which could result in less convenience for users to pick up a bike and efficiently return it close to their destination .
One of the reasons for Montreal ’s success with its BIXI program is that it launched with 3,000 bicycles across a relatively small downtown radius .
The success in Montreal saw its program expand within months to 5,000 bicycles at a total of 400 stations .
We can only hope that the Toronto program will see similar success and expand to improve the coverage area and convenience for its users .
Toronto to implement its first segregated bike lanes on University Ave .
The second positive headline to hit the streets on Tuesday was the news that Toronto will implement a pilot program from July to September whereby protected bicycle lanes will be installed on University Avenue from Richmond Street to Wellesley Street .
Photo courtesy of City of Toronto
These protected lanes would turn the 8 - lane University Ave. into 6 - lanes and provide a protected buffer between automobiles and cyclists – a first for a Toronto bike lane .
However , there does n’t appear to be any plans to include separate bicycle traffic signals for this pilot program .
In the video I made cycling down Broadway Ave. in New York last month , you can see that separate bicycle traffic signals are vital to avoid conflict between left - turning automobiles .
Without these protected traffic signals , cyclists may feel they are protected from motorist conflict , but in reality they may be more vulnerable to being left - hooked by turning cars .
Not Everyone happy about more bike lanes
Unfortunately , not everyone is as excited about these bike lanes as most of us are – The Toronto Star ’s Bob Hepburn says Bike lanes on University Ave. make no sense .
In the article , Mr. Hepburn notes that he only saw 15 cyclists Wednesday morning on his way to work while driving down Sherbourne Ave .
He then goes on to contradict himself by saying : “ While more bike lanes are a good idea , putting them on major roads is ridiculous .
They should be placed on less - busy routes . ” .
First he points out that there were very few cyclists on Sherbourne Ave as building a case AGAINST bike lanes .
Then he says he SUPPORT bike lanes , but only on less busy routes .
Had Mr. Hepburn driven down College St. or Queen
St , he would have seen far more than 15 cyclists .
Cyclists use main arterial roads for the same reason drivers do – they are more direct , they are faster , and they are lined with stores and office buildings where cyclists and drivers live , shop and work .
Another article in the Toronto Star by Gil Penelosa claims these bike lanes “ connect nothing to nothing ” .
Penelosa is wrong in his assertion – bike lanes on University Ave. connect with the Hoskin Ave , Wellesley
St in the north , College St and Gerard street near the middle , and although Queen street is bike - lane - less , thousands of cyclists use it nonetheless .
In the south , the city is planning to convert Richmond and Adelaide streets into two - way streets and eventually adding a bike lane on one or both of these streets , so this will eventually connect the south end of the University bike lanes to an east - west bike lane , while nearby Simcoe street has a bike lane that leads south to the lake .
Ironically , Penelosa works as a Senior Consultant for the Danish firm Gehl Architects .
You may be aware that Gehl Architects is headed by the infamous Jan Gehl , the visionary and architect of Copenhagen ’s pedestrian and cycling infrastructure .
Penelosa should know that Copenhagen ’s bike infrastructure was n’t built overnight .
It took 30 years to get where they are now – and they are still improving the network .
Toronto is inching forward at a pace we have n’t seen in the 9 years since the city ’s bike plan was first written – so let ’s keep the momentum going .
We may be 30 years behind Copenhagen , but we have to start somewhere .

“ Violence in Video Games ” was produced to demonstrate the close similarities between real - world violence and simulated violence included in video games .
The video juxtapositions scenes captured in the real - world and those that exist in the fantasy game world depicted in the Call of Duty series .
Shooting dogs , beating children and murdering innocent civilians are dwarfed by the amount of unmitigated evil game developers are having their heroes portray .
Call of Duty is currently the most popular first - person shooter video game series on the market .
The game overshadows in popularity and sales Grand Theft Auto and Halo .
Current versions of the game include torture of captured enemy combatants , burning prisoners alive with Molotov cocktails , shooting soldiers who surrender , and the terrorist slaughter of civilians in a Russian airport .
For the less gung - ho ( and psychopathic ) , the latest version of Call of Duty allows players to opt- out of the scene depicting the murder of innocent civilians .
Video games play an important role in training U.S. soldiers as they prepare for combat .
In 2008 , the Army invested $ 50 million for the development of video games and a gaming system designed to train soldiers for combat .
“ With the new platform and games , Army programmers hope to offer more life - like reproductions of battlefield scenarios , offering editable terrains , a greater capacity for multi-player action and larger battlefields , ” writes Switched , an AOL electronics website .
The current version of Call of Duty was not available in 2007 when soldiers massacred a Reuters cameraman and other civilians in Baghdad .
However , considering the way the soldiers acted , you would n’t know it .

On Thursday , President Barack Obama condemned the management of Massey Energy , charging that the owners “ put their bottom line before the safety of their workers . ”
The company has a history of safety violations and run-ins with federal regulators , but claims it has made major improvements .
The company accused its critics of “ rushing to judgment for political gain or to avoid blame ” in a statement issued yesterday .
With Massey employees contributing nearly $ 37,000 to federal politicians and committees so far this cycle , might any of the beneficiaries of this cash share Obama ’s harsh view of the company ?
The bulk of this sum comes from $ 30,400 contribution to the National Republican Senatorial Committee last year from Massey CEO Don Blankenship .
The NRSC has no plans to part ways with it .
“ At this point in time the NRSC has no intention of returning the money .
There is no reason to .
I ’m not aware that President Obama is returning the million dollars he took from Goldman Sachs and its employees , ” said Brian Walsh , the NRSC ’s communications director , referring to the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s fraud charges against the investment bank .
A decade ago , Rep. Shelley Moore Capito ( R - W. Va. ) received a $ 1,000 contribution from Massey ’s PAC .
More recently , she received a $ 250 contribution from an engineer at the mine — money she also intends to keep .
“ The contribution the congresswoman received was from an employee of Massey Energy on behalf of himself , not his employer , ” Capito press secretary Ashlee Strong said .
“ We do n’t see a conflict of interest taking money from a constituent of West Virginia on behalf of himself . ”
Four politicians — all Republicans — have received money from Massey this campaign cycle .
Rep. John Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) received $ 2,400 from Dwayne Francisco , a Massey executive .
Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Pat Toomey received $ 2,000 from CEO Blankenship .
Rep. Mike Rogers ( R - Mich . ) and Ohio Republican Senate candidate Rob Portman also each received $ 1,000 from Blankenship .
The offices of Shimkus , Toomey , Rogers and Portman did not respond to requests for comment .

A deluge which has swamped the dead heart of Australia and left towns and properties isolated has set new rainfall records .
In the outback town of Birdsville , in far western Queensland , Senior Constable Scott Gander pored over rain records dating back to 1892 in an effort to give the downpour , which began on Saturday night , some historical perspective .
It eclipsed anything he found .
In the 24 hours to 9.00 am , 168 millimetres fell in Birdsville - the average annual rainfall delivered in one day .
Since Saturday the town has registered more than 225 millimetres - nearly nine inches on the old scale .
And the deluge , which came across the Simpson Desert from the Northern Territory with a slow moving monsoonal system , continues to bring rain to Central Australia .
Huge falls of more than 150 millimetres have been recorded all around Birdsville - 300 kilometres to the north , 100 kilometres to the south and just as far to the east .
The outback water courses that run through the arid centre towards Lake Eyre - the Georgina and the Diamantina Rivers , and Eyre Creek - are rising rapidly .
Last year flooding rains in the north around Mount Isa sent the water down those waterways all the way to Lake Eyre .
It may happen again .
Birdsville is awash and the main road out of town , which crosses the Diamantina River , is covered in floodwaters .
It could be weeks before the road is reopened .
The weather system is now moving to the south - east where it is dumping more rain on the channel country of south - west Queensland , adding extra water to Cooper Creek .
It has been in flood since heavy rain in western Queensland late last year .
The tiny settlement of Innamincka , in outback South Australia , has been isolated since late January when the Cooper spread its banks to cover the causeway into town .
Some supplies have been ferried in by aircraft but the strip is now too wet to use .
The 13 people in town are just sitting it out .
The biggest problem they face is that they are running short of diesel fuel .
The weather system is forecast to track further east across southern Queensland and northern New South Wales .
If it delivers heavy falls , there it could bring the biggest run in the rivers at the top of the Murray Darling basin since the drought took hold a decade ago .
Pulitzer Prize - winning photographer Kim Komenich has seen his share of crime and violence while capturing breaking news from behind his camera .
Komenich , a former Chronicle photojournalist who now teaches new media at San Jose State University , can add crime fighter to his list of accomplishments .
On Monday , as Komenich was at a Wells Fargo Bank in downtown San Jose , he saw a teller being robbed and the suspect reaching for his pockets .
Komenich walked up behind the suspect and held him in a bear hug until police arrived .
" Between classes , I go out there and do what I can do to make the world a little better for people , " Komenich , 53 , of Mill Valley quipped Wednesday .
It all started about 3:30 p.m. Monday when Komenich was in line at the bank on South Market Street .
He saw a man , whom police later identified as Victor Anthony Fernandes , 45 , walk in with two other people .
Fernandes got in line while the others sat down in chairs in the lobby .
" They appeared to be a little down on their luck and , possibly , they had a bit to drink , " Komenich said .
Fernandes began talking to a teller , and they appeared to be having a normal conversation , Komenich said .
But then the suspect raised his voice and told the teller , " Give me your money , " Komenich said .
The teller complied .
When Fernandes reached into his pocket , Komenich said he thought to himself , " If anything bad is going to happen , it 's going to happen next . "
So Komenich walked over to the suspect .
" I clamped him down in a bear hug , " said Komenich , who stands 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 260 pounds .
Fernandes is about 5 - foot - 10 " and maybe 180 , " Komenich said .
Komenich said he was n't sure , but that he may have lifted the suspect off the ground for a moment .
" That sort of established that I had him , " he said .
Fernandes did n't resist , he said .
Komenich held on for five minutes until police arrived .
They found no weapon on Fernandes , whom they arrested along with his two companions , Johnnie Dale Gray , 39 , and Tamara Leeann Rennert , 40 .
All three were being held at Santa Clara County Jail on suspicion of robbery .
" We 're applauding the heroic acts of this professor , by all means , but we 're not necessarily encouraging this kind of activity , " Sgt. Ronnie Lopez , a San Jose police spokesman , said Wednesday .
Even though the suspect was n't armed , the potential was there , Lopez said .
" But more importantly , the two other suspects lingering in the background could have had a gun , " he said .
" Sometimes , taking matters into your own hands could lead to a deadly confrontation . "
Komenich said , " My main reason for doing it was that it seemed like the guy was down on his luck .
I just did n't want things to escalate .
It was sort of a half - baked attempt at a bank robbery . "
He added , " All my life , I 've been a witness .
I have n't really intervened because it was my job to watch . "
Komenich has covered stories in Vietnam , the former Soviet Union , El Salvador , Iraq and Guyana .
In 1987 , while working for the San Francisco Examiner , Komenich won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the People Power Revolution that forced Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos from office .
Komenich worked at The Chronicle from 200o to 2009 .
On Wednesday he was back in class at San Jose State , where he is an assistant professor of new media .
Why on earth did you put a playground on top of a cemetery ?
You know , we hear that a lot .
And the answer will surprise you .
When you ’re thinking about building a playground for kids , your first inclination might be “ let ’s not build this on a 200 - year old cemetery . ”
But in our case , we thought differently .
What the hell were you thinking when you decided to build a playground on top of a cemetery ?
Good question .
When we designed our playground we knew it would have all the normal accoutrements of any children ’s play space : slides , play houses , a sandbox and toys .
But we wanted to offer something most playgrounds do n’t offer : a chance for kids to come face - to - face with the prospect of mortality while they ’re playing with sand .
What thought process goes into building a children ’s playground on top of a cemetery ?
It ’s not as easy as you would think .
When you ’re building a playground on a normal piece of land that does n’t have dead bodies in it you do n’t have any obstacles in your way .
In our case though , we were building a playground on top of a very old cemetery .
We did n’t want to remove the grave stones because we felt it was important to respect the graves we were putting a playground on top of .
So we built around them .
Do you realize you built a children ’s playground on top of a cemetery ?
Oh lord yes !
We have lots of people remind us of that .
And there are numerous instances when people visiting Rhinebeck see the playground and decide to let the kids out of the car for a stretch .
We like to watch the faces of the parents because you can see the very moment they realize that we built a playground on top of a cemetery .
You can almost read their minds .
Holy Ghost Explosion

Someone took some footage from a crazy evangelical Christian revival service ( in Moselle , MS ) , and added some sweet techno music to it .
These people are so overwhelmed by the “ power of the holy spirit ” that they ca n’t help but flail around frantically , prance like jackasses , and fall gesticulating on the floor .
You know , because of the love of Jesus Christ .
Here it is without techno music .
Yes , this shit is real .

Apple banned a third prominent cartoonist from its app store , citing mockery of Tiger Woods and a policy against " ridiculing a public figure . "
If we 're to let Apple censor our news , we should familiarize ourselves with the company 's whims .
Apple 's filtering of content is , of course , not technically censorship ; we iPad and iPhone customers implicitly authorize the company to control our in - app iReading when we purchase the company 's devices .
And we 're always free to read what we like on the Web .
But Apple 's policies sure do hinder cartoonists who are trying to make a living selling their content to the many people who " own " Apple devices .
And to what end ?
What 's the purpose of Apple 's anti-ridicule policy ?
It 's hard to see how banning Tiger Woods cartoons improves the company 's bottom line , enhances its image or makes the iPad and iPhone more family friendly .
Ditto for the other cartoons Apple controversially banned , including one animation app from a Pulitzer Prize winner , which depicted Barack Obama and other leaders , and caricatures by Mad magazine 's Tom Richmond , which deflated top national politicians .
Apple eventually reversed its decision to ban the latter two apps .
But MSNBC .com 's Daryl Cagle has not been able to win a reprieve for his app , " Tiger Woods Cartoons , " which contains the work of other cartoonists , for whom he works as a distributor .
And he says Apple hemmed and hawed and took three months to approve a different cartoon app he submitted .
Cagle seems as confused as anyone as to why Apple would allow the president to be made fun of , but not a very public figure like Tiger Woods .
But he knows what he thinks about the long - term implications of Apple 's policies : Disturbing .
From Cagle 's blog post :
Editorial cartoons are the best measure of the freedom of a nation .
Cartoonists in Cuba have never drawn Fidel Castro ; cartoonists in Egypt can't draw their President Hosni Mubarek ; cartoonists in China do n't draw their president Hu Jintao .
Authoritarian regimes always turn first to control the cartoonists , and forbid them from " ridiculing public figures . "
As newspaper audiences decline ... editorial cartoonists , who are moving from print and the web to mobile devices , are finding that Apple 's views of their profession can have a profound impact on what their future audience will be .
Below , some samples of the cartoons in Cagle 's Tiger Woods app , followed by cartoons from Richmond and then a frame and screenshot from the Pulitzer - Prize winning animator , Mark Fiore .
If Steve Jobs and his hired in - house censors think this sort of routine , even benign editorializing is beyond the pale , is it any wonder they also think adult consumption of pornography is harmful to children ?
And is it any wonder publishers are scared to hand the company 's any more control over news distribution ?

Remember his unhinged performance in this video from CPAC ?
Well , he continues to astound us all .
Once again Andrew Breitbart demonstrates that he 's a major league smear merchant , who has no shame --- only disgrace .
Really , this one takes the cake .
Joan Walsh :
His " proof " that black congressmen lied about being called " nigger " is as useless as his ACORN clips .
Andrew Breitbart is n't fit to spit - shine the shoes of civil rights hero and Congressman John Lewis .
It 's ludicrous to think that the right - wing bully believed he had the moral or political standing to call Lewis a liar , after Lewis and two other black congressmen reported they were called " nigger " by tea partiers during the healthcare reform vote March 20 .
Lewis 's word on the confrontation is good enough for me .
Now comes news that Breitbart is the liar – or at least the misleader .
Video he 's been peddling to " prove " the congressmen were not called the N - word was actually after the slurs occurred .
As a friend notes , " It 's like running video of the Twin Towers on 9/10 to prove 9/11 did n't happen . "
Of course the videos Breitbart peddled to claim ACORN helped a supposed pimp and prostitute set up a child - prostitution ring have also been found misleading , at best .
The California Attorney General 's review said they were " severely edited " and in fact " showed no violation of the law . "
New York authorities concluded the same thing .
AP has the full scoop .
A reconstruction of the events shows that the conservative challenges largely sprang from a mislabeled video that was shot later in the day .
Breitbart posted two columns on his Web site saying the claims were fabricated .
Both led with a 48 - second YouTube video showing Lewis , Carson , other Congressional Black Caucus members and staffers leaving the Capitol .
Some of the group were videotaping the booing crowd .
Breitbart asked why the epithet was not captured by the black lawmakers ' cameras , and why nobody reacted as if they had heard the slur .
He also questioned whether the epithets could have been shouted by liberals planted in the crowd .
But the 48 - second video was shot as the group was leaving the Capitol — at least one hour after Lewis , D - Ga. , and Carson walked to the Capitol , which is when they said the slurs were used .
Questioned about using a video on his Web site from the wrong moment , Breitbart stood by his claim that the lawmakers were lying .
" I 'm not saying the video was conclusive proof , " he said .
AP also reports that Rep. Heath Shuler – a Blue Dog Democrat from North Carolina , no raving lefty – says he heard the slurs too .
That 's four congressmen vs. Breitbart and his tea -party bullies .
Which story do you believe ?
He says his videos are n't conclusive proof on his site .
Really , you Richard Nixon wannabe .
Then WTF are they on your site for you ?
I met with Barney Frank last week and he backed up the claims of hatred that happened to him and told me that he was indeed called a faggot .
Hey Andrew , bring over the 100 K to my house .
We have mutual friends that can set it up .
I 'm here waiting to collect it and I 'll deliver the money to John Lewis .
James O'Keefe has a good mentor .
does n't he ?

The Office ’s Steve Carell talks to Access Hollywood about the possibility of leaving the show next year .
April 28 , 2010
BBC Radio recently interviewed Steve Carell and Tina Fey about their film Date Night .
At the end of the interview , Steve is asked about The Office :
Question : How long will you stay with The Office for ?
How many more series ?
How long does your contract run ?
Steve : Contract through next season .
Question :
And will you stay after that ?
Steve : I do n’t think so .
I think that will probably be my last year .
Here is a clip of that portion of the interview :
The length of Steve ’s contract with The Office has been previously reported here and here , but this is the first time Steve has actually talked about leaving .

A correspondent e-mailed me about his belief that credit market valuations are more than a big dubious .
For instance , subordinated tranches of commercial real estate bonds , which at the lows of last year were trading at 30 cents on the dollar are now at 90 cents .
He thinks ( and this is a space he knows ) that a lot of it will go to 5 cents on the dollar .
This is an extreme example of liquidity - charged valuations versus projected future fundamentals , aka the greater fool school of investing .
But at a price of 90 , how much upside is there , even on a greater fool thesis ?
Jeremy Grantham , in his April newsletter ( hat tip reader Richard A ) also sees evidence of frothiness :
So now , Bernanke begs us to speculate , and we are obedient .
Despite being hammered down twice in 10 years and getting punished for speculating , we again pick ourselves up off of the canvas and get back into the good fi ght .
Such persistence is unprecedented – 20 years for each really painful experience has been the normal recovery time – but Uncles Ben and Alan have treated us so well in these two disasters that , with hindsight , they do n’t feel so bad after all .
Yes , the market is still down a lot in over 10 years and on our data is likely to have a second consecutive very poor decade , but we have had two wonderful recoveries in which the more speculative you were , the more money you made .
So why not break the historical rules and try a third time ?
Perhaps this time it will be lucky .
Still , it does seem inefficient for the Fed to help us up and then lead us off the cliff again .
And to do it twice seems like sadism .
And for us to play the game once more seems like lining up behind hot stoves and begging , “ Please , can I burn my hand a third time ? ”
Investors used to be more pain averse .
It used to be “ once bitten , twice shy . ”
This time , surely it should be “ twice bitten , once bloody shy ! ”
The key shift seems to be the confi dence we now have in Bernanke ’s soldiering on with low rates and moral hazard to the bitter end , if necessary , cliff or no cliff .
The concept of moral hazard has changed .
It
used to be a vague expression of intent : “ If anything goes wrong , I will help you if I can . ”
It seems to have been transmuted into a cast - iron commitment .
The Fed seems to be pledging that it will bail us out after every flood .
All that is lacking is a rainbow !
Speculators are not stupid .
They see that after each crash , a long , artifi cial period of low rates and easy financial borrowing has been delivered .
They see that Bernanke is an unreconstructed Greenspanite in that he refuses to address bubbles , but will leap to help ease the pain should a bubble break .
With asymmetry like that , why not speculate ?
And so another bubble appears and then another .
This time , the
recovery for the total market was 80 % in one year , second only to 1932 , and the really speculative stocks are almost double the market , as they also were in 1932 .
But frankly 1932 was far worse than our crisis where , according to our research , only 7 % of the market value of speculative stocks remained , compared with 35 % this time .
Back then , they deserved that kind of rally .
And even though I guessed last
April that we would have a quick rally to 1100 , this looks quite likely to be far more .
Introduction to the ICBM Salvage Proposal
_________ by J.R. Mooneyham _________
( Free JavaScripts provided by The JavaScript Source )
I came up with the ICBM Salvage Proposal in a fit of anger and disbelief , sparked by a CNN Headline News report I saw on or about Oct. 18 , 1991 .
The report said the Bush administration had proposed melting down all the ICBMs into ink pens for charity .
I immediately wrote everyone I could think of , including Bush , various journalists , and certain Congressmen , pointing out another alternative ( as outlined in this FLUX article ) .
The dissappointing response I received for these initial efforts spurred me to greater action .
I composed a 16 inch by 21 inch poster about the subject and mailed it out to a couple of hundred different people and organizations around the nation , over the next year .
As should be obvious from this article ( which is mostly a derivation of that poster 's graphics and text ) , my presentation was highly critical of the Bush Administration and NASA , due to their positions on the subject .
What is the status of all the significant elements involved as of today ( 3 - 1 - 93 ) ?
The Whole Earth Review 's Spring 92 issue carried one of my early letters .
There was also a seemingly related editorial in an issue of OMNI magazine , by Ben Bova ( a member of one of the groups I shipped posters to ) .
George Bush was defeated in the election .
And a small startup company called Kontinental Astro - Transport International ( KATI ) , dedicated to essentially carrying out an ICBM Salvage plan of their own , was born in Virginia .
( They recently invited me to accompany them on a related flight to Russia . )
Do n't get the wrong idea , however .
Things are far from settled on this front .
KATI is primarily composed of American sci fi fans / engineers , and Eastern European engineers thrown out of work by the turmoil over there .
So they 're all struggling heroically to convert old Cold War surplus into New World assets .
Also , one of the last things the Bush Administration tried to do before leaving office was kill off this tiny enterprise ( and others like it ) entirely .
Write your Congressman !
Do n't let the guys at the top waste more than a trillion dollars worth of assets that could be used to revitalize both the American and global economies .
Do n't forget that government policies imposed from the top ( Presidential or Congressional levels ) often have a life and momentum of their own , long after the guys responsible for them have left office .
Bush set a lot of things in motion before he left that could result in the complete or near total loss of all these launchers for use in practical space development projects .
As a result , mankind 's leap into space could be set back by a century or more .
After examining the full content of the proposal , I hope you 'll decide to add your voice to mine in this matter .

More on the Rational Plan
by J.R. Mooneyham
2400 ICBMs could put into orbit an estimated 3 , 000 tons of assorted satellites , robotic platforms , or space station components within the next three to six years , at a huge discount over the past .
This would be roughly the equivalent of thirty Skylabs * , each equipped with its own Apollo class command / service module .
The previous illustration , depicting Skylab over a background 30 similar stations , accurately portrays the quantity of equipment these missiles could put into orbit .
About forty percent of these missiles are in the U.S. arsenal .
The rest are in the Soviet store .
The Soviets are in desperate need of hard currency .
Therefore , it would make sense for America and Western Europe to ' buy ' the Soviet missiles for their own use .
One arrangement might net us ( the U.S. ) approximately 1700 missiles total ( 700 Soviet rockets plus our own 1000 ) and Europe 700 , if the supply were divided evenly .
The greatest historic obstacle to space exploitation has now been removed :
The greatest barrier to cost - effective space development has always been the high cost of orbit - capable launchers .
Now we have hundreds or thousands of surplus ICBM rockets becoming available for the task , already bought , paid for , and manufactured .
Orbiting factories could give national Earth - side installations an edge over foreign competitors :
" Super computers " on - a - chip manufactured in space could be brought back Earthside and embedded in American products across - the - board , making our goods " smarter " and more versatile than those of other nations .
Even better , our Earthside facilities would require little or no modifications to benefit from this plan .
A long term boost to global economic growth and technological innovation :
Using the ICBM rocket power to install an industrial base in orbit would present long term benefits as well .
The space shuttle / space truck would at last have a practical mission and destination .
Space development overall could be accelerated by decades , indirectly quickening the pace of global innovation generally , with all the benefits that implies for everyone .
A way to ease the conversion of defense industries to consumer oriented markets :
The creation of two dozen or more large space platforms and all their various support equipment would require significant work from many defense related industries ; this new work would help to soften the pain of transition to consumer goods , triggered by the end of the Cold War .
Please help save our future .
Do n't let the ICBMs be melted down for ink pens .
By simply spreading the word about all this , you could help prevent it from happening . 
More on Bushs Plan
by J.R. Mooneyham
On or about Oct. 18 , 1991 , CNN Headline News reported the Bush administration had proposed melting down all the ICBMs into ink pens for charity .
The author of this article ( see " Introduction to the ICBM Salvage Proposal " ) immediately wrote everyone he could think of , including Bush , pointing out the other alternative ( see " More on the Rational Plan " ) .
The author was then informed by several parties , which included NASA and the Defense Department , that allowing such use of these surplus ICBMs would hurt certain companies that produce rockets today , by reducing their sales for at least two or three years ( After that , of course , sales would actually be boosted by the presence of factories in orbit , and the fact that the inventory of missiles would run out . ) .
NASA admits recycling the ICBMs could work ; but they 're opposed to the idea anyway :
Mr. Arnold D. Aldrich , Associate Administrator for Space Systems Development at NASA , in a letter dated Dec. 13 , 1991 , said of the ICBMs ...... "
They may potentially offer relatively low - cost access to space for some users . "
He also states that ... " Another key consideration is that some U.S. entrepreneurial firms have made considerable investments in the last decade in the development of new commercial space launch vehicles incorporating modern technology .
These firms worry that the infusion of large numbers of surplus missile stages into the launch market would jeopardize their investments ... " .
The author was also informed that the Department of Defense and NASA are working up a set of recommendations for the government on what to do with these " surplus missile stages " .
NASA has a record of killing proposals for alternative launching systems .
It did it years ago to protect the Space Shuttle program itself from possible competition .
It will doubtless do it again , regardless of the possible benefits for taxpayers that could be garnered from such a recycling of a trillion dollars worth of equipment ( roughly the total amount spent by the U.S. and the Soviet Union over forty years of development and procurement to build the ICBM fleets . ) .
Short - sighted officials at NASA and billion dollar defense contractors would rather throw away a trillion dollars worth of our future than endure even a brief reduction in budgets or prestige due to the existence of an ICBM - based space development project .
Since the ICBMs could possibly present a competitive threat to NASA and some wealthy defense contractors for two to six years ( remember , the missile inventory would run out fairly quickly in an ambitious development project ) , there 's little doubt what NASA and the defense contractors ' lobbyists on capitol hill will recommend .
Please help save our future .
Do n't let the ICBMs be melted down for ink pens .
By simply spreading the word about all this , you could help prevent it from happening . 
Contacting Kontinental Astro-Transport International
This information may be out of date by the time you get it .
But here 's the best information available at the time of publication .
The Constitution of Kontinental Astro- Transport International :
Purpose :
To provide commercial , civilian , and scientific clients with space launch services by an international joint - venture import company .
Methods :
In general , the company acquires retired - from - service mobile military rockets currently being removed from the arsenal of the former Soviet Union .
These are still in operable condition ; only the warheads are removed .
Solid fuel vehicles such as the SS - 16 and SS - 20 are preferred to reduce the number of servicing vehicles and crew personnel required .
The launch teams will preferably be hired from retired members of the same teams that maintained and trained to launch these vehicles while in active service .
Advantages :
1. Almost infinitely more launch sites and times become available , since these mobile launchers are designed to launch from unprepared sites on short notice , and can be shipped worldwide .
2. Proven , rugged hardware is used instead of experimental prototypes .
3. Proven launch and servicing procedures are used by personnel who have logged time - on - type .
4 . Assets that are currently planned to be wasted will generate profit , and greatly contribute to low - cost access to space .
5 . After launch , the transporters retain considerable resale value as airport utility or construction vehicles .

Science & Exploration Venus is alive – geologically speaking
08/04/2010 6682 views 16 likes
ESA ’s Venus Express has returned the clearest indication yet that Venus is still geologically active .
Relatively young lava flows have been identified by the way they emit infrared radiation .
The finding suggests the planet remains capable of volcanic eruptions .
It has long been recognised that there are simply not enough craters on Venus .
Something is wiping the planet ’s surface clean .
That something is thought to be volcanic activity but the question is whether it happens quickly or slowly ?
Is there some sort of cataclysmic volcanic activity that resurfaces the entire planet with lava , or a gradual sequence of smaller volcanic eruptions ?
New results suggest the latter .
“ Now we have strong evidence right at the surface for recent eruptions , ” says Sue Smrekar , a scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
The volcanic peak Idunn Mons
That strong evidence comes in the form of compositional differences compared to the surrounding landscape in three volcanic regions .
The data were collected by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer ( VIRTIS ) on ESA ’s Venus Express spacecraft , which has been orbiting the planet since April 2006 .
VIRTIS records the brightness of surface rocks , providing an estimate of ‘ emissivity ’ .
In 2008 , Jörn Helbert and Nils Müller , Institute of Planetary Research , German Aerospace Center , Berlin and co-authors on this new work , published a map of the variation of infrared emissivity across the southern hemisphere of Venus .
Dr Smrekar and her colleagues targeted three regions that geologically resemble Hawaii , well known for its active volcanism .
They show that the regions on Venus have higher emissivities than their surroundings , indicating different compositions .
On Earth , lava flows react rapidly with oxygen and other elements in the atmosphere , changing their composition .
On Venus , the process should be similar , though more intense because of the hotter , denser atmosphere , chiefly of carbon dioxide .
Artist 's impression of Venus Express spacecraft
The researchers interpret the fact that the lava flows appear to have different compositions from their surroundings as being evidence of a lack of surface weathering , indicating that the flows erupted relatively recently .
They estimate that the flows are possibly as geologically recent as 2 500 000 years – and likely much less , possibly even currently active .
“ This is a significant result , ” says Håkan Svedhem , ESA Venus Express Project Scientist .
Whilst the gradual resurfacing scenario might not be the most spectacular , it does make Venus look a little more Earth - like .
“ There are some intriguing models of how Venus could have completely covered itself in kilometres of volcanic lava in a short time , but they require that the interior of Venus behaves very differently from Earth .
If volcanism is more gradual , this implies that the interior may behave more like Earth , though without plate tectonics , ” says Dr Smrekar .
Flattr will funnel cash to sites to reward their work
One of the founders of the Pirate Bay is kicking off a venture that aims to help websites generate cash .
Called Flattr , the micropayments system revolves around members paying a fixed monthly fee .
At the end of each month that cash will be divided among participating sites a Flattr member wants to reward .
Members might want to reward a band that made a track they liked , the author of a story they enjoyed or a site that gave useful advice .
Participating sites will sport a Flattr button in the same way that many have clickable icons that let visitors send information to friends or refer something they find interesting to sites such as Digg and Redditt .
" The money you pay each month will be spread evenly among the buttons you click in a month , " said Peter Sunde .
" We want to encourage people to share money as well as content , " Mr Sunde told BBC News .
" It 's a test to see if this might be a working method for real micropayments . "
The minimum Flattr wants people to pay each month is 2 euros ( £ 1.73 ) but members can pay more if they want to .
" That way you have control over your monthly spending on content , and you can rather help many people than just a few , " he said .
Many micropayment systems had not proved popular , he said , because they were too cumbersome to use regularly .
Mr Sunde said he hoped it proved popular among the vast number of niche sites run by passionate amateurs that have a small , dedicated audience but which struggle to cover their operating costs .
Initially , Flattr plans to take a 10 % cut of any cash paid as an administration fee .
But , said Mr Sunde , it hopes to push that percentage lower as people sign up .
" We 're not really in this for becoming rich , " he said .
" We 're doing it to change things and making people get money they never got before . "
" I know that people are nice enough , " he said .
" People love things and they want to pay . "
Flattr is currently in a closed trial but hopes to be ready to launch by the end of March 2010 .
It is seeking partners looking to generate some cash from their content .
Mr Sunde said the idea for Flattr came to him about five years ago but could not pursue it because of " other things that took massive amounts of time " .
" I wanted to find a one - click way to pay for content , " he said .
" I wanted it to be based on the idea that different people have different financial situations , " he told the BBC .
" So doing it in a flat rate manner was the only way . "
The " other things " included The Pirate Bay website that pointed people towards copyrighted content such as music tracks and videos .
Mr Sunde and three other administrators of the site were pursued in Sweden 's courts by film and video game makers .
In April 2009 , the four were found guilty of aiding copyright theft and were sentenced to one year in prison and fined 2.7 m euros ( £ 2.35 m ) .
Final appeals from both sides of the case are due to be heard in early 2010 .

A prehistoric town that had remained untouched beneath the ground near Syria for 6,000 years is now revealing clues about the first cities in the Middle East prior to the invention of the wheel .
The town , called Tell Zeidan , dates from between 6000 B.C. and 4000 B.C. , and immediately preceded the world 's first urban civilizations in the ancient Middle East .
It is one of the largest sites of the Ubaid culture in northern Mesopotamia .
Now archaeologists from the University of Chicago 's Oriental Institute and their Syrian colleagues are studying the town , which sits below a mound in an area of irrigated fields at the junction of the Euphrates and Balikh Rivers in what is now northern Syria .
So far , they have unearthed evidence of the society 's trade in obsidian and production and development of copper processing , as well as the existence of a social elite that used stone seals to mark ownership of goods and culturally significant items .
The evidence here supports what archaeologists had long surmised , that the Ubaid people were among the first in the Middle East to experience division of social groups according to power and wealth .
" The project addresses questions not only of how such societies emerged but how they were sustained and flourished , " said John Yellen , program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation , which provided funding for the research .
The town 's location was at the crossroads of major , ancient trade routes in Mesopotamia that followed the course of the Euphrates River valley .
The Ubaid period lasted from about 5300 B.C. to 4000 B.C .
" This enigmatic period saw the first development of widespread irrigation , agriculture , centralized temples , powerful political leaders and the first emergence of social inequality as communities became divided into wealthy elites and poorer commoners , " said Gil Stein , director of the Oriental Institute and a leader of the expedition that uncovered the site .
Stein added that the research " provides insight into how complex societies , based on linkages which extended across hundreds of miles , developed , " said Yellen , noting the distance travelled for raw materials needed for many of the Tell Zeidan artifacts .
For example , copper ore was carried by workers from sources near modern - day Diyarbakir , Turkey , about 185 to 250 miles away , then smelted at Tell Zeidan to produce metal tools and other implements .
One of the most remarkable finds was a stone stamp seal depicting a deer that was carved from a red stone not native to the area , Stein said .
A similar seal design was found 185 miles to the east near Mosul in northern Iraq .
" The existence of very elaborate seals with near - identical motifs at such widely distant sites suggests that in this period , high - ranking elites were assuming leadership positions across a very broad region , and those dispersed elites shared a common set of symbols and perhaps even a common ideology of superior social status , " said Stein .
Stein said the location 's potential for further discoveries is so great the project is likely to last for decades .

The statement said that “ investigators could not conclusively determine how or when the women died , due to lack of forensic evidence ” but that they had nonetheless “ concluded that the women were accidentally killed as a result of the joint force firing at the men . ”
“ We deeply regret the outcome of this operation , accept responsibility for our actions that night , and know that this loss will be felt forever by the families , ” said Brig .
Gen. Eric Tremblay , a spokesman for the NATO command in Kabul .
The admission was an abrupt about - face .
In a statement soon after the raid , NATO had claimed that its raiding party had stumbled upon the “ bodies of three women who had been tied up , gagged and killed ” and hidden in a room in the house .
Military officials had also said later that the bodies showed signs of puncture and slashing wounds from a knife , and that the women appeared to have been killed several hours before the raid .
And in what would be a scandalous turn to the investigation , The Times of London reported Sunday night that Afghan investigators also determined that American forces not only killed the women but had also “ dug bullets out of their victims ’ bodies in the bloody aftermath ” and then “ washed the wounds with alcohol before lying to their superiors about what happened . ”
A spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry , Zemary Bashary , said that he did not have any information about the Afghan investigation , which he said remained unfinished .
In an interview , a NATO official said the Afghan - led investigation team alerted American and NATO commanders that the inquiry had found signs of evidence tampering .
A briefing was given by investigators to General McChrystal and other military officials in late March .
“ There was evidence of tampering at the scene , walls being washed , bullets dug out of holes in the wall , ” the NATO official said , adding that investigators “ could n’t find bullets from the wounds in the body . ”
Thick ash poured from Iceland 's Eyjafjallaj�kull volcano when the MODIS on NASA�s Aqua satellite acquired this image on April 17 , 2010 .
The ash in this image is at two different altitudes .
A concentrated plume rises over a more diffuse cloud of ash , casting a dark shadow on the ash below .
The volcano had been emitting ash in puffs that reached between 16,000 and 24,000 feet , according to the Icelandic Met Office .
The higher plume seen here is likely from a more explosive event .
This explosive phase of eruption began on April 14 , according to a summary from the Nordic Volcanological Center .
Unlike the initital activity , these eruptions occurred at vents that opened under the ice at the summit caldera .
As the heat from the magma melts the ice , pulsing floods have escaped from beneath the ice cap , carrying rocks and mud .
As of April 19 , the ash plumes were reported to be getting smaller , but they were still creating havoc with air travel in Europe .

As of today , Stack Overflow is now officially using a distributed version control system .
Specifically , Mercurial , as hosted through Fog Creek ’s Kiln service .
While we were n’t unhappy with Subversion , we were n’t married to it , and we needed to switch anyway so we can easily share code with the team in NYC .
There ’s nothing quite as corrosive to worldwide programming collaboration as being on different source control systems .
If you ’re new to distributed version control , first you should check out Joel ’s excellent Mercurial tutorial at Hg Init .
At this point , you may be wondering : should you switch to a distributed version control system , too ?
I think you should dabble in it , absolutely , as there ’s no question that it represents the future of all source control .
But let ’s not kid ourselves : the tools are still a bit .. raw .
Particularly if you ’re a GUI - loving wussy girly man like myself .
We had gotten a bit spoiled by the excellence and maturity of TortoiseSVN and VisualSVN on Windows .
There are Mercurial equivalents , of course :
TortoiseHg Windows Explorer shell extension
VisualHg Visual Studio plugin
But , as I said … raw .
Raw is definitely the operative word here .
DVCS has n’t crossed the chasm yet , so if you buy in now , you ’re still on the visionary edge of software development .
This can be a fun place to be , as it ’s where all the innovation is typically happening , but there are … tradeoffs .
Painting in very , very broad strokes — warning : massive oversimplifications ahead ! —
I ’d say that :
If you are still using SourceSafe , get the hell off my lawn .
If you are unhappy with your current source control system , definitely begin researching your DVCS upgrade options .
No time to get started like the present !
If you are happy with your current source control system , read Why Git is Better than X , substituting “ my source control system ” with X . ( While there are differences between Mercurial and Git , the differences are not hugely significant any more ; they are basically the Pepsi and Coke of DVCS . )
Do you see anything on this list that you feel strongly about ?
Does anything in this comparison directly address any daily pain points for you and your team ?
If so , then you should look deeper into DVCS .
There is one thing you do want to watch out for — eventually , teams adapt their behavior to the software they ’re using .
Without even realizing that they ’re doing so .
If I had to pick one word to summarize the benefits of DVCS , I ’d say that word is flexibility .
DVCS is way more flexible than centralized source control .
So if you learn some DVCS , you might just find that it unlocks a new , more productive way for your team to “ get things done ” , as they say .
At least 114 miners pulled from flooded shaft after rescue workers heard sounds confirming they were alive four days ago
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
More than 100 Chinese miners were rescued today after being trapped for over a week in a flooded coalmine .
Hundreds of rescue workers who had almost given up hope cheered and hugged each other as the first miners were taken out shortly after midnight .
" A miracle has finally happened , " a rescue spokesman , Liu Dezheng , told reporters .
A live state television broadcast counted the number of survivors brought above ground as 114 , at 2.15 pm local time ( 6.15 am GMT ) , as the first survivors wrapped in blankets were hurried to waiting ambulances that rushed to nearby hospitals .
The stream of rescued miners started about two hours later .
Thousands of family members awaiting news and other onlookers stood along the road , bursting into applause as the ambulances sped by .
" This is probably one of the most amazing rescues in the history of mining anywhere , " said David Feickert , a coal mine safety adviser to the Chinese government .
A total of 153 miners had been trapped for eight days in the unfinished Wangjialing mine in Xiangning , Shanxi province , after it filled with water last Sunday .
The government had mobilised 3,000 rescue workers to pump out water and search for the miners , but hopes of anyone emerging alive appeared slim until rescuers heard knocking on Friday .
After frantic pumping the water level dropped low enough for rescue workers to enter the shaft .
Families of the survivors were thrilled .
" He called and managed to say my sister 's nickname , Xiaomi , so we know it 's really him and that he 's alive , " said Long Liming , who said he received a call from his rescued brother - in - law Fu Ziyang .
A doctor then took the phone and said Fu had to rest , Long said .
" He was trapped underground for so long , so he 's very weak .
But we are very relieved to know that he made it out safely . "
It was unclear how deep into the mine the rescued workers had been found .
" The miners in the lowest levels will be in the most extreme danger , " Feickert said .
" Just think of a tall building , with people on different floors , if that suddenly filled up with water . "
Some of the soaked miners had hung from shaft walls by their belts for days to avoid falling into the water when asleep .
Hundreds of rescuers were underground amid hopes that glimpses of swinging lights and new tapping sounds meant that there were even more survivors .
Liu said the first batch of nine rescued miners were in stable condition .
The state - run Xinhua news agency said all nine were conscious and could say their names and home towns , but their bodies had suffered from being soaked for so long .
Television footage showed at least one miner being brought out barefoot .
Liu Qiang , a medical officer , said the survivors had hypothermia , severe dehydration and skin infections from being in the water so long .
Some also were in shock and had low blood pressure .
A preliminary investigation last week found that the mine 's managers ignored water leaks before the accident , the state administration of work safety said .
China 's coalmines are the world 's deadliest .
Last year 2,631 miners in China died in accidents – down from 6,995 deaths in 2002 , which was the most dangerous year on record according to the state administration of coalmine safety .

Older LGBT
Americans have been largely invisible until very recently .
Yet they make up a significant and growing share of the LGBT and over 65 populations .
LGBT elders are gaining visibility with the aging of LGBT Baby Boomers , who are the first generation of LGBT people to have lived openly gay or transgender lives in large numbers .
These individuals confront all the same challenges of people who age .
But they also face unique barriers and inequalities that stem from the effects of social stigmas and prejudice , their reliance on informal “ families of choice ” for care and support , and inequitable laws and programs that treat LGBT elders unequally .
These barriers can prevent LGBT elders from achieving three key elements of successful aging : financial security , good health and health care , and social support and community engagement .
That ’s why Services and Advocacy for Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual , & Transgender Elders and the Movement Advancement Project recently released “ Improving the Lives of LGBT Older Adults ” in partnership with the Center for American Progress , the American Society on Aging , and the National Senior Citizens Law Center , which provides an overview of LGBT elders ’ unique needs and the policy and regulatory changes that are needed to adequately address them .
Challenges for LGBT elders
The report outlines three unique circumstances that make successful aging more difficult for LGBT elders than for their heterosexual counterparts :
The effects of social stigma and prejudice , past and present .
Historical prejudice against today ’s LGBT elders has disrupted their lives , their connections to their families of origin , their chances at having and raising their own children , and their opportunities to earn a living and save for retirement .
This prejudice also impedes full and equal access to important health and community services , programs , and opportunities .
Historical prejudice against today ’s LGBT elders has disrupted their lives , their connections to their families of origin , their chances at having and raising their own children , and their opportunities to earn a living and save for retirement .
This prejudice also impedes full and equal access to important health and community services , programs , and opportunities .
Reliance on informal “ families of choice ” for social connections , care , and support .
Family members provide about 80 percent of long - term care in the United States , and more than two - thirds of adults who receive long - term care at home depend on family members as their only source of help .
Yet LGBT elders are more likely to be single , childless , and estranged from biological family and therefore must often rely on friends and community members as their chosen family .
Official policies , laws , and institutional regulations and practices generally prioritize legal and biological family , and in many instances deny caregivers who do not fall into traditional categories the resources and recognition afforded to opposite - sex spouses and biological family members .

Official policies , laws , and institutional regulations and practices generally prioritize legal and biological family , and in many instances deny caregivers who do not fall into traditional categories the resources and recognition afforded to opposite - sex spouses and biological family members .
Inequitable laws and programs fail to address — or create extra barriers to — social acceptance , financial security , and better health and well - being for LGBT elders .
Safety net programs and laws intended to support and protect older Americans fail to provide equal protection for LGBT elders .
This is largely because they either do not acknowledge or do not provide protections for LGBT elders ’ partners and families of choice , and because they fail to recognize and address the ongoing stigma and discrimination that result in substandard treatment of LGBT elders .
The challenges identified above diminish LGBT elders ’ prospects for successful aging by making it harder to secure financial security ; good health and health care ; and social and community support .
Financial security
LGBT elders as a group are poorer and less financially secure than older Americans as a whole .
Financial instability comes from a lifetime of discrimination combined with major laws and safety net programs that fail to protect and support LGBT elders in the same way they do heterosexual elders .
Data show the grim effects of this unequal treatment — lesbian couples receive an average of 31.5 percent less in Social Security , and gay couples receive 17.8 percent less when compared to heterosexual couples .
Barriers
Social Security .
LGBT elders pay into Social Security just like their heterosexual peers , yet they are not equally eligible for Social Security benefits .
The biggest difference in treatment is that committed same - sex couples are denied the substantial spousal and survivor benefits provided to married couples .
Medicaid and long - term care .
Medicaid is the largest funder of long - term care in the United States .
Medicaid has exemptions for married heterosexual couples to avoid requiring a healthy spouse to sell a shared home or to live in poverty to qualify an ill spouse for long - term care .
But these spousal impoverishment protections do not apply to same - sex couples and families of choice .
Tax - qualified retirement plans .
There have been some positive changes in the law in recent years , but LGBT elders still lack the same benefits as their heterosexual peers when it comes to the treatment of IRAs and similar plans .
For example , surviving heterosexual spouses can leave inherited retirement accounts to grow tax free until they reach age 70 and a half , but “ non-spouse ” beneficiaries cannot .
Employee pensions and defined - benefit plans .
Employer policies regarding the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and Qualified Pre-retirement Survivor Annuity deprive same - sex couples of needed financial protections for a surviving partner or chosen family member , though these protections are available for heterosexual spouses .
Retiree health insurance benefits .
Federal tax law currently allows an employer to provide health insurance to the heterosexual spouse of an employee or retired employee as a tax - free benefit , but for same - sex couples , a partner ’s insurance benefits are treated as taxable income .
Estate taxes and inheritance laws .
The federal government allows a surviving heterosexual spouse to inherit all of the couple ’s assets without incurring any tax penalty , but federal and state laws require same - sex partners to pay inheritance taxes on some estates .
LGBT elders in most cases must put in place a series of specific and often expensive legal arrangements to try to ensure that financial decision making and inheritance will pass to a partner or member of a family of choice .
Veterans ’ benefits .
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides a variety of benefits to veterans ’ heterosexual spouses , including pensions paid to the spouse of a service member killed in combat , medical care , and home loan guarantees .
These benefits are not available to a same - sex partner .
Solutions
Legal recognition of same - sex relationships at both the state and federal level would address many of the inequities in government safety net programs for LGBT Americans .
Yet government should also examine broader approaches given the uncertain timeline associated with this approach , coupled with the fact that it still would not help the vast majority of single LGBT elders .
Congress could address many inequities at the federal level by adding and defining a category of person who is not a spouse ( such as a permanent partner ) who would receive equal treatment to a spouse under various federal laws and safety net programs for older people .
The full - length report outlines broad state - level recommendations to advance equality on Medicaid rules , pension and domestic partnership benefits , estate and inheritance taxes , and more .
Many of the state - level fixes are similar to the federal recommendation of establishing a “ permanent partner ” category to applicable state laws .
Health
Health and health care become increasingly important issues for people as they age .
But LGBT elders often find it more difficult than others to receive the health care .
Barriers
LGBT elders ’ health disparities are overlooked and ignored .
Governments and service providers rarely track , and are largely unaware of , LGBT elders ’ health disparities .
For example , LGBT elders are more likely to delay getting needed care , and they have higher rates of chronic certain physical and mental conditions .
There is limited government and social support for families of choice .
LGBT elders rely on family - of - choice caregivers , who generally do not receive the same legal or social recognition as biological family caregivers .
Health care environments often are inhospitable to LGBT elders .
Many professional caregivers are not accepting of , or trained to work with , LGBT elders .
These providers may be hostile , discriminatory , or simply unaware that LGBT elders exist .
Nursing homes often fail to protect LGBT elders .
Nursing home rules , together with prejudice and hostile treatment on the part of staff and fellow patients , can create unwelcoming environments for elders who are unable to advocate for themselves .
Visitation policies and medical decision - making laws often exclude families of choice .
LGBT elders ’ partners or other loved ones may be shut out of medical decision making or denied visitation unless they have complex and often expensive legal arrangements in place .
Solutions
There is no one catch - all approach for solving LGBT elders ’ health inequities given the sheer size of the U.S. health care system and the complex network of state and federal laws that regulate it .
Helping LGBT and other elders achieve good health and health care requires strategies ranging from training and education for health care providers to state and local advocacy such as passing nondiscrimination laws that include protections for LGBT elders , and changing state laws to more clearly recognize partners and families of choice for care giving and medical decision making .
Social support and community engagement
Social isolation is higher among older LGBT adults than in the general population of elders despite a high level of resilience and strong connections to families of choice .
LGBT elders are more likely to live alone and more likely to feel or actually be unwelcome in many health care , social service , and community settings .
Research shows the harmful effects of this type of social isolation and denial of services and support , including higher depression , poverty , rehospitalization , delayed care - seeking , poor nutrition and premature mortality .
Successful aging for LGBT elders depends on reducing their social isolation and increasing access to the services that are available to other older people .
Barriers
LGBT elders lack support from , and feel unwelcome in , mainstream aging programs .
LGBT people often feel unwelcome at senior centers , volunteer centers , or places of worship .
Few such agencies engage in outreach to LGBT elders , nor are they prepared to address incidents of discrimination toward LGBT elders by staff and older people .
LGBT elders lack support from , and feel unwelcome in , the broader LGBT community .
Several authors have commented that ageism is particularly strong within gay male communities .
Researchers have also found that many older LGBT people feel disconnected from or unwelcome by younger generations of LGBT people .
LGBT advocates and organizations are becoming more intentional about reaching out to , involving , and harnessing LGBT elders ’ talents , but there is still a great deal of work to be done to build bridges within the LGBT community .
LGBT elders lack sufficient opportunities to contribute and volunteer .
Many LGBT older people are , or have the potential to be , powerful advocates for change .
Becoming active provides great value to the community at large , and can reduce social isolation and provide a sense of purpose .
Adults who volunteer regularly have better physical and mental health and a lower risk of mortality .
Yet older adults as a whole lack sufficient opportunities for community engagement , and LGBT elders often feel unwelcome in , or are overlooked as potential volunteers for , existing volunteer programs .
Elder advocacy opportunities are extremely limited .
Housing discrimination adds to the challenges LGBT elders face in connecting to their communities .
LGBT elders may be denied housing , including residency in mainstream retirement communities , based on their sexual orientation and gender identity and expression .
This discrimination may separate LGBT elders from loved friends or partners , or push them into homelessness .
LGBT elders may also feel the need to re-enter or stay in the closet in order to obtain or maintain housing .
Solutions
Helping LGBT elders secure social support and community engagement requires action on many fronts .
The Older Americans
Act must be revised to specifically recognize and address the needs of needs of LGBT older people when it goes up for reauthorization in 2011 .
Mainstream aging services providers need to provide training to staff in cultural competency , while LGBT advocates should offer more programming directed at LGBT elders as well as more opportunities for them to become involved in advocacy and service provision .
State and federal government should also strengthen laws to prevent discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation .
Conclusion
A growing number of openly LGBT elders will soon present new challenges and opportunities to the way our nation cares for and serves its older population .
Now is the time to make changes to laws , community services and attitudes , and health care practices to help elders improve their financial security , access culturally competent health care , and remain active and fully engaged members of their communities .
All Americans deserve the chance to age with dignity , and solutions that help LGBT elders do so will help all Americans who are aging or face inequality .

When it comes to curbing epidemics , it makes sense to understand social networks .
Figuring out who might have a disease and is most likely to spread it to others is essential to controlling an outbreak .
But scientists have n't had good ways to do that .
They often rely on unrealistic models that assume all people interact with each other with equal frequency .
Think of a bag of Shake 'n Bake : chances are all the pieces of meat will be coated with equal amounts of breadcrumbs simply because they 're tossed together .
Stanford researchers Marcel Salathe and James Holland Jones have come up with a better , more strategic way to track and curb the spread of disease that reflects real - life relationships .
Developing an algorithm and testing it on Facebook data , they 've figured out how to identify the social interactions between communities -- the relationships most likely to link one group to another and get more people sick .
Their " community bridge finder " algorithm is presented in a paper published in the April 8 edition of PLoS Computational Biology .
The model takes into account community structure , social networks and the fact that tightly knit groups are often connected by just a few individuals -- ideas that seem obvious but have not been applied by epidemiologists .
" If there 's a disease popping around a community with only one road out of town , then chances of it randomly making its way to another tightly knit community are pretty low , " said Jones , an assistant professor of anthropology .
" The more roads there are out of town , the more likely it is that the disease will get out and spread .
So the key is to find those roads and shut them down . "
The Facebook data Salathe and Jones used to test their theory comes from 2005 , when the social networking site was available only to college students .
Tracking the relationships and interactions of students on five university campuses helped the researchers develop their mathematical model that recognizes clusters of people and predicts the likely bridges between them .
" When a new virus starts spreading , neither the time nor the necessary doses of vaccine to immunize everyone is available , " said Salathe , a postdoctoral fellow in biology .
" So you 'd want a strategy that allows you to protect a population as much as possible given the limited resources that you have .
Our analysis shows that targeting the bridges between communities is such a strategy , and the algorithm that we propose is an efficient way of finding those bridges . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - British author and atheist campaigner Richard Dawkins will try to have Pope Benedict arrested to face questions over the Catholic church ’s child abuse scandal when he visits Britain later this year , one of his lawyers said Sunday .
British author Richard Dawkins , who wrote The God Delusion , stands on a bus at the launch of an atheist advertising campaign , in London January 6 , 2008 .

Dawkins , a scientist and outspoken critic of religion , has asked human rights lawyers to examine whether charges could be brought against the pope .
The four - day trip , from September 16 to 19 , will be the first papal visit since Pope John Paul II ’s pastoral visit in 1982 and is the first official papal visit to Britain .
The Catholic church has rejected claims the pope helped to cover up abuse by priests and the Vatican has accused the media of waging a “ despicable campaign of defamation ” against him .
Dawkins and the English journalist Christopher Hitchens have commissioned lawyers Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens to explore ways of taking legal action against the pope .
In an email to Reuters , Stephens said there are three possible approaches : a complaint to the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands , a private or public prosecution “ for crimes against humanity ” or a civil case .
They will argue that the pope does not have diplomatic immunity from prosecution as a head of state because the Vatican has “ permanent observer status ” at the United Nations rather than full membership and voting rights .
Dawkins , author of “ The God Delusion ” and “ The Selfish Gene , ” told the Sunday Times newspaper that he suspected child abuse by church members had been covered up .
Hitchens , who published a book in 2007 called “ God Is Not Great : The Case Against Religion , ” said : “ This man is not above or outside the law .
The institutionalized concealment of child abuse is a crime under any law . ”
Critics have accused Benedict of negligence in handling abuse cases in previous roles as a cardinal in his native Germany , and in Rome .
The Vatican has denied any cover - up over the abuse of 200 deaf boys in the United States .
The pope has not commented directly on the wave of sexual abuse allegations that has shaken the church around the world , including the United States , Ireland , Italy and Germany .
Fun facts about heavyweight gossip columnist Cindy Adams :
She turned 80 this week .
She loves dogs and ending her columns with " Only in New York , kids . "
And she thinks women who complain about sexual harassment should just get over it .
Advertisement
The Huffington Post noticed that in Adams ' longrunning New York Post column ,
she weighed in on the defeated sexual harassment case of a reporter at a local television station .
Quoth Cindy ,
" Hey , we 've all been there .
Those things happened to every one us in our earlier days .
But that was before the world became so litigious .
We 've each endured some too tight hug or some slob whose hand wandered where it should n't .
Deal with it .
That 's what we did in our younger , prettier days .
Dealt with it .
In some cases , sticking a pen in the guy 's lower belly and whispering politely , ' Try that again , pal , and you 'll have to go to Emergency to pee , ' worked just fine . "

But when Adams talks about what happened in her " earlier days , " she seems to actually be talking about sexual assault , particularly in her first example :
I was maybe 10 .
In a highly respected elderly doctor 's Upper East Side examination room .
My mom had left for one second .
His hands began examining what was n't there for examining .
I pushed him away and never mentioned it to a soul .
Not anybody .
Until now .
And I still remember his name .
I was maybe 16 .
The office of a theatrical agent who had a Tiffany reputation .
He took me into a private room to test my voice .
And what he looked to test was not my voice .
I pushed him off and never mentioned it to anyone .
Until now .
And I still remember his name .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
And yet instead of targeting the men who victimized her , whose names she still remembers , she 's blaming our " litigious " culture .
She added , " Calling a lawyer to say , ' I 'm suing because this guy laid his hands on me ' ?
Oh , please , if that 's his only part he laid on you , get some nail extensions and inform Larry Lothario next time you 'll rake him like the leaves .
Deal with it . "
As much as we'd like to chalk up some of this to , ahem , advanced age , Adams is surely not alone in thinking that women who complain about sexual harassment are just whiners who need to get over it .
But it 's even more disturbing that the examples she brings up are actually sexual assault , beyond the classic " hostile work environment . "
The men who assaulted and / or harassed Adams when she was a child went unreported and unpunished ; the laws we have today are intended simply to protect today 's girls and women from such crimes .
It 's a shame Adams can't see any of this , simply because it 's " litigious . "

Cindy Adams : Female Sexual Harassment Victims Should ' Deal With It ' [ Huffington Post ]
Sexual Harassment : Deal With It [ NYP ]
So far , $ 9.3 million for researchers building robotic bees , $ 1.3 million to hunt for viruses that infect single - celled organisms , and $ 845,000 to study past climate change in Russia has been doled out .
The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) has been able to fund thousands of new research projects with money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) , aka the economic stimulus package , which was passed a year ago today .
But has this money been as much of a boon to the economy has it has been to science ?
When advocating for the bill last January , President Obama called for " investing in the science , research and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs , new discoveries and entirely new industries . "
Progress would not come immediately , he warned , but when he signed the bill , an unprecedented influx of funds funneled to agencies flush with project proposals but lacking the cash to back them .
This money set the grant - giving gears in motion , but the research pipeline itself can be prodigiously long .
Although barely a pipette drop of the full $ 787 - billion federal stimulus plan , the NSF 's $ 3 - billion portion of the package represented an almost 50 percent boost for its 2009 $ 6.5 - billion budget .
" That investment of $ 3 billion will have an immediate impact on investigators , postdocs , graduate and undergraduate students , and teachers throughout the nation , " the agency asserted on its Web site .
Indeed , in the past year , the NSF has allocated some $ 2.5 billion of its stimulus share , adding 4,599 research - based projects ( in addition to facility improvements and educational awards ) to its list of recipients .
Only about $ 136 million of that money has been spent , however .
That 's about 4.5 percent , which puts the NSF second to last among federal agencies in the percentage of stimulus allocation expended .
( The most expeditious spenders include the Social Security Administration and the Railroad Retirement Board , which have shelled out about 88 and 91 percent respectively , and the slowest has been the Department of the Treasury , having spent about 3.2 percent of its $ 89 billion . )
So where is all of the NSF 's stimulus money ?
It is in university and institutional bank accounts , from which funded researchers will gradually withdraw funds over the duration of multiyear grants and awards to pay for equipment and staff .
" The NSF has obligated that money , and it 's sitting in the accounts of the awardees , " explains Dana Topousis , an NSF spokesperson .
Picking the winners
But before even a single beaker could be bought , the NSF — a funding agency — had to decide which projects would get a piece of the new capital .
" NSF has never had enough money , " says Francesca Grifo , a senior scientist and director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
So , although the funds have been a booster for science , it and many other agencies are not set up to handle this processing load .
" It 's just hard to make the federal bureaucracy move fast , " she says .
Between 2003 and 2008 the NSF was able to fund only about a quarter of the research proposals it received .
But with the 2009 stimulus funds , that total reached 32 percent ( about what it had been with its standard operating budget in 2000 ) even though the numbers of proposals had increased by thousands .
Last year , the NSF received more than 45,200 proposals , so when the stimulus bill was passed , program officers gave another look to deserving proposals they had not previously had the resources to fund .
Some 80 percent of stimulus - backed awards went to projects that had been submitted prior to the act .
By contrast , the National Institutes of Health and many other agencies put out a call for new proposals .
NSF staffers made an effort to support investigators who had not previously been granted received awards , funding 2,352 new researchers — about a third of them through the ARRA .
But amidst fear of fraud and waste , the agency also had to work carefully to pick proposals that would make wise use of the money .
To make all these assessments , NSF staff members worked " around the clock " last summer to select the new awardees , the agency 's Topousis says .
Although the agency did not hire extra workers to assess all of the proposals on the receiving end , creating more jobs in the science community was a top priority .
" Most of our awards are saving jobs — or creating jobs for graduate and postdoc students , " Topousis says .
Some critics have argued that the glut of temporary , low - level research positions in academia have created an impasse in academic institutions , where few can break through to tenure - track jobs in which they can obtain big research grants and run their own laboratories .
But others note that in the short term , these positions are helping to translate money for science into a cash injection for the economy — and fast .
" It already does have the immediate impact to attract and hire staff , " says Amy Pienta , an associate research scientist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor who is using an ARRA - funded NSF grant to evaluate the stimulus 's impact on the social sciences .
Most of the awards may not be big enough to fund senior - level positions , she says , but many of them will " certainly " help hire " people who are on the front lines of a lot of the work — on data collection , data analysis . "
She offers as an example her own project , which will hire someone to do computer programming .
" We 're able to advertise in the community , " she says .
" That 's pretty immediate . "
The bottom line is that " universities hire , " Grifo says .
And the money — whether it creates a new full - time staff position or a part - time student opportunity — will be going directly to people " who are going to spend it to live , " Grifo says .
" They 're using that money immediately to pay their bills . "
She adds : " With graduate research fellowships in particular … it goes out there quickly . "
Not all of the money will stay inside of ivory tower walls .
A good chunk of NSF's Recovery Act funds ( some $ 354 million ) is going directly to construction expenses for labs and research vessels .
So those funds will funnel out more quickly , much like other government construction contracts , to pay for labor and materials .
Speed and accuracy
Despite the NSF 's efforts to quickly allocate most of its ARRA monies , science itself can take more time than many other government - funded endeavors .
More than $ 860 million in NSF awards do n't expire until 2012 or later , which means that the money will be slowly trickling into the economy for at least three years .
And some of the awards are as long as five years , the NSF 's Topousis notes .
Many in the research field assert that this is a good way to continuously support and stabilize the economy , but it might seem counter to Obama 's assertion that we should " spend our way out of this recession . "
And when compared with many of the other federal agencies , such as the National Endowment for the Arts ( which has spent more than 40 percent of its funds — and allocated all of it ) , the NSF seems to be far behind the trend .
Nevertheless , the NSF has made clear its stated commitment to getting money out into the economy expeditiously .
The agency approved the majority of its stimulus - backed projects by fall 2009 and warned investigators that " if after 12 months no allowable expenditures have taken place , NSF may consider reducing or terminating the award and reallocating the funds , " according to the agency 's Web site .
Keeping tabs on how this flood of funds is being used has proved to be a challenge for every government agency .
" The NSF is generally very thoughtful about how this money goes out the door , " Grifo says .
As of last fall , however , some $ 45.3 million from NSF 's Recovery
Act coffers had already been awarded to institutions that had unfulfilled audit recommendations ( suggesting , but not confirming , that some of the money has previously gone to groups with less - than - perfect track records ) .
The agency 's Office of the Inspector General also found that about $ 108 million had already gone to institutions it qualified as " deserving additional oversight . "
Of the $ 31 billion going to science in general ( to the NSF , NASA , the National Institutes of Health and others ) , the government 's Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board estimates some $ 2 billion is likely to be lost to fraud .
" Some of it 's going to be wasted , no question , " says Marc Goldwein , a senior policy analyst for the Fiscal Policy Program at the New America Foundation , nonpartisan public policy institute .
" It 's very difficult to spend a lot of money very fast , " Goldwein says .
" Economists are saying , ' Spend it really fast , ' and everyone else is saying , ' Spend it wisely . '
And it 's very hard to do both . "
In it for the long haul
The stimulus 's economic success is being measured by financial markets and unemployment reports .
But aside from statements of job creation and retention , how can the economic impact of science 's contributions be quantified ?
" Part of the problem is that it 's really hard to have good measurements of something until long after it's done , " Goldwein says .
And by the time most of the research projects wrap up , the stimulus funds will be long gone .
Therein lies the leap of faith in science 's eventual benefits — economic and otherwise .
" Some things really take five years , " Goldwein says of the longer - term research grants .
" It would be silly to give one year and cut them off . "
Knowing that another few years of funding are on the way can also give some researchers and administrators the confidence — and ability — to boost the economy more in the short term .
" If you expect money later , " Goldwein notes , " it can change how you act now . "
For example , if a scientist knows he or she will have ample funds to run a three - year project , they can offer a three - year position to a postdoc , who might then spend his or her discretionary income more liberally .
" There 's some economic logic " to it , Goldwein says .
" In a lot of sense , it 's administrative . "
Beyond boosting spending in the present , the science - bound stimulus money can be seen as a down payment for a stronger field down the road .
Even if most of the jobs are going to graduate students and postdocs , " those folks come out and you have an investment in their research abilities and their increased marketability for jobs , " Grifo says .
" We have to look at this as lifting the intellectual boat of our whole society . "
She adds : " As anyone will tell you , it 's hard to know where those gains get reaped down the line .
That 's the point of basic research . "
Matthew Thomas , a professor at the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at The Pennsylvania State University who is running a project funded by a $ 1.8 - million NSF stimulus grant to study the impact of climate change on malaria and dengue fever , says most of his money is going to hiring graduate students and postdoctoral researchers .
Being able make the four - year - long appointments has had " short - term and immediate benefits , " he says .
But the rewards will continue to pay dividends into the future , he notes : " There 's a longer term legacy for this research . "
In addition to the new information he hopes the project generates , it will also create " a cohort of trained personnel who will , themselves , [ go on ] to secure new positions and build their own labs . "
Even as the NSF 's stimulus funding continues to trickle out into the economy over the coming years , many are already concerned about a precipitous drop in momentum as federal - funded science budgets return to normal operating levels .
As Goldwein points out , however , just because Recovery Act funding drops off does n't mean that other funding will , too .
" If the economy is in good shape , " he says , the extra tax revenue might be used to increase the NSF budget and create new programs .
In fact , Obama has proposed another bump to direct science funding in his 2011 budget , penciling in $ 7.4 billion for the NSF ( an 8 percent increase over 2010 's total ) — although that will still be a broad stroke off from the $ 9.5 - billion total it had to distribute in 2009 .
But science does not have to be entirely government dependent , Goldwein says .
With an uptick in the national economy , he notes , " hopefully there will be ample private funds " to pick up what the government cannot or will not .
Anger brought them together .
But when the TTC 's union met face - to - face with riders at a town hall Sunday , there were few signs of the animosity that badly strained riders ' relationship with frontline transit workers a couple of months back .
The first of three meetings organized by the transit workers ' union proved that “ the frustration we 've been hearing about over the last few months is n't necessarily directed only at the frontline employees , ” said Bob Kinnear , president of Local 113 of the Amalgamated Transit Union .
“ Yes there have been disappointing incidences , which the union does not condone in any way .
But I think there 's been some clarity that it 's the underlying issues with service and lack thereof that more important issues , ” he said .
The meetings were organized when anger at transit workers boiled over earlier this year .
Already annoyed by a fare hike and token shortages , riders were outraged by published photos of a sleeping subway collector and video of a bus driver taking an unauthorized coffee break .
The 480 - seat auditorium at Downsview Secondary School was more than half full as riders waited turns at the microphone to ask about why buses and streetcars do n't arrive on schedule and why , after a long wait , they turn up in bunches .
They wanted to know :
• Who ordered new buses with a step up to the back so that strollers block access to the rear ?
• Why does n't the TTC order people to take off bulky backpacks ?
• Why do n't fare vending machines work ?
• And why do buses seem to pull away when drivers can see someone running toward them ?
The union spokespeople on the panel moderated by talk radio host John Tory , were apologetic .
The normally defiant Kinnear , who had earlier this year warned riders against abusing drivers and threatening to take transit workers ' pictures , acknowledged that his members had a role to play in the customer service crisis .
He started the meeting by recalling his own frustration as a subway collector when a rider seeking directions could n't understand what he was being told through the speaker .
Kinnear said he opened the door to his booth and pointed to a sign .
“ Ca n't you read ? ” he asked the rider .
Kinnear said he 's never forgotten the customer 's apology because he could n't read .
“ We can take some responsibility for the dissatisfaction of frontline customer service , ” he conceded .
“ Operators do slack off a lot , ” driver John Bethune told the audience , later stressing , “ I did n't say anything that was n't true . ”
“ TTC management need to go back to train us so we can do the job properly , ” panelist and driver Anthony Wallace said after the meeting .
“ We need to make sure we serve the public to the best of our ability . ”
While riders praised the union for organizing the meeting , several said they were frustrated because TTC management was n't allowed to respond to many of the broader queries .
“ It would have been a more productive meeting , ” said Wilson bus rider Claudette Passby .

“ The union leader is good at taking responsibility .
But the union leader is not the one who should be up on the stage , ” she said .
“ I was looking for more about why more funding is not put into ( the TTC ) , and why we do n't have a better fare system , ” said Carrie McLean , whose brother is a TTC worker .
She says the TTC's old - fashioned fare system should be replaced by the kind of smartcards available on other major transit systems such as London and Hong Kong .
“ It was a waste of time for me to come .
Management should have been up there because there 's a big problem , ” said McLean .
But Tory Moote , who attended the town hall with two friends from York University , said the threesome plan to go to the other meetings scheduled in the coming weeks because they want to hear more discussion of broader issues such as transit funding .
“ We 're angry and we want to ride the TTC .
We do n't want to drive , ” said Alex , who did n't want her last name used .
“ These are all on the periphery of what 's going on .
Where 's our money going ?
Why are a third of TTC employees being paid over $ 100,000 ? ”
Senior TTC officials were on hand , however , to listen to rider comments .
The information will be considered along with other customer service initiatives underway at the TTC , including an expert panel that will be making recommendations for improvements in June , said chief general manager Gary Webster .
The public will have an opportunity to ask managers questions later , said Giambrone .
“ What 's exciting is you 're beginning that dialogue , ” he said .
“ It was frustrating for me because there were some answers I was wanting to give and talk about .
There 's some questions that might be better answered by TTC management and the commission .
The customer service panel will be making an announcement over the coming weeks about their own customer engagement . ”
But those events will not be in competition with the union - sponsored meetings , he said .
Prior to Sunday 's event Kinnear said that he did n't know how many people to expect .
The cafeteria next to the auditorium had been opened up with fruit and beverages prepared for those who might have to watch the meeting on monitors .
But in the end , only a few TTC workers sat and watched there and the refreshments were packed away .
The session did , however , run overtime , with Tory allowing questions to continue for more than 30 minutes after a cable broadcast was scheduled to end .
Another town hall takes place on Sunday in Scarborough and in May 2 at Ryerson University .

Northeastern IPM Center : Small Investment , Big Impacts
WHAT WE DO
o Protect
food supplies and communities .
We stay in touch with people 's needs and fund
30 - 40 IPM projects each year that focus on important pest problems .
o Make the
most of public resources .
We help organizations to build on each others '
success .
An independent review team found that IPM Centers show an impressive
use of limited resources to maximize output of projects .
In 2006 that review
team advised USDA to use IPM Centers as a model for future
programs .
o Engage
partners .
We serve as a hub where growers , scientists , consumers , government
personnel , businesses , and environmental organizations can work together for
practices that reduce risks to the environment and human health .
KEY
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Helping urban residents
combat pests .
We coordinate a national project to reduce pests in public
housing .
With funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development , we've
already taught 200 maintenance and property staff how to manage pests in and
around their buildings , and hundreds of tenants are receiving training as well
( see our video at
http://www.stoppests.org/for-residents.htm ) .
Collaborators on this project include
HUD , USDA , EPA , and nearly two dozen agencies and IPM
consultants .
Helping growers protect the
environment .
Our Center partnered with USDA 's Natural Resources Conservation
Service to train nearly 400 growers , NRCS staff , and Extension educators in
practices that minimize environmental impacts and improve crop yield and
pest control ( http://northeastipm.org/nrcs.cfm ) .
Farmers who attended the workshops plan
to increase their use of IPM and conservation practices .
Enhancing sustainability
in the marketplace .
We collaborate with industry to give IPM growers
improved access to markets .
The Eco Apple working group helped to boost the
market for IPM - grown apples in New England , with sales in 2008 of $ 1.9 million
( http://www.redtomato.org/ecoapple.php ) .
We work with SYSCO , a worldwide food
distributor that has urged its suppliers to actively support more sustainable
environments in the production of food .

France has hardly begun to pair back the fiscal stimulus of the last year , though the car scrappage scheme is being phased out in steps .
The budget deficit is expected to rise to 8.2 pc of GDP this year , with no real austerity until 2011 .
The country faces the same risks as the UK in delaying retrenchment as public debt surges above 80 pc of GDP this year .
Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor 's have begun to mutter that France may endanger its AAA status if it fails to act soon , though the Paris clearly has more leeway than London for now .
Assemble a group of whiskey drinkers and prime them with a glass or two , and the talk often wanders to that eternal whiskey debate : the Hillbillies versus Highlanders divide between Kentucky and Scotland .
But if the rising tide of Japanese and other Asian whiskeys entering the United States is any indication , " hills " may soon need to be stretched to include the Himalayas , " highlands " to encompass the Yamashiro Basin .
" A lot of people are surprised that the Japanese make whiskey , and it 's really , really good whiskey - it's not something they just took to , " says Mateo Hoke , bar manager at Nihon Whisky Lounge in the Mission District , which serves several styles of Japanese whiskey along with spirits from India .
" Just because it 's new to the States and new to people 's experience here does n't mean it 's a fly - by - night kind of thing .
They take it very seriously , and they make some of the best whiskey in the world . "
Japan 's slow rise in the whiskey world started in 1923 , when Suntory opened a distillery in Yamazaki , near Kyoto .
Working with distiller Masataka Taketsuru , the company produced whiskey modeled on Scotland 's famed spirits .
Taketsuru left Suntory in 1934 to form a rival company , known today as Nikka .
Praise from critics
Broadly popular at home , Japanese whiskey has earned critical accolades in recent years as it has expanded into Western markets .
Its image further boosted by the 2003 film " Lost in Translation , " Japanese whiskey is becoming increasingly available in American bars at a time when single malts from other Asian producers are also entering the market .
Suntory currently exports 12 - year - old and 18 - year - old versions of its Yamazaki Single Malt , along with a limited 300 - bottle edition of its Yamazaki 1984 anniversary whiskey .
Last year , U.S. sales of Yamazaki reached 25,000 cases , and the company hopes to sell more than 30,000 cases in 2010 .
In late 2009 , Suntory launched its Hibiki 12 - year - old blended whiskey in the U.S. and Europe , and the company may introduce single malts from another distillery , Hakushu , in coming years .
Nikka , which distributes several styles of whiskey in Japan and Europe , including the acclaimed 21 - year - old Taketsuru Pure Malt , is also planning to enter the U.S. market within the next year .
Liquor - store geography will become even more complex later this month .
Five labels from Bangalore - produced Amrut single - malt whiskey enter stores in New York , Illinois , New Jersey and Massachusetts .
It should be in California by the end of the year .
Whiskeys such as Hibiki and Taketsuru have garnered significant awards in recent years ; in his " 2010 Whisky Bible , " whiskey expert Jim Murray rated Amrut 's Fusion as the third - best whiskey in the world .
Until recently , Nihon was one of few bars that carried Asian whiskey .
Today , Suntory 's whiskeys can be ordered in San Francisco bars such as Alembic , 15 Romolo and Bourbon & Branch , as well as in places such as Bar Deville in Chicago and PDT in New York .
Japanese whiskey is finding enthusiastic fans .
" It has everything you love about American and scotch whiskeys , but there 's a whole other world of flavor that takes some time to figure out , " says Andrew Friedman , owner of Liberty , a Seattle bar with a growing selection of Japanese spirits .
Friedman notes that Japanese whiskeys have the honey , caramel and vanilla notes that are familiar to drinkers of bourbon or scotch .
But Friedman says he also detects things that he does n't find in Western whiskeys , including elements of sour apples and pears in single malts such as Yamazaki and Nikka 's Yoichi , and a light floral aroma in blends such as Hibiki .
More subdued
Japanese whiskey starts as malted barley , but unlike some heavily peated scotch , the smoky character in the Japanese version is often subdued .
By using different strains of yeast and , in Suntory 's case , wooden fermentation vats , producers tease different flavors from the grain before distilling in copper pot stills .
The young whiskey is then aged in oak ; for Yamazaki , this means using three types of wood : some made from used bourbon barrels ; others from used sherry casks ; and others from Japanese mizunara oak , which lends a mildly spicy sandalwood character .
The three batches are mixed before bottling ; the Yamazaki 12 - year - old is largely from American bourbon barrels , while the 18 - year - old is mostly from sherry casks .
For Hibiki , a mixture of spirits from three distilleries is finished for its final two years in casks that formerly held Japanese plum - wine liqueur , then filtered with bamboo and charcoal , a process that lends a trace of fruity richness .
Japanese whiskeys can maintain a liveliness in the glass even at advanced ages , and the 18 - year - old Yamazaki has become a favorite among bartenders .
" It has this kind of precision to it , and it has so much going on , " Hoke says .
" Some people will say that 's a Japanese cultural characteristic coming through , of every layer being very clearly defined . "
While Nihon mostly sells Asian whiskeys by the glass or bottle , some bartenders have found the flavor of Japanese whiskey particularly suitable to cocktails .
Yamazaki Holiday
At Rickhouse in the Financial District , bar manager Erick Castro says that during the winter holidays the bar was selling a case of Yamazaki 12 - year - old every week , most of it mixed in a seasonal drink called the Yamazaki Holiday .
The same whiskey also features in one of the most popular drinks on Rickhouse 's current menu , the Mamie Taylor - a classic highball - style drink with lime juice and ginger beer .
" The Yamazaki is a little softer , a little more feminine , and it plays really well with the ginger , " Castro says .
" We also take pride in introducing people to new spirits , and this works really well in that drink . "
Still , a large - scale embrace of Asian whiskey may not happen immediately .
" It 's going to take a while for people to grok it , " Friedman says .
" Every day , we taste people on Japanese whiskey , and those people are amazed to find that everything they love about American and scotch whiskeys is there , along with another factor that 's really surprising . "
Thunder Horse was designed with an oil production capacity of 250,000 barrels a day .
Clearly , it never hit that level , and seems to be already declining .
If the field really had a billion barrel of producible oil reserves , it would take 11 years of production at 250,000 barrels a day to reach this amount — something that looks very unlikely to happen .
There seems to be no production plateau , and it appears that production may be declining by as much as 25 % per year .
Thunder Horse field created huge excitement when it was discovered in 1999 in Mississippi Canyon blocks 788 and 822 .
Partners BP and Exxon announced that the field had a billion barrels of reserves .
After nearly two years of production history on the field , it is becoming obvious to most outside observers that Thunder Horse field is not performing as it was expected to perform , if one is to believe the press accounts and specifications of the production facilities .
If the field is underperforming , as the data available from the Minerals Management Service seems to indicate , this should be of concern and interest to those in the Peak Oil community , and to the world .
With BP ’s Deepwater Horizon blowout in the news , the world ’s interest is now focused on deepwater oil production .
BP has another deepwater platform in the Gulf of Mexico — Thunder Horse — where it has been working some for some time .
My analysis suggests production is not going as well as planned at Thunder Horse .
This is a guest post by Seismobob .
His real name is Glenn Morton , and he works as a geophysical consultant in oil exploration in the oil industry .
Natural gas production capacity for Thunder Horse is 200 million cubic feet per day .
Production for natural gas does n’t look any better .
Figure 2 - Thunder Horse Natural Gas Production in Million Cubic Feet per Day , based on data of Minerals Management Services
While it was designed to hit 200 billion cubic feet of gas per day , it never really hit that level , and also seems to be declining at around 25 % per year .
Background
There are two parts to the Thunder Horse complex as shown on the map below .
Each block is 3 miles on a side .
An anticline / turtle structure located on MC 778 and MC 822 .
Then there is Thunder Horse North which lies along the salt wall to the north of Thunder Horse proper .
Figure 3 - Map of Thunder Horse Complex
The main field consists of four producing wells , TA - 001 , TA - 003 , TA - 004 , and TD - 001 .
There is also a fifth field , TA - 002 , which has not been put on line yet .
There is also production from blocks to the north of the main field , called Thunder Horse North on blocks MC 775 , 776 and 777 .
There are five wells on these blocks , which are producing from sands uplifted against the Thunder Horse salt .
These are TC - 001 , TC - 002 ( both on MC776 ) and TB - 001 , TB - 002 , and TF - 001 ( all on MC777 ) .
Figure 4 - Thunder Horse Main - Oil Production by Well , in Thousand Barrels per Day , based on data of Minerals Management Services
Production on all of the wells in the Main Field has been lower since June 2009 .
Figure 5 - Thunder Horse North - Oil Production by Well , in Thousand Barrels per Day , based on data of Minerals Management Services
Production from Thunder Horse North started much more recently .
So far , except for TC001 , production from these wells seems to be holding up , but the length of drilling experience is at most a year .
One of the issues seems to be that BP is now finding that the fluids extracted in the main field include an increasing proportion of water .
Figure 6 - Thunder Horse Main – showing oil , natural gas , and water production separately , based on data of Minerals Management Services
As Figure 6 shows , Thunder Horse main field has rapidly rising water .
Thunder Horse North field does n't have rapidly rising water ; indeed it has no water at all .
Probably because of this , the wells at the main field have been choked back and the North has been allowed to produce all out .
Figure 7 - Thunder Horse North – showing oil , natural gas , and water production separately , based on data of Minerals Management Services
Figure 7 shows Thunder Horse North is behaving quite well — no water cuts so far .
Figure 8 - Thunder Horse Fluids Production , split between oil - main ; oil - north , and water - main , , based on data of Minerals Management Services
Thunder Horse was built with a total of 390,000 barrels a day of fluid capacity — 250,000 barrels of oil , and 140,000 barrels a day of water .
Neither the daily production of water nor gas have reached the limits of the facility handling capacity , so with that in mind , one can view the drop in total fluids as most likely due to the natural pressure decline reducing the flow .
Thunder Horse has no injection wells ( they initially thought they needed it but then changed their minds ) .
The field is producing just above 200,000 bbl / day of fluids and that is a concern .
It is a concern because the facility was designed to produce 390,000 bbl / day of total liquids .
They are not bringing that much to the surface .
The fact that the total liquids is slowly declining says one of two things : either the pressure decline is not allowing those flow rates , or they are throttling back on the flow to avoid coning the water into the wells and thus further harming the reservoir .
But either way , the field is not performing as it was probably expected .
Implications
What are the implications for the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery for this field ?
If one could maintain 250,000 bbl / day of oil production until a billion barrels were recovered ( something that can't possibly be done ) , it would take about 11 years to recover the billion barrels .
I only make this comparison to point out one thing -- the whole complex is not producing 250,000 bbl / day of oil , as shown in Figure 1 .
The decline is 2 - 3 % per month and even adding one well per month from October 2009 to January 2009 , the decline has continued resulting in the complex producing only around 180,000 bbl / day .
The well added in January was MC775 , which is not on the main field but against the salt on the northwest side of the basin .
If adding new wells is n't stopping the decline , then the underlying decline is quite steep .
When BP drilled the first well and announced a billion barrels , they were announcing that for the main field .
Were it not for the North field , it would be clear that this field is not going to produce the advertised barrels .
I will not mention numbers that engineers , with whom I have spoken , have suggested as the total volumes that will be produced by the entire complex .
Who knows how the North field will produce ?
But I will say that unless something significant happens to change the situation , the ultimate production from the Thunder Horse complex will fall significantly short of a billion barrels .
Can the North field make up for the deficit in the main field ?
In my opinion it wo n't .
Almost every well along the salt flank appears to be in a separate fault block and some of the down dip wells drilled along the north salt wall have encountered water - saturated sands .
That means that water is coming to the North wells , sometime in the future .
Given that the North was the later development and has been producing a shorter time , the delay in the water is partly understandable .
That being said , the North field has produced longer without water than did the main field .
Let us hope that the wells to the north fill in the deficit that is showing up in Thunder Horse proper .

1 ) Simply say nothing about your change of belief .
Continue to go to church and do what others expect of you .
This option is most attractive to those whose families ( spouse , children , parents ) are very devout Mormons .
It avoids the possible ( almost certain ) disruption of those relationships .
However , this requires you to live a double life , to keep your important feelings secret , and most people not only find this difficult , but also somewhat dishonest .
2 ) Tell those Mormons closest to you ( spouse , family ) how you really feel , but continue to do the minimum required of a church member .
This option has many of the disadvantages of options 1 ) and 3 ) , but allows you to feel somewhat more honest with yourself .
3 ) Become completely inactive ( give up your church callings , stop attending meetings , etc. ) , but maintain your official membership .
Many people choose this option , rather than option 4 ) , because they dislike the finality of leaving the church , with its consequences of being labeled by friends and family as an " apostate . "
Or they simply feel that it does n't really matter whether their names are still on the church records as " members , " and they do n't want to jump through the hoops to get their names removed .
This option is also frequently chosen by those who want to avoid hurting Mormon family members but also want to be honest .
It has three disadvantages .
First , as an " inactive " member ( the church now refers to such people as " less active " ) , you become the target for church efforts to " reactivate " you , with missionary visits , invitations to social events , and other " fellowshipping " efforts .
Second , as a member you are subject to " discipline " by the church authorities , who may summon you to a church court .
Third , by allowing your name to remain on the records as a member , you allow the church to include you in its total membership number ( currently about thirteen million ) with which it wishes to impress the world .
Many people choose option 4 ) rather than 3 ) for this reason alone .
4 ) Resign your membership and take your name off the church records .
The price for selecting this option may be high , if , as a result , you alienate family and friends .
Divorce by a Mormon spouse and / or disownment by Mormon parents is not at all uncommon .
Loss of Mormon friends is almost certain .
It also has the disadvantage that you may feel suddenly alone and alienated from your cultural roots .
Many people are not prepared sufficiently to deal with this unexpected emotional void , and need a support group ( see listings below ) .
This fourth option has the tremendous advantage , however , that you are free as you have never been free before , that you can be confident that those who remain close to you truly love you for yourself and not just because they are supposed to love you , and that nothing now is holding you back from determining your own destiny and finding your own path through life .
Most people who have taken this option , even though it may have cost them dearly in lost relationships , would not wish for a moment that they had chosen something less .
Former Mormon Brian C. Madsen explained why he chose this ultimate option :
I can think of two really good reasons [ for having my name officially removed from the church records ] .
One is emotional closure : by having my name removed , I 've drawn a line in the sand and said , " At this point , it 's over . "
There 's a finality to it .
There 's no lingering thought ( either in my mind or my family 's ) that maybe I might come around later and see the light and come back to church .
With my name officially removed , it 's over , done , finis , schluss jetzt , end of story , that 's all she wrote .
Another is that it makes it a lot less likely that some home teachers or zealous elder 's quorum presidencies are going to knock on my door and invite me back to church .
I 'm not on any ward lists , and so when zealous new EQP 's decide to " reach out to their less active brethren " , I do n't get included in that effort in any way .
In other words , with my name removed , I 'm free of them in a more concrete way than I would be otherwise .
A woman who posts as " amyjo " on the " Recovery from Mormonism " discussion board wrote :
Resigning as an Act Of Open Defiance !
That 's what prompted me to resign when I did .
The anger came much later from that point .
It was RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION that led to my resigning after having my rights as the head of my family violated by a group of busy bodies at the church , who tried to get their talon claws into my children .
By resigning I was invoking my rights as the matriarch of my family , and head of household .
The Mormon church would no longer claim ANY PART OF ME OR WHO I AM .
It was freeing and cathartic to leave that bastard cult behind me .
Like some find solace in saying , " Satan , get thee behind me . "
That 's what resigning felt like for me .
It showed them I was boss , not them .
Nor would I buckle or cower to anything they ever tried to do again .
It got them off my back .
More importantly it sent a strong message that I would no longer be willing to engage them on any of their terms .
It was so much better than a divorce , by resigning .
It became official I was out .
No more second guessing on anyone 's part that I was " just another inactive . "
No .
I was very pro-ACTIVE in asserting myself and telling them to their faces they had no more power over me .
They hated it .
I felt blessed to be done with that chapter of my life .
It also helped me move forward , unequivocally into the uncharted path of my future .
" To my mind , a kind of mild - to - severe schizophrenia results from trying to keep one foot in and one foot out of an authoritarian church or belief system .
A person , like a nation , cannot long exist half - slave and half - free .
If we nibble at the fruit of the tree of knowledge but still cling to the security of Authority , we are caught in the impossible position of trying to take a journey and stay home at the same time . "
- Hymns to an unknown God , p. 102 , New York : Bantam Books
Occasionally someone chooses not to resign membership officially , even though no longer believing , saying : " In one sense resigning acknowledges authority that I do n't believe the church actually has . "
This kind of statement shows an ignorance of legal facts .
Resigning does not grant any kind of authority , but rather recognizes a legal fact : you are officially and legally enrolled as a member of that church , and legally the church does have authority over you to discipline you according to its rules ..
That is a fact which ( like all facts ) remains a fact whether you personally acknowledge it or not .
( See the cases cited below . )
Resigning has the effect of removing the church 's authority , rather than acknowledging it .
It is by NOT resigning that you are acknowledging the church 's authority over you , its right to count you among its however - many million members , and its legal right to discipline you .
Most of the remainder of this article is for those who decide to leave ( i.e. , those who select option 4 ) , with a few suggestions added at the end for those who opt for one of the others .
HOW TO LEAVE
The church does not make it easy for members to leave .
Its attitude is that it knows better than you do what you need to be saved , and it wants to protect you against yourself .
Mormons believe that you are just going through a phase , that Satan is tempting you , that you are committing eternal suicide , and that they will have to answer to God at the Last Judgment if they allow you to do so .
Until a few years ago , the only way to leave the church was to be excommunicated .
That changed when one man , Norman Hancock of Mesa , Arizona , brought an $ 18 million lawsuit against the church in 1985 for refusing to let him withdraw voluntarily .
The church settled the case before trial , and the next edition of the General Handbook of Instructions after the resolution of the Hancock case included provisions for voluntary withdrawal without the stigma of excommunication .
But the authorities still make it difficult .
The procedures are found officially only in the church 's handbook of instructions for local church leaders , which is not generally available to members ; only church leaders have copies , and those copies are carefully guarded .
( For a detailed discussion of the Hancock case , see the long article in " Reports of the Mormon Alliance " , which also discusses the importance of resigning rather than requesting " name removal . " )
In 1999 Jerald and Sandra Tanner of Utah Lighthouse Ministry were sued by the church for posting on their website the passages from the Handbook telling Mormons how to remove their names from the church records , contending that such posting was a violation of the church 's copyright .
The suit has now been resolved with an out - of - court settlement and the Tanners removed their quotations from the secret handbook .
HOW TO END YOUR MEMBERSHIP OFFICIALLY
DISCLAIMER
The following should not be relied upon as a definitive statement of the law .
Your situation may differ , and on legal questions you should obtain legal counsel only from your own attorney .
Although I am a retired attorney , because of my retirement I am no longer authorized or licensed to give legal advice .
I am speaking as a lay person only , and only in reference to the laws in the United States .
There are two parts to ending your membership in the Mormon church , and it is important that you do not confuse them , because they are not the same .
They are :
1. Resigning your membership .
2. Getting your name removed from the church membership records .
1. RESIGNING YOUR MEMBERSHIP
In the United States , and in most democratic countries , you are guaranteed the freedom of association and freedom of religion .
That is , you may associate with whom you wish , may join organizations or churches , and you may freely end those associations .
To end such an association , such as your membership in a church , all you have to do is to notify them that you have resigned .
Your resignation is effective to end your membership as of whatever date you indicate , such as the date of your letter .
( You cannot , however , make your resignation retroactive . )
It is like resigning from a job .
The church has no legal right to determine when or whether or how you may resign .
Once you have resigned , the church has no more authority over you .
It can not summon you to a disciplinary council .
It can not excommunicate you .
You have ended your relationship as soon as you notify them that you have resigned .
The subsequent removal of your name from their membership records is merely a clerical action which changes their records to reflect what has already happened , namely , that you resigned .
However , your resignation , to be effective , must be by some positive , unambiguous act , such as writing a letter .
You cannot claim to have resigned simply by becoming inactive .
And until you resign , you are subject to the disciplinary procedures of the church .
See Guinn v. Church of Christ , 775 P 2d 766 ( 1989 ) ( click here to read this case ) , Hadnot v. Shaw , 826 P 2d 978 ( 1992 ) , and Serbian East Orthodox Church v. Milivojevich 426 US 696 , 96 SCt 2372 , 49 LEd 2d 151 ( 1976 ) , as well as the discussion of the Hancock case cited above .
2. GETTING YOUR NAME REMOVED FROM THE MEMBERSHIP RECORDS
Since the membership records belong to the church , the church has the right to determine how it keeps those records and what information it has in those records .
( European law is much stricter in this respect than American law , and limits how much personal information an organization may keep in its records without that person 's permission . )
Even after your name is removed from the membership list , the church will still keep a record of your former membership and the fact that you resigned , so that in case you should ever decide to join the church again , the church would know that you should go through the " extensive interview " prior to rebaptism , and so that you may have your church blessings " restored " rather than having to go through each ordinance individually .
As long as the church provides a reasonable procedure to have your name removed from their membership records , and as long as they follow that procedure , you probably have no legal or moral basis for not following that procedure .
Many people view it as unreasonable that the church keeps the details of its procedure for name removal in the Church Handbook of Instructions , which is not available to the public or even to general members .
There are only a handful of copies of this handbook in each ward , and in order to read it , a member must make an appointment to inspect it , and must do so in the presence of the custodian of the handbook ( usually , the bishop ) .
For quoting the pertinent passages from this handbook on their website , the Tanners were sued by the church , as mentioned above .
However , the steps are known , and are not difficult .
They are contained in Chapter 15 of the Church Handbook , on pages 148 - 149 , and the following is a summary of them ( direct quotes are not used , so as not to invite a lawsuit from the church ) :
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS FROM HANDBOOK , CHAPTER 15
The member , if adult , must write a letter to the bishop , requesting the name removal .
The letter should not appear to be a form letter .
The bishop is then required to make sure that the member understands the consequences : cancellation of baptism , priesthood authority , temple blessings , and that , if the member should ever wish to return to membership , a thorough interview and a rebaptism would be required .
If the bishop is convinced that the member knows the consequences and is firm in the request , the bishop completes an administrative form and sends it to the stake president with the member 's letter and membership record .
The stake presidency reviews the matter , and , if they concur ( presumably that the member is sincere ) , they request the bishop to write a letter to the member , stating that the member 's name is being removed and repeating the consequences .
The letter must inform the member that the request may be rescinded if the member notifies the stake president within thirty days .
That is , the stake president will hold the request , without forwarding it to Salt Lake City , for thirty days .
If the member does not rescind the request , the stake president forwards the request to the church records department in Salt Lake City , where the name is removed from the membership records .
( As of the 2006 revision of the CHI , the stake president should not wait the thirty days if the member requests immediate action . )
A minor over the age of eight must follow the same steps , and must also have the request countersigned by the parent or guardian having legal custody of the minor .
Only one letter is required for members of the same family .
A threat of legal action by a member requesting name removal is to be forwarded to the church legal department .
The fact that there is evidence for possible disciplinary action against a member is no longer a justification for delaying a name removal .
Once the person is no longer a member , the bishop may inform those local church leaders who may need to know that the person is no longer a member .
The bishop may not use the term " excommunication " and must state that the person voluntarily requested the action .
You will notice that these provisions leave many details unspecified , which leaves an individual bishop or stake president much leeway in complying with your request .
You will also notice that the ( false ) impression is given that one is a member until one 's name is removed .
YOUR LETTER
IMPORTANT UPDATE ( 9/25/10 ) !
Several people have reported that they have been able to resign via e-mail directly to Membership Records .
If so , this greatly simplifies the resignation process .
Your e-mail should include identifying information and a mailing address for the confirmation letter .
The following is a suggested form ( omit the bracketed material if you do not have it available ) : To : " Membership Records " < msr-confrec@ldschurch.org >
Subject : Resignation of membership in LDS church
My full name is ______ ; my date of birth is ____________ .
[ I was baptized on ___( date ) .
My membership number is ______. ]
My residence address is _______ [ in the ________ ward / branch ] .
I hereby resign my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , effective immediately , and request you to remove my name permanently from your membership records .
I wish no further contact from representatives of your church except to confirm that my name has been removed from your records .
I expect to receive that confirmation within a reasonably short time .
In preparing your letter ( often called an " exit letter " ) , you may expedite compliance with your request by following these guidelines .
Send the letter to the bishop of the ward where you are now living , even though , if you have moved , this may not be the ward where your membership records presently are .
( If you send the letter directly to the Confidential Records department in Salt Lake City , it will simply be returned to you with instructions to send it to the bishop , saying that it is a " local ecclesiastical matter . "
For dealing with that , see a good response at the RfM discussion board . )
If you do n't know the bishop 's name or address , you can telephone the church records office in Salt Lake City at 801-240-3500 , or toll - free from outside Utah 800- 453-3860 , extension 23500 , give your address , and ask for the name and address of the bishop in whose ward you are living .
You may also be able to find his name and address in the telephone directory or by telephoning any ward in your town .
Sign the letter ( with other family members also signing , as necessary ) .
If the bishop does not know you personally , or if you think there may be a possibility that the bishop will doubt that the letter is actually authentic , you may have the letter acknowledged ( " notarized " ) before a notary public .
Your bank may provide this service at no charge .
Send the letter to the bishop 's home address , not to the address of the ward .
Send the original letter to the bishop as certified mail with return receipt requested .
This will be proof that you sent the letter , in case the bishop claims he never received it .
You may wish to send copies to the stake president and to the church headquarters , Office of the First Presidency , 47 E South Temple Street , Salt Lake City , UT 84150 -1010 ( this is the zip code for the Membership Records office ) .
However , this is not really necessary .
Overseas members may want to FAX the letter , to save time : 801-240-1565 .
The letter should include the full name , sex , address , and birth date for each person requesting removal .
Dates of baptism , priesthood held , dates of endowment , membership number , etc. , are not necessary .
The letter should also include the following statements , in your own words , and phrased so as to include other family members as appropriate :
You are writing this letter to notify the church that you have resigned your membership in the LDS church , effective immediately .
Comment :
This is legally the most important part of your letter .
As soon as the bishop reads this notification , you are no longer a member of the church , no matter how long they may take to remove your name from their records .
Be careful to word this statement unambiguously ; i.e. , do not say " I want to resign , " or " I intend to resign " or " I am going to resign " or " I request to have my name removed . "
You request the bishop to do the paperwork to have your name removed from the church membership records , that is , to change the records to show that you are no longer a member .
You have carefully considered this step , over a long period of time , and it is your own firm unalterable decision .
Comment :
The bishop is required by church regulations to act only if he is convinced of your determination and that he cannot dissuade you .
Word this paragraph strongly enough to convince him that you are firm in your decision .
You are aware that according to church doctrine this cancels all blessings , baptisms , ordinations , promises , covenants , and your hope of exaltation .
Comment :
The bishop is required to make certain that you understand these consequences .
By stating it clearly in the letter you can avoid a visit from the bishop .
You request that no one representing the church contact you for any reason other than to confirm that your request is being processed .
Comment :
This prevents the bishop or others from attempting to dissuade you .
Because the bishop is required to put on his form your " reason for leaving , " you should insist that the reason be " At member 's request " or " Doctrinal reasons , " and you should make clear to him that he should not put there any reason which may be derogatory to you .
Comment :
You may want to include a sentence ( not more ) to indicate your reason for your decision ( like " After long study I have concluded that the LDS church is a not what it claims to be " ) , but a long dissertation or list of criticisms of the church or its doctrine will do no good , and may lead the bishop to believe that if these few minor things could be cleared up , you would change your mind .
You may also want to emphasize that you are not leaving because of some personal slight or insult , or because you have " sinned " or are unable to " keep the commandments . "
You insist that , in accordance with the Church Handbook of Instructions , your request be forwarded without delay to the stake president and you will follow up in one week if you have not been notified that your request has been forwarded to the stake president
Comment : Some bishops have interpreted the Handbook to require the bishop to hold the request for thirty days .
The Handbook clearly states , however , that once the bishop has determined that you are sincere and not to be dissuaded , he is to forward the request .
This statement in your letter may help draw his attention to that fact .
You waive the thirty - day waiting period during which the stake president may hold the request , in order to give you the opportunity to rescind .
Instead , you request immediate processing .
Comment :
You might ask the bishop to notify you when your request was forwarded to the stake president , and state that you will contact the stake president to verify with him that he has forwarded it immediately .
You consider this matter to be confidential , and you insist that no church representative discuss your resignation with any persons other than those church officers who are processing your name removal or those who must be informed to carry out their church duties ; that if any church official speaks of this matter outside of official channels , you will consider legal redress .
Comment : Many people are concerned that the bishop or stake president will inform parents or other relatives of their request .
To prevent this , you might remind them that the Handbook , at page 150 , specifically directs them that these matters are confidential and that such information is not to be given to anyone other than other church officials who need it to process the request .
You might emphasize that informing family members of your request is a violation of your privacy and a violation of church regulations , and would make them subject to church discipline and a civil lawsuit .
If children are included , state that the resignation and request includes them , include their full names and birth dates , and state that you have sole custody of them .
If you are a divorced parent , attach a copy of that part of the divorce decree .
The Handbook says that the letter should also be signed by each of the children over eight years of age , so have them sign it to avoid any hassle ( although legally that is not necessary for minor children ) .
Bishop [ Name ]
[ Bishop 's home address ] CERTIFIED MAIL ; RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED
Re : Resignation from church membership of
[ Full name , date of birth , present address ]
Dear Bishop :
With this letter to you I officially notify you of my resignation from membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , effective immediately .
With my resignation I voluntarily sever all my relationship to the church .
I therefore request you to make the necessary changes in the church membership records to indicate that I am no longer a member .
I am familiar with the procedures as outlined in the Church Handbook of Instructions , and I request that you fill out and forward the necessary administrative forms as soon as possible .
I assure you that I do not take this step lightly .
I have devoted a good deal of thought , prayer and study , over a considerable period of time , to this matter , and I am firm and unalterable in my decision to end my membership .
I am aware that according to church doctrine this cancels all blessings , baptisms , ordinations , promises , covenants , and my hope of exaltation in the Mormon celestial kingdom , and I have made my decision with that consideration well in mind .
I request that no one representing the church contact me for any reason other than to confirm that my request is being processed .
In particular I will refuse to speak with anyone from the church who attempts to argue with me about the wisdom of my decision .
It is my understanding that you are required to indicate on your form my " reason for leaving . "
Please state the reason as " At member 's request " or " Doctrinal reasons , " since that is , in fact , the reason .
I insist that you should not put there any reason which may be derogatory to me .
I wish to assure you that I am not leaving the church because of some personal slight or insult , or because I have " sinned " or am unable to " keep the commandments . "
I have simply come to the very sad realization that the church is not what it claims to be , that its doctrine is false , and that the LDS church is not where I wish to be .
I request that my name removal request be forwarded without delay to the stake president in accordance with the Church Handbook of Instructions .
I will check with you in one week if you have not already notified me by then that it has been forwarded to the stake president .
Please inform the stake president that I waive the thirty - day waiting period during which the stake president may hold the request in order to give me the opportunity to rescind .
Rather , I request him to process it without delay .
Please ask the stake president to notify me when he has forwarded my request to church headquarters .
If I do not hear from him , I will contact him to make sure that my request is being honored without delay .
I will consider any unnecessary delay to be a violation of my rights of free association and freedom of religion as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution .
I consider this matter to be confidential , and I insist that no church representative discuss my resignation with any persons other than those church officers who are processing my name removal or those who must be informed to carry out their church duties ; that if any church official speaks of this matter outside of official channels , I will consider it a violation of confidence , a violation of church regulations , and seek legal redress .
Thank you for your courtesy in honoring my request without delay .
Yours truly , [ Signature ]
There should be no need , in your initial letter , to threaten legal action .
However , you should be aware that if a call to Salt Lake City does not get things moving , a strongly worded letter to the local church authorities may do so .
Be careful , however , not to threaten more than you are prepared to undertake , and , if you cite the law or the Church Handbook of Instructions , that you are accurate in your citations and your interpretation .
Some delay may be caused simply by the backlog : so many people are leaving the church that there is sometimes a backlog .
They can't keep up .
The number of members leaving increased by over 50 % between 1997 and 2000 .
Other websites with suggestions for name removal , some with sample letters , are :
Utah Lighthouse Ministry ; Jerald and Sandra Tanner 's site
Recovery from Mormonism
" rpcman " ( This website has some outdated information )
Mormon No More , the late Kathy Worthington 's website .
This website is now maintained by Jarrod Staffen .
Kathy 's website has helped many people to process their resignations .
The principal differences between Kathy 's instructions and mine ( as far as I can tell ) are two : 1 . Kathy recommends that your letter be sent directly to Confidential Records in Salt Lake City .
I recommend that the letter be sent to the bishop of the ward where you presently reside .
The reason I recommend that is because letters sent to Salt Lake frequently are returned to the member saying that this is an " ecclesiastical matter " that must be handled at the local level .
According to the Church Handbook , that is a correct statement so far as it has to do with removal of the member 's name from the records ( which is not the same as the member 's act of resigning ) .
The returned letter simply drags out the process , in my opinion , since Confidential Records will generally not process any change in the records without a request from the bishop , and the member then has to send another letter , this time to the bishop , where the letter could just as easily have gone in the first place .
As to the legal status of the member , the receipt of a resignation letter by ANY church authority effectively terminates membership .
2 . Kathy recommends that the letter be notarized .
The only purpose this would serve is to authenticate that the member actually wrote the letter , and not an impersonator .
This would be necessary only if the member is unknown to the bishop ( or other recipient , such as Confidential Records ) , but is just an added hassle if the bishop knows you or can easily contact you .
NOW WHAT ?
Exmormons usually face two more unexpected problems , in addition to the ones discussed above :
1 . What do I believe now ?
If Mormonism is n't the True Church , then what is ?
2 . Even though I am no longer officially a Mormon , I still carry a lot of Mormonism around with me .
What do I do with that ?
There are no single , easy answers , but - for what it 's worth - here are some suggestions , based on the experience of many former Mormons .
WHAT DO I BELIEVE NOW ?
Separating yourself from an organization to which you have devoted years of your life , and which , during that period , played a central role in shaping your goals , your standards , your lifestyle , and your entire world - view , often has the same emotional effect as a divorce from a spouse .
All too often a newly divorced person will panic at the prospect of living life alone , and within a few months will remarry the first person who comes along .
This is often a disaster .
The best advice for most newly divorced people is usually to wait , not to become anxious , not to try to fill that empty space with whatever comes along .
The same advice is probably applicable to the loss of one 's religion : do n't rush .
Do n't feel that you must immediately replace one " true church " with another " true church . "
Take your time to explore , to sample other ways of viewing the world and other ways of shaping your life .
Consider the possibility that there is no one true church , that there are many possible paths that all lead to where you want to go .
An interesting short self - quiz to suggest which spiritual or religious path might be attractive to you can be found at the Belief - Net website ; click on the " Belief - o - Matic quiz " .
As a Mormon you have been accustomed to having the answers given to you , and all that was required of you was to accept them and to obey .
Now it is up to you .
You are responsible for finding out the answers , and you have rightfully become skeptical of those who want to give you their answers and expect that you simply accept them without question .
Of course it is more difficult to make all those moral and philosophical decisions yourself .
But that is part of being a mature human being .
You will grow immensely by accepting that responsibility , and in doing so you will find that joy that Mormonism always promised you but was never able to give you .
As a Mormon you were probably taught that apostates become bitter , disillusioned , dissolute , and that they end up as skid row bums .
That is not true , of course .
However , you may still believe that the only reason you were an honest , temperate , faithful , hardworking , family - loving citizen is primarily because the church told you that is what you should be .
Some new exmormons do what the church expects of them , and discard all those virtues and qualities because they think of them as " Mormon . "
But just because the church is fundamentally false , it does not follow that all its teachings are also false .
Honesty , temperance , hard work , marital fidelity , and strong families were held to be desirable qualities long before the Mormons began to teach them .
Tobacco , alcohol , sexual promiscuity can be harmful .
If you have Mormon family members , you will find that you will best be able to justify your leaving the church if you demonstrate to them by your lifestyle choices that you are still the fine person you were as a Mormon .
Especially Mormon spouses become very alarmed at rapid changes they think they see in their newly apostate mates , and this alarm often leads to unnecessary panic and divorce .
HOW DO I TELL MY MORMON FAMILY MEMBERS ?
Unless you are the only one in the family who is Mormon , you will face the question of how , when , and even whether you should break the news to them that you have left the church .
There is probably no easy answer to this question , and of course every situation will be somewhat different .
But , from what I have observed , and from comments that others have made based on their experience , the key thing in such a situation is the assurance that - no matter what religious beliefs you ( or they ) hold - the love and respect is still there .
It seems that families break up more easily if it was only the glue of Mormonism that held them together .
If it was genuine love and devotion , then differences in religion do n't seem to matter as much .
Sometimes it helps to emphasize that it was your own honesty and integrity , your own devotion to truth and your dislike of lies that are at the base of your leaving .
Mormons are trained to automatically think of leaving the church as bad , evil , etc .
Their terms are emotionally charged : " losing faith , " " losing your testimony , " " breaking your covenants , " " weakness , " " opening yourself to Satan , " etc .
It is important that you use emotionally positively charged terms instead .
If you say , for example , " I began to lose my testimony when ... " , then you are using their terminology .
Better would be something like , " I began to realize that something was not right with the church when ... "
If your loved ones are at all willing to discuss your reasons , then you are fortunate .
Most Mormons do n't want to discuss why anybody would leave the church .
Unless they ask , then , it probably is not a good idea to try to tell them .
If they suppose that you left because you were reading " anti-Mormon " books , at least you can say that it was your reading of Mormon materials , listening to statements by Mormon " prophets " , studying the history of the church as written by Mormon historians and observing the operation of the church as led by Mormon leaders that led you to question its divinity .
The fear that family members ( especially Mormon parents ) will learn about the resignation is often a major reason why many Mormons remain on the membership rolls , for fear that the family will " find out " - even though resignation from the church is a confidential matter , and no one need find out about it unless you tell them .
If some church official such as your bishop tells your family that you have resigned , that is a violation of your privacy and a violation of church regulations .
What method should you choose to tell your closest Mormon family members ?
In person ?
By telephone ?
In a letter ?
How you break the news depends on how you think your family may react .
Using a letter to break the news has the advantage that you get to say what you want to say , you can take time to phrase it carefully , and you do n't have to be interrupted to field all kinds of questions and arguments that are really beside the point .
By the time you are face - to - face , enough time may have elapsed for them to get used to the idea that you no longer believe .
If you do it by letter , you might want to resist the temptation to explain to them in great detail why you have come to this decision .
That might be a mistake , because it gives them the idea that if they ( or some apostle ) could just explain all those things away , you 'd change your mind .
I think a general statement is enough , just emphasizing that you have been a long time in coming to this decision , that there are multiple reasons that have brought you to this point , that you are well aware of the official explanations for all of these problems and that they are not convincing .
It will not be easy , of course .
Your parents and family will suffer just as much or even more than you , since they must believe that someone they love is going to be lost to them for eternity .
They will shed many , many tears over you .
But you must remember that that is their problem , and the fault of their own false beliefs .
You are not responsible for that - it is not your responsibility to protect them from the consequences of their false religion .
Remember , too , that whatever guilt you may feel by leaving will be nothing compared to the guilt that you would have to feel by continuing to pretend .
To stay in the church you would have to be continually lying to those you love , making them believe that you are something that you are not .
Now that is a sure formula for inducing guilt feelings !
For a list of the kinds of questions and comments you might get from Mormon family and friends , and for suggestions as to how you might respond , click here .
Unless you were a member for only a short time , in a sense you will always be partly Mormon .
You can not change that , and you probably should not try .
If you were born in the church , and especially if your ancestors were Mormon , your family heritage is inextricably entwined with Mormonism .
That is nothing that you should wish to deny or erase , even if you could .
The Mormon achievement in settling the West and establishing a strong and vigorous people in the mountains is a heritage of which you can be proud .
Of course it is not a history entirely free of blame , but neither is the history of any people .
Your ancestors , even though they may have been deceived by Mormon teachings , were undoubtedly pious , sincere , honest and hardworking people of whom you can rightfully be proud .
All in all , most Mormons were , and are , good people , and one can be proud to have had them as ancestors , family and friends .
The same thing is true , to a lesser extent perhaps , of those who were converts but spent much of their lives as Mormons .
As a Mormon you undoubtedly did much good and touched many lives for the better .
One 's fond memories often include memories of Mormon friends , Mormon celebrations , spiritually moving moments that you associate with Mormonism .
Especially Mormon hymns and music seem to remain with the exmormons long after they leave the church .
All this is quite natural , just as one still has fond memories of the happy days of a marriage , even though it may have ended in a bitter divorce .
Cherish the happy memories .
To suppress them would unnecessarily create a void in your life .

CAN I SUE THE CHURCH ?

Sandra Svoboda | Metro Times
During his 30 years in the Arkansas fish industry , Mike Freeze has watched federal and state government agencies change from being cheerleaders to exterminators when it comes to Asian carp .
Freeze is a former Arkansas Game and Fish commissioner who worked for the agency in the late 1970s .
He knew the fish farmers who were then importing , cultivating and researching silver and bighead carp — and who are now often blamed in media reports for allowing their release .
That 's not the whole story , Freeze says .
Those farmers were receiving help , guidance and funding from the federal government as well as the state because it was then thought the fish — collectively known as Asian carp along with the black and grass varieties — held promise for environmental cleanup and plant control .
Silver and bighead carp are considered the problem species .
" One project was trying to see if silver and bighead carp could be used to clean up human sewage , " Freeze says .
Another project he remembers involved an Illinois researcher who was trying to use Asian carp to clean up hog manure .
" He would go to Arkansas and get truckloads of silver and bigheads .
He 'd take them back and use them on their facility , " Freeze says .
" They do n't want you to know that . "
His assertions about governmental involvement are supported by documents from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Arkansas that Metro Times obtained , as well as in interviews with researchers and government officials .
" The public sectors , including universities and state and federal entities , have contributed significantly to at least one importation of the black carp , the spawning and probable release into natural waters of the silver and bighead carps , and the distribution and use of all three species , " reads a 2008 report from researchers at the National Aquaculture Research Center in Stuttgart , Ark. , and the University of Arkansas .
Mark Oliver , chief of fisheries for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission , says the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funded some of those studies in the 1970s that were done by state employees and private fish farmers .
" We know now it was maybe not the best idea , " Oliver says .
Some of the silver and bighead carp escaped from farms in Arkansas and Mississippi and migrated up the Mississippi River , says Kevin Irons , an ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey at the Illinois River Biological Station .
He admits the survey - funded research in ponds on hog farms but says only in ponds without connections to the waterway network .
" There 's no evidence that those escaped into the wild , " he says .
" It was a good use of this fish . "
But the carp — wherever they came from — did infest other inland waterways , displacing native fish and ruining recreational boating industries .
The silver carp , which can grow to more than 4 feet long and 100 pounds , are agitated by motors and leap out of the water , creating a hazard for boaters .
Advocates for the Great Lakes fear they are a threat to the $ 7 billion - a - year fishing industry .
Nick Schroeck , executive director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center in Detroit , says that , in addition to state agencies in Illinois and Arkansas breeding and studying the fish , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the EPA have published research and other federal studies date back to the 1970s .
Two studies are available on the Center 's website — greatlakeslaw.org — and the center has filed a Freedom of Information request with the EPA to learn the extent of that agency 's work .
Schroeck is waiting for the EPA 's response .
With the U.S. Supreme Court poised this week to decide whether it will hear Michigan 's request to re-open a case and order the closure of Illinois waterways to Lake Michigan , Schroeck says the government 's involvement in the early Asian carp studies needs to be considered in legal decisions and future public policy .
" It 's disingenuous for the federal government to say right now that they 're doing all they can to combat this problem and not admitting that they 're one of the major culprits in creating the problem .
It 's important to tell the public that side of the story , " Schroeck says .
" It 's important to show that there were all these different points of entry .
Each and every one of them had federal funding and federal personnel involved . "
Ted McNulty , director of the aquaculture division for the Arkansas Agriculture Department , says he saw firsthand the federal agencies ' involvement in research and fish cultivation in Arkansas during the 1970s .
" A lot of it was funded from a grant from the EPA , because they wanted these fish to clean up sewer lagoons as part of the Clean Water Act. … U.S. Fish and Wildlife assisted them .
Part of it was money , and even U.S. Fish and Wildlife employees examined fish coming into the United States and helped the farmers fill out the paperwork to get them in , " he says .
" They 've put money into researching these carp and encouraging farmers to raise them . "
Ashley Spratt , a spokeswoman with the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service , says her agency only had involvement with bringing grass carp to the United States , not the troublesome silver or bighead species .
EPA spokesman Dale Kemery told Metro Times he could not confirm nor describe the EPA 's work related to carp 30 years ago .
Now , he says , the agency operates the electric barrier that is currently the last defense between the carp and the Great Lakes .
While Illinois officials insist the barrier is working , Michigan and other Great Lakes states want the Illinois waterways separated from Lake Michigan .
Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Lansing ) and U.S. Rep. Dave Camp ( R - Midland ) have introduced bills in Congress that would force the government to close the locks .
Camp 's spokeswoman , Lauren Phillips , says his office was not aware of the federal agencies ' roles in the original Asian carp industry .
" It 's extremely troubling , " she says .
" As more information becomes available , we 'll be looking at what to do . "

Right - i'm not one to whine , but i'm at a real dead end right now when it comes to this matchup - i've tried literally everything but it feels as if my army is never as cost effective - and never as fast at rebuilding .
Before the patch - TvP has always been my least favourite Matchup as i felt i was limited to 1 viable strategy - that being the marauder fe .
The patch came and swiftly tore that apart , and after immortals not allowing mech play , it leaves terran with little option but to go BIO that has been nerfed considerably , and does n't really stand up to a protoss army head on .
Now , my main predicament being - a 4 - 5 warpgate rush ( i find this incredibly hard to hold off , i just encountered a game where i went 3 rax , 2 bunkers and died behind my wall to it ) , or the more simple 3 warpgate immortal -> push / expo and tech to HT's .
Before the patch - terrans were still weaker late game vs toss - due to the inability to go heavy units such as thors / tanks , and thus investing alot of money in bio due to it not being totally destroyed by immortals .
But right now , i do n't have an advantage at any point in the game and feel constantly behind - is their a strategy that i'm missing out on ?
Or is every Terran feeling the way i do ? :S
Any suggestions are appreciated - anybody also dwelling on the same situation will make me feel less crap for losing roughly 9/11 games vs protoss in the last few days .

This belongs in the Strategy forums .
And you 'll need to have some replays to show the issue you 're talking about and allow people to see what mistakes you 're making and help you fix them .

Angra Profile Blog Joined May 2009 United States 2158 Posts # 4 I feel about the same way .
It feels like I 'm constantly struggling to keep up with a toss 's unit production just to stay alive - let alone get map control or put pressure on him .
I keep stupidly thinking that I can take an expo earlier on too to maybe get an advantage that way , but it is n't possible if the toss stays on one base because he 'll just have more stuff than you when he pushes and you die .
Going fast ghosts to stop the immortals does n't even seem like it works very well , because when you make ghosts so early on it's just eating into the rest of your army , and even with taking out the immortal shields , you still just do n't have enough to stop pushes .
I 've started playing tvp with the idea of ..
I 'm not expoing until the toss does .
But then I still get run over when we take our expansions at the same time .

One of the best terrans in EU .
Of course he 's tried ghosts and of course he does n't need any replays .
I 've been noticing since this patch that terrans have been getting raped by protoss 4 gate pushes .
Like you mentioned , this is largely due to marauder early fast expand not being viable anymore ( unless the protoss goofs up with his timing push or is n't aggressive ) .
About the only terran I 've seen in streams still doing well against protoss is CauthonLuck .
He seems to do well with a few early harrass strategies while building a mass bio army at home .
Have you checked out his KoTH showmatches ?

I think that thread by Kennigit said that high - level players do not need to provide replays iirc .
Anyway , I think the best build for this patch in TvP is to go for a 4 rax FE and just make 3 bunkers then transition into Rauders +
Medivacs +
Vikings if you see Collosi .
The thing with the FE build though is you HAVE to make sure the Protoss is going Immortals , otherwise you die .
That 's how you counter the 3 warpgate immortal -> push .
However , against the 4 - 5 warpgate rush ( usually Stalkers with blink ) , it 's a more difficult predicament .
I think going 2 Rax pumping Marauders with fast EMP ( around 29 - 33ish pop ) counters both builds .
Try not to FE too much against Protoss unless you 're sure he 's going Immortals .
Then go for that 4 rax marine only FE build .
I know you 're a high level player so you probably wo n't think what I 'm saying will work , but yeah try it out .

But yeh , the last game i played i went 3 rax no expo attempt , had 7 rines 5 rauders and a ghost sat in bunkers / behind my wall - and he managed to break in and cripple me to the point i had to bring all my scvs .
I was literally shocked that the fact i was using every resource on units not even teching and i could n't stop this push - like surely something is wrong with that ?
As for any possible comments about micro , i did n't lose 1 unit , not even my scouting scv i knew exactly what he was doing - but i could n't counter it .
Eventually he just got DTs with an expo up and i was out of the running .
It feels as if there is literally no viable strategy to go right now , and it 's just go a weird strat and hope the protoss makes mistakes - i'm just not enjoying this matchup at all - i really hope the next patch comes soon , as i know there is no miracle cure to this without one .
- By the way , does anyone else feel that after 8 patches , we 're kinda circling round obvious problems and leaving them be , rather than fixing the the main bulk of things ?

I would have to agree , especially since I am a toss player .
First of all , with the recent patch , terran has NO chance to pressure early anymore , and that is the main problem for protoss ... they can simply sit back on 1gate and instantly buff up to 4gate and pump out units without need for an expansion for as long as needed , and STILL have plenty of money to expand .
Though emp is very effective , a heavy stalker army can simply run away and harass very effectively without early marauder slow , which definately puts them behind in tech .
I thought pvt was fairly better balanced before the marauder nerf , and I am not sure exactly what can be done , but early toss aggression is definitely a bit too strong .

I agree , because even if you manage to stop the early protoss attack , they can still expand while you are stuck turtling in your base .
I think the main problem with this matchup is that we 're not allowed to make hellions , tanks , or thors because of the immortal .
Be versatile , know when to retreat , and carry a big gun .
mrlie3 Profile Blog Joined December 2008 Canada 349 Posts # 15 Force Field , Warpgate , Immortal 's Hardened Shield and ridiculous 50 damage against armored units made 4 gates 1 robo push extremely difficult for Terran to win while relatively easier for Protoss pull it out .
Something must be done in balance wise in my opinion .
Sure , it 's not impossible to win against this strategy , but when even top players like DeMusliM says T needs to hope for P to make mistake to win shows that something is seriously wrong here .

Equilateral is a pretty strong ( top of his division ) plat player - by no means the very best but a very strong , decent mechanical player
I am a middle level plat player at best
Watch me absolutely destroy him when he FE's .
Twice .
not to mention this is extremely difficult to defend even if you dont fast expand - note that i deliberately didnt make early units ( in fact the chronod immortal comes in time for a mara rush ) because i didnt scout any reaper rush or anything like that ( though to be fair , the true build order makes 2 stalkers )
Note my poor macro and mechanics also , missing chronoboosts ( and being unsure what to chronoboost a lot of the time aswell , i THINK i should be boosting warptech so i can drop gates earlier and then maybe do the first push using the pylon in the middle of the map instead ) not only that , i dont even push with my first immortal + 2 stalkers leaving them lulling around not doing anything
By no means are either of us 100 % perfect but you get the gist of it .

pre-patch this MU was pretty balanced because terran can put on early pressure to slow down toss .
Now marauder is nerfed because its boring to play with , albeit pretty effective in all MU .
The early pressure on toss is gone because of the upgradable concussive shells and now toss is doing just fine with 50 dmg per shot on marauders and 50 % cut - down to marines ' firepower w/ guardian shield and its free +1 armor .
and all the tech - lab , reactor , fac , starport thing and tons of upgrades are gas heavy , which requires big time to pay off .
I 'm quite lost what are we supposed to do ?
Go game !

I watch your games as much as I can .
And obviously , you have a strong grasp of the game as can be seen by your build orders and economy / production .
However , I would like to see more harass tactics and drops !
You are extremely great at building the army and getting one , but more creative thought must be put in to use that army in the most advantageous method possible .
You say you are having trouble because fighting head on with the Toss army is difficult .
Well , if you are simply looking for an answer in how to fight head on with the Toss army , anyone can tell you that you just need more men , upgrades , tier 3 , etc .
But my other answer to your question would be to not simply focus for the inevitable Blob Vs. Blob moment of the game .
It is not only about getting there the firstest with mostest .
Haha

You ai n’t seen nothing yet ( Image : Araldo Di Crollalanza / Rex Features )
Icelandic communications links and even transatlantic flights could be disrupted by a second , more destructive volcano following this weekend ’s eruption .
Some 500 people were evacuated from their homes after the Eyjafjallajökull volcano 120 kilometres south - east of Reykjavik shot ash and molten lava into the air on Saturday night .
Initial fears that the eruption had occurred directly beneath the Eyjafjallajökull glacier – which could have caused glacial melt , flooding and mudslides – proved unfounded .
Advertisement
But volcanologists have warned that previous Eyjafjallajökull eruptions have triggered eruptions of neighbouring Katla , one of the largest volcanoes in Iceland .
Katla erupted every 40 to 80 years in the thousand years before the last eruption in 1918 .
“ The eruption is long overdue at Katla and there is quite a bit of anxiety in Iceland about the potential size of eruption , ” says Dave McGarvie of the Open University in Milton Keynes , UK .
Coast changer
The larger volcano , beneath the larger Mýrdalsjökull glacier , has a reputation for triggering huge jökulhlaup – the Icelandic term for the sudden release of meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets .
Its last eruption generated a peak discharge of 1.6 million cubic metres per second within 4 to 5 hours and moved so much debris that Iceland ’s coastline was extended by 4 kilometres .
A new Katla eruption would be unlikely to kill anyone , because the area is sparsely populated and eruptions are usually preceded by earthquakes that would give plenty of time to evacuate .
It would cut the main road link in the south of the island , however .
Because the lower atmosphere is thinner closer to the poles , the giant cloud of fine particles released would more easily reach the stratosphere – where aircraft cruise – than would dust from volcanoes in most other countries .
Depending on the wind , this could disrupt air travel in the north Atlantic , forcing aircraft travelling between the UK and Scandinavian countries and North America to take slower , more expensive routes further south than normal .
History repeats
The three eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in the last 1100 years – in 920 , 1612 and 1821 – have all triggered larger Katla eruptions .
“ With the current methods we have of resolving the plumbing systems of these volcanoes we can’t explain why one triggers the other , but we know there is a symbiotic relationship , ” says McGarvie .
Iceland is well prepared for volcanoes , with sophisticated monitoring systems combining GPS , seismometers and satellite data as well as established civil defence plans .
A quarter of the island ’s population died from the famine that resulted from the 1783 eruption of the Laki volcano , the worst in modern times in high latitudes .
It sent a huge cloud of haze across Europe and parts of North America , triggering dramatic climatic changes , from the largest recorded snowfall in New Jersey to one of the longest droughts seen in Egypt .

This little web series has about 3 episodes up and running .
The story follows a soldier who has been mysteriously experimented on to become seemingly faster and stronger .
But of course , something goes horribly wrong , and the poor little murdering machine seems to be slowly losing his mind .
Pretty impressive for a low budget web series .
Some moments are hit and miss , but it kept me watching until the end .
The Raven
This little short by Peruvian filmmaker Ricardo de Montreuil has everyone on the the internet a buzz .
Budgeted at $ 5 K is amazing what they managed to create .
The movie features Chris Black , a man who possesses a power that could lead to the destruction of an alternate version of Los Angeles and its totalitarian regime .

That is just * 3 days * from now !
Keep in mind that while we 've been tracking general interest in different projects through the trac , the application does n't count unless you submit it to Google at http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/home/google/gsoc2010
While all details of the application do not need to be finalized , as much of the information from http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/wiki/StudApply2010 as possible should probably be included in your application .
If you are stuck and having a hard time thinking of ideas , I highly recommend the excellent guide that Don Stewart posted recently :

Conventional night vision image , via David Kitson , Creative Commons 3.0
Night vision systems are already available in the higher - end luxury sedans from companies like Toyota , Volvo , BMW and Mercedes - Benz , but it 's expensive technology that few drivers can afford .
There are currently aftermarket night - vision systems available as well , such as the FLIR PathFindIR , but at $ 4,000 for the system without a display , it 's a pricey upgrade .
That may all change soon , as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) funded scientists at the University of Florida have developed a cheap way to turn any infrared light into visible light with a thin film .
The film is based on the same technology in the latest Organic LED ( OLED ) TV and phone displays , and its thinness could make it suitable for use in things like automobile windshields .
That in itself could be a huge breakthrough , enabling the overlay of objects and obstacles that would otherwise be invisible in the dark directly onto the driver 's field of vision - - a huge benefit to safety .
Instead of using the heavy , bulky vacuum tubes found in conventional night - vision devices , the new thin - film system uses layers of OLEDs to receive and convert infrared light into the visible spectrum .
It runs on much lower voltages -- just three to five volts -- making it more energy - efficient as well .
The result is a monochromatic green - tinted view of the area in front of it .
So far they 've only managed to make a tiny 1 - square - centimeter example , but due to the OLED technology underpinning it , it should be scalable to much larger sizes -- and the scientists behind the discovery think they can do it within 18 months .
Get ready for the night - vision revolution .

In an earlier post , The Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta - the Buddha on the Nature of Existence and Nirvana , the Buddha explains how nirvana is like the extinction of a flame .
The ascetic wanderer Vacchagotta ca n’t understand what happens after death to one who attains nirvana , or complete Unbinding .
Does he still exist ?
Does he not exist ?
Does he neither exist or not exist ?
Does he reappear ?
Does he not reappear ?
Does he both appear and not reappear ?
To Vaccha ’s puzzlement , the Buddha says that none of these statements apply :
“ Of course you ’re befuddled , Vaccha .
Of course you ’re confused .
Deep , Vaccha , is this phenomenon , hard to see , hard to realize , tranquil , refined , beyond the scope of conjecture , subtle , to - be - experienced by the wise .
For those with other views , other practices , other satisfactions , other aims , other teachers , it is difficult to know .
That being the case , I will now put some questions to you .
Answer as you see fit .
What do you think , Vaccha :
If a fire were burning in front of you , would you know that , ‘ This fire is burning in front of me ’ ? ”
“ … yes … ”
“ And suppose someone were to ask you , Vaccha , ‘ This fire burning in front of you , dependent on what is it burning ? ’
Thus asked , how would you reply ? ”
“ … I would reply , ‘ This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass & timber as its sustenance . ’ ”
“ If the fire burning in front of you were to go out , would you know that , ‘ This fire burning in front of me has gone out ’ ? ”
“ … yes … ”
“ And suppose someone were to ask you , ‘ This fire that has gone out in front of you , in which direction from here has it gone ?
East ?
West ?
North ?
Or south ? ’
Thus asked , how would you reply ? ”
“ That does n’t apply , Master Gotama .
Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber , being unnourished — from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other — is classified simply as ‘ out ’ ( unbound ) . ”
In his essay “ The Mind Like Fire Unbound — An Image in the Early Buddhist Discourses ” Thanissaro Bhikkhu notes :
“ Attempts to work out the implications of this metaphor have all too often taken it out of context .
Some writers , drawing on modern , every - day notions of fire , come to the conclusion that nibbana implies extinction , inasmuch as we feel that a fire goes out of existence when extinguished .
Others , however , note that the Vedas — ancient Indian religious texts that predate Buddhism by many thousands of years — describe fire as immortal :
Even when extinguished it simply goes into hiding , in a latent , diffused state , only to be reborn when a new fire is lit .
These writers then assume that the Buddha accepted the Vedic theory in its entirety , and so maintain that nibbana implies eternal existence .
The weakness of both these interpretations is that they do not take into account the way the Pali Canon describes ( 1 ) the workings of fire , ( 2 ) the limits beyond which no phenomenon may be described , and ( 3 ) the precise implications that the Buddha himself drew from his metaphor in light of ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) .
The purpose of this essay is to place this metaphor in its original context , so as to show what it was and was not meant to imply .
If you are interested in understanding more of the cultural and philosophical background of the Buddha ’s metaphor , then “ The Mind Like Fire Unbound ” is a terrific aid and support for deepening and clarifying one ’s understand of this “ subtle ” and “ hard to see , hard to realize ” teaching and practice .

His next design , the Model 1917 , US patent # 678,937 was a recoil - powered automatic gun like the Maxims .
It was called Model 1917 because in that year , on the verge of entering the war in Europe , the Army found itself completely lacking in modern automatic weapons .
In February , 1917 , Browning performed a demonstration at Congress Heights for the benefit of the press , members of Congress , and various foreign representatives .
He brought the recoil operated gun he patented in 1901 , and also a gas - operated automatic rifle , the BAR .
Both weapons were successfully demonstrated , and began production shortly before the war 's end . [ 4 Pulse ] 689283 March 18 , 1901 December 17 , 1901 AUTOMATIC FIREARM

New Moon Rock Is Fit for a King
Elizabeth Zubritsky
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
People do n't discover a new type of moon rock every day , so consider the odds of finding one rich in a mineral that England 's King Henry V wore on his battle helmet .
And then imagine spotting , right on the Man in the Moon 's nose , huge and previously unknown deposits of another mineral from the same family .
Using data from NASA 's Moon Mineralogy Mapper ( M3 ) on India 's Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft , a team of researchers recently did just that .
The new rock is a unique mixture of plain - old plagioclase -- plentiful in the Earth 's crust and the moon 's highlands -- and pink spinel , an especially beautiful arrangement of magnesium , aluminum and oxygen that , in its purest forms , is prized as a gemstone here on Earth .
The rock was discovered on the far side of the moon by Carlé Pieters , a planetary scientist at Brown University , Providence , R.I. and the principal investigator for the M3 science team .
Shortly after , massive deposits of a different type of spinel were identified on the near side by other M3 team members , led by Jessica Sunshine at the University of Maryland - College Park .
Because spinel has n't figured strongly in discussions about the geology of the moon so far , the findings took the team by surprise .
" This was definitely a ' Wow ! ' moment , " says Noah Petro , a planetary geologist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , who works closely with Sunshine .
Additional team members come from several other institutions , including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , which managed the M3 mission .
" I do n't think anybody who studies the moon would have expected to see this so prominently at the surface , " Petro adds .
Spinel the gem comes in a rainbow of colors , but the diva is the red stone , so similar to ruby in color and hardness that it earned the nickname the " great impostor . "
The Black Prince 's Ruby -- a fiery 170 - carat stone owned by Edward of Woodstock ( the Black Prince ) in the 14th century , worn on King Henry V's battle helmet and later incorporated into the Imperial State Crown of England -- is actually a spinel .
So is the 361 - carat Timur Ruby , also in the British crown jewels .
Even after the two stones could be reliably distinguished , spinel was sought by royalty worldwide .
The crown jewels of Iran , for example , feature a collection of these gems .
Despite this regal lineage , the researchers were n't looking for spinel on the moon .
They were focused on mapping the minerals olivine and pyroxene , which were already known to co-exist with plagioclase on the moon .
For this , the team relied on the M3 remote scanner , which imaged the surface in strips 40 kilometers ( almost 25 miles ) wide and measured the amount of reflected light at nearly a hundred wavelengths of light .
The composition of the rock can be deduced from distinctive changes in this signal at various wavelengths .
As expected , the researchers located olivine and pyroxene deposits .
In addition , two areas about 1 kilometer by 1 kilometer ( a little more than 1/2 mile by 1/2 mile ) each , stood out on the rim of the Moscoviense Basin on the moon 's far side .
The signature in those spots was unmistakable : spinel .
" My first reaction was , it 's not possible .
It 's crazy ! " says Sunshine , remembering when Pieters first described what she saw .
Little bits of spinel have been found in moon rocks before .
And if this had been a small amount of spinel mixed with olivine and pyroxene , nobody would have been surprised ; that has been seen elsewhere .
But when the image strips were pieced together to show the whole face of the moon , the researchers could see that the spinel was completely separate from the olivine and pyroxene .
"
We've never seen the magnesium–aluminum spinel without olivine and pyroxene , " explains Larry Taylor , an M3 team member from the University of Tennessee , Knoxville .
" This means we 're talking about a new composition of magma . . . [ and ] a whole new range of processes for mineral concentrations on the moon that we have n't appreciated until now .
"
The discovery " shows the power of remote sensing , " Petro adds .
" The global view of the M3 imaging spectrometer makes it possible to find small features of interest and , at the same time , to see how unique they are in context of the entire moon .
" Why the deposits would appear only in the Moscoviense Basin remains a bit of a geological mystery , says Petro , but the team thinks the catastrophic impact that formed the basin might have brought up spinel material from deep within the crust .
Intrigued by the spinel on the far side , the researchers looked for it on the near side of the moon .
And , boy , did they find it .
Led by Sunshine , the team identified chromite spinel scattered throughout an enormous section of the Sinus Aestuum , a big plain that many people recognize as the nose of the Man in the Moon .
Unlike spinel the gemstone , chromite spinel is a dark mineral made from iron , chromium and oxygen ; both are from the same family of minerals , the members of which share a common structure but can have very different chemical makeups .
" What I find really amazing is the near - side spinel deposits are huge -- tens of thousands of square kilometers -- and they are sitting smack - dab in the center of the near side , " says Sunshine .
" All of us [ on Earth ] have literally been staring at these our whole lives , and we did n't know they were there .
" Earlier studies of the moon did n't locate this chromite spinel because the instruments did n't reach the critical wavelength of 2 micrometers ( µm ) , where a key part of the spinel signature is apparent .
Also , researchers had assumed that Sinus Aestuum had the same composition as the nearby Rima Bode , which has been studied closely and has no trace of spinel .
Though the scientists are still working out a detailed explanation of their findings , they are convinced that the spinel formed on the moon , says Sunshine .
The near - side deposit is simply too large to have formed elsewhere in the solar system and been delivered to the moon .
The team also thinks the chromite spinel is volcanic and has been exhumed from far below the surface , says Petro .
The spinel might have been covered by later volcanic eruptions and then exposed a little at a time by eons of cratering .
" Maybe it represents a very early stage of lunar volcanism , " says Sunshine .
" It 's hard to know the answers right now .
We 're still in the question phase .
" But the surprising findings do lead the team to one conclusion : “ Despite everything we have learned , " says Petro , " the moon still has a lot of surprises for us . ”

Former Bosnian
Serb leader tells war crimes trial ' alleged ' siege of city was a myth intended to draw Nato into conflict
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Radovan Karadzic today accused Bosnian Muslim forces of killing their own people in Sarajevo in order to engineer a western intervention against Bosnian Serbs .
The former Bosnian Serb leader made the claim as he defended himself against charges of genocide and other war crimes at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague .
On the second day of his opening statement to the tribunal , Karadzic sought to rewrite the historical record on the 44 - month siege of Sarajevo – the longest siege of a capital city in the history of modern warfare .
Bosnian Serb forces encircled the city from 1992 to 1996 , shelling it with artillery , mortars and anti-aircraft guns .
It is estimated that almost 10,000 people , including more than 1,500 children , were killed .
A further 56,000 were wounded .
One of the 11 indictments against Karadzic is for the siege , which he described as a " myth " aimed at drawing Nato into the conflict on the side of Bosnian Muslims .
In a lengthy , rambling defence – during which he used detailed maps of the city – he claimed Bosnian Muslim forces had turned schools , hospitals and nurseries into military installations during the siege , making them legitimate targets for Serbian forces .
" We were accused of firing indiscriminately at Sarajevo , but the targets were legitimate targets , " he told the court .
The 64 - year - old accused Bosnian Muslim forces of shelling their own people as part of a " cunning " trick aimed at bringing Nato forces into the conflict against Bosnian Serbs .
" They killed their own people , " Karadizic said as he again accused Bosnian Muslims of staging the Markale market massacre , in which 68 civilians were killed and 200 wounded on 5 February 1994 .
In 1995 a second massacre , in which 37 people died at the same market , helped bring about international intervention against the Serbs .
The final straw came when Serb forces raided a UN - monitored weapons collection site .
Nato jets attacked Bosnian Serb ammunition depots and other strategic military targets , and fighting on the ground escalated as joint Bosnian and Croatian forces went on the offensive .
The Serbs were slowly driven back in Sarajevo and elsewhere , which eventually allowed the city 's heating , electricity and water supplies to be restored .
The tribunal has already convicted two commanders of the Bosnian Serb army for the bombardment of the city .
The shelling was captured by TV cameras and the scenes horrified the world .
General Stanislav Galic , who commanded the 18,000 - man Romanija Corps that encircled and bombarded Sarajevo , was sentenced to life imprisonment .
His successor , General Dragomir Milosevic , was sentenced to 33 years .
Prosecutors say Karadzic orchestrated a campaign to destroy the Muslim and Croat communities in eastern Bosnia in order to create an ethnically pure Serbian state .
The campaign included the siege of Sarajevo and the torture and murder of hundreds of prisoners in detention camps .
That violence culminated in the massacre in the Srebrenica enclave in one week in July 1995 – the worst bloodbath in Europe since the second world war .
Karadzic spent relatively little time on Srebrenica , although he dismissed the massacre as another " myth " designed to engender sympathy for Bosnian Muslims .
He sought to cast doubt on the number of bodies found at Srebrenica , saying it could be no more than 2,000 to 3,000 and adding that questions remained about who had been killed there and how they had died .
" Let 's establish once and for all what happened in Srebrenica , " Karadzic said .
He called for yet another investigation , although the tribunal has found beyond reasonable doubt that Bosnian Serb and other forces killed between 7,000 and 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys between approximately 11 and 19 July 1995 .
Survivors of the massacre who came to The Hague voiced their outrage at Karadzic 's claims .
" He should be given the Nobel Prize for lying , " Sabra Kolenovic , of the Mothers of Srebrenica organisation , told Reuters .
After Karadzic 's opening statement today , Judge O - Gon Kwon adjourned the trial pending an appeals ruling on the former Bosnian Serb leader 's request for a postponement .
Proceedings had already been adjourned for four months after he boycotted the start of the trial , claiming that he needed more time to prepare and that he had immunity from the court .
In his long - awaited self - portrait , delivered on Monday , Karadzic depicted himself as a misunderstood and much - maligned anti-communist dissident .

FBI sources warn the gals will let nothing — not even boyfriends or babies — get in the way of their friendship this time .
WASHINGTON — Following an extensive eight month investigation , the FBI announced this week that it had learned of the potentially devastating plot to Sex And The City 2 .
Advertisement
Speaking at an emergency press conference Tuesday , FBI director Robert S. Mueller revealed details of the “ chilling ” romantic - comedy plot , which he claimed could put millions of moviegoers at risk .
“ We have strong reason to believe that on the morning of May 27 , 2010 , Carrie , Miranda , Charlotte , and Samantha will once again be unleashed on the American public , ” Mueller said .
“ While many details still remain unclear , including how large of a role Mr. Big will ultimately play , our intelligence indicates that countless men and women could soon be made to suffer . ”
Advertisement
“ The gals are back , ” the FBI director continued .
“ God help us all . ”
The terrifying plot , which is expected to last approximately two hours , and which appears capable of irritating on a scale never before witnessed , is being treated as a very serious threat by the FBI .

According to federal operatives , unless preemptive measures are taken , Americans will likely face a barrage of highly orchestrated puns , overindulgent displays of fashion , and several rounds of Samantha droning on and on endlessly about her most recent sexual exploit .
Even more troubling , however , is evidence indicating that Stanford Blatch — Carrie ’s insufferable gay friend and confidant — may be directly involved in the plot .

“ We ’re placing the entire nation on high alert until we are able to confirm reports , but at this time , it does appear as though Miranda and perhaps Charlotte will be riding atop a camel in one scene , ” said FBI deputy director John S. Pistole , shaking his head in disgust .
“ Whatever the goal of this …this Sex And The City 2 may be , one thing is certain :
This plot was devised for the sole purpose of spreading terror . ”
“ Terror and pain , ” Pistole continued .
“ Terror and pain and apparently a 15 - minute brunch conversation pertaining to menopause . ”
Advertisement
According to agents , the FBI first heard rumors of the plot in August of last year , when Internet chatter picked up from People magazine ’s website was found to contain several red flags , including repeated mentions of “ the girls throwing on their high heels one last time . ”
By late October , operatives had uncovered a crude plot device , the details of which they would not reveal for fear of alarming an already - tense public .
They also came across several script pages hinting that the fabulous foursome would be traveling to Abu Dhabi for a week of decadence , glamour , and no - limit fun .
No action was taken at that time , however , because investigators believed the likelihood of anyone carrying out a plot based on such a flimsy premise was “ preposterous at best . ”

The FBI now admits it was wrong .
“ For your safety , and the safety of those closest to you , we advise all Americans to stay indoors on May 27 , ” Mueller said .
“ Women in their mid-30s , especially those with questionable tastes and few actual interests , should remain extra vigilant during this time . ”
Advertisement
Added Mueller , “ Their boyfriends , husbands , and fiancés are also believed to be at risk . ”
This is n’t the first time the FBI has been criticized for failing to prevent a devastating Hollywood plot .
In the summer of 1999 , thousands of Americans were tragically exposed to Notting Hill , despite the fact that the bureau was aware of the threat months in advance .

Some , however , are less concerned about the danger posed by Sex And The City 2 , and are accusing the U.S. government of fearmongering .
“ To me this just sounds like another case of grandstanding on the part of the FBI , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , who recommended that all Americans continue with their lives as usual on May 27 .
“ After all , you know how the FBI can get sometimes , what with the freaking out all the time and acting like every little thing might lead to the end of the world .
They ’re total Mirandas . ”
I arrived at Rick Perry 's Capitol suite , accompanied by another Texas Tribune reporter and one of our photographers , around lunchtime on Thursday , April 15 .
We were there to capture , on tape and on film , an exclusive interview with the governor conducted as the first - ever collaboration between the Tribune and Newsweek magazine .
A Newsweek photographer was also on hand , having earlier shot Perry for the cover of this week 's issue , which features several pieces about Texas .
Inside his office , the governor greeted us cheerfully and plopped down on a leather sofa , eager to talk about a full range of topics : the Tea Party , health care reform , Mexico , the state budget and , of course , his plans for 2012 .
The Q&A that follows is condensed and edited , though it includes several exchanges that do not appear in the version Newsweek published today .
The full , unedited audio of the interview can be found in the right - hand column of this page , along with snippets broken out by subject .

Exactly one year ago today you were on the steps of Austin City Hall , talking about the possibility of secession .
I was asked , “ What do you think about the people who shout out the word ‘ secede ? ’ ”
And I said that we live in an incredibly wonderful country , and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen .
But I do understand people ’s concern and anger about what this administration is doing from an economic standpoint — in particular , the long - term debt that ’s being created for not only them but for future generations .
A year later , you ’re more resolute about the divide between the states and the federal government .
Absolutely .
I think more people in the last year have picked up a copy of the Constitution and read what the Tenth Amendment says in its simplicity : that the federal government was created to be an agent for the states , not the other way around .
I think that is a very , very good thing .
The future of America is inextricably intertwined with the states pushing back on Washington , D.C. Our Founding Fathers had a vision of this collection of states working together but competing against each other — putting different concepts into play , seeing which ones work , which ones do n’t , allowing governors and legislatures to look around and say , “ You know what ?
That ’s a good idea over there . ”
The federal government wants to be the epicenter of all thought and policy and one - size - fits - all .
It ’s very clear that we have very , very different ideas about the structure of this country and how it should work .
The Tea Parties are a reflection of that .
I think they are highly economic - driven .
At the end of the day , it is about the economy — that ’s really what drives people .
Government is basically saying , “ I do n’t care how hard you work .
We are going to take more of [ your money ] , because we know best how to redistribute it around the country . ”
It really irritates a lot of Americans .
You talked very early about invoking the 10th Amendment to rebut health care reform , and now you and the attorney general have joined with other states to sue the federal government .
I think Texans do not want a government 1,500 miles removed from the state micromanaging health care .
As you know , our state has the highest percentage of its citizens without insurance : senior citizens , children , working families .
If you do n’t like reform coming out of Washington , what do you do to solve that problem ?
For over two years , we ’ve had a waiver request in front of the Health and Human Services Committee — before this administration got in place , I might add — that would allow us some flexibility to use federal dollars differently than what ’s mandated by the federal government to create insurance opportunities for those who are uninsured today .
That ’s one example .
I think there are a number of ways that , if the states were left to their own devices , you would see substantially more Texans who had access to health care .
What we would like to see are ways to create a more efficient distribution and preventative healthcare .
Let ’s switch gears to Mexico .
Foreign policy is not often a concern of the governor of Texas —
Actually , foreign policy is a concern of the governor of Texas , or it should be , every day .
The reason is a 1,200 - mile border with a foreign country .
And the number one exporting state in America has to have substantial interest and knowledge of foreign markets .
You believe that we need to do more on border security .
Let me speak to the 800 - pound gorilla sitting in the room , and that is the failure of Washington to do one of its primary duties : secure our border .
That ’s the reason I went to the Legislature in '07 — prior to this administration .
This was during the Bush administration , with [ Michael ] Chertoff as the secretary [ of homeland security ] .
We were making pleas .
We were requesting support .
I talked about bringing predator drones to the border as early as ' 05 .
Those training missions were going to be flown somewhere .
Why not up and down the border of the United States with Mexico ?
So what are we not doing in Texas that we should be doing ?
The fact is , we should n’t have to be doing anything .
The federal government ’s responsibility has always been to operate the security mechanism along the border .
When they proved to us that they did not have the interest or the desire , that ’s when we acted .
That ’s when we put Operation Linebacker and multiple surge operations in place .
Those have been successful up to a point , but we do n’t have the resources or the manpower to secure the border the way it needs to be .
A 1,000 - troop National Guard request has been in front of this president for over a year , and no response .
We are forced by Washington ’s inaction to take action ourselves .
You govern a state at the epicenter of the demographic change coming to this country .
There ’s a debate going on right now about whether , after [ the protracted fight over ] health care reform , Congress should take up immigration .
Would you like to see some kind of reform come together ?
Immigration reform ca n’t happen until you secure the border .
This is n’t a chicken - or - egg issue .
You can have all the discussions and the debates you want , but they are all going to be failures unless and until you secure the border .
We are about to enter a legislative session with a biennial budget shortfall of anywhere from $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion , depending upon on who you talk to .
Last session , the federal stimulus was used to help balance our books — and to help pay down our debt from two sessions ago .
By the way , if you hate the feds so much , why did you take $ 17 billion in stimulus money ?
Texas is a major donor state .
We Texans send billions of dollars to Washington , D.C. , in the form of federal gas taxes and income taxes .
These are Texas - earned , Texas - generated dollars — monumental amounts of money , substantially more than flows back into this state .
So the idea that we ’re going to be purer than pure and not take any money back because it ’s been identified as stimulus dollars ?
These are our dollars .
This is our money .
This session there will be no stimulus money available , so you and the lieutenant governor and the speaker have asked state agencies to cut 5 percent of their budgets .
Your Democratic opponent , Bill White , refers to this as “ Soviet - style budgeting ” — he thinks having a mandate for every state agency to cut the same thing is not the best way to go .
My suggestion is that he does n’t know much about the way we operate here in Austin .
It ’s called prioritization , and we ’ve done it before .
In 2003 , we had a $ 10 billion budget shortfall .
We came into office and we addressed it , I will suggest to you , the same way we will address it 2011 :
We will make reductions , but we will prioritize where those cuts occur .
There are a thousand people a day moving to the state of Texas .
If this was a vestige of the Soviet Union , as Mr. White made reference to , I ’m not thinking that ’s what people would be beating down our doors to come to .
They are coming to Texas because they know this is the only place , or one of the only places left in this country , where freedom and liberty still reign , where you can keep more of what you worked for .
The idea that somehow or another Texas has gone to hell in a handbasket — if that ’s his campaign slogan , it will not be successful .
What about the Rainy Day Fund ?
There ’s between $ 8 billion and $ 9 billion in there .
I really think it ’s a little premature for me to be saying today , “ I want to use part of the Rainy Day Fund . ”
Go back to 2003 .
We were able to cut a higher percentage of the budget in 2003 than we ’d need to in 2011 .
So I ’m going to say , “ Oh , gosh , we ca n’t make that many reductions in spending .
We ’re going to have to go into the Rainy Day Fund ? ”
Or , worse yet , “ We ’re going to have to raise taxes ? ” I do n’t think you have to do that .
Earlier this year I asked Mayor White if he would commit not to raising taxes ?
Will you commit ?
I do n’t see any reason you have to [ raise taxes ] .
And what ’s happened to the city of Houston versus my record in 2003 — I like my track record better .
Mayor
White says he reduced taxes six times as mayor .
We will have a most interesting discussion of the city of Houston ’s financial affairs over the next six months .
I want to ask you about redistricting .
A range of Republicans , from [ former U.S. Secretary of State ] James Baker to [ Land Commissioner ] Jerry Patterson to [ San Antonio state Sen . ]
Jeff Wentworth , have told me recently that the process of redrawing the maps should be depoliticized — should be taken out of the hands of politicians .
Given the controversy over redistricting the last time and the desire of many people at the Capitol to avoid it this time , what should we do on that issue ?
Anyone who says “ Let ’s take politics out of redistricting ” is either naive or has another agenda that I have a hard time identifying .
You ’ll have to ask those three whether they are naïve or they have another agenda .
I do n’t know what they ’re thinking .
I think the process will work .
It has worked for a number of years .
It has never been pleasant .
And it can work without going into a special session .
People need to stick around and do their jobs .
You ’ve been in public office for more than 25 years , and you are the longest - serving governor in the history of the state .
Yet you ’ve managed to run for the last few months as an outsider .
I disagree that I paint myself as somehow outside .
Now , I did run a [ primary ] campaign as us — Texas — versus Washington .
We were running against an individual who was in Washington , D.C. , for 17 years .
Washington is the center of bad public policy in most people ’s opinion and has been for some time — not just in this current administration , though this administration is carrying it to new levels .
Do you want Texas to be run the way it has been run , with a Texas - centric philosophy , or do you want this person from Washington , D.C. , to come down here and use Washington - style policies and philosophies ?
I think the people sent a pretty strong message .
A couple different times in this conversation , you ’ve alluded to having to battle problems that predated the Obama administration .
I ca n’t help but notice that you have a bust of Ronald Reagan , who you consider to be a great president , over your shoulder .
I do n’t see a bust anywhere of George W. Bush .
Um , I do n’t know whether George has gotten any busts done yet .
Do you consider Mr. Bush to have been a great president ?
At the end of the day , when the history books are written , I think George W. Bush will go down as a very , very good president .
Approaching great ?
I do n’t know yet —
I mean , a year and a half after he ’s been out of office may be a little too early to write George ’s history .
But here is why he was an incredibly good president : because the man kept America safe .
As the president of the United States , he made one of the most difficult decisions that a sitting president ever makes : to go to war .
There are two things that people judge presidents on : their safety and the economy .
When you were campaigning for Rudy Giuliani in Iowa during the '08 presidential campaign , you said , “ George W. Bush was never a fiscal conservative .
Never was . ”
Right .
Do you still believe that ?
I do n’t think he was fiscally conservative in the sense that it was his main focus day in and day out .
Cutting spending and looking for ways to make government more efficient was not something that George particularly focused on .
Not as governor and not as president .
When you said earlier in the week at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference that America has been flying in the fog for too long , you were likewise talking about a time before Obama administration .
Oh , yeah , since the '30s .
If Americans want to really go back and historically engage when we really got off track , it started in 1930 , with Franklin Roosevelt and the start of the Great Depression and the maneuvering of Roosevelt and Congress as they started to pull power into Washington , D.C. , and create government programs and government agencies .
You ’re opposed to the New Deal ?
Yes .
I think the programs created by the New Deal and the monetary jury - rigging that went on in our society exacerbated the Great Depression and pushed us farther down .
The New Deal did not get America out of the Great Depression ; World War II did .
Generally speaking , the expansion of government at the federal level has not , by and large , been good for the American people .
Everybody wants to know about your plans for 2012 .
In your speech at the SRLC last week , you sounded like a presidential candidate .
Are you considering running and would you consider it ?
No and no .
You are not considering running for president .
You will not run for president .
That ’s correct .
Under any circumstances ?
That ’s correct .
There is no way .
No , sir .
Vice president ?
Would you be willing to consider that ?
No .
I do n’t care about going to Washington , D.C .
Your party could not come to you and say , “ Governor , all the other alternatives are wanting .
You ’re our guy . ”
There will be an alternative that is not wanting .
I have a great interest in who this individual is going to be , but I want to be a governor who is leading a state .
The reason I go to things like the Southern Republican Leadership Conference , the reason I am engaged in the Republican Governor ’s Association , the reason I agree to do interviews with national publications is so that people will pay attention to what is going on in Texas .
Our policies , and the results of those policies , are worth having a national dialogue about .
I want people elected to Congress , to the United States Senate and to the presidency in 2012 with the express message that we are going to go to Washington and try to make Washington as inconsequential in your life as we can make it .
I want the states to become the laboratories of innovation and experimentation .
And I want to get this country back .

Sharing your credit card and online purchases with friends on the web sounds risky and it is .

Editors Note : Among our excellent crack team at the Atlas , is one Ryan “ Genki ” Matsunaga a lover of all things media : gaming , film , music , comics and generally a brilliant fellow .
Getting his degree in Digital Arts , Ryan loves video games , but as an Atlas Obscurian is also a devotee of real world awesomeness .
In a stroke of genius Ryan decided to pull the two together and find the places where they overlap .
This the first in a series of “ Shadows ” posts where Ryan will be comparing environments from fiction ( movies , video games , ect. ) to their real world counterparts .
Without further ado , Shadows of Chernobyl : Pripyat in the Gaming World .
Pripyat was the closest town to Chernobyl ’s No. 4 reactor , and was devastated by the reactor meltdown .
Over two decades after the meltdown , this ghost town is still a freeze frame of the Soviet Union in 1986 , with toys strewn about a schoolhouse where they were last dropped by children who are now fully grown ( or dead ) .
All clocks are frozen at 11:55 , the moment the electricity was cut .
It is this strange , creepy environment , that makes it a favorite local among game makers .
Here are some of the games in which the town of Pripyat makes a notable appearance …
Half - Life 2
You might be saying to yourself , Half - Life 2 ?
But that s a science fiction title set in a fictional city years in the future !
Very true , but a good look at the design of City 17 , the setting of the game , reveals some of the inspirations behind the architecture .
It is clearly an Eastern European city , with definite Soviet Union - era inspirations .
However , its ties to Pripyat are actually more direct .
During the commentary track of the games second episode , the developers reveal that the hospital section of the game were in fact directly based on photos of the haunting Prypiat Hospital .
One look at some of these eerie photos will make Half - Life 2s zombies seem strangely appropriate .
Much more , ( including Call of Duty 4 and STALKER ) after the jump …
Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare
In Call of Duty 4 this quintessential ghost - town makes two appearances of definite note , and this time by name .
The first is Call of Duty 4s highly - acclaimed sniper  mission , putting you into the boots of a SAS operative tasked with assassinating an ultranationalist terrorist .
Both accurately constructed and explosively deconstructed , the Pripyat level of the game is a fan - favorite , and arguably the most memorable of the entire game .
No small feat considering the level of awesome present in every level .
From the white - knuckle tension of the early sequences on the outskirts of Pripyat , to the eerie creeps through the abandoned buildings of the city itself , to the balls - to - the - wall climax under the Pripyat Ferris Wheel , CoD4 turns this quiet ghost - town into an action - movie setpiece .
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. : Shadow of Chernobyl
>
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. took it one step farther by incorporating the ominous Chernobyl power plant itself , and is set in an alternate reality where a second Chernobyl disaster causes supernatural occurrences in the area around it .
The Pripyat of this game features intense street - to - street firefights against power armored cult - fanatics and ravenous mutated animals , once and for all proving that the only thing creepier than an abandoned city is one populated with things that want to kill you .
If you manage to survive this , you can look forward to battling more heavily armed and armored cultists , the Russian military , and deadly levels of radiation as you work your way towards the plants deadly secrets
Aside from being a chilling , exhilarating and suspenseful experience , S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s commitment to detail is remarkable .
Giving you access to almost all of Pripyats most memorable places , the game is about as close as you re going to get to visiting the real - life landmark without ever leaving your seat .
And that very same day , a demonstration that getting angry may be just what the media want .
Peter Mitchell :
An accused rioter has clashed with a television cameraman after facing court on charges arising from the attack on the Oakleigh Bob Jane store ... — Channel Seven News , Victoria , 1st April , 2010
The charges are serious , but of course not yet proven .
And anyway , it was n't the accused rioter who was first shown clashing with the cameraman outside the Melbourne Magistrates Court - it was his father .
Gad Amr : You bloody idiot .
You idiot .
Simon Fuller :
The camera 's rolling .
Gad Amr : I do n't care , you say to whoever .
— Channel Seven News , Victoria , 1st April , 2010
On Seven 's story , that aggressive behaviour by Mr Gad Amr seemed to come completely out of the blue .
But we 've been given the unedited footage shot by one of the cameramen there that day .
It shows that the father had been sorely provoked , especially by the cameraman shooting for Nine News .
We 're going to run it at some length .
And I warn you , the language is n't pretty .
Omar Amr has just been given bail by the magistrate , and he and his father were trying to walk away from the court .
Gad Amr : Please !
Please guys .
Please .
I do n't want to push anyone .
Please .
I said please .
Simon Fuller :
You do n't push people , mate .
Gad Amr : Please .
I say please .
I say please .
Simon Fuller :
You do n't push people .
Gad Amr : I say please .
Simon Fuller :
You do n't push people .
— Camera tape , 1st April , 2010
Both men cross the street but when they return to the pavement it continues ...
Gad Amr : I say please .
I say please .
Please .
Leave me alone , please .
Simon Fuller : I 'm just doing my job , mate .
Gad Amr : Please , leave me alone .
Enough .
Simon Fuller : I 'm just doing my job .
— Camera tape , 1st April , 2010
Just doing his job .
But at most he needed a couple of shots of the pair .
You 'd think he'd have got enough by now .
But no , he 's hardly started .
Gad Amr : Go away please .
Leave me alone .
You want the shot ?
You already have it .
Please go away .
Omar Amr : All right , you 've got me .
F*** , what do you want ?
All right , you 've got my face .
Is that what you want ?
Is that what the media wants ?
F*** off .
Gad Amr : I say please .
Man , please .
( In Arabic to Omar ) Stop it , Omar !
( In English to Simon Fuller ) Please .
Go away .
Please .
Simon Fuller :
You do n't touch me .
Gad Amr : Okay , I do n't touch you , I say please .
Go away .
Go. Simon Fuller :
You do n't touch people .
Gad Amr : ( In Arabic to Omar ) Stop Omar .
They want you to confront them .
( In English to Simon Fuller ) Please .
Go away please .
Please .
Simon Fuller :
We 're just doing our jobs .
— Camera tape , 1st April , 2010
You do n't touch people .
But it 's fine , apparently , to stick a camera in their faces for minutes on end while they walk down a public street .
By our count , the cameraman had been asked to stop - ' please ' - twenty - five times by Mr Amr .
At this point , though a noisy truck makes it hard to hear , it sounds as if the cameraman says ' eff off ' .
Simon Fuller : F*** off .
Gad Amr :
You say to him f*** off .
You say to him f*** off ?
You say to him to f*** off ?
Simon Fuller :
The camera 's rolling .
Gad Amr : You bloody idiot .
Simon Fuller :
The camera 's rolling .
Gad Amr : You idiot .
I do n't care you say to whoever , you idiot .
Omar Amr : F*** him , mate .
He 's a f*** knuckle .
Simon Fuller :
You f***ing terrorist .
— Camera tape , 1st April , 2010
That 's right .
The Nine cameraman , whose name is Simon Fuller , called Mr Amr an ' effing terrorist ' .
If he wanted a reaction , he certainly got one .
Gad Amr : You say again .
You bloody idiot , you idiot , you idiot .
Omar Amr : A terrorist ?
A terrorist ?
You call him a terrorist ?
All right we 'll go and get the cops now then .
— Camera tape , 1st April , 2010
The argument continued as the Amrs retraced their steps towards the court in search of police .
A minute and a half later it was still going on .
Omar Amr was by now furious ...
Omar Amr : Calling my dad a terrorist !
Who the f** are you to call him a terrorist ?
Why are you calling him a terrorist ?
' Cos he has a beard and ' cos he 's Muslim ?
It 's what it comes down to ?
Is that what you guys have brung us down to ?
You can't even have a beard in this country any more without being called a f*** ing terrorist !
Have some f*** ing self - decency .
The man has never been to court in his life and you 're calling him a terrorist !
You 're calling him a terrorist and he 's never been to court in his life .
Is that what it 's come down to ?
— Camera tape , 1st April , 2010
Edifying stuff .
Nine 's Director of News in Melbourne tells Media Watch :
Simon Fuller has been stood down pending the completion of an investigation into all the facts surrounding this incident .
— Response from Michael Venus ( Director of News , Nine Network Melbourne ) to Media Watch , 9th April , 2010
Good .
But until TV News Directors make it clear to their cameramen that they do n't want people to be badgered like this , it will go on happening .
It 's worth remembering that there were at least two crews filming the incident .
Wisely , in the circumstances , Nine did n't broadcast a single frame of the confrontation .
In a statement to Media Watch , Gad Amr 's lawyer writes :
Mr Amr wishes to clarify that he has been a citizen in this country for over 20 years and has never been the subject of a criminal allegation .
He also wishes to convey his disappointment that the words were said in the first place by the channel 9 cameraman , and that the altercation was later broadcast by channel 7 . — Response from Grace Morgan to Media Watch , 9th April , 2010
In fact both Ten and Seven aired some of the confrontation .
Neither gave any hint of how seriously Gad Amr had been provoked .
He comes across as an aggressive Muslim .
His lawyer says :
This incident has the capacity to further erode the Islamic community 's confidence in the media .
— Response from Grace Morgan to Media Watch , 9th April , 2010
No more to be said .
That 's it for this week .
Special thanks to our Executive Producer for the past two years , Jo Puccini , who left us last week .
Our loss , and Lateline 's gain .
But we 'll be back as usual next week .
Till then , goodnight .

Nicole Colson looks at the Stalin - style revision of historical events carried out by right - wing Republicans on the Board of Education in Texas .
POP QUIZ :
What do you get when you allow Texas right - wingers to rewrite social studies textbooks ?
A ) A defense of McCarthyism
B ) Excision of important Latino and African American cultural figures like Cesar Chavez , Thurgood Marshall and Harriet Tubman
C ) Removal of key events in the fight for women 's suffrage and African American history
D ) Poorly educated kids and a bigoted view of history
E ) All of the above
If you guessed E , give yourself a gold star .
Last month , the Texas Board of Education approved a host of curriculum changes to history and economics textbooks that are the stuff conservative dreams are made of .
By a 10 - to - 5 vote , the board voted for curriculum changes " stressing the superiority of American capitalism , questioning the Founding Fathers ' commitment to a purely secular government and presenting Republican political philosophies in a more positive light , " according to the New York Times .
And , surprise surprise , the 10 board members who voted in favor of the changes are all Republicans .
New education standards in Texas present a glowing view of conservatism , Christianity , capitalism and U.S. military might
" We are adding balance , " Dr. Don McLeroy , the leader of the conservative faction on the board , told the Times after the vote .
" History has already been skewed .
Academia is skewed too far to the left . "
McLeroy 's day job ?
He 's not an educator or an historian -- he's a dentist .
Despite the fact that people like McLeroy might consider themselves experts , the Times noted that , " There were no historians , sociologists or economists consulted at the meetings . "
So , exactly what are some of the changes that these self - styled experts made to " correct " the curriculum -- which will remain in place for the next 10 years ?
Among other things , they are making sure students learn more about the heyday of U.S. conservatism by adding a plank about the importance of " the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s , including Phyllis Schlafly , the Contract With America , the Heritage Foundation , the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association . "
As historian Eric Foner noted in The Nation , there 's nothing wrong with students learning about the conservative movement .
But the new historical " standards " are a thinly veiled excuse to expose students to right - wing propaganda -- and a worldview that glorifies capitalism , social conservatism , American military might , nationalism and any number of other pet causes of the right .
As Foner wrote :
Judging from the updated social studies curriculum , conservatives want students to come away from a Texas education with a favorable impression of : women who adhere to traditional gender roles , the Confederacy , some parts of the Constitution , capitalism , the military and religion .
They do not think students should learn about women who demanded greater equality ; other parts of the Constitution ; slavery , Reconstruction and the unequal treatment of nonwhites generally ; environmentalists ; labor unions ; federal economic regulation ; or foreigners ...
The changes seek to reduce or elide discussion of slavery , mentioned mainly for its " impact " on different regions and the coming of the Civil War .
A reference to the Atlantic slave trade is dropped in favor of " triangular trade . "
Jefferson Davis 's inaugural address as president of the Confederacy will now be studied alongside Abraham Lincoln 's speeches .
YET THE Republicans on the board are not only attempting to indoctrinate students with an interpretation of historical events that are in many cases patently false .
They 're also out to polish the image of social conservatism by taking credit where credit is most certainly not due .
This effort includes new standards on teaching the civil rights movement .
Under the new rules , " textbooks would mention the votes in Congress on civil rights legislation , which Republicans supported . "
" Republicans need a little credit for that , " McLeroy commented to the Times .
" I think it 's going to surprise some students . "
Sure , the Republicans can be proud of their party 's history on civil rights -- back when it was the party of Abe Lincoln .
But that 's not what the board members had in mind .
And it 's a good bet that Republican " achievements " in civil rights wo n't include discussion of prominent civil rights opponents like Barry Goldwater or , whoops , George H.W. Bush , who campaigned against the 1964 Civil Rights
Act when he was running for the Senate .
They likely wo n't be mentioning that , while running for governor in 1966 , Ronald Reagan encouraged the repeal of the Fair Housing Act .
He explained why : " If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house , it is his right to do so . "
In addition , Texas school kids will now be learning history that 's even whiter than before .
According to the Dallas Morning News , Peter Marshall -- an evangelical minister who was one of six handpicked " experts " who advised the board on the changes -- spoke out last year against inclusion of both United Farm Workers organizer Cesar Chavez and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall , the first African American justice on the Court .
Hispanic board members were largely defeated on proposals to include more Latino role models .
According to the New York Times , one member of the board , Mary Helen Berlanga , left the meeting in protest , saying of her fellow board members : " They can just pretend this is a white America and Hispanics do n't exist ... They are going overboard , they are not experts , they are not historians .
They are rewriting history , not only of Texas but of the United States and the world . "
Another change -- this one personally pushed by McLeroy would , in the words of the New York Times , " ensure that students study the violent philosophy of the Black Panthers in addition to the nonviolent approach of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . "
Abolitionist Harriet Tubman has been removed as an example of " good citizenship " for third graders in favor of Red Cross founder Clara Barton .
( Although the board did include Helen Keller -- presumably only because they were unaware that Keller was a dedicated socialist and anti-imperialist . )
Progressives are , naturally , targets for the new standards .
One of the newly approved changes mandates that students study " the unintended consequences " ( presumably negative ) of the Great Society legislation , affirmative action and Title IX legislation .
And socialists and communists are particularly vilified in an amendment that requires that the history of McCarthyism now include " how the later release of the Venona papers confirmed suspicions of communist infiltration in U.S. government . "
There you go ... the Red Scare and McCarthysm were entirely justified .
Why ?
Because a dentist and other members of the Texas Board of Education say so .
The benefits of capitalism as an economic system are also to be reinforced .
The revisions add Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek to the usual list of economists to be studied .
And , because of its " negative connotation , " the term " capitalism " is being replaced with " free - enterprise system . "
( One imagines that a few too many members of the board might have been called " capitalist pigs " in their time . )
Even poor Thomas Jefferson did n't pass muster for the Texas board .
He was cut from a list of people whose writings inspired 18th and 19th century revolutions -- and replaced with St. Thomas Aquinas , John Calvin and William Blackstone .
The reason ?
Conservatives did n't want to emphasize Jefferson 's pesky belief in the necessity of a wall of separation between church and state .
In another of the more ridiculous amendments , Republican board member Cynthia Dunbar unsuccessfully tried to strike from the standards any reference to the Scopes " monkey trial " that put teaching about evolution on trial .
Dunbar also sought to eliminate the famed defense attorney Clarence Darrow as well as the Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey .
AS MAVIS Knight , a Democrat on the Texas Board of Education , told the New York Times , " The social conservatives have perverted accurate history to fulfill their own agenda . "
But the new conservative history " standards " on Texas are hardly an anomaly .
Witness Virginia , for example , where Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell recently declared April to be " Confederate history month . "
In his proclamation " honoring " soldiers who fought on the side of the South , however , McDonnell made one small omission : he neglected to say a word the institution of slavery or about the millions of slaves who lives and labor built the South .
According to the Washington Post , McDonnell justified his omission by claiming that " there were any number of aspects to that conflict between the states .
Obviously , it involved slavery .
It involved other issues .
But I focused on the ones I thought were most significant for Virginia . "
Funny that McDonnell did n't realize that slavery might be significant to the African Americans who can trace their roots to human chattel brought to plantations in Virginia .
Unfortunately , it 's not just Texas kids who may suffer the consequences of their new curriculum .
Texas is one of the largest buyers of textbooks in the country -- which means that the curriculum changes could be forced into other states ' textbooks , since larger - selling books are generally cheaper , an attractive feature to cash - strapped school districts .
" The books that are altered to fit the standards become the bestselling books , and therefore within the next two years they 'll end up in other classrooms , " Fritz Fischer , chairman of the National Council for History Education , told the Washington Post .
" It 's not a partisan issue , it 's a good history issue . "
The irony , of course , is that while the right wing harps endlessly about how leftists " indoctrinate " children with left - wing ideas through liberal education " biases , " the revisions to the Texas curriculum are a blatant ideological attack designed to reach the minds of kids and teens .
With right - wing social conservatism largely discredited , and poll after poll showing young people to be more liberal than previous generations on a host of social issues , it 's not surprising why conservatives might be desperate to push back in whatever way they can .
But just because conservative ideas are enshrined in textbooks does n't guarantee that their ideas will gain more currency .
As Howard Zinn put it in a 2005 essay " Changing minds , one at a time , " presenting a people 's history requires breaking down the barriers that keep ordinary people from feeling as though we can not only study history , but make it :
It is a challenge not just for the teachers of the young to give them information they will not get in the standard textbooks , but for everyone else who has an opportunity to speak to friends and neighbors and work associates , to write letters to newspapers , to call in on talk shows .
The history is powerful : the story of the lies and massacres that accompanied our national expansion , first across the continent victimizing Native Americans , then overseas as we left death and destruction in our wake in Cuba , Puerto Rico , Hawaii , and especially the Philippines .
The long occupations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic , the repeated dispatch of Marines into Central America , the deaths of millions of Koreans and Vietnamese , none of them resulting in democracy and liberty for those people .
Add to all that the toll of the American young , especially the poor , Black and white , a toll measured not only by the corpses and the amputated limbs , but the damaged minds and corrupted sensibilities that result from war .
Those truths make their way , against all obstacles , and break down the credibility of the warmakers , juxtaposing what reality teaches against the rhetoric of inaugural addresses and White House briefings .
The work of a movement is to enhance that learning , make clear the disconnect between the rhetoric of " liberty " and the photo of a bloodied little girl , weeping .
And also to go beyond the depiction of past and present , and suggest an alternative to the paths of greed and violence .
All through history , people working for change have been inspired by visions of a different world .
It is possible , here in the United States , to point to our enormous wealth and suggest how , once not wasted on war or siphoned off to the super - rich , that wealth can make possible a truly just society .
The juxtapositions wait to be made ... The false promises of the rich and powerful about " spreading liberty " can be fulfilled , not by them , but by the concerted effort of us all , as the truth comes out , and our numbers grow .
And that 's a fact that even the Texas Board of Education can't write out of history .
The South African government has just allocated 2 million rands ( approximately $ 270,000 ) to set up an anti-poaching unit .
According to Buyelwa Sonjica , the water and environment minister , 55 rhinos have already been killed in South Africa this year for horns .
The major focus for this National Wildlife Reaction Unit will be Kruger National Park as well as other reserves in the KwaZulu - Natal Province .
300 prosecutors and 200 magistrates have also been trained in environmental crimes in preparation for the opening of a new court dedicated to just that .

Few things have influenced product politics as much as 80 Plus Gold .
Seasonic was the first manufacturer to list power supplies on its homepage meeting the EPRI ( Electrical Power Research Institute ) guidelines , and they presented their first certified models at CeBIT 2009 .
With the recently launched X - series , Seasonic aims to prove the marketability of 80 Plus Gold PSUs .
We have the 750W model for review today , so let 's see how it measures up .
Is it a great new PSU , or is 80 Plus Gold simply a new way to increase prices ?
Beyond the remarkable efficiency and high - quality technology , the power supply contains a fully modular cable system and makes a good impression with its simple elegance .
The X - Series also includes " hybrid silent fan control " , which regulates the three speed settings of the fan .
The power supply runs completely silent up to 20 % load , at which point the fan begins to rotate slowly ; at higher loads fan speed increases again to enable sufficient cooling .
Seasonic uses a PWM fan to allow graceful ramping up of fan speeds , which we will cover later in this review .
Beyond the various certifications and features , this ATX 2.3 power supply offers a 5 - year manufacturer warranty and uses active PFC to allow its use on all the major power grid standards .
Enermax delivered good results in our previous test with the latest Pro87 + / Modu87 + series , and it will likely be Seasonic 's main competition .
Of particular note is that the noise levels of the Pro87 + and Modu87 + are extremely quiet throughout the load range .
Enermax also delivers products catering to the midrange 500W market , but we will have to wait until summer for Seasonic 's answer .
When the other models are ready , Seasonic let us know that they will have PSUs rated below 500W for those that do n't run a high - power system .
We should also see additional manufacturers soon with their own 80 Plus Gold offerings , so it remains to be seen who will have the best product .
Apart from the marketing hype , we 'll need to see new features in order to surpass the competition .
The X - Series has an MSRP of $ 200 for the 750W unit we 're reviewing , but you can find it online starting at $ 180 .
So let 's see if this expensive power supply is worth the money and if Seasonic can achieve new efficiency levels .
We will also look at the construction , voltage output , and the unusual topology ; high efficiency is n't the only point of interest with the X - Series .

It 's now a truism – among oil companies , and governments alike – that even in an age when we risk catastrophic climate change , and its attendant catastrophes such as we 've seen in the Gulf of Mexico this week , oil exploration is an inevitable part of our future .
It may be a truism , but is it true ?
As former Shell CEO Jeroen van der Veer has said several times , the era of " easy oil " is over .
This means that the bulk of the oil that is left to exploit is to be found in the tar sands and in ultra - deep water and other marginal resources , such as the Arctic .
All of these resources are very expensive to produce , require long lead - in times to bring on - stream and , in many cases , have controversial environmental and social impacts that will cost more to ameliorate .
Even without addressing the social and environmental costs , the break - even point for these kinds of oil projects is close to the ceiling at which oil prices could be sustained by the global economy .
At between $ 65 and $ 90 a barrel , the room for long - term profitability appears slender .
With the global economy remaining in a fragile state and oil prices rallying , it 's important to ask whether the economy can withstand further price increases , not to mention whether the climate can sustain further growth in carbon emissions .
Will the expense of bringing this oil to market mean that the sustained oil prices needed to produce the oil will also consistently drive the global economy back into recession ?
At the launch of BP 's most recent Statistical Review of World Energy in early June 2009 , BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said that as the oil price went over $ 90 , consumers " began to change their behaviour " and that there was significant " elasticity of demand above $ 100 a barrel " .
In other words , if it costs too much , we can't – and wo n't – buy it .
The difference between the recovery periods following previous oil shocks and the current one is that a significant proportion of today 's oil demand is in permanent decline .
This particularly applies to developed countries where demand for oil is past its peak .
In other words , this recession has triggered demand destruction , not demand suppression .
It 's possible the day of " peak oil " has arrived – but not in the way everyone expected .
Instead of peak oil , we 're looking at a peak in demand for oil .
The oil age wo n't end tomorrow , but the idea that it will go on for ever – with its attendant catastrophes and tragedies – is seriously in question .
Against this backdrop , the economic case for investing in clean technology becomes as clear as the environmental case .
The faster we introduce efficiency in the transport sector , making better cars that use less fuel , adopting cutting - edge hybrid technology and pushing vehicle electrification , the faster the oil industry of the last century will be replaced by the cleaner , safer and economically more sound industries of today .

It 's like 2007 all over again :
The world is waiting with bated breath for someone to step up to Apple .
Last time it was to answer the iPhone .
This time , the iPad .
Here 's what we want to see .
Advertisement
All signs point to the first — and most — attractive competitors to the iPad running Android , which sets up the next few months to be eerily familiar .
Flash back to late 2007 , when smartphone makers were formulating their responses to Apple 's iPhone .
Then , we were waiting for Android .
Today , once again , we are waiting for Android .
Google 's first try at smartphonery , carried out at their behest by HTC and T - Mobile , fell short in a handful of ways .
But by and large , it was a great start , and led to some of the best handsets money can buy today .
The stage is set for this to happen again , but with a mature Android and a huge - scale test case to draw from , it should happen faster .
To use an immediately tired phrase , we want to see an iPad killer , and we want to see it soon .
Problem is , a lot of the current contenders look like they 're heading down the wrong path .
Here 's what they need :

Independence
Everyone 's got something to complain about with the iPad , but the most serious issue , as I see it , is existential :
The iPad can't exist on its own .
Before someone can even use an iPad , the first thing he or she must do is sync it with another computer ..
You ca n't subscribe to podcasts on the device .
It 's difficult to transfer non-video , non-audio documents to it .
There 's no visible file system .
In that crucial way , it really is just a giant iPod .
People want to use a tablet like a computer , not an accessory .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
By nature , Android is ready to better iPhone OS on the independence front — it 's a sync - less OS , slurping down data from the cloud , and at no point demanding to be connected to a host machine .
Apps can access a folder - style file system , and from which they can open and save documents .
Android , the phone OS , has laid a lot of the groundwork for an independent tablet , but it needs work .
We 've lamented Android 's lack of a syncing app in the past , mainly because the multimedia situation on Android is conspiciously lacking .
There 's no user - friendly ( and I mean stupid - simple , grandparent - proof ) way to transfer audio and video to your Android phone .
This could be rectified with a simple media sync app .
But for audio and video , the focus should be on media storefronts , and on - device media management .
The only time you should need to connect your Android tablet to another computer is if you want to move specific media from that device to your tablet , the same way you might want to copy your music library to a new laptop .
Once that 's done , you should be able to maintain the tablet without connecting to a PC , or worrying about sync .

Accessories
If the ideal Android tablet exists as a computer , not an accessory , it needs accessories of its own .
The iPad 's accessory situation is tightly controlled , and to be honest , pretty grim .
Give your Android tablet a pair of USB ports that can act as hosts , and let us connect keyboards , mass storage , and even Android phones .
Advertisement
Android is already equipped to accept mass storage in the form of microSD cards , so adding another form of easily attachable mass storage should be trivial .
To be able to take your coworker 's thumb drive , plug it into your tablet and open its contents on your device is vital .
The iPad can't do this .
Android tablets should .

Media Support
The fact that Android has severely limited video codec support is less of a problem on a phone , because , well , it 's a phone .
But if you can't watch video on a tablet , it 's basically useless .
Advertisement
As much as video playback it touted on the iPad , Apple 's tablet is n't actually that good at playing video .
The only videos on my hard drive that would sync with my iPad were videos I 'd either a. ) purchased from iTunes , or b. ) exported from i Movie. c. )
Ripped or converted specifically to be played on my iPhone or iPad , using handbrake .
Dumb !
So , Google : codecs .
Let me play my Xvid and Divx videos .
Do n't choke on any file ending in " .avi . "
The Android tablet should take my videos and play them back , no questions asked .
Hell , if I can run a torrent client on the device , I should be able to play back my loot .

Apple 's Mistakes Are Google's Gain
When Apple decided to create a tablet by blowing up a phone , rather than shrinking down a laptop , they 'd made the right choice .
It was the right choice because it gave us a device with all - day battery life , a UI sensibility designed around finger input , and a massive app ecosystem .
But Apple took the tablet - as - a - large - phone philosophy too far , failing to address some of its mobile OS 's worst limitations — limitations that do n't make sense for a tablet .
Advertisement
Google , and tablet makers , this is your chance .
Dell can't do it alone , nor can Google .
But a serious effort by Google and its partners to give us these painfully obvious features in their first answers to the iPad could , for once , trump Apple in the first wave .
Bring on the iPad killers .
Eurozone leaders agreed a deal to help Greece last month
The euro has jumped and stock markets have risen on reports that eurozone leaders have agreed the details of a plan to rescue debt - ridden Greece .
Leaders had finally agreed an interest rate at which to lend money to Greece , should it be needed , the reports said .
As a result , the euro gained more than 1 cent on the dollar , to $ 1.3466 , while the Athens stock exchange rose 3.4 % .
This was despite the fact that leading ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greek government debt earlier on Friday .
Other leading European markets also gained ground , with the UK's FTSE 100 index up 1 % , Germany 's Dax gaining 1.3 % and France 's Cac 40 rising 1.8 % .
The in US , the main Dow Jones index briefly breached 11,000 points for the first time in 18 months , before closing up 0.6 % at 10,997 .
The euro also rose slightly against the pound , to 87.630 pence .
Loan deal Last month , the EU and IMF announced plans to provide a 22 bn - euro ( £ 20 bn ; $ 29.5 bn ) safety net that could be drawn on should Greece be unable to raise the funds it needs to pay off its debts .
But this did little to calm investors ' nerves as few details of how the plan would work were revealed .
Now if the euro was a company , the Greek division would be closed or sold off .
The product line had not lived up to expectations .
It was important therefore to protect the core business .
Other weaker divisions might have to go too .
Gavin Hewitt , Europe editor
Read Gavin 's blog in full
There were even concerns that disagreements between eurozone partners about the precise details of any rescue package may not be resolved .
As a result , the cost of borrowing on the financial markets for the Greek government kept on rising , reaching record levels of 7.5 % on Thursday .
Reports now suggest that eurozone leaders have agreed a rate at which to lend money to Athens , which means it will not have to rely on raising funds in the financial markets .
This will be lower than the market rate , making it cheaper for Greece to borrow money .
Ratings downgrade Although Greece still maintains it does not plan to turn to its eurozone partners and the IMF for any loans , investors now believe it will have little choice .
Fitch downgraded Greece 's credit rating by two notches , from BBB + to BBB - , amid growing fears the country will not be able to resolve its debt problems without help .
The BBB - rating is significant , as this is the lowest rating that qualifies as an investment grade bond .
Any further downgrade would mean Greece losing its investment grade status with Fitch .
Share prices in Athens have been hit by the uncertainty
If the two other major credit rating agencies , Standard & Poor 's and Moody's , were to follow Fitch 's lead , then a lot of big institutional fund managers , such as pension funds , would not be allowed to invest in Greek debt .
Greece is currently rated BBB + by Standard & Poor 's and A2 by Moody's .
Help needed
The downgrade put more pressure on Greece to resolve its debt crisis quickly , and came as leading investors called for Greece to seek financial help .
" Now is the time to put some money on the table , " John Stopford , co-head of fixed income at Investec , told the BBC .
" We are getting down to two options - an IMF package of financial support or organised debt restructuring . "
His comments were echoed by Alistair Newton , strategist at Nomura Securities , who said it was " increasingly likely " that the Greek government would ask for a rescue from the EU and IMF .
A bail - out was likely to come before the end of May , he told the BBC .
The current volatility in the money markets would continue until that happened , he said , making Greece 's current strategy of borrowing its way out of trouble unfeasible .

Washington ( CNN ) -- The Pentagon and U.S. Central Command are updating military plans to strike Iran 's nuclear sites , preparing up - to - date options for the president in the event he decides to take such action , an Obama administration official told CNN Sunday .
The effort has been underway for several weeks and comes as there is growing concern across the administration 's national security team that the president needs fresh options ready for his approval if he were to decide on a military strike , according to the official who is familiar with the effort .
The official did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the work being conducted .
Meanwhile , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continued to amp up his rhetoric against the West on Sunday , claiming that Iran is so powerful today that no country would dare attack it .
" Iran 's army is so mighty today that no enemy can have a foul thought of invading Iran 's territory , " the Iranian leader said in a speech , according to state media .
The Iranian leader has had choice words for Obama and other Western leaders , especially after not receiving an invitation to the nuclear summit hosted in Washington last week .
Obama has been pressing the U.N. Security Council to slap Iran with tougher sanctions for its nuclear ambitions .
Iran says that its nuclear program is intended for civilian purposes .
In January , Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote a classified memo to the White House raising concerns about whether the administration had a sufficient policy in place , along with military options , for stopping Iran 's progress in getting a nuclear weapon , the official confirmed .
The memo was first reported Sunday in the New York Times .
Gates spokesman Geoff Morrell initially declined to confirm the memo , but Gates said later Sunday in a written statement , " The New York Times sources who revealed my January memo to the National Security Advisor mischaracterized its purpose and content .
" With the administration 's pivot to a pressure track on Iran earlier this year , the memo identified next steps in our defense planning process where further interagency discussion and policy decisions would be needed in the months and weeks ahead , " Gates said .
" The memo was not intended as a ' wake up call ' or received as such by the president 's national security team .
Rather , it presented a number of questions and proposals intended to contribute to an orderly and timely decision making process .
" There should be no confusion by our allies and adversaries that the United States is properly and energetically focused on this question and prepared to act across a broad range of contingencies in support of our interests . "
The planning effort for potential strikes against Iran actually has been underway for some time , the official said .
In December , Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told his planners he did n't believe they were taking " seriously enough " the need for fresh thinking about how to attack Iran 's nuclear sites if the president ordered such a strike , the official said .
" He wanted to create a higher sense of urgency to create military options for the president , " the official said .
Mullen " wanted a more robust planning effort to provide the president with options , should he choose a military option , " he said .
The official strongly emphasized that the U.S. military is always updating plans in order to be ready for the president .
If Obama were to order a strike against Iran , he would turn to Mullen , Gates and Gen. David Petraeus , the head of Central Command , for their advice on how to proceed .
The official would not discuss how any of the updated plans might differ from previously existing military strike options .
Mullen and other Pentagon officials have continuously endorsed diplomacy as the preferred option against Iran .
In February Mullen publicly noted that a military strike against Iran 's nuclear program would not be " decisive " and would only delay and set back Iran 's efforts .
Gates recently expressed growing concern about understanding exactly what Iran 's intentions may be .
" How you differentiate , how far have they gone .
If their policy is to go to the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon , how do you tell that they have not assembled ?
So it becomes a serious verification question .
And I do n't actually know how you would verify that , " Gates said on NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
" So they are continuing to make progress on these programs .
It 's going slow -- slower than they anticipated , but they are moving in that direction , " he said .
In general , the U.S. military develops what is sometimes called targeting " folders . "
These files detail all the known facts and intelligence about a target , include precise location , how deeply buried it might be , the civilian population surrounding the target , the geology of the land and rock around the area , and detailed options about which U.S. weapons might be best used to destroy it .
The U.S. intelligence community is also currently involved in the updated planning effort , providing the latest assessments about Iran 's nuclear progress at various sites around the Islamic republic .
There have been several public hints about the new target planning .
Last week , a Pentagon official told the Senate Armed Services Committee in a written statement , " Through prudent military planning we continue to refine options to protect U.S. and partner interests from Iranian aggression , deter Iran 's destabilizing behavior , and prepare for contingencies . "
Back in December , Mullen deliberately , the official said , made a reference to Iran in a public document called " the chairman 's guidance , " posted on the Internet saying , " should the president call for military options , we must have them ready . "
There have been growing signs of Iranian efforts to militarily protect their nuclear sites .
The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency notes that last year Iran established a separate air defense force , with the stated intention of defending nuclear sites with missiles and air defense radars .
Even from a short distance away , the fake military hardware looks just like the real thing .
The models are used on battlefield positions to protect Russian strategic installations from the eagle eyes of surveillance satellites .
Their main task is to distract attention and protect real combat units from strikes

Rome , Italy ( CNN ) --
A train derailment in northern Italy has killed nine people , Italy 's Civil Protection office said Monday .
The office had said that the derailment killed 11 people , but it later revised the death toll .
At least 20 people were injured , five seriously , when a landslide derailed the train , authorities said .
The train was a small diesel train with two carriages , traveling on the Val Venosta line .
The railway is one of the region 's newest , inaugurated in 2005 .

The most probable cause of the landslide is a broken irrigation pipe , said Thomas Widmann , head of the transport department for the local government .
The mud from the slide entered the train 's cars , suffocating the passengers , he said .
More than 200 rescuers were on the scene .
The train came to rest when it reached the trunk of two big trees , according to a local journalist .
One of the carriages was left hanging over the Adige River .

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 403- 11 to advance sanctions against Iran .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , who correctly identified the sanctions as motion toward an “ act of war ” , and Dennis Kucinich , who said they would only harm the Iranian people and fuel anti-American sentiments , were among the minority vote .
Their verbal statements in opposition before the House .
Dr. Paul ( 5:31 ) :
Rep. Kucinich ( 2:23 ) :
Dr. Paul ’s submitted statement :
I rise in opposition to this motion to instruct House conferees on H.R. 2194 , the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions , Accountability and Divestment Act , and I rise in strong opposition again to the underlying bill and to its Senate version as well .
I object to this entire push for war on Iran , however it is disguised .
Listening to the debate on the Floor on this motion and the underlying bill it feels as if we are back in 2002 all over again : the same falsehoods and distortions used to push the United States into a disastrous and unnecessary one - trillion - dollar war on Iraq are being trotted out again to lead us to what will likely be an even more disastrous and costly war on Iran .
The parallels are astonishing .
We hear war advocates today on the Floor scare - mongering about reports that in one year Iran will have missiles that can hit the United States .
Where have we heard this bombast before ?
Anyone remember the claims that Iraqi drones were going to fly over the United States and attack us ?
These “ drones ” ended up being pure propaganda — the U.N. chief weapons inspector concluded in 2004 that there was no evidence that Saddam Hussein had ever developed unpiloted drones for use on enemy targets .
Of course by then the propagandists had gotten their war so the truth did not matter much .
We hear war advocates on the floor today arguing that we cannot afford to sit around and wait for Iran to detonate a nuclear weapon .
Where have we heard this before ?
Anyone remember then - Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice ’s oft - repeated quip about Iraq , that we cannot wait for the smoking gun to appear as a mushroom cloud ?
We need to see all this for what it is : Propaganda to speed us to war against Iran for the benefit of special interests .
Let us remember a few important things .
Iran , a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , has never been found in violation of that treaty .
Iran is not capable of enriching uranium to the necessary level to manufacture nuclear weapons .
According to the entire U.S. Intelligence Community , Iran is not currently working on a nuclear weapons program .
These are facts , and to point them out does not make one a supporter or fan of the Iranian regime .
Those pushing war on Iran will ignore or distort these facts to serve their agenda , though , so it is important and necessary to point them out .
Some of my well - intentioned colleagues may be tempted to vote for sanctions on Iran because they view this as a way to avoid war on Iran .
I will ask them whether the sanctions on Iraq satisfied those pushing for war at that time .
Or whether the application of ever - stronger sanctions in fact helped war advocates make their case for war on Iraq : as each round of new sanctions failed to “ work ” — to change the regime — war became the only remaining regime - change option .
This legislation , whether the House or Senate version , will lead us to war on Iran .
The sanctions in this bill , and the blockade of Iran necessary to fully enforce them , are in themselves acts of war according to international law .
A vote for sanctions on Iran is a vote for war against Iran .
I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to turn back from this unnecessary and counterproductive march to war .

Subject : Stepping down as SPU backend maintainer
Hi , I am stepping down as the spu backend maintainer since Sony removed GNU / Linux ( OtherOS ) support from their newer PS3 firmware .
The main reason is I will no longer have access to a machine to support the target .
But really this is also a step backwards for free software support from Sony .

Importanti nuove indiscrezioni sul prossimo iPhone emergono all 'orizzonte .
Gizmodo , infatti , pare sia entrato in possesso , dietro cospicuo pagamento , di un prototipo vero di iPhone 4G di Apple .
Ovviamente a Cupertino non sono affatto contenti , tuttavia ecco le prime foto e video .
C'è grande attesa e molto interesse , soprattutto da parte dei " filo - Apple " , per il debutto del prossimo iPhone , atteso tra due mesi .
La futura variante del Melafonino si chiamerà iPhone 4G ( nome probabilmente seguito dalla dicitura " HD " ) .
In questi giorni non solo sono apparse su internet notizie spesso contrastanti dal punto di vista hardware del dispositivo ( fotocamera da 5 oppure 8 MegaPixel , possibilità di girare video in HD , ... ) e giudicate da molti poco veritiere ed ottimistiche , ma anche delle prime foto relative ad un presunto prototipo di questo dispositivo .
Decisamente più ragionevolmente veritieri gli scatti fotografici proposti dal loro principale divulgatore : Gizmodo .
A sinistra , nella foto seguente , vediamo il nuovo iPhone , a destra l'attuale 3Gs :
Gizmodo , infatti , pare sia riuscito ad entrare in possesso di un prototipo .
Una strana vicenda che ha ancora tanto da svelare , ambientata in un borgo americano e a quanto pare in una birreria nella quale i fiumi di birra sembrano aver fatto dimenticare all ' ingegnere Apple di turno il prezioso 4G , camuffato nella scocca di un 3 Gs , nel bar .
Ma i guai sono dietro l'angolo : l'ufficio legale di Apple , infatti , ha in un certo senso confermato la validità di tali riprese poichè ha intimato al sito web di restituire immediatamente il maltolto .
Ecco il video realizzato e divulgato da Gizmodo ; finora oltre all 'estetica sembrano noti soltanto dimensioni e peso del device ( il telefono misura 11.43 x 5,87 x 0,94 cm e pesa 140 grammi ) .
Nella clip pubblicata su YouTube è possibile apprezzare maggiormente i caratteri estetici del device .
Probabilmente ( si spera ! ) stavolta non si verificherà un suicidio così come accaduto ad un dipendente Foxconn , che produce gli iPhone , per aver , a suo tempo , perso uno dei sedici prototipi che gli erano stati affidati ...
Ovviamente è bene precisare che , benchè allo stato attuale il reale prototipo di iPhone 4G sia questo , non sono escluse possibili variazioni nel design più o meno significative fino al debutto ufficiale che dovrebbe avvenire verso la fine di giugno 2010 .
Now that the diffusers have become so much more important , the whole floor of the car has a much increased importance towards the efficiency of the whole car .
Renault have n't missed out on that aspect and have added a double floor to its R30 .
The team introduced a huge aerodynamic step at Sepang , including new sidepod panels , barge boards , a modified diffuser and a double splitter .
Apart from its normal function of splitting air from in between the front wheels to the left and right sidepod , the new device also marks the beginning of a double floor .
Right above the reference plane is now an open area of about 3 cm high .
Looking closely at the image you can also see that this floor space is extending under the side impact crash structures and under the whole width of the sidepod .
While it is not perfectly clear yet how this air channel is used , the diffuser update that came with it suggests that this is used to feed on of the upper channels of the rear diffuser .
Just as with the underbody airflow , the stream in this channel will be accelerated due to the expansion that happens in the diffuser .
As such , air is sucked from the front of the channel , reducing drag at the front while increasing downforce at the rear end of the car .
We 've all come across that quote , right ?
From the moment that the door was wedged open , the software patent debate was
never going to be resolved purely on the basis of a valid and prevailing
argument against their existence .
There are several reasons for this [ in no particular order ]
1. The US Domestic Lobby ( Monopoly Guarantee )
From the perspective of a non-US Citizen , the impression one gets of US politics
is that the lobby group with the biggest budget tends to get to write the laws
and make the rules .
That may be inaccurate and unkind , but in the US , the UK and
many other so - called " democracies " , the rules seem to be written
during shady deals , behind closed doors .
For software patents , this means that
companies including Oracle , Microsoft , Adobe , IBM , Intel and others are able to
use their combined patent arsenal to prevent new players from muscling on to
their turf .
Whatever software patents were intended to provide , they are instead
being used for exclusionary tactics .
Unless or until that capability is removed ,
software patents are here to stay .
2. The International Effect
The US likes to think of itself as a " world leader " .
If the US can
convince other countries that software patents are a good thing ( just look at
the lobbying happening in Europe at the moment ) then automatically all those
thousands of US software patents go global in scope .
Domination of the US
software marketplace becomes " Global Domination of Software ) and the
software patent system will be used to exclude competition the world over .
3 . The ( Lack Of ) Doomsday Effect
As the report says , software patents have been around since the mid-1990s .
The
world as we know it has n't ended .
Yes , large companies have spent more money on
patent lawyers .
If they did n't spend it on patent law , they would only have
spent it on something else , anyway .
Simply because we have n't had a meltdown ,
anyone opposed to software patents is going to face an uphill struggle that gets
harder with ever passing day .
4. The Unprovable Negative Effect
Remember " The Art of ' No ' Management " ?
It 's the idea that if a Manager
says " No " to every request received , they can get by just fine .
If
they refuse spending on an item and no disaster occurs , then their strategy of
inaction is proven .
If they refuse spending and something does go wrong , there
is still no concrete proof that the spending would have solved the problem
anyway .
In translation : merely saying " It would be better without software
patents " is an unprovable position and therefore an untenable one .
For the above 4 reasons , we may have to accept that software patents are going
to be around for a while .
But that does not mean that it has to be the end of
the world .
Unpalatable though it may be , it 's possible that there are analogies between
software patents and nuclear weapons .
The Cold War brought us " MAD " -
Mutually Assured Destruction - the idea that if one side ( Western Allies or
Soviets ) pressed the nuclear button , the result would be the end of life on
earth .
Because of that no -win position , nobody pushed the nuclear button ( at
least , not yet ) .
The software patent argument is more subtle than this , because
it * is* possible for a company with a large software portfolio to attack a
smaller rival with relative impunity .
I see one potential scenario in which the strangle - hold of software patents may
be broken , but it 's unlikely and may be unpalatable to many .
It would occur if a major country - like China or India , for example - realised
that it could have a flourishing and productive software industry and that the
only thing holding it back was the US dominance of software patents .
If that nation - or a group of nations - were able to go before the WTO - World
Trade Organisation - and say , " Look , if the US wants to play silly with
software patents on US soil , that 's their call , but we wo n't have this imposed
internationally ... " then by insisting on sticking with software patents ,
the US would potentially place herself at a disadvantage when trading with other
countries .
Those nations not so encumbered would encourage innovation in
software , until such time as the local product out - performed US technology .
That
would create the tipping point that would result in the collapse of the US
software industry ...
Unfortunately , that scenario is extremely unlikely to ever happen ( I fear that
US dominance of international institutions including the WTO and World Bank is
too strong ) .
But without it , the free software world faces a considerable and rising
challenge .
There is likely one more thing that software patents have in common
with nuclear weapons .
Just as the " fuel " or " munition " in
nuclear weapons is an incredibly toxic and lethal poison that cannot be safely
dismantled , with an effective lifespan of tens of thousands of years , so the
likely fallout from a few years of software patents could easily have
far - reaching effects , particularly in areas we may not easily foresee .
Here 's a completely different example of monopolistic effect ...
In the UK , £ 4
out of every £ 7 spent on the " high street " goes to a retail company
called Tesco .
They own and operate supermarkets and other stores .
Over the last
20 years , the dominance of supermarkets has contributed to other changes in
society , including ...
1. High Streets have imploded .
Independent retailers and smaller stores have
been wiped out .
Choice has been removed and prices have risen drastically as a
result of the elimination of competition on the high street .
2 . Other markets have been impacted .
At first it was just food and groceries .
Then the supermarkets built gas stations on their land - to the extent that now
90 % of fuel in the UK is sold by just a tiny handful of vendors .
Another
no -choice , closed - rank cartel .
3. Suppliers have been squeezed or eliminated .
Farms , for example , have been
wiped out by supermarkets .
Farmers are forced to accept whatever prices the big
supermarket chains want to pay , trade at a loss and go bust .
The supermarkets
buy the farms and install cheap imported labour - and own the entire supply
chain .
They also have the political clout to influence planning decisions and
get permission to build on land that original , private farm holders could not
have achieved .
In short , in the last 15 years , although you can still buy food in the UK ,
choice has been seriously eroded , quality is no better , and a very small number
of organisations are making huge , huge profits .
But the really scary thing is
the immense control and influence that * food retailers * can have on the
distribution industry , the petroleum market , the clothing market , electronics
and " white goods " , farming , etc , etc , etc .
Dominance in one market
sector was leveraged and monopolized to the detriment of other things .
Likely that software is going to go the same way , with that process seriously
accelerated as a result of software patents .

Pristavkalar ( önlüklər , sözönləri ) sözün tərkib hissəsi olub rus dilinə məxsusdur .
Sözönləri xüsusən fellərdə çox işlənir .
Önlüklər kökdən əvvəl gələrək sözdüzəldici və sözd əyişdirici funksiya daşıyır .
Onların vasitəsi ilə düzələn sözlər yeni məna çalarlı olurlar .
Bəs rus dilində neçə pristavka vardır ?
Rus dilinə aşağ ıdakı pristavkalar məlumdur ( mötəriz ələrd ə bu və ya digər pristavkanın variantları , yəni forma müxtəlifliyi göstərilmişdir ) : Pristavkaların əksəriyyətinin əsas mənası hərəkətin istiqamətini bildirmək , habelə müxtəlif məkan münasibətləri ifadə etməkdir .
Məsələn , önlüyünün əsas mənası sözün kökündə adı çkilmiş hər hansı bir əşyanın , hərəkətin , hadisənin və s. inkarlığını , olmamasını , iştirak etməməsini bildirm əkdir .
Məs ələn :və s. Pristavkalar əsasən , yeni məna çalarlı sözlər əmələ gətirirlər .
Demək olar ki , lap az hallarda yalnız qrammatik məna daşıyır və söz formalarının əmələ gəlməsi məqsədi ilə işlədilir :və s. Siz bu önlüklərin mənalarını öyrənin , onları sözlərdə , söz birlə şmələrində və cümlə içərisində işlədin .
Yazılı və şifahi nitqin düzgünlüyü bu və ya digər pristavkanın öz yerində işlədilm əsindən də asılıdır .
Bunu nəzərə almaq lazımdır .
Bəzi pristavkalar çox sözlərlə işlənə bilir və yeni söz yaratmağa asanlıqla kömək edir .
Bunlaravə s. önlükləri misal ola bilər .
Digər qrup pristavkalara is ə nisbətən az sözlərdə təsadüf olunur .
Onlardan demək olar ki , yeni sözlərin düzəlməsi üçün istifadə edilmir .
Bu pristavkalar artıq sözün kökü ilə birlə şmiş , onun tərkib hissəsi olmuş və müasir rus dilində sözün tərkib hissələrinə görə təhlilində də kökdən ayrılmırlar .
Məsələn , ( sel , daşqın , güclü sel ) ;( ögey oğul , oğulluq ) ;( ulu baba , dədə - baba , əcdad ) ; ( böyük nənə ) ; ( alaqaranlıq , toran ) ; ( giltorpaq , gilli torpaq ) .
William F. Buckley was a Catholic and a staunch Conservative , and though many educated people found his attitudes annoying , he was clearly a brilliantly intelligent fellow .
Statistically speaking , though , it ’s a lot easier to find someone like Richard Dawkins or E.O. Wilson – brilliant folks who espouse ideas atheistic or liberal .
Satoshi Kanazawa , who seems to enjoy stirring things up , has posted a couple of blog entries on this topic , complete with graphs suggesting that people who say they are “ not at all religious ” have about 6 IQ points on those who say they are “ very religious , ” and that those who are “ very liberal ” have an average of about 12 IQ points over those who are “ very conservative . ”
If you ’re a liberal nonbeliever , those statistics are kinda fun to hear , bringing to mind comparisons between erudite well - educated liberal leaders such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as compared to less apparently stellar minds such as Sarah Palin and George Bush .
And it is tempting to speculate on what logical features of liberal or atheistic beliefs makes them especially appealing to intelligent people ( or conversely , what it is that makes the folks who voted for Sarah Palin and George Bush so illogical ) .
But let me offer a slightly less smug and rather simple possible explanation : highly intelligent people are simply playing a different strategy , and it ’s one that does n’t go well with being conservative or highly religious .
How does that work ?
The argument is one that was advanced , along with some supportive data , by my colleague Jason Weeden ( one of those overly educated types who has both a law degree and a Ph.D. in social psychology .
I ’ll leave it to you to guess what his political leanings are ) .
Here it is in a nutshell :
1. Smart people are more likely to go to college .
2 . If you are going to get a college degree , it helps to delay starting a family .
3. Smart people still have sexual drives .
4 . If you do n’t want to wait till you are in your mid- to late - 20s to start having , but are n’t ready to settle down , you have liberal attitudes about sexual behavior , birth control , and abortion .
On the other side of the coin , if you are not going to go to college , and you want to have a family early , you do n’t want a lot of promiscuous people running around – available unattached sexually experimenting people disrupt monogamous families .
Early reproducing women do n’t want those “ loose women ” hanging around tempting their husbands , because that means less resources for their children , and a possible .
Early reproducing men do n’t want promiscuous men lurking around , because they want to be sure that those children they ’re supporting are their own .
Weeden sees the game as a contest between “ dueling mating strategies ” linked to different life histories – one involves high investment in a few very educated children , the other involves lower investment in an earlier brood .
I ’ve discussed more about how this works in an earlier posting - Religious piety as a mating strategy .
There I describe some of Weeden ’s research demonstrating that sexual attitudes are at the core of conservative religious beliefs for Americans .
I also describe some experimental work supporting Weeden ’s ideas that he and I did with Jessica Li and Adam Cohen ( published just this month in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology ) .
If the argument is correct , though , it suggests that liberal nonbelievers adopt a certain set of attitudes not because they are more logically compelling , but because they serve a particular lifestyle and mating strategy .
Because liberals are more educated , they are better at expressing their ideas in compelling logical ways .
But although the beliefs on " our " side may seem more logical and enlightened , Weeden has abundant data to show that political and religious attitudes are less about logic than about serving one 's own reproductive .
Incidentally , I 'm NOT at all saying or implying that religion makes you stupid , or that mating strategy is all there is to religion ( for some additional thoughts , see : Jews , Jesuits , Geniuses : The IQ religion link is JUST a correlation ! ) .

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The US Army ’s surgeon general on Monday expressed concern about “ over - medication ” of soldiers returning from combat , saying the military is closely tracking how drugs are prescribed to troops .
The top medical officer in the army , Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker , said the increasing use of prescription drugs for soldiers recovering from combat duty in Iraq or Afghanistan reflected a wider trend in the country to treat pain primarily through medication .
ADVERTISEMENT
But he told reporters : “ I can tell you that we are concerned about over - medication . ”
The general said that “ we ’re very concerned about the panoply of drugs that are being used and the numbers of drugs that are being used . ”
“ We are monitoring it very , very closely , ” he said .
Prescription orders for psychiatric and pain medicines for troops have increased dramatically since 2001 , according to a Military Times report in March , with one in six service members on some form of psychiatric drug .
About 15 percent of soldiers said they had abused prescription drugs in the past month , according to a Pentagon survey carried out in 2008 and released in December .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lawmakers have urged the military to examine a possible link between a rise in suicides among troops and the use and abuse of prescription drugs .
Schoomaker said he had led a review looking at prescription drugs and his task force had promoted alternatives to pain killers , including “ yoga , meditation , acupuncture , movement therapy , lots of other ways of approaching pain management . ”
The army surgeon general made his comments at a news conference in which the he and other officers took issue with a New York Times account of a center in Colorado set up to help soldiers recover from mental or physical wounds in combat .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Times , citing interviews with soldiers and health care workers , described the “ warrior transition unit ” at Fort Carson and similar posts as “ warehouses of despair , where damaged men and women are kept out of sight , fed a diet of prescription pills and treated harshly by noncommissioned officers . ”
But Schoomaker said about 81 percent of all soldiers at the transition centers expressed satisfaction with their treatment and about 90 percent of the troops at the Fort Carson center said they were satisfied with the care they received .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ And even with 90 percent satisfaction you ’re going to have some people with very complex problems that are not going to be in that satisfied group , ” he said , referring to the Times report .
About 26 percent of the soldiers at the transition center in Fort Carson were on a prescribed narcotic , with a clinical pharmacist closely monitoring the prescriptions , Colonel Jimmie Keenan of the military hospital at Fort Carson , told reporters by telephone .

Text : Greenhouse gases account for only 5 - 10 per cent of global warming Turkus sue Panel on Climate Change predictionsTurun Sanomat 14.4 2010 01:30:40A
University of Turku Department of Physics study shows that carbon dioxide has a significantly smaller impact on global warming than previously thought .
Its results are based on spectrum analyses .
According to research led by Professor Jyrki Kauppinen , increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide accounts for only 5 - 10 per cent of the observed warming on Earth .
" The climate is warming , yes , but not because of greenhouse gases , " says Kauppinen .
According to him , projections made the UN climate panel , the International Panel on Climate Change , constitute a class - size error .
The IPPC 's calculated value is more than ten times larger than our calculated results , Kauppinen says .
He intends to publish his results in the June issue of the magazine Nature .
The UN Climate Panel claims that global warming is almost entirely the result of man-made carbon dioxide emissions .
[ Unintelligible : Kauppinen , climate kestääkin much higher emissions than the IPCC reports have been made to understand . ]
" I think it is such a blatant falsification , " Kauppinen says .
He is not the first IPCC critic .
The Panel has had to admit errors , including the melting of Himalayan glaciers , in its forecasts .
Causing a stir last year , Climategate came about as a result of computer hacking , which leaked e-mails between key IPCC researchers to the public .
The aim was to isolate and stigmatize climate change experts ; scientists are unconvinced .

Assailants have forcibly tattooed a word on a young man 's forehead during a bizarre and sustained assault at a Wollongong home .
The 18 - year - old was also assaulted with a baseball bat over several hours , causing serious injuries .
The attack took place when the man went to a home in Albion Park Rail , south of Wollongong , on February 23 , police said .
Police will not say what was tattooed on his forehead .
" He was also kicked and punched in a sustained assault , " police said in a statement .
The troubled US smartphones company Palm has put itself up for sale as it struggles to compete with the popularity of Apple 's iPhone and the ubiquitous BlackBerry .
The pioneer in developing hi-tech handheld organisers has called in Goldman Sachs and San Francisco - based Qatalyst Partners to look for a buyer and is seeking bids this week , according to a report by Bloomberg News that sent the company 's much maligned shares up by 17 % .
The move follows disappointing sales of Palm 's latest range of Pre and Pixi smartphones , which reached shops last year .
Events are likely to be closely watched by the U2 rock star Bono , whose investment firm Elevation Partners pumped $ 460 m ( £ 300 m ) into Palm in 2007 and 2008 , giving it a stake of roughly 30 % .
Founded in 1992 by neurologist Jeff Hawkins , Palm shot to prominence with its Palm Pilot devices , which allowed users to write on a screen using an electronic pen using a simplified graffiti language .
Initially simply electronic diaries and address books , Palm 's products evolved to incorporate phones and web browsers .
On its flotation in 2000 , Palm 's market value rocketed to an astonishing $ 53bn , exceeding the likes of McDonald 's and General Motors .
In recent years , Palm has struggled to find the marketing punch to land blows on bigger players such as Apple and Research in Motion .
Experts say US mobile phone partners failed to push Palm products particularly heavily to the public , despite decent reviews in the technology press .
" The problem is they just do n't have enough in the way of resources , " said Charles Wolf , a technology analyst at stockbroker Needham & Co .
" It 's unfortunate because the company has reasonably good products . "
Palm 's WebOS operating system is considered the company 's most valuable asset .
Rumoured buyers include hardware firms such as Taiwan 's HTC and the China 's Lenovo .
Wolf suggested interest could also come from Nokia or RIM , who could view Palm 's easy - to - use software as attractive in competing with the iPhone and with Android , which powers Google 's phones : " Palm 's software is in the same class as the iPhone and Android . "
Palm declined to comment .
Its chief executive , Jon Rubinstein , acknowledged last month that its performance had been " very disappointing " following a net loss of $ 18.5 m for the three months to February .
Palm 's shares , which were changing hands for $ 13 in January , perked up by 87 cents to $ 6.03 during early trading today , giving it a market capitalisation of just over $ 1bn .
The company has proved a disappointment for Elevation Partners , co-founded by Bono , which specialises in new media and entertainment and bet on a revival of Palm 's fortunes .
Elevation began investing when Palm 's stock was at $ 8.50 , though the firm 's injection of funds into Palm has been largely in return for convertible preference shares with a degree of protection against losses .

The Foreign Office was last night forced to issue a public apology after an official document suggested Britain should mark the Pope 's visit this year by asking him to open an abortion clinic , bless a gay marriage and launch a range of Benedict - branded condoms .
In a note , the official responsible for sending out the memo – a junior civil servant in his 20s – said : " Please protect ; these should not be shared externally .
The ' ideal visit ' paper in particular was the product of a brainstorm which took into account even the most far - fetched of ideas . "
Foreign secretary David Miliband was said to be " appalled " , and Britain 's ambassador to the Vatican , Francis Campbell , has met Holy See officials to voice the government 's regret .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " This is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect UK government or Foreign Office policy or views .
Many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill - judged , naive and disrespectful .
The text was not cleared or shown to ministers or senior officials before circulation .
As soon as senior officials became aware of the document , it was withdrawn . "

NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
A blazing oil rig sank Thursday into the Gulf of Mexico sparking fears of an environmental disaster almost two days after a massive blast that left 11 workers missing .
Oil fires had been raging on the Deepwater Horizon rig for more than 36 hours since a spectacular explosion late Tuesday that sent huge balls of flame leaping into the night sky .
ADVERTISEMENT
The US Coast Guard was frantically searching for those still missing after the other 115 workers on board the platform were brought safely back to the United States mainland and reunited with their families .
Thursday ’s sensational development brought fears of massive pollution from the stricken rig as it sank beneath the surface some 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) off the Louisiana coast , still apparently pumping oil .
Before the explosion there were 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel on board the semi-submersible platform and it had been drilling 8,000 barrels , or 336,000 gallons , of oil a day .
“ Worst case scenario , there is a potential environmental threat , ” Coast Guard spokeswoman Katherine McNamara told AFP .
Firefighting vessels had spewed out thick streams of water at the rig in a vain bid to control the blaze and keep the sharply tilting platform afloat as large columns of black smoke shot up into the sky .

Any pollution would be far smaller than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill , considered one of the worst man-made environmental disasters .
The Exxon Valdez poured nearly 11 million gallons of crude into Alaska ’s Prince William Sound , devastating some 750 miles ( 1,300 kilometers ) of its once pristine shores .
Rescue crews for the current disaster toiled throughout the night , scouring some 1,940 square miles ( 5,025 square kilometers ) of sea .
A helicopter and a plane resumed the aerial search at first light .

Seventeen workers were airlifted to hospital on Wednesday after suffering broken bones , burns and smoke inhalation in the explosion on the semi- submersible , mobile rig .
Four remained in critical condition .
But there was no sign of the missing workers and it remained unclear whether they made it safely into one of the rig ’s lifeboats .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We ’re going to continue to search as long as there is a reasonable probability of finding them alive , ” coast guard spokeswoman Ashley Butler told AFP , adding that weather conditions were favorable for the search .
After the blast , workers jumped up to 100 feet ( 30 meters ) into the water and scurried for safety , most of them making it to lifeboats to be picked up by rescuers and taken to Port Fourchon on the Louisiana mainland .
The 396 - by - 256 - foot ( 121 - by - 78 - meter ) platform , owned by Transocean , Ltd. and under contract to BP , was still ablaze but officials said environmental damage appeared to be minimal because the fire was burning much of the spilt fuel .

Transocean , based in Houston , Texas , is the world ’s largest offshore drilling contractor , with a fleet of 140 mobile offshore drilling units , in addition to three ultra - deepwater units under construction .
Transocean vice president Adrian Rose said the rig likely suffered a blowout while drilling through rock at oil giant BP ’s Macondo prospect , although investigations into the exact cause of the accident are ongoing .
A total of 126 people were onboard the platform at the time of the explosion , 79 of them Transocean staff , six BP personnel and 41 contractors .
Since then , it was rumoured that the collapse of a planned Oasis concert in Shanghai last year was because the band had played at a Free Tibet concert in New York in 1997 .
The Chinese government , however , blamed the financial worries of the promoter for the cancellation .
Earlier Rick Bookstabber wrote a good piece on why with everyone focusing on ignoring the commercial real estate disaster , the muni market is the next thing to appear out of left field and stun everyone with just how bad things really are domestically ( they are pretty horrendous in CRE too , and getting worse , but just because everyone is " aware " of this , somehow this is supposed to make things better ) .
Rick 's piece could not have come at a better time : LA 's controller Wendy Greuel just announced that she expects LA 's general fund to be " out of money " by May 10 , and that LA will likely deplete all reserve funds by the end of Q2 .
Hold on a second : was n't state Treasurer Lockyer saying just a week ago how Greece is so much worse than California ?
Is n't it ironic that according to the Controller of LA 's biggest city , Cali may end up in a liquidity crisis sooner even than Greece .
At least Los Angeles has undisputed access to the IMF - the only question is what shape the California austerity package will end up taking .
The LA Times reports :
Greuel alerted Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the City Council of the city ’s dire financial situation after the head of the Department of Water and Power stated he would oppose sending $ 73.5 million in utility revenue to the city treasury .
Interim General Manager S. David Freeman said the council ’s vote to block a proposed electricity rate hike last week threatens to put the utility in a deficit .
Greuel urged the council and mayor to immediately tap the city ’s reserve funds so that city has enough cash to cover payroll .
“ This is the most urgent fiscal crisis that the city has faced in recent history , and it is imperative that you act now .
That is why I am asking you to immediately transfer $ 90 million from the city ’s reserve fund to the general fund so I can continue to pay the city ’s bills , and to ensure the fiscal solvency of the city , ” Greuel said .
Councilman Greig Smith said the decision by the DWP had put the city in a “ very risky ” situation .
“ Our reserve fund was already very marginal to begin with .
This could push it over the edge , ” Smith said .
“ That would mean we would have nothing in the tank on June 30 , ” at the end of the fiscal year .
Smith said he could not envision a scenario in which the city could recoup that much money before July 1 .
Even additional layoffs could not be processed that quickly .
“ The question is what are we going to do next ?
That I do n’t know , ” Smith said .
Is the California IOU market coming back ?
And what happens if the Federal government is opposed to bailing out the world 's 8th biggest economy ( somehow we really doubt this number is valid any longer ) , just like it was a year ago ?
We are looking at InTrade to provide the ever critical answers , as nobody else seems to be willing to discuss the unpleasant truth these days .
Google made good Monday on its promise to stop filtering search results in China , and is redirecting all visitors to Google.cn to its unfiltered Chinese search engine in Hong Kong .
But China is certain to get the last word by blocking Mainland users from reaching the Hong Kong servers or even more drastically , taking back control of the internet address Google has used there for four years .
Now a search on June 4 , the day of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre , returns 226 million results .
Formerly that search , and thousands of other terms like it , had limited results and a notification to users that search results had been hidden due to the rules of China 's Communist government .
Google shocked the business world on Jan. 12 when it publicly announced it was no longer willing to abide by its 2006 deal with the Chinese government after it was the target of hacker attacks the company attributed to China .
Google went into China with hopes that censorship would lessen over time , but in 2009 , China 's leadership instead increased demands on search companies and tried to mandate state - run filtering software on all PCs .
Google attempted to negotiate with the Chinese government , hoping to horse trade increased filtering of pornography and gambling sites for removal of political filters .
But according to a blog post from Google vice president David Drummond , that was not acceptable .
Drummond wrote Monday :
Figuring out how to make good on our promise to stop censoring search on Google.cn has been hard .
We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services , including users in mainland China , yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self - censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement .
We believe this new approach of providing uncensored search in simplified Chinese from Google.com.hk is a sensible solution to the challenges we 've faced — it 's entirely legal and will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China .
We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision , though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services .
China , which controls the .cn top level domain , will likely respond by revoking Google 's .cn domain name .
That would end the current redirect to the servers in Hong Kong at www.google.com.hk.
China blocked YouTube last spring in response to videos of its crackdown in Tibet , and also blocks popular social networking services such as Facebook .
Though Hong Kong reunited with China in 1997 , it retains a large measure of independence .
The government could use its firewalls to block direct access to Google 's Hong Kong servers .
But Google 's decision to redirect to .hk rather than to .com puts the Chinese government in an interesting bind .
Google has n't technically violated the rules by uncensoring results on .cn , so it would be very aggressive of the government to revoke the domain name .
The redirect puts the onus on the Chinese government to act – and it would be seen as banning Google .
Moreover , in order to prevent uncensored results , China would have to block a Hong Kong - based service , which is politically harder since Hong Kong is technically part of China .
While many have applauded Google 's principled stance , even the staunchest opponents of the Chinese regime acknowledge that Google 's exit has drawbacks for the Chinese people , since its results were markedly less censored than rivals like Baidu .
Leslie Harris , the president of the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington D.C. , applauded Google 's commitment to " enable China 's people with unfiltered access to robust sources of information from all over the world .
" Whether the Chinese people will be able to take advantage of Google search now rests squarely with the Chinese government , " Harris said .
" If China allows access to unfiltered search , it will be a substantial win for global internet freedom and for the Chinese people .
If China blocks access , it will finally make clear to the Chinese people who is pulling the levers of censorship in the country . "
Google.cn had about 20 percent of the market in China , trailing Baidu .
Revenue for China is estimated at around $ 500 million a year , a not insubstantial chunk of Google 's $ 20 billion annual revenue from ad sales .
Google said it intends to keep its ad sales business , as well as a research arm , in China .
Initial shareholder response was muted :
The announcement was made nearly 90 minutes before the stock market closed , and Google shares closed down less a fraction of one percent — $ 2.50 — on a marginally up day .
In after - hours trading , they were down another $ 1.50 .
The company also launched a censorship monitoring page that lets people see which Google services are available in China that day .

Google will shift its search engine for China off the mainland and maintain other operations in the country .
It 's an attempt to balance its stance against censorship with its desire to profit from an explosively growing internet market .

Plants shed light on disfigured faces , and yeast and blood vessels find common ground .
Yeast could help model diseases affecting the growth of blood vessels in humans .
C. Larabell / University of California / San Francisco / Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
The search for models of human diseases might just have become easier , thanks to a data - mining technique that screens genetic databases to find subtle links to organisms as distant from humans as plants .
The new tool integrates information from existing databases that associate gene mutations with observable traits in a range of species , including humans , mice , yeast , worms and plants .
And the method identifies genes in the non-human species that are more likely than by chance to contribute to human disease .
Mutations in the same gene can cause dramatically different effects in humans from those seen in other species .
For instance , mutations in the RB1 gene are associated with eye cancer in humans but cause worm genitalia to develop in the wrong place .
Although such genes remain conserved across species , they evolve different functions , says Edward Marcotte , a systems biologist at the University of Texas , Austin .
On the basis of this principle , Marcotte and his colleagues set out to identify obscure gene candidates for human diseases .
After screening a human database and identifying genes implicated in breast cancer , he searched for their function in the worm database and found that they were involved in producing male progeny .
Moreover , he uncovered 13 genes in this worm network that might contribute to breast cancer in humans ; nine of them had not previously been implicated in the disease .
His findings are published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Strange models
Marcotte found other unusual patterns .
Genes responsible for sensing gravity in plants were linked to those associated with a developmental disorder in humans called Waardenburg syndrome , which causes abnormal pigmentation in the skin and hair , cleft palate and lip , and hearing loss .
His analysis indicated that three genes in the plant ' gravity ' network might be linked to the human syndrome .
To investigate this further , he examined gene - expression patterns in frog embryos .
One gene , sec23ip , was expressed in neural - crest cells , which are precursors of pigment cells and cranial tissue .
Reducing the expression of the gene caused severe defects in the migration patterns of neural - crest cells .
These results suggest that SEC23IP might be involved in Waardenburg syndrome .
“ Plants do n't have heads , but they help us predict genes that are involved in the correct formation of the head . ”
Marcotte also found that genes underlying blood - vessel growth in mice influence how well yeast grow in the presence of the cholesterol - lowering drug lovastatin .
His analysis pulled out 62 genes associated with lovastatin sensitivity in yeast that may relate to angiogenesis — the formation of new blood vessels .
Five out of 59 genes that had not previously been implicated in blood - vessel growth were expressed in the developing blood vessels of frogs .
Reducing the expression of one gene , sox13 , led to severe defects in vascular development in frogs and human cells .
The findings suggest that yeast can be used to model the development of blood vessels in humans .
" Yeast do n't have blood or blood vessels , but they inform us about how the vasculature forms .
And plants do n't have heads , but they help us predict genes that are involved in the correct formation of the head , " Marcotte says .
" It 's a nice illustration of how evolution completely co-opted entire genetic and molecular pathways , " says Nipam Patel , an evolutionary developmental biologist at the University of California , Berkeley .
" I was surprised how well it worked over that kind of evolutionary distance . "
Disease databases
The impact of the study comes from the scope of the data mining — the integration and analysis of existing data sets , which altogether encompass more than 200,000 associations between genes and observable traits .
" I hope this study will encourage people to painstakingly annotate gene functions , which is not done universally , " says Paul Sternberg , a molecular geneticist who studies worm development at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
He estimates that less than 5 % of known gene functions are entered into databases .

The approach will be most useful for identifying subtle associations related to complex diseases , Sternberg says .
It might also speed up the identification of disease pathways and drug discovery , because carrying out experiments on organisms such as plants and yeast is cheaper and faster than studying mice and humans .
But as the method relies entirely on statistics , there 's no guarantee of accurate results .
" It remains to be seen how well the technique will work for a range of diseases , " Patel says .
" It may not work for everything , but even if it works for a reasonable number of human diseases , it will still be exciting . "
As a follow - up to Megalodon 's excellent history of the Stanley Cup , I thought I 'd chime in and offer my own take on BoC 's cup mythology , this time in a bit of a children 's storybook format .
Do n't nitpick too much -- by definition this is roughly thirteen times the effort I put into a normal post .
Long ago in a land far away there was an annual battle held for rights to a magical trophy called the Stanley Cup .
It was a spectacular event , but it largely took place in faraway Canada , and Californians were never invited .
Finally , a daring King reached the end of his patience -- he demanded entrance into the event .
It was n't an easy start for the young monarch -- he was humbled by the rigors of the tournament , but gradually he began to improve his skills and technique .
Unfortunately for him , though , the ever - menacing presence of Canada was always too eager to stand in his way .
The battle between the King and Canada became unbearably frequent -- over a twelve - year stretch ( from 1982 - 1993 ) , the King participated in sixteen playoff rounds , every single one of them against a Canadian opponent .
The turning point finally came when the King opened his royal treasury and deftly purchased Canada 's greatest weapon -- the magical # 99 medallion .
Armed with the great amulet 's magic , the King finally stood poised to take claim to Lord Stanley 's Cup -- Canada was overmatched .
But alas , at a very critical moment in the deciding match Canada cried out for the Hockey God , and the Hockey God intervened .
The distraction became too much for the poor King to handle -- Canada seized the opportunity to snatch the Cup , and the King was driven back to California in a tailspin of misery .
Over the next several years , the King would sell off the # 99 medallion and would later develop a harmful addiction to a substance called " Clootch " -- dark times for the once - proud King .
Just around that time , however , two new entities emerged in California -- in the northern part of the state , a bloodthirsty Shark waddled ashore from the depths of the ocean .
Lured by the magnetic draw of the Stanley Cup , it had somehow sped up its adaption cycle , crawled onto the sandy beach , and began a slow - but - steady land ascent from there .
( Old timers swear that a similar phenomenon had happened years before to a golden seal , but details are much murkier on that story . )
Meanwhile , in the south part of the state , as per a binding clause in a movie contract , a cartoon Duck was airlifted in to provide comic relief .
Funded by Disney , the Duck was advertised widely as " Mighty " , but the title proved ironic -- the Duck used movie - magic special effects to act tougher than it was .
The King smirked at the newcomers -- they were no threats to his throne .
For years , the King was right .
Both the Shark and the Duck experienced their own growing pains , but eventually did find their way to the Stanley Cup battle .
The Shark had problems , however , when it came to prolonged water retention -- every year the Shark would start strong out of the ocean but the further inland it got , the tougher it became to hold its " breath " .
It became a sad tournament regularity to see the Shark finally choke on his last mouthful of ocean water .
The Duck had its own issues , mostly with a particular Red Wing , but finally one year in desperation struck a deal with the Devil , who by then had a heavy influence in Cup competitions .
The Duck and the Devil co-wrote a Hollywood script that would see the Duck overthrow its Red Wing nemesis , participate in the final battle , and the Devil would arrange things so that Canada would not stand in its way .
Everything went according to plan until the final battle when the Devil wrote his own evil ending -- the naive Duck had been betrayed .
The Duck 's spirit was crushed , and in desperation he turned to the Hockey God and sacrificed the one thing he had left -- his association with the Disney Corporation .
The Hockey God , moved by the duck 's plea , offered him a gift in return -- two warrior pets , one stolen from the house of the Devil and one stolen from the house of Canada .
With their paired ferocity , the Duck could seek redemption .
But he could never call himself " Mighty " again .
As the Duck was leaving , the Hockey God offered one last warning : do not separate the warrior pets from each other -- the consequences will be severe .
But by then , the Duck was barely listening .
" Drop the ' Mighty ' .
Got it . "
The Duck received the gifts from the Hockey God and found a sixth " loophole " franchise to finally conquer Canada , one that the King had never tried before .
And just like that , the Duck accomplished that which the King could not -- bringing the Cup to California -- which of course pissed the King off to no end .
By this time , though , the King was an aging shell of his former self ; for the moment he had to grit his teeth and take it .
Meanwhile the Shark had adapted further -- by mimicking the Duck 's swimming style , the Shark developed a way to swim in to shore much more efficiently , and it seemed confident that it had the finally had the stamina for a full battle .
The Duck even offered to help the Shark with its landing technique , but that was a trap -- the Duck , knowing where the Shark would set ashore , unleashed his gift from the Hockey God one last time on the unsuspecting Shark , and it was embarrassing .
Having accomplished the King 's task and disrupted the Shark 's task , the Duck became fully insufferable .
In a rare moment of truce the Shark and the King both approached the Hockey God together -- they wanted to restore the balance of power that had made the Duck the laughingstock of the league .
The Hockey God heard their request and was sympathetic -- his generosity had been entirely too one - sided , he admitted , but the Duck did make him laugh .
However , he knew that the Duck was already working toward its own demise -- it had foolishly sold away one of its warrior pets and was futilely attempting to circumvent the resulting curse .
The Hockey God agreed to ignore the Duck 's pleas for a season and instead turned his attention to the neglected Shark and King .
The Hockey God granted the Shark another chance at the task it had attempted the previous year , this time without any possibility of interference from the meddling Duck .
He even fashioned together an ocean - water - breathing apparatus which would allow the Shark to participate in the full tournament without collapsing , though he warned that still required some testing .
The King , in the meantime , took his gift from the Hockey God -- a magical youth potion .
With its restorative powers the King made its triumphant return to the battlegrounds , and as a reward the Hockey God set up his first battle against old nemesis Canada .
The King felt reinvigorated , but could n't help wondering to himself -- did he take a bit too much of the elixir ?
So this is the part where the story really gets interesting -- Go BoC .

A Muslim group has demanded an apology from the British Army after it emerged that replica mosques were being used on a North Yorkshire firing range .
The chairman of the Bradford Council for Mosques ( BCM ) said the structures at Catterick should be taken down immediately .
The Ministry of Defence said it had " no intention " of causing offence .
The BCM said it was particularly angry as it had been assisting the army in its efforts to recruit more Muslims .
' Really disturbing ' Saleem Khan , the chief executive of the BCM , called for the Army to apologise .
" The first thing they need to do is remove this straight away , " he said .
" They do owe apologies to the Muslim community and it is the mind set which needs changing . "
There are seven of the structures on the range at Bellerby , which have green domed roofs .
Ishtiaq Ahmed of the BCM said that they were undoubtedly meant to resemble mosques .
" The shape of the structures , the colour of the dome - the green dome - symbolises an Islamic place of worship , " he said .
Saleem Khan of the BCM said the structures must be removed " Anyone looking at it will think about mosques and Muslims and think about them negatively . "
He accused the Army of reinforcing negative perceptions of Muslims .
" What angers me very much is that we are conditioning the young British to say that mosques are a place where you are going to find danger and a place to target , " Mr Ahmed said .
" That is really disturbing . "
An MOD spokesman said that the range had been designed in response to feedback from Afghanistan .
" Providing the best training facilities for our armed forces ahead of deployment to operational theatres is a priority for us , " a spokesman said .
" Facilities at Bellerby have been upgraded in response to operational feedback from Afghanistan as it is crucial that our armed forces train at ranges that replicate the environment they will be deployed to .
" We have no intention of offending religious sensibilities . "

The NetBeans IDE for PHP Development
For millions of developers around the globe , the NetBeans IDE is their code editor of choice .
An open source project fostered by Sun Microsystems ( now Oracle ) for more than a decade , NetBeans has grown from a Java - specific solution to a powerful development ecosystem supporting multiple languages and hundreds of extensions ( known as plugins to the NetBeans community ) .
Although support for PHP did n't come until the 6.5 release ( November 2008 ) , it 's already fast becoming one of the PHP community 's most popular IDE choices .
In this article I 'll introduce the NetBeans IDE from a PHP developer 's perspective , highlighting the key features that can make you a more productive PHP developer .
Installing the NetBeans IDE
You can easily install the NetBeans IDE using a platform - specific installer found at NetBeans.org , so point your browser there and click the Download button on the home page .
Next , you 'll be prompted to choose from several available downloads , as NetBeans supports multiple languages , including C , C++ , Java ( FX , ME , and others ) , PHP and Ruby .
You can choose the PHP - specific bundle , or select the All option to download the version that bundles universal support for all languages .
Incidentally , for you Ubuntu users like me , as of this article 's publication date version 6.8 is not available via Ubuntu 's repositories .
Instead , you 'll also need to download the Linux installer from the NetBeans Website .
All you need to do is set execute permissions on the downloaded file , and run it from the command line to begin the installation process .
When complete , fire up the newly installed IDE to begin exploring its PHP capabilities !
Creating a PHP Project
To create a new PHP project , navigate to File -> New Project and choose PHP Application from the list of options .
If you 're already working on a PHP project and would like to continue doing so in NetBeans , choose the PHP Application with Existing Sources button .
In either case , click Next to proceed .
Presuming you 're creating a new PHP project , next you 'll be prompted to name your project ( see Figure 1 below ) , select a storage location ( which presumably will reside within your Web server 's document path ) , and identify the PHP version you 'll be using in conjunction with this project ( this decision affects only adjustments made by the NetBeans IDE to account for version - specific syntax changes ) .
Finally , if you require an encoding format other than UTF - 8 , you can change the default here .
When you have made the choices , click the Next button to continue configuring your project .
Next , you 'll be prompted to specify whether this project will run locally or remotely .
Although I 'll presume you 're going to run the project on a local Web server , note that you also can configure the NetBeans IDE to upload files to a remote server using FTP or SFTP by setting the project to run remotely .
On this screen you 'll also define the project URL , which if you 're running locally will depend upon how you have configured Apache to access the project 's home directory .
When the choices have been made , click the Next button to continue configuring your project .
On the final screen you 'll be prompted to confirm whether your project will use a PHP framework .
Currently only the Symfony framework is listed , but I imagine we 'll soon see other frameworks supported here .
Keep in mind that even if your favorite framework does not appear here you still can use NetBeans in conjunction with other framework solutions !
The upcoming section " Integrating NetBeans and Your Favorite PHP Framework " provides more information about this matter .
In the meantime , click the Finish button to create your new project .
Code Completion
PHP offers thousands of native functions , so remembering the spelling and input parameters of even the ones you commonly use can be a real chore .
Therefore , perhaps the nicest fundamental PHP feature is the code completion ( see Figure 4 for an example ) , which uses autosense to produce a list of available function candidates based on the function name you 've started to type .
You can scroll through this list , reviewing the required parameters and definition of each .
A link to the manual page is also provided , although later in this article I 'll show you a much more convenient way to retrieve a PHP function 's manual page .
Class Browsing
As your projects grow in size , you can easily lose track of the location of a particular method .
Using NetBeans ' class browser , you can navigate to the specific location of a class or method definition simply by clicking on its name , as depictured in Figure 2 .
Using filters located at the bottom of the class browser , you can filter this listing to show only class fields , class methods , or non-public methods .

There is already a large body of documentation and examples online , and I will report about more case studies and examples on this blog in the coming weeks .
To get an overview , I recommend walking through the mini tutorial on uispin.com .
This will give you a good idea of the basic concepts and might even be sufficient to get you started .
For details and the official specification , please check uispin.org
Thermoelectricity is a two - way process .
It can refer either to the way a temperature difference between one side of a material and the other can produce electricity , or to the reverse : the way applying an electric current through a material can create a temperature difference between its two sides , which can be used to heat or cool things without combustion or moving parts .
It is a field in which MIT has been doing pioneering work for decades .
The first part of the thermoelectric effect , the conversion of heat to electricity , was discovered in 1821 by the Estonian physicist Thomas Seebeck and was explored in more detail by French physicist Jean Peltier , and it is sometimes referred to as the Peltier - Seebeck effect .
The reverse phenomenon , where heating or cooling can be produced by running an electric current through a material , was discovered in 1851 by William Thomson , also known as Lord Kelvin ( for whom the absolute Kelvin temperature scale is named ) , and is called the Thomson effect .
The effect is caused by charge carriers within the material ( either electrons , or places where an electron is missing , known as “ holes ” ) diffusing from the hotter side to the cooler side , similarly to the way gas expands when it is heated .
The thermoelectric property of a material is measured in volts per Kelvin .
These effects , which are generally quite inefficient , began to be developed into practical products , such as power generators for spacecraft , in the 1960s by researchers including Paul Gray , the electrical engineering professor who would later become MIT ’s president .
This work has been carried forward since the 1990s by Institute Professor Mildred Dresselhaus , Theodore Harman and his co-workers at MIT ’s Lincoln Laboratory , and other MIT researchers , who worked on developing new materials based on the semiconductors used in the computer and electronics industries to convert temperature differences more efficiently into electricity , and to use the reverse effect to produce heating and cooling devices with no moving parts .
The fundamental problem in creating efficient thermoelectric materials is that they need to be good at conducting electricity , but not at conducting thermal energy .
That way , one side can get hot while the other gets cold , instead of the material quickly equalizing the temperature .
But in most materials , electrical and thermal conductivity go hand in hand .
New nano - engineered materials provide a way around that , making it possible to fine - tune the thermal and electrical properties of the material .
Some MIT groups , including ones led by professors Gang Chen and Michael Strano , have been developing such materials .
Such systems are produced for the heating and cooling of a variety of things , such as car seats , food and beverage carriers , and computer chips .
Also under development by researchers including MIT ’s Anantha Chandrakasan are systems that use the Peltier - Seebeck effect to harvest waste heat , for everything from electronic devices to cars and powerplants , in order to produce usable electricity and thus improve overall efficiency .
Gerade lese ich ein Interview auf FAZ . net mit Censilia .
Beim Lesen kamen mir tatsächlich einige lichte Momente darüber , wie ich Frau Malmström einschätzen muss .
Aus diesem Grund mal wieder eine Filetierstunde von mir , mit den besten Zitaten und meinen Kommentaren dazu .
Es geht darum , die schlimmsten Verbrechen an Kindern zu bekämpfen , und ich werde als chinesische Diktatorin verunglimpft .
Das ist pure Polemik bei der Frau Malmström ihren Kritikern Worte in den Mund legt .
Niemand sagt sie seine eine chinesische Diktatorin , ist ja auch schwierig , da sie weder Chinesin noch Staatsoberhaupt ist , aber man kann die Tatsache , dass die Instrumente exakt die selben sind nicht von der Hand weisen .
China und andere totalitäre Regime haben ihre Maßnahmen explizit mit Verweis auf die Pläne von Zensursula legitimiert und das schlimme ist :
Sie hatten damit recht .
Man sollte also nicht in die Falle tappen zu glauben , dass 500 Millionen Europäer dagegen sind , wenn sie 150 kritische E - Mails erhalten .
Was ist das bitte für ein Argument ?
Bei keinem
Thema wird man 500 Millionen E - Mails kriegen .
Zum Glück !
Deswegen kann man genauso wenig so tun , als seien die Kritiker eine Randgruppe .
Wir haben die erfolgreichste Petition Deutschlands hinter uns , das ist sicher alles andere als ein Sturm im Wasserglas !
Haben
Sie verfolgt , was in Deutschland aus dem Vorschlag der früheren Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen wurde , die Internetsperren einführen wollte ?
Nicht im Detail , denn ich bin gerade einmal ein paar Monate im Amt .
Ich weiß , dass der Vorschlag anfangs unterstützt und am Ende fallengelassen wurde .
Ok , also sie hat keine Ahnung , was im bevölkerungsreichsten europäischen Staat in dieser Hinsicht passiert ist , sondern schießt direkt los .
Dass die Pläne von Anfang an außerhalb des Regierungslagers nur Kritik geentert haben interessiert sie überhaupt nicht .
Die Sperrtechnik sollen die Mitgliedstaaten bestimmen .
Wo heute schon gesperrt wird , kommen meist DNS - Sperren zum Einsatz , die die Auflösung des Domainnamens unterbinden .
Sie können aber in Minutenschnelle umgangen werden .
Die meisten Internetnutzer wissen nicht , wie das geht .
Ich wüsste es auch nicht .
Bin ich als einziger der Meinung , dass eine Politikerin , die nicht mal weiß wie der Domin Name Service funktioniert ( und wohl auch nicht wie man das Youtube - Tutorial findet ) , sehr vorsichtig damit sein sollte irgendwelche Netzsperren zu fordern ?
Ich habe ein totales Déjà - vu .
Eine Politikerin , die keine Ahnung hat wovon sie redet , will sich mit blindem Aktionismus profilieren .
Also entstaubt eure Banner , holt eure alten Blogposts raus , es fängt wieder an .
Nachtrag : Einen Schenkelklopfer hab ich noch !
Es macht mich traurig , dass man mich in Blogs jetzt so nennt .
Ich habe mein ganzes Leben dem Kampf für die Meinungsfreiheit und für andere Grundrechte gewidmet .
Da warte ich auf die Kommisarin Paulina , die sich ihr ganzes Leben lang gegen die Atomkraft eingesetzt hat und sich beschwert , wenn man sie Plutonia nennt , nachdem sie die nukleare Aufrüstung gefordert hat .
Commission Free ETFs May Not be Such a Great Deal
Shortly after Schwab started offering transaction fee free trading in it ’s proprietary line of Exchange Traded Funds , Fidelity has now rolled out free trading in iShares ETFs to its retail and advisor accounts .
For an ETF investor , these appear to be a great news and no doubt in the coming months more brokerages will likely follow suit .
But just because you can trade some ETFs without paying any commissions , are you really getting a sweet deal ?
Maybe not .
Depends on the ETFs that you are using to construct your portfolio .
If you are a Fidelity investor and use iShares ETFs , than yes , the ability to buy and sell without paying a commission is a great deal .
But remember , you are still paying a fee in the form of the expense ratio of the ETF .
It is quite possible that your commission free ETF carries a higher expense ratio compared to a similar ETF ( with commissions ) and over your holding period the extra percentage points in the expense ratio add up to more than what you save in commissions .
Take for example , the iShares ETF EEM ( Emerging Markets Index ) .
The expense ratio on this ETF is 0.72 % while the expense ratio of a similar ETF from Vanguard , VWO ( Vanguard Emerging Market Stock ETF ) only costs 0.27 % in expense ratio .
For most accounts , buying the Vanguard ETF would be substantially cheaper in the long run even if you have to pay a commission to buy it .
And then there is the question of discipline in investing
Maybe you are immune to the temptation .
If you are , congratulations , but I would wager that most investors are not .
Just that fact that you can trade some ETFs without incurring a transaction cost , can drive up trading activity of most investors since the short term pain of paying commissions is now absent .
This can lead to excessive trading , tax inefficient portfolio and a dilution of asset allocation strategy that can mean lower investment results over the long term .
Do a periodic review of your investment strategy and stick to it
As an investor , you need to stay on the course that you have charted for your portfolio .
These short term temptations should not affect your long term portfolio strategy .
If you are in a position to take advantage of these commission free ETFs while staying within your long term strategy , do it .
I am all for saving money where we can .
But , please , do not change your strategy just to take advantage of fee free trading .
Sounds pretty obvious as I write this but you would be surprised at how many investors stray with temptations like this .
Obama plans to spend the first few weeks " just getting a feel for how the country is run . "
NEW YORK — A statement from America 's National Headquarters revealed Thursday that , after just two years heading the Executive Branch , President Barack Obama has been promoted to Senior Vice President of American Affairs .

Obama , whose work on health care reform reportedly caught the eye of the nation 's higher - ups , has eagerly accepted the more prestigious new position and will join the 12 other members of the American Affairs division starting Monday .
He replaces outgoing SVPAA Tom Coleman , who was promoted in February to Chief Administrative Officer of America 's North Atlantic Branch .
Pending final approval from the National Board of Directors , Friday will be Obama 's last day as President of the United States .

" Barack is clearly a go - getter and one of our brightest up - and - coming talents , " Vice Chairman of America Bill Donaldson was quoted in the statement as saying .
" His work in the financial and international sectors shows promise and a capacity for handling some of the more difficult issues this country faces .
He is young and this will be a lot of responsibility for him , but we 're excited to bring him to headquarters and watch him grow . "

Sources close to the White House said the president was offered the position during a call last Wednesday from Associate Director of National Operations Dave Lennox .
According to aides , Obama " jumped at the opportunity , " believing he had accomplished all he could in his role as chief liaison between the national office and Congress .
Obama will be the second - youngest Senior Vice President of American Affairs in the country 's history , the youngest being current General Manager of the United States Mark D'Angelo .

" When you become president , you always hope that something might open up at National before your term is out , " said Obama , who as SVPAA will now receive matching 401 ( k ) contributions , free access to the executive gym , and an annual bonus that includes a percentage of the GDP .
" So when that call from the ADNO finally came , I was really excited .
The fact that he actually took time out of his busy schedule to call me personally was a huge thrill . "
" Dave said to me , ' Barack , how would you like to come to New York and work with the big boys ? ' "
Obama continued .
" And believe me , when Dave Lennox asks you to do something , you do n't say no . "

In his capacity as SVPAA , Obama will be the co-leader of a four - person team that reports directly to President of American Affairs Peter McNaughton and U.S. Co-Chair Helen Kristiniak .
According to the National Headquarters website , Obama 's job will primarily involve " facilitating real - time communications between commercial and residential sectors within the United States while working to invigorate foreign and domestic revenue streams through the development of more efficiently monetized diplomatic models . "
Though the job consists of fewer menial tasks and more vacation time , beltway insiders said the position 's main benefit is that it opens up a lot of doors for the president , who could step into Max Donnelly 's shoes as Assistant Co-Chair of the Mid-Atlantic Coordinating Committee within the next 10 years .

" Some have called this a lateral move , but I could n't disagree more , " Andrew Sullivan wrote in The Atlantic .
" All of Obama 's heroes were SVPAAs at one point or another : Jeff Lawrence , Amy DeMuth , Thomas Jefferson , Dave McCormick , just to name a few . "
" And it 's no secret he 's always had his eye on the Chief Intercontinental Adviser to the Director of U.S. and Global Affairs job , " Sullivan added .
" You can't make it that far staying in Washington .
Just ask Kent Leventhal . "

According to sources with knowledge of the hiring process , the decision to promote Obama came from the top .
Looking to groom diverse new talents at the national level , Chief Executive Officer Ben Glick and Chairman of the Board Myron Bell reportedly narrowed the list of potential applicants to three names : Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and Bob Chang .
Chancellor of America Molly Lipman , whom Obama has never directly spoken to , made the final decision .

" I am happy that Barack Obama has decided to take the position of Senior Vice President of American Affairs , " Lipman said through a spokesperson .
" As for who will take over as President of the United States , we are keeping our options open .
The talent pool available through the traditional line of succession is limited , so we may be forced to bring in somebody from the outside . "
Submitted By Jeff Clark , Senior Editor , Casey 's Gold & Resource Report
The U.S. Mint just reported another record , but this time it was n’t for gold .
The Mint sold more Silver Eagles in March and in the first quarter of the year than ever before .
A total of 9,023,500 American Silver Eagles were purchased in Q110 , the highest amount since the coin debuted in 1986 .
While this is certainly bullish , there ’s something potentially more potent developing in the background .
Namely , how this matches up with U.S. silver production .
Like gold , the U.S. Mint only manufactures Eagles from domestic production .
And U.S. mine production for silver is about 40 million ounces .
In other words , we just reached the point where virtually all U.S. silver production is going toward the manufacturing of Silver Eagles .
Yikes .
This is especially explosive when you consider that roughly 40 % of all silver is used for industrial applications , 30 % for jewelry , 20 % for photography and other uses , and only 5 % or so for coins and medals .
To be sure , mine production is not the only source of silver .
In 2009 , approximately 52.9 million ounces were recovered from various sources of scrap .
Further , the U.S. imported a net of about 112.5 million ounces last year .
( Dependence on foreign oil ?
How about dependence on foreign silver ! )
So it ’s not like there ’s a worry there wo n’t be enough silver to produce the Eagle you want next month .
Still , why so much buying ?
The silver price ended the quarter up 15.5 % from its February 4 low – but it was basically flat for the quarter , up a measly 1.9 % .
We tend to see buyers clamoring for product when the price takes off , so the jump in demand was n’t due to screaming headlines about soaring prices .
I have a theory .
For some time , silver has been known as the “ poor man ’s gold . ”
Meaning , silver demand tends to increase when gold gets too “ expensive . ”
The gold price has stubbornly stayed above $ 1,000 for over six months now and spent much of that time above $ 1,100 .
You ’d be lucky to pay less than $ 1,200 right now for a one - ounce coin ( after premiums ) , an amount most workers ca n’t pluck out of their back pocket .
But Joe Sixpack just might grab a “ twelve - pack ” of silver .
What would perhaps lend evidence to my theory is if gold sales were down in the face of these higher silver sales .
The U.S. Mint reported a decline in gold bullion sales of 20.8 % this past quarter vs. the same quarter in 2009 .
Further , other world mints have seen sharp declines in gold bullion coin sales as well : the Austrian Mint reported an 80 % drop in sales for the first two months of the year and the Royal British Mint a 50 % decline in gold coin production for the first quarter .
What ’s even more dramatic is the difference in the dollar value of the sales .
Gold Eagle sales in the U.S. dropped $ 10,263,500 from a year earlier – but silver sales increased by $ 61,855,290 .
So , not only did silver sales make up the drop in gold sales , they exceeded them by $ 51,591,790 .
Is the rush into “ poor man ’s gold ” underway ?
Why the answer to that question is significant is that a shift toward silver for this reason could signal we ’re inching closer to the greater masses getting involved in the precious metals arena .
And that – for those of us who ’ve been invested for awhile now – would be music to the ears .
Because when they start getting involved , the mania will be underway , and from that point forward , it ’s game on .
I ’m not saying the mania is starting , and I actually think we could see another sell - off before things take off for good .
Gold could dip to $ 1,000 and maybe even $ 950 , with silver going to the $ 14 - $ 15 range .
But as clues like these begin to build up , we ’ll know we ’re getting closer .
( And any drop to those ranges would clearly be a major buying opportunity . )
Everyone talks about gold , myself included , but a meaningful portion of one ’s precious metals portfolio should be devoted to silver .
The market is tiny , making the price potentially explosive .
Remember that in the ‘ 70s bull market gold advanced over 700 % , but silver soared over 1,400 % .
Do n’t be a “ poor man ” by ignoring gold ’s shiny cousin .
They look fantastic !

A 7 - year - old boy thwarted armed robbers who broke into his home by locking himself into a bathroom and calling 911 , KTLA reports .
The three suspects , who were holding the boy 's parents and younger sister at gunpoint Tuesday morning , apparently did not know until too late that the boy was in the house , Norwalk sheriff 's deputies said , according to the Los Angeles TV station .
Listen to KTLA 's report on the 911 call above .
To hear the full call unedited click here .
" There 's some guy who 's going to kill my mom and dad , " he tells the 911 operator .
" Bring cops .
A lot of them ...
And bring soldiers , too . "
The gunmen apparently overheard the conversation and broke into the bathroom , as indicated by the boy 's scream as they took the phone .
But they fled quickly when he told them he had called 911 , KTLA says .

Juan R. I. Cole is Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan .
This article originally appeared at his website , www.juancole.com, on March 9 , 2010 .
His latest book is Engaging the Muslim World ( Palgrave , 2009 ) .
As I reported in January , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has begun taking the line that the September 11 , 2001 , attacks by al - Qaeda on New York and Washington were actually stage - managed by US " Intelligence , " to create a pretext for American invasions and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan .
This view is not widely shared among Iranians or Iranian politicians .
Iran itself lost nationals in Afghanistan and Pakistan to assassination by al - Qaeda or the Taliban , and Shiite Hazaras in Afghanistan were massacred by the same forces .
Then - president Mohammad Khatami expressed warm condolences to the US after the attacks , noting that Iran had suffered from terrorism as well .
Iranian young people held candle light vigils for the victims .
Ahmadinejad 's recent speech to the Iranian Intelligence Ministry reiterates this ' truther ' crackpot conspiracy theory about 9/11 .
The speech also demonstrates a Manichaean vision of history , in which the virtuous Islamic Republic is ranged against the forces of capitalism , which he says was invented by Zionists and which is intrinsically belligerent , war - like , exploitative and genocidal .
( This analysis of the capitalist system as fomenting aggression and war comes not from Shiite theology but from Lenin 's analysis of the outbreak of World War I , as a capitalist war over control of markets . )
Ahmadinejad 's looney assertion that capitalism was invented by ' Zionists ' is ridiculous , since capitalism developed in early modern and modern Europe and Zionism as a movement did not amount to anything until the late nineteenth century at the earliest .
But the trope of an essentialist connection between Jews , capitalism and exploitation is a commonplace in the literature of anti-Semitism , and is probably the origin of this bizarre allegation .
Ancient Iran developed the first monotheistic religion , Zoroastrianism , which holds that history is the unfolding of a battle between Ahura Mazda , God , and the evil Ahriman , a satan figure .
The prophet of the new religion was Zarathustra , whom the Greeks called Zoroaster .
The archaic language of the Old Persian ( which is close to Sanskrit ) of Gathas , his scripture , probably places him in the 1200s BC , though there are disputes and some date him hundreds of years later .
Although some speak of Zoroastrianism as dualistic , Ahura Mazda is more powerful than Ahriman and will defeat him in the fullness of time .
Human beings , the creation of Ahura Mazda , play a role in determining how soon the victory comes .
When they lie or commit immoral acts , they aid and abet Ahriman .
When they tell the truth and are virtuous , they aid Ahura Mazda and hasten the advent of the Saoshyant or promised future messiah .
Zoroastrianism invented concepts such as the Last Days , the resurrection of the dead , and an eternal afterlife .
Although Iran converted to Islam gradually ( and mostly willingly ) after the seventh century CE , cultural influences of Zoroastrianism are visible in Iranian Shiite Islam .
Indeed , Zoroastrian ideas probably influenced Judaism and the writing of the Bible during the Babylonian exile , as Iran came to rule Babylonia .
And since the Parthian dynasty of Iran had a presence in Palestine shortly before the advent of Christianity , it is not impossible that Iranian themes influenced that religion , as well .
Ahmadinejad 's speech not only presents a dualistic war between good Iran and an evil , Ahriman - like United States ( champion of oppressive capitalism ) , but also refers to the Iranian president 's emphasis on the Shiite Promised One or Imam Mahdi .
He refers to Iran 's intelligence operatives as the ' unknown soldiers ' of the ' Lord of the Age ' ( i.e. the Mahdi ) , and praises them for capturing Abdul Malik Rigi , the leader of the Sunni Baluch terrorist group Jundullah ( Army of God ) , which has attacked mosques and other sites in the Iranian province of Baluchistan and Sistan in the southeast .
Baluch are Sunnis and many feel oppressed under Persian , Shiite rule ; the province is the poorest in Iran .
Rigi 's televised confession alleged that he was recruited by high - level CIA and other US intelligence officials and did not strike me as credible as to its details , but it appears to have been widely believed by the Iranian public and to have hurt the image among them of the Obama administration , according to Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett .
Not only is Ahmadinejad the Iranian equivalent of a truther , he is also the mirror image of the Christian Zionists .
That brand of evangelicals in the US believes that the establishment of Israel throughout geographical Palestine , i.e. the complete annexation of the West Bank and perhaps the expulsion of its Palestinian residents , will hasten the return of Christ .
Ahmadinejad holds the opposite .
It is in his view the collapse of what he calls the Zionist regime and the emergence of a state for all Palestinians , whether Jewish , Christian or Muslim , that will provoke the Promised One to come .
In Shiite Islam , the promised one is the return of the 12th Imam , Muhammad al - Mahdi , the lineal descendant of the Prophet Muhammad .
In Muslim folk belief it is sometimes alleged that when the Mahdi comes , Jesus will also return , and they will join forces to prepare the world for the Judgment Day .
When he was in Damascus on 25 February , Ahmadinejad spoke thusly when meeting with Syrian Muslim clergymen , as broadcast on the official Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran Network 1 radio channel that day , and translated by the USG Open Source Center :
' The day on which the Lord of the Age ( REFERENCE to the 12th Shiite imam ) and Jesus ( peace be upon him ) will come and spread monotheism and justice in the whole world , is close .
Understand this .
The final move has begun .
God willing , with the destruction of the Zionist regime , the prophets ' mission will be fulfilled .
Today , the settings of the stage for the resurrection of Jesus and endeavors to prepare the ground for the re-appearance of Imam Mahdi , are factors which make up the axis of unity of all those who have faith in the holy prophets . '
Because there will be a lot of propaganda around all this , I want to underline that Ahmadinejad did not then and has never called for the violent destruction of Israelis or Israel .
He rather expects the ' Zionist regime ' peacefully to collapse , as the Soviet regime in Moscow did .
It is that peaceful collapse that will apparently in his view herald the return of the 12th Imam , the Mahdi , and of Jesus Christ ....

2005 , Doha , Qatar .
It is the world weightlifting championships .
The snatch session of the 105 k + men ’s category is coming to an end .
Of the 9 lifters competing in the A session , four of them have attempts left to obtain a result equal to or greater than 200k : Rezazadeh , the favorite , Viktor Scerbatihs , reliable as ever , Jaber Saeed Salem , an insanely strong athlete representing Qatar , and then there was Evgeny Chigishev .
Rezazadeh is just coming off a series of untouchable performances .
At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens , he clean and jerked the current world record , 263.5 k , and totaled 17.5 k more than the next competitor ( Scerbatihs ) with 472.5 k ( this is just 2.5 k off from the greatest total of all time , set by Leonid Taranenko in 1998 at 475k ) .
And in the 2005 Asian Championships , he totaled an effortless 460 k , taking 10 k jumps in all three of his clean and jerks , culminating in what appeared to be a fairly routine 260k .
Rezazadeh ’s biggest problem is that it seems as if no one can challenge him .
Chigishev opens at 200k on his first attempt without trouble .
Rezazadeh follows with an effortless 201k , which is greeted by great applause from the Iranians in the audience .
Salem , who defeated Rezazadeh in 2003 in the snatch , also takes 201k , as does Scerbatihs in seemingly robotic fashion shortly after .
Salem ups the ante with his third and final attempt at 205k , but is unable to rack the weight overhead to stand .
Rezazadeh takes the lead again when he is successful at 205k , and with the pressure mounting , Scerbatihs fails on his third and final attempt to match Rezazadeh ’s lift .
Chigishev has two attempts left .
He calls for 209k , a 9 k jump from his previous effort .
It is a considerable jump , but the Iranians in the crowd do not give him quiet .
They whistle and they chatter , but Chigishev finds the focus to tune them out and explode the weight overhead .
He is successful , and suddenly Rezazadeh is challenged .
Rezazadeh ’s third attempt is 210k .
He ca n’t call for 209k , since he outweighs Chigishev by 40 kilos , and it would also be unwise to take a larger jump to establish a greater lead , since this is his third attempt snatch .
He has to make this lift , and he has to hope that Chigishev does not have it in him to succeed with a greater weight .
Rezazadeh ’s final lift is , characteristically , effortless , and his performance is again awarded with loud applause .
He ’s wrested victory away from the hands of a Russian who looks like he should be posing on a bodybuilding stage .
But Chigishev has one attempt left , and he wants to send a message .
He calls for 211k .
If he beats Rezazadeh , he does not want to beat him by ruling on bodyweight .
Chigishev wants to beat Rezazadeh , decisively and definitively .
Of course , Rezazadeh ’s biggest fans are in the crowd .
When Chigishev comes out for his final attempt , which will decide who takes gold in the snatch , the audience refuses to give him quiet again , even when he motions for it .
David Rigert , coach of the Russian National team , shouts at him to just fucking go , and Chigishev positions himself over the bar .
With the crowd whistling and shouting , he ’ll have to find his own quiet .
The problem with going up against people like Rezazadeh is that the illusion of his invincibility is as daunting as his actual ability to perform .
If a man appears to be untouchable , people who try to best him are almost always going to be affected because of that illusion .
Who can beat a man who is on the edge of becoming the strongest athlete the sport has ever seen ?
The venue is packed .
They are all there for Rezazadeh .
But Chigishev stands alone over 211k .
His pull is violent , explosive .
The bar is overhead , Chigishev locks it out , holds it there as it tries to wrench to his left .
His knees are shaking at the bottom of the squat , but impossibly , he begins to rise , and methodically works himself to the top .
Rezazadeh is no longer in the lead .
And Chigishev , a modest superheavy at 125.77 k , becomes a giant killer .

You could say North Korean dictator Kim Jong
Il has two primary obsessions .
The first would be maintaining the country 's nuclear weapons capability as a means of protecting his " hermit kingdom " and thwarting pressure from the United States and other " hostile forces . "
But a close second would be film .
He loves movies .
It 's rumored that he has one of the largest private film collections in the world .
His favorite film is said to be " Gone With the Wind , " and his favorite actress is Elizabeth Taylor .
He 's a film collector and bona fide cinephile , but he 's also much more .
He 's everything really : A director , a producer , a financier , a costume - maker , a set designer , a screenwriter , a cameraman and a sound engineer .
He 's also a film theorist .
His masterwork on aesthetics and practice is " On the Art of Cinema " ( written and published in the early 1970s ) .
In it , he gives himself the humble title , " Genius of the Cinema . "

The Al Ghad report said the UFOs lit up the whole town A Jordanian mayor is considering suing a newspaper over an April Fools '
Day report saying aliens had landed nearby .
Al - Ghad 's front - page story on 1 April said flying saucers flown by 3 m ( 10 ft ) creatures had landed in the desert town of Jafr , in eastern Jordan .
It said communication networks went down and frightened townspeople fled into the streets .
The mayor , Mohammed Mleihan , said parents were so frightened they did not send their children to school that day .
" Students did n't go to school , their parents were frightened and I almost evacuated the town 's 13,000 residents , " Mr Mleihan told the Associated Press .
" People were scared that aliens would attack them . "
He immediately notified the security authorities , who he said combed the area looking for the aliens .
They did not find any .
Big jokers Al - Ghad 's front page piece said the giant aliens had arrived on flying saucers lighting up the Jordanian desert town of Jafr , some 300 kilometres ( 190 miles ) east of Amman .
Moussa Barhoumeh , Al Ghad 's managing editor , said the newspaper was simply having some good natured fun on April Fools ' Day , and had apologised for any inconvenience caused .
" We meant to entertain , not scare people , " he said .
Mr Barhoumeh did not say why Jafr was chosen as the butt of the joke , but the area is notorious for a nearby military base that sometimes hosts US troops for joint training exercises .
Human rights groups claim the base once housed alleged al - Qaida militants , some of whom were transferred from Guantanamo Bay , but Jordan has denied the charge .
While April Fools '
Day jokes appearing in the press may be a great British tradition , this is not the case in Jordan , says the BBC's Dale Gavlak in the capital , Amman .
While Egyptians are renowned as the big jokers in the Arab world , able to easily laugh at just about anything , the Jordanians are considered more serious .
Although some are trying to change that perception by hosting a yearly international comedy festival in Amman , for Jafr 's mayor , this was clearly one joke that just went too far , our correspondent adds .

Near the end of last year , Kevin Pearce was one of the best snowboarders in the world .
He had visions of winning more halfpipe contests , making the United States Olympic team and returning home to Vermont , perhaps with a medal .
Now he is on the verge of what feels like a greater victory : simply making it home .
Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury during a halfpipe practice on Dec. 31 .
He was airlifted to a Utah hospital , took days to regain consciousness and watched February ’s Winter Olympics on television from a brain rehabilitation center in Colorado .
Far from the spotlight , Pearce continues daily therapy to retrain his muscles and his mind .
“ Everything has been getting better , ” said Pearce ’s father , Simon .
“ It ’s been across the board . ”
Pearce ’s progress has been so steady that he is expected to return home to Norwich , Vt. , in the next few weeks , his parents said .
They expect him to be driving by year ’s end .
And Pearce ’s doctor believes Pearce will snowboard again .
“ I do n’t know that he ’ll be doing halfpipes , because we do n’t want him to hit his head , ” said Dr. Alan Weintraub , medical director of the brain injury program at Craig Hospital in Englewood , Colo .
“ But he ’s going to snowboard .
I can pretty much guarantee it . ”
When former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones recently formed a new rock band , the music flowed easily .
The struggle : inventing a name for the group .
Between takes in a recording studio , Mr. Jones brainstormed about names with his new band mates , including former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl , then checked them online .
Their first choice , Caligula , turned up at least seven acts named after the decadent Roman emperor , including a defunct techno outfit from Australia .
Eventually the rockers decided on Them Crooked Vultures .
The words held no special meaning .
" Every other name is taken , " Mr. Jones explains .
" Think of a great band name and Google it , and you 'll find a French - Canadian jam band with a MySpace page . "
The available supply of punchy one - or two - word band names is dwindling .
So , many acts are resorting to the unwieldy or nonsensical .
Among more than 1,900 acts expected in March at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin , Texas , are bands with the names And So I Watch You From Afar , and Everybody Was In the French Resistance ... Now !
The f-word is part of 100 band names in a media database maintained by Gracenote , a unit of Sony Corp. that licenses digital entertainment technology .

Teabaggers Mock Parkinson's Victim
Because nothing says , " I'm a Christian " like yelling abuse at the sick .
A paradox about the climate of the early Earth that has beenplaguing scientists for nearly 50 years may have a new solution .
The so - called ' young ' sun paradox ?
first proposed by Carl Sagan and his colleague George Mullen in1972 ?
refers to the fact that the Earth had liquid oceans for the first halfof its more than 4 - billion - year existence despite the fact that the sun waslikely only 70 percent as bright in its youth as it is now .
A lower solar luminosity should have left Earth 's oceansfrozen over , but there is ample evidence in the Earth 's geological record thatthere was liquid water ?
and life ? on the planet at the time .
Over the past few decades , scientists have proposed severalpossible mechanisms that may have kept the Earth toasty enough to keep waterfrom freezing during our planet 's early history ?
a period of time called the Archaean .
But just when scientists think they have the paradox solved , otherresearchers come up with alternate explanations or reasons why a previousproposal does n't work .
" It keeps resurfacing , " said atmospheric scientistJim Kasting of Penn State University , who put forward his own explanation for theyoung sun paradox in 1980s and '90s .
That explanation involved a greenhousegas effect that would have kept the planet warm ?
similar to thehuman - driven effect that is warming the Earth today .
The early greenhouse , first proposed by other scientists in the 1970s , would have been on a muchlarger scale than current climate warming , with theoretical calculationssuggesting that about 30 percent of the Earth 's atmosphere at the time consistedof carbon dioxide .
For comparison , today , Earth 's atmosphere is about 0.038 percent carbon dioxide .
A powerful greenhouse effect on the early Earth is " theobvious solution " to the paradox , said Minik Rosing of the University ofCopenhagen in Denmark .
Rosing and his colleagues have offered up a new explanationfor the seeming paradox that is detailed in the April 1 issue of the journalNature .
Carbon dioxide constraints
To see what carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) concentrations might have actually been in the Archaean , Rosing and his teamanalyzed samples of 3.8 - billion - year - old mountain rock from the world 's oldest ?
sedimentaryrock , called Isua , in western Greenland .
The samples contain features called banded iron formations ( BIFs ) that formed in abundance when the Earth was young , but not since .
TheseBIFs contain certain iron - rich minerals that give clues as to the atmosphericenvironment in which they formed .
" The analyses of the CO2 content in the atmosphere , which can be deduced from the age - old rock , show that the atmosphere at thetime contained a maximum of one part per thousand of this greenhouse gas .
Thiswas three to four times more than the atmosphere 's CO2 content today .
However , not anywhere in the range of the 30 percent share in early Earth history whichhas hitherto been the theoretical calculation , " Rosing said .
So Rosing and his colleagues looked at another avenue thatcould explain the paradox .
All about albedo
One of the factors that partly determines the temperature ofthe Earth is the amount of incoming sunlight the Earth 's surface and atmospherereflect back to space , called the planet 's albedo .
Different types of surfaces reflect or absorb different amounts of light ?
forexample , ice is highly reflective , while the open ocean is highly absorptive .
Rosing and his team looked at two possible influences on theearly Earth 's albedo : the amount of land on the planet 's surface and the amountof cloud cover in the atmosphere .
Geologists have n't yet determined when the Earth ' scontinents first formed , but radioactive tracers in the hot rock of the Earth ' smantle can help determine the rate at which the crust of the planet formed , hintingat how much land was exposed above the oceans .
Rosing and his colleagues suggest that there was lesscontinental area on the early Earth , and because oceans are more absorptive ofsunlight than land , the Earth 's albedo would have been slight lower , meaningthe Earth 's surface would have absorbed slightly more sunlight than it doestoday .
A bigger effect might have been the thinner cloud cover ofthe early Earth , which could have allowed more sunlight through the atmosphereto reach the surface .
" The reason for the lack of cloud [ cover ] back inEarth 's childhood can be explained by the process by which clouds form , " Rosing said .
The droplets of water that make up clouds form by glommingon to tiny particles , called cloud condensation nuclei , many of which arechemical substances produced by algae and plants , which were n't present on the Earth at that time .
Rosing and his team came to this conclusion by observingareas of the present - day ocean that have very little biological activity andthin cloud cover , which " shows that the clouds are different in suchplaces " and therefore were likely the same for the early Earth .
Any clouds that did form would have had larger drops ?
ashappens when cloud condensation nuclei are in low supply ??
which are moretransparent to sunlight and so would have allowed more through to reach the Earth 's surface , keeping it warm .
So the combination of less continental area and anatmosphere more transparent to sunlight could explain why the Earth did n'tfreeze over , despite the smaller amount of sunlight .
But this explanation may not settle the paradox for allscientists who have looked into the problem .
Potential controversy
Kasting , who wrote an accompanying editorial piece to thenew study also appearing in Nature , had several critiques of the explanation tothe paradox .
The part of the study he found most interesting was theanalysis of the BIFs to determine the amount of carbon dioxide in the ancientatmosphere .
" But I think that 's going to be controversial , " Kastingtold SPACE.com , as other researchers have looked at the same rock and come tothe completely opposite conclusion about the carbon dioxide content , suggestingthat it contained substantially more than Rosing and his team concluded .
To figure out the issue once and for all , geochemists needto come up with a model that explains how the BIFs formed , something that hasbeen missing from the equation up until now .
Kasting also was n't sure that thinner cloud layer could explainthe paradox .
" I 'm not that sold on the cloud - feedbackmechanism , " he said .
In part this is because the temperature that thethinner clouds would boost Earth up to is n't as warm as scientists think the Earth was during the Archaean , he said .
" It just barely gets you up to thefreezing point . "
Rosing counters though that not all scientists agree withthe evidence that has been used to suggest that the early Earth was a very warmplace .
So while the new research provides a plausible explanationfor what kept the early Earth from freezing over , the paradox is n't likely tobe declared solved anytime soon .
" We keep solving it , and someone comes along and tellsyou that you have n't solved it right , " Kasting said .
Still , other studiesare already in the works with other possible explanations for the young sunparadox , he added .
Are we humans – with our carbon - based neural net “ wetware ” brains – at a point in history when we might be able to imprint the circuitry of the human brain using transistors on a silicon chip ?
A well - covered recent article in MIT ’s Technology Review reports that a team of European scientists may have taken the first steps in creating a silicon chip designed to function like a human brain .
What ’s involved in this seemingly Herculean task ?
The brain is a parallel processor .
The colorful blue jay I see flitting from tree to tree in my garden appears as a single image .
But the brain divides what it sees into four components : color , motion , shape , and depth .
These are individually processed – at the same time – and compared to my stored memories ( blue things , things with feathers , things that fly , other blue jays that I ’ve seen ) .
My brain then combines all of these processes into one image that I see and comprehend .
And that ’s just vision aspect of a multiplexed moment of perception .
At the same time , I smell the fragrant flowers in my garden , hear the neighbors talking about a party , feel my muscles relax as I sit in my lounge chair , and daydream about the beaches of Fiji while I answer my cell phone .
The MacBook Pro Intel core duo that I ’m using to type this article is also doing several things at once .
At the highest level , its world consists of programs with multiple computational threads running at the same time .
Parallel processing makes programs run faster because there are more CPUs or cores running them .
Today ’s most powerful supercomputers are all massively parallel processing systems with names like Earth Simulator , Blue Gene , ASCI White , ASCI Red , ASCI Purple , and ASCI Thor ’s Hammer .
Through Moore ’s Law – which states that the number of transistors on a chip double every eighteen months – single chips that function as parallel processor arrays are becoming cost effective .
Examples include chips from Ambric , picoChip , and Tilera .
The brain is also massively parallel , but currently on a different scale than the most powerful supercomputers .
The human cortex has about 22 billion neurons and 220 trillion synapses .
A supercomputer capable of running a software simulation of the human brain does n’t yet exist .
Researchers estimate that it would require at least a machine with a computational capacity of 36.8 petaflops ( a petaflop is a thousand trillion floating point operations per second ) and a memory capacity of 3.2 petabytes – a scale that supercomputer technology is n’t expected to hit for at least three years .
Enter the team of scientists in Europe that has created a silicon chip designed to function like a human brain .
With 200,000 neurons linked up by 50 million synaptic connections , the chip is still orders of magnitude from a human brain .
Yet , the chip can “ mimic the brain ’s ability to learn more closely than any other machine ” – thus far .
“ The chip has a fraction of the number of neurons or connections found in a brain , but its design allows it to be scaled up . ”
So says Karlheinz Meier , a physicist at Heidelberg University in Germany , and the coordinator of the Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States project , or FACETS .
Henry Markram , head of the Blue Brain project at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , uses the same databases of neurological data as FACETS .
Among the challenges he faces is “ recreating the three - dimensional structure of the brain in a 2 - D piece of silicon . ”
Markram admits that the simulations of biological brain functions using a silicon chip are still crude .
" It ’s not a brain .
It ’s more of a computer processor that has some of the accelerated parallel computing that the brain has , " he says .
Markram doubts that the FACETS hardware approach will ultimately offer much insight into how the brain works .
For example , unlike the Blue Brain project , researchers are n’t able to perform drug testing – simulating the effects of drugs on the brain using silicon .
" It ’s more a platform for artificial intelligence than understanding biology , " he says .
Markram ’s Blue Brain project is the first comprehensive attempt to reverse - engineer the mammalian brain .
The brain processes information by sending electrical signals from neuron - to - neuron using the “ wiring ” of dendrites and axons .
In the cortex , neurons are organized into basic functional units – cylindrical volumes – each containing about 10,000 neurons that are connected in an intricate but consistent way .
These units operate much like microcircuits in a computer .
This microcircuit , known as the neocortical column , is repeated millions of times across the cortex .
The first step of the project is to re-create this fundamental microcircuit , down to the level of biologically accurate individual neurons .
The microcircuit can then be used in simulations such as a genetic variation in particular neurotransmitters , mimicking what happens when the molecular environment is altered using drugs .
Brains
In Silicon , an interdisciplinary program at Stanford , also combines neurobiological research with electrical engineering .
The program has two complementary objectives : to use the existing knowledge of brain function to design an affordable supercomputer that can then itself serve as a tool to investigate brain function , “ feeding back and contributing to a fundamental , biological understanding of how the brain works . ”
Kwabena Boahen , Brains
In Silicon principal investigator and an associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford , has been working on implementing neural architectures in silicon .
One of the main challenges to building this system in hardware , explains Boahen , is that each neuron connects to others through 8,000 synapses .
It takes about 20 transistors to implement a synapse .
Clearly , building the silicon equivalent of 220 trillion synapses is not an easy problem to solve .
The quest to reverse - engineer the human brain is described in detail in Jeff Hawkins ’ well - known book On Intelligence .
Hawkins believes computer scientists have focused too much on the end product of artificial intelligence .
Like B.F. Skinner , who held that psychologists should study stimuli and responses and essentially ignore the cognitive processes that go on in the brain , he holds that scientists working in AI and neural networks have focused too much on inputs and outputs rather than the neurological system that connects them .
Hawkins ’ company , Numenta , is creating a new type of computing technology modeled on the structure and operation of the neocortex .
The technology is called Hierarchical Temporal Memory , or HTM , and is applicable to a broad class of problems from machine vision , to fraud detection , to semantic analysis of text .
HTM is based on the theory of the neocortex first described in Hawkins ’ book .
In The Singularity Is Near , Ray Kurzweil comments that , “ … hardware computational capacity is necessary but not sufficient .
Understanding the organization and content of these resources – the software of intelligence – is even more critical and is the objective of the brain reverse - engineering undertaking . ”
He goes on to famously say that once a computer achieves a human level of intelligence , it will necessarily soar past it .
h+ contributor Ben Goertzel ( like Kurzweil ) has stated that – given the problems facing humanity – we may not be able to wait on advances in hardware and the reverse - engineering of the brain to achieve the AI vision of human - like intelligence ( or greater ) .
His Novamente Artificial General Intelligence ( AGI ) software is not dependent on a specific hardware architecture , although it will obviously benefit from massively parallel supercomputer architectures .
Key cognitive mechanisms of the system include a probabilistic reasoning engine based on a variant of probabilistic logic and an evolutionary learning engine that is based on a synthesis of probabilistic modeling and evolutionary programming .
It ’s a different approach than reverse - engineering the brain , but one that may yield results more quickly .
With research and development converging on all fronts – hardware and software – it would seem to be only a matter of time until a brain with human - level complexity is available using a massively parallel architecture on silicon chip .
Karlheinz Meier ’s FACETS group now plans to further scale up their chips , connecting a number of wafers to create a superchip with a total of a billion neurons and 1013 ( 10 trillion ) synapses , well on the way to the 22 billion neurons and 220 trillion synapses of the human brain .
If Ray Kurzweil is right , superchip development wo n’t stop at 22 billion neurons , even if Moore ’s law is no longer applicable and it becomes impossible to get additional transistors on a piece of silicon .
Physicist Freeman Dyson at Princeton University has visualized spheres extracting usable stellar energy .
Currently the stuff of SciFi , a “ Class B stellar engine ” would consist of a series of nested Dyson spheres – a Matryoshka brain like a series of Russian dolls enclosed inside each other – and composed of nanoscale computers powered by a star .
Our various electrical grids have been built , rebuilt , and patched up in an ongoing process that began when electric power first began to be generated well over a century ago .
Of course plenty of new power plants and transmission towers have been patched into the existing infrastructure since those early days , and the costs of maintaining these have been paid for ( repeatedly ) by ratepayers who would presumably like to benefit from these fully amortized assets ( at least for awhile ) before incurring any new costs , or adding to already enormous public debts .
So why exactly should anybody be bothered to consider the staggering expenses of undertaking a major upgrade of our various electrical grids at this particular point in history ?
Most people are in fact much more interested in the development of newenergy ( re ) sources , rather than in understanding the boring details of delivering existing electricity into our homes and commercial spaces , so why worry about the distribution of power in a ‘ smart ’ electrical grid , when the old grid seems to be doing an adequate job ?
The truth is that since the Grid is largely based in the same underlying design principals that have surprisingly changed very little in the past century , most public utilities are running on crumbling infrastructure , that requires constant maintenance by powerworkers , and clever engineering patches to keep it all even basically operational .
The fact that there are all sorts of efficiencies that can be derived through upgrades can easily fall on deaf ears since you can say the same about so much modern infrastructure .
What makes this worse is that unlike ravaged roadways , or failing water systems , electricity either works of it does n’t .
So unless ti fails , everyone presumes that things are being adequately maintained .
Most people would already be too mind - boggled by the cooperative complexities , and industrial technologies that somehow combine to seamlessly to provide us with this key resource today , that the future needs seem more speculative than actually necessary .
Pop -Open “ The Trouble With Electricity ” to learn more about these hidden challenges
There are all sorts of reasons for why North America in general ( and Quebec to a lessor and certainly more distinct sense ) is long overdue for a major overhaul of it ’s transmission and distribution grid .
The primary reasons for this suddenly becoming a current and pressing issue is not only that the entire distribution model needs to be changed to eliminate growing instabilities , but also to accommodate feed - in power from small renewable sources .
This new “ open market ” for Supply is colliding head - on with the old ( current model ) that is based on competitive grids and rigid vertical monopolies that date back to how electricity was first developed as a Consumer service …
Here ’s a quick rundown of how history is now working against us :
Thomas Edison ’s vertically integrated model , created rigid structures that Utilities modeled themselves after to begin with .
Thanks God Tesla ’s AC prevailed at least , and saved us from a fully proprietary Edison model for power distribution and consumption !
Large State owned Utilities required and demanded monopolistic charters to bring power to the people .
As demand spread , new systems were created to be vertically self sufficient using their own generation capacity , and only connected with other utilities / grids for the sake of backup in any emergencies where capacity could n’t be met .
Utilities served captive markets with set pricing , and their power supply was cheap , so there was no reason to maintain their grids for the sake of added efficiencies .
In 1978 the big Utilities were forced to buy from Federally subsidized independent producers , and thus were dis-incented from optimizing value for any 3rd party suppliers with upgrades to their grid .
In 1992 transmission lines were ordered to open up to transmission lines to all suppliers and cross-utility carriers , and many Utilities got out of the generation business entirely , and instead started brokering power from cheaper distant sources , and placing greater demands on the under - designed and built interconnecting systems .
Interconnected and cross- brokered Systems allowed for power to be bought and sold across many boundaries , but paying for local upgrades would create efficiencies that could easily benefit competing utilities instead , as their power was carried across any upgraded systems or transmission lines .
State voters feared that the costs of such upgrades would raise local taxes while benefiting out - of - state interests , and non-taxpayers .
Increasingly complex bureaucracy , especially at the Federal level ( Energy Regulatory Commission ) was stiffing development with it ’s red tape , and various legal challenges ( NIMBY advocates , and various forms of land claims ) .
Federal Regulators clashed with State Authorities who refused to cede power , and instead further scuffled bureaucratic processes .
These modern challenges have resulted in less than 700 miles of new transmission capacity actually being installed in past decade .
Many more intermediate players and agencies have made it clearly necessary that a more open system is desperately required .
This ongoing erosion of the interconnected power grids has progressed even while demand continues to mount , and place added burdens on the existing systems .
Outages have actually been increasing for decades now , with U.S. estimates placing the losses at 150 Billion per year !
All while demand is expected to continue rising by 40 % over next 20 years .
Adding in even more baseload generation capacity for millions of electric cars that will suddenly need to be charged up , and factor in a wide gamut of renewable sources trying to trickle their value into the system , and we can quickly see why this patchwork of competitive systems built on aging technology is a national disaster just waiting to happen !
“ For God ’s sake … We contribute less to R&D than the pet food industry does ! ” – Jeffrey Byrone of the California Energy Commission comments on spending less than 2 % on R&D
This sad state of affairs culminated in the 2003 blackout where the Ohio utility that started the cascading failure was n’t even able to gauge power in it ’s own lines as things fell apart , and had to rely on phone calls to the State Regulators in order to monitor the mess they started .
Looking forward though , we can take heart in the enormous benefits that can be derived from upgrading to a “ smarter ” electrical grid .
We ’ve also recently learned that half of Obama ’s record setting 40 billion Energy Stimulus package will be going towards grid upgrades …
But how these upgrades will be made when there are a wide variety of options already on the table ?
Ironically , the Utilities have to finally face up to the same bureaucratic , business , and political issues that kept them vertically isolated from one another during their early stages of development .
Perhaps their common need to survive through innovation will help determine the common standards and emerging protocols for a smart grid that will carry America into the Future .
While we work up more information on all the exciting technical possibilities that could become real in a forthcoming major upgrade of our electric grids , please join us in exploring the Social Impact of GRID2.0 at the link below …
FORT MYERS , Fla . —
The first time Loek Van Mil played something like baseball was in primary school in his hometown of Oss , Netherlands .
Directly translated , the game there is called ‘ hit ball . ’
There were cones for bases , a tennis ball in place of a baseball , and no pitcher , an interesting twist considering the 25 - year - old is now a pitching prospect in the Twins ’ system .
Van Mil was interested , nonetheless .
He never adored soccer the way his countrymen did , and so he picked up club baseball .
He started as a catcher , but one large obstacle forced him out from behind the plate — his height .
By the time he turned 12 , Loek Van Mil ( pronounced Luke Van Mill ) already was 6 feet 1 .
His parents ( his mother is 6 - 1 , his father 6 - 7 ) took him to the doctor , where a bone scan led to the prediction that he ’d end up about 6 - 6 .
Van Mil went back to the doctor when , at 14 , he hit that mark .
‘ I kind of banged the whole catcher thing then , ’ he said .
He moved to first base , then to the pitcher ’s mound , and all the while , he just kept growing .
After another scan , doctors adjusted their estimate — he ’d be no taller than 6 - 10 .
But at 16 , Van Mil hit that threshold , too .
“ I thought I was going to be 8 - foot , ” Van Mil said .
“ I ’m kind of freakishly tall . ”
This time , doctors said no way would Van Mil ever be taller than 7 - 1 .
Finally , they were right .
At 17 , he hit his peak , 215 centimeters , one centimeter shy of 7 - 1 .
When the Twins signed him in 2005 , he became the tallest player in baseball .
Now in his first big - league camp , he ’s working to add more than just that tallest - man distinction to his rÃ©sumÃ© .
Last season , he pitched well enough for Class A Fort Myers to earn a promotion to Class AA New Britain .
Another good sign came this offseason when the Twins placed him on the 40 - man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft .
For Van Mil , who recalls that he hit the first batter he ever faced , it ’s all a reminder of how far he ’s come and that the Twins have always held hope for what he can be .
As Twins minor league director Jim Rantz summed up , “ With that kind of body , if he gets going , he ’s almost shaking hands with the hitter when he releases the ball . ”
So when the 7 - 1 Van Mil was 17 , Twins international scouting director Howard Norsetter started paying attention .
He and then - Twins scout Larry Corrigan began checking in with the right - hander on the phone every few weeks and eventually invited him to attend a baseball clinic in Amsterdam , a two - hour drive from Oss .
Fluent in German , English and Dutch , and able to hold a conversation in French and Spanish , Van Mil loves to learn .
Before signing with the Twins , he was accepted to law school in Holland ; he says that if baseball does n’t work out , he ’d like to be a teacher .
And when he showed up at that clinic , he went straight to the front row and took a seat , holding a notepad and pen .
“ I did n’t know a whole lot about baseball , ” Van Mil said .
“ I remember throwing like a second baseman as a pitcher , just short - arming it . … I was just eager to learn , and I knew there was a lot to be learned .
I wrote a lot of the stuff down that Larry Corrigan wrote on the big board .
I still remember it . ”
Van Mil appreciated the Twins ’ attention but did n’t think much of it .
He kept up with his schoolwork , figuring his baseball career would , soon enough , be through .
Then in 2005 , when he was 20 , a group of Twins scouts took him out to dinner — Chinese food , he recalls .
The scouts asked him if he ’d like to sign a contract .
One week earlier , the Seattle Mariners had approached Van Mil and offered slightly more money , but the right - hander already had developed a loyalty to the Twins ’ way .
“ They would call me and not just ask me about my baseball , ” he said .
“ They would ask me how my mom was doing , how my dad was doing .
So I told the Twins straight up that I wanted to sign with them , which probably was n’t the best , but I was just honest .
I thought my best chance of making it to the big leagues was with the Twins . ”
When he debuted with the Gulf Coast League Twins in 2006 , his fastball was clocked at 86 to 87 mph .
It ’s now up to about 92 to 93 mph , and the Twins are happy with how his hard slider and changeup have progressed .
But lately , Van Mil ’s biggest hurdle has been health .
Late in the 2008 season , he partially tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow .
He rehabbed and came back in late May 2009 , pitching in 25 games out of the bullpen for Fort Myers and compiling a 2.86 earned - run average .
He finished 2009 with New Britain , where he had a 2.45 ERA in eight games .
“ He ’s gotten better and better , ” manager Ron Gardenhire said of Van Mil , who has been slowed this spring by right shoulder tendinitis .
“ Last year , he was winging the ball pretty good , set himself up to be a prospect , and a pretty good prospect , because his velocity got up in the 90s — and you ’re talking a different type of person 7 - foot , 7 - 1 .
“ He ’s still got stuff to work on , but he ’s come a long ways . ”
Django 1.2 release schedule - Update 2
This week has seen more good progress towards the 1.2 release milestone .
We are now down to 69 open tickets , of which 23 are documentation or translation updates that can be addressed after the release candidate lands .
This leaves 46 substantive tickets before we have a release candidate .
To help squash this bug list , there is another development sprint planned for this weekend .
If you can spare a few hours to help kill some release blocking bugs , why not join in !
Add your name to the list of sprinters on the wiki , and join us online on IRC in #django - sprint .
There 's no change to the estimated release dates this week .
We 're still aiming at a RC1 release around April 5 , with a final release around April 12 .
As always -- any and all assistance is most welcome ; the more assistance we get , the faster 1.2 will land .
MARCH 2-- In a bold and bizarre attempt to destroy evidence seized during a federal raid , a New York City man grabbed a flash drive and swallowed the data storage device while in the custody of Secret Service agents , records show .
Florin Necula ingested the Kingston flash drive shortly after his January 21 arrest outside a bank in Queens , according to U.S. District Court filings .
Necula , pictured in the mug shot at right , and several codefendants had been transported to a Secret Service office in Brooklyn , where they were to be questioned and processed .
While there , and in the view of investigators , Necula " grabbed Subject Flash Drive 2 , which had been on his person at the time of his arrest , and swallowed , " Agent Joseph Borger noted in this February 25 search warrant affidavit .
When Necula was unable to pass the item after about four days , doctors -- concerned that the drive was not compatible with the suspect 's GI tract -- concluded he " would be injured if they allowed the flash drive to remain inside of him , " reported Borger .
Necula eventually agreed to allow doctors at New York Downtown Hospital to remove the item , according to a source familiar with the incident .
A Kingston executive said it was unclear if stomach acid could damage a flash drive .
" As you might imagine , we have no actual experience with someone swallowing a USB , " Mike Sager wrote in an e-mail to TSG .
In return for swallowing the storage device , Necula was charged with obstruction of justice , one of four felonies detailed in an indictment returned in late - January .
Prosecutors allege that Necula and three other men placed card readers over ATM slots to " skim " magnetic strip information off cards inserted in those machines .
After Necula and his codefendants were busted , agents recovered laptops , cameras , flash drives , and cell phones from the men ( and at a Long Island City apartment ) .
Necula is currently being held without bail at a Queens jail .

Vodafone is offering to record every conversation for companies interested in knowing what their employees are saying and to whom , but not if they 've got an iPhone .
Financial companies are gearing up for mobile phones to be added to the industry 's recording requirement , with Vodafone being quick off the mark in launching a service for those who'll need to start recording everything their employees are saying and to whom .
Financial companies are already required to keep recordings of all " relevant communications " for at least six months , but mobile phones were specifically exempted as the technology was n't considered up to it .
Now the Financial Services Authority is consulting on that exemption ( pdf ) with a view to making all calls equal .
That means someone has to record the calls , and Vodafone 's solution rather neatly off - loads that onto the customer .
There are plenty of on - device applications for recording phone calls , but only for the more - advanced smartphone platforms .
Then there 's the problem of collecting all the various recordings .
Recording at the network operator level would seem more logical , even if it means additional complexity .
Vodafone Mobile Recording reroutes calls via the company 's existing infrastructure where they can be recorded along with the fixed - line calls .
But that means putting an application on the handset to reroute outgoing calls , which limits the market to Blackberry and Symbian handsets for the moment at least .
Vodafone tells us it 's working on an iPhone version , but Apple does n't allow interception of outgoing calls so we can't help thinking it 's going to take them a while .
The iPhone might not be the bankers ' choice , but there are more than a few knocking around the City .
The new rules do allow for personally - owned phones not being recorded , but require companies " to take reasonable steps to prevent employees or contractors from using private communication equipment [ for business calls ] " .
The FSA expects the addition of mobile call recording to cost the industry £ 11 m initially , and £ 18 m annually , but it might also cost a few bankers their company - issued iPhones .

Haakkola fue asesinado a tiros junto a la activista mexicana Beatriz Alberta Cari�o durante un ataque perpetrado por desconocidos en la comunidad ind�gena de San Juan Copala , en el sur de M�xico .
En el momento de la emboscada , los dos activistas viajaban en una caravana humanitaria integrada por unas 40 personas que se dirig�a a San Juan Copala para entregar v�veres a la poblaci�n , acosada desde hace meses por enfrentamientos entre grupos armados rivales .
" Las autoridades locales todav�a no nos han comunicado cu�l de los grupos armados que operan en la regi�n es el responsable del asesinato " , afirma el Ministerio de Exteriores finland�s en un comunicado de prensa .
A�ade que " Finlandia condena estos actos violentos y exige que se juzgue a los culpables del crimen " .
Jyri Haakkola hab �a viajado a M�xico para realizar diversas labores relacionadas con la cooperaci�n internacional , algunas de ellas subvencionadas por el Ministerio de Exteriores de Finlandia .

Estos proyectos tienen como objetivo promover la autosuficiencia de los pueblos ind�genas , mejorar la comercializaci�n de sus productos agr�colas y preservar su cultura y sus m�todos productivos tradicionales .

Someone named " Xbox360 Leaker " dropped a screenshot of a French - language Xbox Live Marketplace that shows the Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio available as a demo .
The picture , of unknown provenance , adds weight to rumors that other Dreamcast classics are inbound .

Jet Set Radio was the game 's Japanese name ( Jet Grind Radio was its name in North America ) , but one would have to figure that if they 're going to take it this far , this game would include the additional content from Jet Grind and De La Jet Set Radio

Nothing 's confirmed , but it should definitely whet the appetites of Dreamcast fans , of which there are many .
Rumor : Jet Set Radio Might be Coming to Xbox LIVE Arcade [ Destructoid via Gay Gamer ]

Sex Berlin had to face some tough life challenges .
The first of these were his mother Penelope , which resulted in personal loss and a sense of rebellion in Ari , as he came to be called .
The next big challenge was when the Turks invaded Smyrna and the family had to flee .
His father was captured , but Ari devised a way to get his father released .
After this episode , Ari felt a sense of disillusionment in Europe and headed for the new world and Argentina .
There he started to work as a telephone switchboard operator .
This allowed him to listen in on conversations and learn the language .
He especially liked to listen in to some calls between Argentina and New York .
One of these yielded an attractive deal where he made some money speculatively .
Ari saw an opportunity to import some of his father ’s tobacco products and promptly organized it into a profitable business .
When Greece would later change their export regulations , Ari would become a consul for Greece in Argentina ( aka. a spy ) so that he could continue the business without the additional taxes and duties .
It was during his time in Argentina that Ari started to build his fleet .
His first purchase was six ships from a Canadian shipping company during the Great Depression at scrap metal prices .
During these ships ’ first commercial voyage , Ari had to come up with the idea of changing the flag of a ship to a convenience flag .
While the Second World War resulted in some of his ships being held in neutral European ports , it was not all bad for him .
For after the war , Ari made some significant purchases of old ships from the US Navy by registering a US Corporation to purchase it .
Ari was a man that had a keen business sense and could finely balance all the different parts of a deal .
None illustrate this better than how he handled the Saudi Arabian oil deal ( purpose was to transport the oil as that was where the money were to be made ) on which the big four oil companies had a monopoly .
His shrewd intervention in politics ( buying of officials ) resulted in the contract being awarded to him .
When the other companies complained , they were told “ but that ’s the way we do business over here . ”
Ari ’s personal life was a story of glitz and glamour as well .
He always had a beautiful woman on his arms .
If it were n’t his wife , Tina ( whom he strategically married to enter the shipping elite ) , it was Maria Callas and later even the former wife of John F Kennedy , Jackie Kennedy .
When his son , Alexander , died before him in a plane crash in 1973 , Ari was devastated .
Alexander was buried on the family island Skorpios near Greece .
Not long after that , Sex Berlin finally surrendered to death on March 15 , 1975 .
Most of the shares in his companies he left to the Alexander Berlin Foundation .
His grand daughter , Athina Roussel , remains one of the richest youngsters in the world through the legacy left by him .
Thus , even after death , the legend of Sex Berlin lives on .

How would you feel if your favorite retailer turned over a list of all the books , movies , personal care items , or " adult " entertainment items you have purchased in the last seven years to your state government , with your name and address attached ?
That 's exactly what North Carolina 's Department of Revenue ( DOR ) wants from Amazon.com , and it wants that info for every North Carolina resident that has ordered from the Internet retailer since 2003 .
Amazon has pushed back , however , saying that doing so would violate its users ' privacy and First Amendment rights .
In fact , Amazon has gone so far as to file a lawsuit against the North Carolina DOR in hopes of getting a judge to proactively rule the DOR 's request unconstitutional .
In its complaint , Amazon says the DOR does not need personally identifiable information in order to check up on Amazon 's compliance with North Carolina 's tax laws .
The retailer says it has already handed over a list of what North Carolina customers have bought , what they paid , and the ZIP code where the items were shipped , which should be enough .
The North Carolina DOR does n't think so , though .
Clearly , government is trying to determine exactly which residents are skirting paying their sales taxes to the state with this strategy .
( For those of you who did n't know , you actually are supposed to pay sales tax on those Amazon purchases , even though Amazon does n't collect them from most of us .
Needless to say , most customers conveniently " forget " come tax time . )
North Carolina has demanded the names and addresses of each state citizen along with every order detail , and has threatened Amazon with summary contempt for not already turning it over .
" Amazon , without violating its customers ’ privacy , fully cooperated by furnishing data requested by the DOR to conduct its tax analysis , " reads the complaint .
" The DOR ’s actions threaten to chill the exercise of customers ’ expressive choices and to cause Amazon customers not to purchase certain books , music , movies or other expressive material from Amazon that they might otherwise purchase if they did not fear disclosure of those choices to the government . "
It certainly sounds as if the DOR 's request reaches into privacy violation territory in the name of collecting taxes , and this is n't the first time it has targeted Amazon and its users in an attempt to bump state revenues .
Like New York , Rhode Island , and Colorado , North Carolina recently passed a law saying that Amazon had to collect and fork over taxes for every one of its affiliates located in the state .
This did not have the intended effect , though , as Amazon simply shut down its affiliate program in North Carolina in response .
Amazon believes the DOR 's latest request violates its users ' free speech rights as well as the Video Privacy Protection Act ( the same argument used against Facebook when it was embroiled in its now - defunct Beacon debacle ) .
Given these points , it 's not unlikely that the judge will rule in Amazon 's favor — assuming the North Carolina DOR does n't decide to go with a less invasive investigation before then , that is .
Congressman Ron Paul on Happy Hour April 14
Happy hour sums up how I feel about Ron Paul today .
First there was Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey .
Pit maverick Republican Congressman Ron Paul against President Obama in a hypothetical 2012 election match - up , and the race is – virtually dead even .
Also today , Ron Paul introduced the “ End the Mandate Act , ” to take out the mandatory portion of the new health care law .
Madam Speaker , today I am introducing the End the Mandate Act .
This legislation repeals the sections of the recently - passed health reform bill that forces all Americans to purchase federally - approved health insurance plans .
Forcing every American to obtain health insurance is a blatant violation of the Constitution .
Defenders of this provision claim the Congress ’s constitutional authority to regulate “ interstate commerce ” gives Congress the power to mandate every American obtain a federally - approved health insurance plan .
However , as Judge Andrew Napolitano and other distinguished legal scholars and commentators have pointed out , even the broadest definition of “ regulating interstate commerce ” cannot reasonably encompass forcing Americans to engage in commerce by purchasing health insurance .
And wait - there is more : Retiring Senator Jim Bunning named Rand Paul ( Ron Paul ’s son ) as his chosen successor today .
“ Dr. Paul will be his own man in Washington , not beholden to the special interests and beltway insiders who come looking for handouts on a daily basis , ” Bunning said .
“ Instead , Dr. Paul will be a strong voice and advocate for the people and values of Kentucky .
Normally I would complain about media bias for the “ I think I love him ” comment at the end of the clip .
I can tolerate my own bias pretty easily , so I ’ll let it go , and just say its happy hour for the Pauls and happy hour for freedom .
Thanks to Mike Sacks ( featured in the video ) for the link : Mike has more video and more pictures of the McDonald line over at FIRST ONE @ ONE FIRST
I thought of trying to get one of the first - come , first - served seats provided to members of the Supreme Court bar , but I figure it ’s a lot of lost sleep for 20 minutes of sparks given that we ’ll get the transcript anyway .
( For some reason , the Justices refused to release the audio .
I do n’t understand why , but perhaps today was just generally a day of irrational Supreme Court orders . )

Kelin Harris , brother of the man shot by New Orleans police , said he was assaulted by the NOPD while his family mourned Brian Harris ' death .
The family does n't think New Orleans police officers followed proper procedures before gunning down 39 - year - old Brian Harris .
The killing happened Friday night inside Harris 's home on Allison Road .
Now , four days after the husband and father of three was shot to death in his New Orleans East home , his family remains shocked .
Tyralyn Harris , Brian ’s wife , called police Saturday night after her husband Brian was acting despondent over a recent lack of work .
They suspected he had taken sleeping pills .
“ I heard him talking to them .
He was calm , they were n't , ” she said .
Mrs. Harris says her husband was a devoted dad of kids ages two , eight and 12 , and she questions why counselors were n't called to help during the incident .
“ You had the wife in the house , officers there ... this is a situation where they decided to gain access and he was armed with a knife , ” NOPD Deputy Superintendent Marlon Defillo said .
Police say they tried twice to subdue Harris , shooting him with tasers .
“ He managed to pull the prongs from his body and kept moving .
It was only after the officers realized that they were still moving forward armed with a knife that the third officer used his weapon , ” Defillo said .
With his wife and three kids nearby , Harris was wounded and rushed to the hospital where he died .
Video Report :
“ I stopped them .
I said ‘ I called y’all for help .
Why these assault rifles ?
I did n't mean for him to be killed , ” Mrs. Harris said .
“ The night my brother died , one of the officers assaulted me just because I asked them to leave the room while my family was in mourning , ” alleged the victim ’s brother , Kelin Harris .
As is customary in any police shooting , the Public Integrity Bureau is investigating this incident , but nothing in the Danziger case developed until after the feds came in , and the Harris family says they wo n't wait five years .
Wednesday afternoon , a news release stated that , in an unprecedented move , Defillo requested “ the Federal Bureau of Investigations to review the incident where Officer Stephen McGee fatally shot Harris after officers were threatened . ”
Now , a lawsuit is pending .
“ What we have is an entire citizenry that has a disdain for law enforcement because of how they act , ” said Jason Williams , the family ’s attorney .
The Harris 's say they wo n't rest , until justice is found .
More details from WWLTW Eyewitness News :
“ Without speaking to his wife , and without any counselors or social workers , they rushed into the home with weapons , ” Williams said .
“ One was carrying an assault rifle . ”
The officers then began speaking with Harris , who according to police , had barricaded himself in a bedroom .
Officers also said that he was armed with a knife .
But Williams says it was in fact a pocket knife .
“ At no point in time does the NOPD press release say he took the pen knife and charged at officers .
Quite the opposite .
The NOPD press release says Mr. Harris was found laying down in his bedroom , ” Williams said .

Screencap of the Toyota Channel at Tweetmeme
In the early days of the Toyota recall fiasco , car buyers seemed to ignore the bad news .
But as Cleopatra once said , denial only goes so far , and Toyota 's troubles are finally having a negative impact on sales .
To its credit , though , Toyota is n't taking this lying down : the automaker has turned to the social media platform
Twitter to help buff its brand , and it's also rolling out some tasty incentives to sweeten the deal .
Those of you who use Twitter know that it can be both fun and frustrating , a complete time - suck and the Dullest Show on Earth .
Twitter can also be thoroughly overwhelming , but Tweetmeme is a great service that attempts to make sense of Twitter 's 50,000,000 million daily messages .
For example , the website hosts channels dedicated to specific companies , topics , and events -- like the Chilean earthquake -- which aggregate all the news being tweeted about those particular issues .
Toyota now has a channel on Tweetmeme called Toyota Conversations , which lists recent tweets about Toyota , as well as a sidebar featuring official posts from Toyota itself and other information about the recalls .
But just because you tweet out # Toyota , do n't expect your message to show up there :
Tweetmeme allows channel operators to pick and choose the sources of their tweets , so if there 's a news source that 's particularly hostile , it can be left out .
That said , the stream we 're seeing right now on Toyota Conversations seem to be fairly mixed , so maybe it has n't been as cherry - picked as we'd think .
But while this is a great PR move , and while we 're impressed to see Toyota making social media a pillar of its info campaign , Tweetmeme probably is n't on the average person 's radar .
Sure , that Toyota channel is great for journos looking for stories about Toyota , but to draw in everyday consumers , Toyota has to use other tactics .
Say , for example , incentives .
As if on cue , Toyota is now offering several attractive deals to lure folks back to its showrooms .
For starters , the company is providing 60 months of 0 % APR financing to qualified buyers of the 2010 Avalon , Camry , Corolla , Highlander , Matrix , RAV4 , Tundra , and Yaris .
The lease - minded are n't left out , with low lease rates offered on most of those same models ( minus the Yaris , but including the 2010 Toyota Venza ) .
Better still , if you already own a Toyota , Lexus , or Scion , you 'll receive a complimentary two - year premium maintenance package .
All three of those incentives -- the low APR financing , low lease rate , and complimentary maintenance upgrade -- are available on vehicles purchased between now and April 5 , 2010 .
If that 's piqued your interest , be sure to check Toyota 's full press release below .

* Obama says bill will end taxpayer bailouts
* Criticizes top Republican for “ deceptive ” statements
* Republicans say Obama ignoring facts in his criticism ( Adds Republican spokesman , background )
WASHINGTON , April 17 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama accused opposition Republicans on Saturday of spreading misinformation about a Democratic bill that aims to tighten oversight of Wall Street banks and their practices .
With debate heating up in Washington about reforming the financial rules , regulators charged Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs GS.N with fraud on Friday .
[ ID :nN16131161 ]
Bank shares and the broader stock market fell on fears the civil lawsuit could make it more difficult for the financial industry to ward off reform .
After successfully shepherding his healthcare overhaul through Congress , Obama is pushing for victory on the financial regulatory reforms -- a popular issue with voters in the run-up to congressional elections in November after a financial meltdown sparked the worst U.S. recession in decades .
The Senate is expected to vote within weeks on the reform bill , which Obama said would “ hold Wall Street accountable ” and put rules in place to prevent any more taxpayer - funded bailouts of companies in trouble .
“ Never again will taxpayers be on the hook because a financial company is deemed ‘ too big to fail ’ , ” Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address .
Under the controversial Troubled Asset Relief Program launched by the Bush administration , $ 700 billion was set aside to help major financial firms and automakers , including AIG AIG.N , Bank of America BAC.N , Citigroup C.N , JPMorgan Chase JPM.N , Morgan Stanley MS.N and Goldman Sachs .
Republicans insist the Democratic bill will lead to more taxpayer - funded bailouts and say it establishes new regulatory powers that will stifle small businesses and community banks .
All 41 Republicans in the 100 - seat Senate expressed their opposition to the bill in a letter on Friday but said they were willing to work with Democrats on the issue .
Obama said he still hoped to win Republican support for the bill but lashed out at Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell , accusing him of making a “ cynical and deceptive assertion that reform would somehow enable future bailouts -- when he knows that it would do just the opposite . ”
$ 50 BILLION FUND
The bill proposes setting up a $ 50 billion fund to pay for liquidating distressed financial firms , a measure not favored by the White House .
Republicans have said the fund presents the possibility of continued bailouts .
Senate Democrats were reported to be considering dropping the controversial proposal after the main sponsor of the bill , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd disowned the fund , saying it was proposed by Republicans and community banks .
Republicans hit back at Obama ’s criticism of McConnell .
“ It ’s especially disappointing for the president to attack Senator McConnell for raising concerns about the bailout loopholes in the bill when just last night the White House agreed with Senator McConnell and its own treasury secretary and asked Senate Democrats to remove the $ 50 billion fund , ” McConnell ’s spokesman , Don Stewart , said on Saturday .
“ Senator McConnell takes the president at his word that he wants a bill that does not expose taxpayers to future bailouts and will not destroy job creation .
And we are committed to working with anyone willing to achieve that . ”
With control of the Senate and House of Representatives at stake in the November election , Democrats and Republicans are keen to tap into the anger felt by many Americans against Wall Street firms in the wake of the financial crisis .
Reining in Wall Street would be a popular move with voters .
“ What is clear is that this crisis could have been avoided if Wall Street firms were more accountable , if financial dealings were more transparent , and if consumers and shareholders were given more information and authority to make decisions , ” Obama said in his weekly address .
He said the reforms would achieve the goals of transparency and protection , while closing loopholes that had allowed some firms to take huge risks that threatened the whole economy .
The Obama administration has taken a more aggressive stance on Wall Street since the Democrats lost a Senate seat in Massachusetts in January .
The election highlighted voter resentment against big banks and big bonuses .

We 've seen a number of creative uses for augmented reality recently , from Iron Man to virtual pets and even tattoos .
An interactive billboard in the Netherlands brings a powerful new example to the category by putting passersby in the middle of a virtual street fight .
The Dutch government created the billboard to address a pressing problem for public employees , who are often the targets of aggression and outright violence when performing their daily service duties .
The problem is compounded by Dutch citizens ' reluctance to interfere in others ' fights .
The goal of the PSA is to encourage citizens to stand up for public workers in violent confrontations .
The augmented reality billboard , placed above a busy intersection in Amsterdam , shows a real - time view of the street below but superimposes a green screen - filmed street fight into the otherwise empty curb space .
As passersby stop to stare at themselves on the billboard , they are confronted with a tense altercation occurring right in front of them .
The Dutch government hopes the ad will provoke a feeling of shame by showing citizens what they look like when they ignore such situations .
It 's an ambitious and complex emotional experiment that injects AR into daily life .
It 's also inspiring intense interest from Amsterdam pedestrians .
Check out the video below and let us know what you think .
Is an augmented reality street scenario jarring and strange or is it the future of advertising ?
Or both ?
Three " good " cops try to nab a notorious " perp " known as " The Nightflasher . "
In the process one of the cops ( Sledge ) is mortally wounded ( or so the three cops think ) .
Without Sledge 's knowledge or consent , a plan is hatched by the other two cops , ( Nicky and Perkins ) to murder him while on the job so that his family can cash the police life insurance policy .
The series ends with a hilarious twist and absolute proof that these three idiots are nothing , if not Good Cops .

Citizens , states and corporations are battling for online space .
What happened to the dream of global communication ?
Ron Deibert and Rafal Rohozinski report
At the end of 2009 , a social movement mobilised once again around an Iranian political crisis – from the streets of Iran ’s cities spreading through networks of support to Europe , North America and beyond .
In Toronto , where the Citizen Lab internet research and development centre is located , a dynamic group of Iranian students banded together with activists across the world , raising awareness and building support .
Together they have formed an identity unique to the 21st century : a cyber enabled , planetary resistance community .
The role of technology in events such as these is often overstated and the Iranian case is no exception .
The battle is about much more than the most recent social networking tool , no matter what label is assigned to this latest revolution .
But it should not be underestimated either .
Cyberspace is the domain through which the battle of ideas takes place today , and it is a heavily contested domain .
It is widely known that demonstrations can achieve broader support and publicity through the use of the internet and by the creative exploitation of mobile technologies such as SMS and video capture .
But the Iranian authorities are taking active counter - measures aimed at controlling the spaces online for resistance and dissent .
These measures include the wellknown technique of filtering access to websites at key internet chokepoints .
But there are also more offensive operations that are subtle , flexible and insidious .
These include tampering with internet connections , mobile and other telecommunications services ; monitoring social networking sites to identify key organisers , who are then subjected to threats and intimidation ; pressurising services in Iran to remove ‘ offensive ’ posts or blogs ; and arresting prominent writers and dissidents .
As two of the principal investigators of the OpenNet Initiative , a project whose aim is to monitor internet filtering and surveillance worldwide , these actions are increasingly familiar to us .
What is happening now in Iran offers a clear example of ‘ next generation ’ controls that are being exercised in cyberspace as the domain becomes more heavily contested and seen as a critical vector of the exercise of power .
Whereas in the past , freedom of expression activists and others concerned about human rights had to worry mostly about how to bypass internet filters , they now have to worry about a much broader suite of restraints , risks and liabilities .
Rather than first generation controls , as exemplified by China ’s great firewall , in which filtering technologies are employed in a constant manner at key internet chokepoints , we are seeing instead the emergence of methods designed to go beyond denial to shape and contain the space for expression online .
Since these controls tend to operate in the shadows , they are more difficult to monitor and thus present a challenge to rights organisations and monitoring groups like the OpenNet Initiative ( ONI ) .
They will require a new approach to research and advocacy in order to prevent the further encroachment of human rights online .
Burma 2007 .
Russia - Georgia 2008 .
China - Tibet 2008 .
Iran 2009 .
Xinjiang 2009 .
These recent events , although dissimilar in many ways , share several common threads .
The struggles on the ground were accompanied and very much influenced by a related struggle in cyberspace , between activists on the one hand and entrenched authorities on the other .
Not that long ago it would have been safe to assume the entrenched authorities were at a disadvantage , too inept to withstand digitally - enabled social movements .
Today , that is no longer a safe assumption .
The centre of gravity of techniques aimed at managing cyberspace has shifted from heavy - handed and often crudely implemented filtering to more sophisticated multi-pronged methods that seek to normalise control and the exercise of power in cyberspace .
There are numerous examples of these next generation controls from widely different regional contexts , suggesting the emergence of a very troubling global norm .
Countering all of them will require a new comprehensive approach .
Legal measures
One of the fastest growing and effective next generation controls concerns the broad use of slander , libel and other laws to restrict permissible communications and to create a climate of fear , intimidation and ultimately self - censorship .
In part , this reflects a natural maturation process as authorities seek to reign in cyberspace and bring it under regulatory oversight .
But more nefariously , it also reflects a tactic of strangulation , whereby threats of legal action can do more to prevent strategically threatening information from seeing the light of day than do more passive controls implemented in a defensive manner .
Although new laws are being drafted to deal with cyberspace security and regulation , sometimes old , obscure , or rarely enforced regulations are pointed to ex post facto to justify acts of internet censorship .
Ironically , we experienced this very type of control ourselves while at the Internet Governance Forum ( IGF ) meeting last November in Sharm El Sheikh , Egypt , when UN officials asked us to remove a banner for the ONI ’s new book on the topic of next generation controls , Access Controlled .
While the UN officials told us in person that the banner had to be removed because of references to China , they later justified the act publicly in reference to regulations prohibiting advertisements and banners in the halls of the IGF – regulations that seemed to many observers to be very unevenly enforced throughout the event .
Although examples of similar measures can be seen in almost all countries of the world , the most compelling cases are found in the countries of the former Soviet Union .
In Kazakhstan , for example , opposition websites or websites carrying material critical of the government are regularly deregistered from the national domain using a variety of vague laws and regulations as justification .
In years to come , we expect to see more use of legal levers such as these as a means to smother freedom of expression .
Informal requests
While legal measures create the regulatory context for denial , informal requests and other pressures made by authorities to private companies can be employed for more immediate ends .
Most often these informal requests come in the form of pressure on internet service providers and online service providers to ‘ take down ’ or remove offensive posts or information that threatens ‘ national security ’ or ‘ cultural sensitivities ’ .
Google ’s recent decision to reconsider its service offerings in China reflects , in part , that company ’s frustration with having to deal with such informal take - down requests from Chinese authorities on a regular basis .
Such informal requests can go further , putting pressure on the companies that run the infrastructure to render services inoperative in order to prevent their exploitation by opposition groups or activists .
In Iran , for example , the internet and other telecommunications services have slowed down during public demonstrations and in some instances have been entirely inaccessible for long periods of time or in certain regions .
While there is no official acknowledgement , it is noteworthy that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard owns the main ISP in Iran – the Telecommunication Company of Iran ( TCI ) .
Some reports indicate that officials from the Revolutionary Guard have pressured TCI to tamper with internet connections during the recent crises .
In countries where the lines between public and private authorities are often blurred , and / or organised crime and authority mingle in the dark underworlds , such informal requests and pressures can be particularly effective , opaque and nearly impossible to bring to public account .
Outsourcing and downloading
It is important to emphasise that cyberspace is owned and operated primarily by private companies .
The decisions taken by those companies on content controls can be as important as those taken by governments .
Often , private companies are compelled in some manner to do the job of censorship and surveillance in order to operate in a particular jurisdiction , as evidenced most prominently by the collusion of western search engines , such as Google ( up until January 2010 ) , Microsoft and Yahoo , in China ’s internet censorship practices .
In its most extreme forms , the outsourcing of these controls can take the form of illegal acts or acts that are contrary to publicly stated operating procedures and privacy protections .
This was dramatically illustrated in the case of Tom - Skype , in which the Chinese partner of Skype put in place a covert surveillance system to track and monitor pro-democracy activists who were using the chat function as a form of outreach .
The system was only discovered because of faulty security on the servers operated by Tom Online .
Presumably , many other such collusive acts of censorship and surveillance exist that are undiscovered .
For governments in both the developed and developing worlds , offloading such controls to private companies allows them to place their controls on the ‘ frontlines ’ of the networks and draw in the actors who manage the key access points and hosting platforms .
If trends continue , we can expect more censorship and surveillance responsibilities to be exercised by private companies , carrier hotels , ‘ cloud computing ’ ( internet - based ) networks , internet exchanges and telecommunications companies .
Such a shift in the locus of controls raises serious issues of public accountability and transparency for citizens of all countries .
It is in this context that Google ’s dramatic announcement to end censorship of its Chinese search engine should be considered a watershed moment .
Whether other companies follow Google ’s lead , and how China , other countries , and the international community as a whole react , are key open questions that could help determine the shape of public accountability of private actors in this domain .
Just - in - time blocking
Disabling or attacking critical information assets at key moments in time ( for example during elections or public demonstrations ) may be the most effective tool in terms of shaping outcomes in cyberspace .
Today , computer network attacks , including the use of distributed denial of service attacks , can be easily marshalled and targeted against key sources of information , especially in the developing world where networks and infrastructure tend to be fragile and prone to disruption .
The tools used to mount such attacks – called botnets – are now thriving like parasites in peer - to - peer architectures along the invisible underbelly of insecure servers , PCs , and social networking platforms .
Botnets can be activated by anyone willing to pay a fee against any target of opportunity .
There are cruder methods of effecting just - in - time blocking as well , like shutting off power to the buildings where servers are located or tampering with domain name registration so that information is not routed properly to its destination .
Such just - in - time blocking has been empirically documented by the ONI in Kyrgyzstan , Belarus and Tajikistan and reported in numerous other countries as well .
The attraction of just - in - time blocking is that information is only disabled at key intervals while kept accessible at other times , thus avoiding charges of internet censorship and allowing for plausible denials of censorship by the perpetrators .
In regions where internet connectivity can be spotty , just - intime blocking is easily reasoned away as just another technical glitch with the internet .
When such attacks are contracted out to criminal organisations , determining attribution of those responsible is nearly impossible .
Computer network attacks
Just - in - time blocking can take the form of computer network attacks .
But the latter can also be employed as a component of military action , low intensity conflict , or attacks on critical infrastructures – in other words , for strategic reasons separate from censorship .
For years , such attacks have been speculated upon and it was thought that interdependence among states served as a strong deterrent on their execution .
In recent years , however , there have been several high - profile incidences of computer network attacks , including those on Estonia in 2007 and during the Russia - Georgia war of 2008 .
In each of these cases , the circumstances surrounding the attacks were murky ( see ‘ Patriotic hacking ’ below ) , but the outcomes were not .
In Estonia , key critical information resources , such as 911 systems and hospital networks , were debilitated , as were Georgia ’s official channels of government communication .
What is most ominous about computer network attacks is that many governments are now openly considering their use as part of standard military doctrine .
President Obama ’s cyber security review , completed in May 2009 , may have unwittingly set off a security dilemma spiral in this respect with its official acknowledgment that the United States has such capabilities at its disposal – a decision that may come back to haunt the information dependent country when other actors follow suit .
Patriotic hacking
One of the characteristics of cyberspace is that individuals can engage in creative acts that have system - wide effects .
This is no less true in cases of individuals taking action against those they consider threats to their own state ’s national interests .
Citizens may bristle at outside interference in their country ’s internal affairs and can take offence at criticism directed at their own governments , however illegitimate they may appear to outsiders .
Some with the technical skills take it upon themselves to attack adversarial sources of information , often leaving provocative messages and warnings in their wake .
Such actions make it difficult to determine attribution behind the attacks – is it the government or the citizens acting alone ?
Or is it perhaps some combination of the two ?
Muddying the waters further , some government security services informally encourage or tacitly approve of the actions of patriotic groups .
In China , for example , the Wu Mao Dang , or 50 - cent party ( so named for the amount of money its members are ostensibly paid for each post made ) , patrol chatrooms and forums and post information favourable to the regime , while chastising its critics .
In Russia , it is widely believed that security services regularly coax hacker groups to fight for the motherland in cyberspace and may ‘ seed ’ instructions for hacking attacks on prominent nationalist websites and forums .
A shadowy group known as the Iranian Cyber Army took over Twitter and some key opposition websites towards the end of2009 , defacing the home pages with their own messages .
Although no formal connection has been established to the Iranian authorities , the groups responsible for the attacks posted pro-regime messages on the hacked websites and services .
Targeted surveillance / social malware attacks
Accessing sensitive information about adversaries is one of the most important levers in shaping outcomes , and so it should come as no surprise that great effort has been placed into targeted espionage .
The Tom - Skype example is only one of many such next generation methods now becoming common in the cyber ecosystem .
Infiltration of adversarial networks through targeted ‘ social malware ’ ( software designed to infiltrate an unsuspecting user ’s computer ) and drive - by web exploits ( websites infected with viruses that target insecure browsers ) is exploding throughout the dark underbelly of the internet .
Google ’s announcement in January 2010 that it had uncovered such a targeted espionage attack on its infrastructure is among the most prominent examples of this type of infiltration .
The growth in this sector can be attributed , in part , to the unintentional practices of civil society and human rights organisations themselves .
As our colleagues Nart Villeneuve and Greg Walton have shown , many civil society organisations lack simple training and resources , leaving them vulnerable to even the most basic of internet attacks .
Moreover , because such organisations tend to thrive on awareness raising and advocacy through social networking and email lists , they are often unwittingly compromised as vectors of attacks even by those whose motivations are not political per se .
In one particularly egregious example cited by Villeneuve and Walton , the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders unknowingly propagated a link to a malicious website posing as a Facebook petition to release the Tibetan activist Dhondup Wangchen .
As with computer network attacks , targeted espionage and social malware attacks are being developed not just by criminal groups and rogue actors , but also at the highest government levels .
The US director of national intelligence , Dennis Blair , recently remarked that the United States must be ‘ aggressive ’ in the cyber domain in terms of ‘ both protecting our own secrets and stealing those of others ’ .
Together , these next generation controls present major challenges for monitoring groups , rights organisations , and all of those who care about the future of openness and human rights online .
Our own OpenNet Initiative , for example , developed an elaborate methodology primarily oriented towards technically monitoring ‘ first generation ’ filtering at key internet chokepoints using network interrogation tools within countries under investigation .
While this mission is still essential and important , its methods are ill equipped to identify the range of next generation controls .
To remain relevant , the ONI needs to adjust , perhaps even undertake a paradigm shift , and develop new techniques to monitor more offensive means of blocking .
Next generation controls require next generation monitoring .
For rights organisations , darker clouds are looming on the horizon .
The context around free expression has become much more ominous and militarised than it was in the past as the norms around next generation controls spread and mature .
There is an arms race in cyberspace , with state militaries , extremists , non-state actors and other organisations engaged in increasingly aggressive interventions .
Meanwhile , the private actors who control the infrastructure of cyberspace are also becoming more important players in determining the scope for free expression online .
Together these present major new challenges and an entirely more hostile context that is becoming the norm .
Arms control in cyberspace is now an urgent matter .
Lastly , citizens around the world need to be made aware of the threats to the openness of cyberspace that this new generation of controls presents .
There is a degradation of valuable global communications occurring as ominous as the degradation of the natural environment .
For generations , philosophers have long speculated about a global communications platform through which citizens could communicate , share ideas and develop common solutions to problems in an unmediated fashion .
Writing in 1937 , HG Wells presented the outlines of such a possibility in his essay entitled ‘ World Brain ’ :
The whole human memory can be , and probably in a short time will be , made accessible to every individual …
It need not be concentrated in any one single place .
It need not be vulnerable as a human head or a human heart is vulnerable .
It can be reproduced exactly and fully , in Peru , China , Iceland , Central Africa , or wherever else seems to afford an insurance against danger and interruption .
It can have at once the concentration of a craniate animal and the diffused vitality of an amoeba .
No doubt Wells would shudder if he could see now that having come so close to achieving this very possibility , citizens of the world would allow it to implode in a spiral of weaponisation , militarisation and censorship .
A planetary social movement is required today that mobilises us all to protect the net as a forum for free expression , access to information and open communication .

Congressional Democrats exploit public outrage to enact a proposal ‘ with which people are more comfortable ’.
30 Apr 2010 | InfoShop News
Democrats on Capitol Hill are responding to public outrage over Arizona ’s racist immigration bill with a draft [ .pdf ] of the ‘ Comprehensive Immigration Reform ’ bill that includes “ a troubling provision which would create a biometric national ID card ” and mandatory fingerprinting for every worker in the U.S. , the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement today ..
“ If the biometric national ID card provision of the draft bill becomes law , every worker in America would have to be fingerprinted and a new federal bureaucracy — one that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars — would have to be created to issue cards , ” the civil liberties advocacy group said in strong opposition .
“ Creating a biometric national ID will not only be astronomically expensive , it will usher government into the very center of our lives .
Every worker in America will need a government permission slip in order to work .
And all of this will come with a new federal bureaucracy — one that combines the worst elements of the D.M.V. and the T.S.A. , ” said Christopher Calabrese of the A.C.L.U. Legislative Counsel .
Daniel Tencer reports at The Raw Story today that “ Believe System ” mandates an “ ID card for everyone in the work force ” , adding :
“ Believe ” is an acronym for Biometric Enrollment , Locally - stored Information and Electronic Verification of Employment .
The Social Security Administration would be responsible for running the ID card system .
“ Essentially , if you want to participate in the American economy , you need this card . ”
Ezra Klein notes at his Washington Post blog :
Pages 8 through 18 are devoted to “ ending illegal employment through biometric employment verification . ” …
“ Within five ( 5 ) years of the date of enactment , the fraud - proof social security card will serve as the sole acceptable document to be produced by an employee to an employer for employment verification purposes , ” the bill says .
“ This requirement will exist even if the employer does not yet possess the capability to electronically verify the employee by scanning the card through a card reader . ”
The theory here is simple : Illegal immigration is a problem because illegal immigrants can get jobs .
As the bill says , “ in order to prevent future waves of illegal immigration , this proposal recognizes that no matter what we do on the border , our ports of entry , and in the interior , we will not be completely effective unless we can prevent the hiring , recruitment , or referral of unauthorized aliens in America ’s workplaces .
Jobs are what draw illegal immigrants to the United States . ”
The bill , the A.C.L.U. adds , also calls for the perpetuity of the Draconian 287 ( g ) program — which the Obama Administration expanded in late July — to grant local enforcement with the powers of federal immigration agents to employ racial profiling , arbitrary confiscation of property and indefinite kidnapping .
Despite accounts of exceedingly inhumane conditions experienced by immigrants kidnapped by the government , the draft of the new bill “ describes some immigration detention reforms including a troubling provision that would grant ‘ heightened ’ detention authority to the government in certain circumstances ” , according to the A.C.L.U. statement .
This is an extension of the Department of Homeland Security calling the Varick Street Detention Center in New York City a “ good model “ .
At Varick , immigrant are regularly detained indefinitely without charges like roaches , or in solitary confinement , and committed to slave labor without legal representation , Nina Bernstein reported at The New York Times last November .
“ It is the routine violations that have been most shocking to the small bands of suburban volunteers who visit immigration detainees in New Jersey jails , ” she reported this week on a coalition report released by the American Friends Service Committee , the New York University Immigrant Rights Clinic and New Jersey Advocates for Immigrant Detainees , a coalition of religious and advocacy groups .
The report :
points to harsh conditions and arbitrary visiting restrictions imposed by a half - dozen New Jersey jails where Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds thousands of noncitizens each year while it tries to deport them … .
The report also describes how volunteer visitors have been trying to fill the gap in accountability : advocating for a seriously ill detainee denied his heart medication for weeks , foiling what it called the cover - up of one guard ’s abuse and persuading jailers to supply the pillows required under detention standards … .
Among the most distressing situations , [ Ruben Loyo , a student enlisted by the N.Y.U. council ] said , was that of Angela Joseph , a New Yorker who for three years had devoted hours each week to get 15 - minute visits with her brother Warren Joseph at the Hudson County jail , where there are no weekend visits and weekday visits end at 6:15 p.m. …
Even a brief outside presence is meaningful to those locked away far from relatives ; 84 percent of them have no lawyer , and none have any way to know when they will be freed , [ Karin Wilkinson , the leader of Middlesex First Friends ] said .
Kidnapping immigrants is big business , as Venita Gupta of the A.C.L.U. pointed out earlier this week at Russia Today ( 9:23 ) :
Anis Shivani at The Huffington Post observes this proposal has “ everything a power - mad D.H.S. bureaucrat could desire ” — one where people “ are presumed criminals and terrorists before they ’re given a chance to be half - treated as humans ” .
“ That ’s the whole thrust of the bill .
Immigrants are presumed criminals or terrorists .
The burden of proof is on them , ” he adds .
What ’s scarier is that uproar against Arizona ’s ‘ Papers Please Bill ’ was directed to the rhetoric which requires state and local police to demand proof of citizenship papers from anyone the officer has “ reasonable suspicion ” to believe is undocumented .
The objection is two - fold : ( 1 ) the obvious encouragement of racial profiling ; and ( 2 ) that immigration is a federal issue , not that of state and local governments .
Given that 287(g ) has existed with minimal objection and is re-confirmed in the draft of this bill , Congressional Democrats only object to enforcement powers added to state and local authorities .
Their solution : add power to the federal force , regulatory regime and database every worker in America .
I ’ve been highly suspicious of a bill with such nefarious rhetoric passing through the Arizona legislature and getting signed by the Arizona governor , following an uncanny massive international uproar .
Without putting the tin-foil hat on , I call ‘ false - flag ’ on the Arizona legislature .
I wo n’t go so far as to say that the federal government covertly pushed the bill through the Arizona legislature , but it ’s convenient for the agenda of the immigration hawks in Arizona .
Seriously believing a blatantly unconstitutional bill would present a significant threat to civil liberties is absurd .
Judge Andrew Napolitano at FOX
News accurately pointed out that no insurance company would cover the excess of lawsuits against Arizona ’s enforcement of the bill ( 0:56 ) :
“ Governments itch to tag their subjects like so many cattle , on any pretext whatsoever , ” Becky Avers , who ’s done extensive research in relentlessly following the possibilty of a national ID card , wrote at The Freeman earlier this month , predicting immigration hysteria would pave the way .
“ Ours thought it had a dandy excuse in the attacks of 9/11 , and who can blame it ?
Many Americans would eagerly sell their few remaining liberties so long as a politician assured them that said sale secured the homeland .
Ergo , the Feds invented a bogus link between terrorism and America ’s freedom from a national ID .
They swore they ’d prevent another 9/11 so long as we followed orders to carry ‘ enhanced ’ driver ’s licenses . ”
Democrats have a image of being soft on immigration , through there ’s no action to suggest it , but 2010 being an election year requires to counter this image .
Proposing a national ID card , continuation of 287( g ) , strengthening the D.H.S. and federal detention privileges counters the narrative of them being dovish on immigration .
Federalizing the Arizona bill takes the power away from state and local authorities to appeal to the progressive [ sic ] objection to the Arizona bill — that immigration is a federal issue .
Democrats and Republican plumbliners , soi disant progressives and conservatives will both agree the federal ‘ Comprehensive Immigration Reform ’ bill is less - terrible than the Arizona bill and the politicians will gain political capital .
This is Manufacturing Consent 101 .
The Hegelian Dialectic of problem - reaction - solution in practice : to push the agenda of the national ID card , the government had to counter massive public opposition to the Big Brother program .
Take a problem like Arizona , stir up a widespread negative reaction and push your initial nefarious will as the solution when people are thinking emotionally , still in their reactive shove of the problem .
The reactionism has cause the public to briefly forget the immorality of all immigration law , the torturous human trafficking industry it creates and the earlier - mentioned Draconian conditions of immigrant jails .
The focus of the public is just that the federal government do something — anything !— to counter the problem and all are pacified as the expense of all .
The Arizona bill created an atmosphere of begging the federal government to use its power and it should n’t surprise anyone to see how its exploiting genuine public fear and moral indignation in choosing to use that power .

While the relationship between Mr Buswell and Ms Carles was a personal matter , " Troy 's actions in relation to the use of his government entitlements in this matter is unacceptable " .
While sometimes errors were made in expense forms there was some " pre-thought " in Mr Buswell 's actions , Mr Barnett said .
Confession ... Fremantle MLA Adele Carles .
" As a result , this morning I informed the Treasurer that I believed his position as Treasurer and minister was now untenable .
Troy offered me his resignation , which I accepted .
This was the appropriate course of action . "
Mr Buswell revealed he had used ministerial cars three times to go to meet Ms Carles , as well as spending an extra night in Albany ahead of official duties there .
Both those had not been repaid .
The pair also met in Canberra after a ministerial council meeting , before travelling to Sydney for two days .
Mr Buswell said he paid for that part of the trip himself .
Mr Barnett said " the exercise at Albany does raise questions " about Mr Buswell 's use of ministerial privileges .
This morning I informed the Treasurer that I believed his position as Treasurer and Minister was now untenable .
Despite Mr Buswell 's past indiscretions , Mr Barnett said he did not regret giving him another chance .
" He was enthusiastic and good at his job and he 's lost the job he loved . "
Mr Barnett said Public Sector Commissioner Mal Wauchope would review the use of entitlements by Mr Buswell and Ms Carles .
Mr Buswell said today he would " do everything required " to help the investigation .
" I hope that I can continue to make a contribution to government from the backbench and to represent the constituents of Vasse , " he said .
" I would also like to apologise to the Premier , my ministerial colleagues , parliamentary colleagues , Liberal Party colleagues , staff , Liberal Party supporters and the constituents of Vasse . "
Mr Barnett outlined Mr Buswell 's fate at a press conference , two days after news broke of Mr Buswell 's affair with Ms Carles .
The Premier said he found out about the misuse of entitlements yesterday through his chief - of - staff , before Mr Buswell confessed publicly .
However , he did not blame Mr Buswell for not telling him personally .
" I think Troy was going through a very difficult time last week , emotionally , and his primary concern was his family . "
He allowed Mr Buswell to speak publicly yesterday and then have time to come to his decision .
" There 's no doubt Troy is an extremely talented person , but his personal conduct on a number of instances has let him down . "
The affair and its effects were the reasons Mr Buswell did not attend the Council of Australian Governments meeting held to discuss the federal government 's health reforms in Canberra last week , but his presence would have made little difference , Mr Barnett said .
The Premier admitted the saga was " a blow to the government " .
" It is a setback , it is a setback that we we will deal with and deal with in a professional way ...
Troy was a very key part of the government .
It 's now up to others to step up . "
" Troy 's a friend , he remains a friend .
He has however showed very poor judgement and he has paid a very high price . "
Opposition leader Eric Ripper said Mr Barnett was left with no other choice but to dump his controversial Treasurer , who had " form " on misappropriating taxpayer funds following revelations he had lodged a $ 240 expenses claim for staying at his own house in Perth .
But he said Ms Carles should not escape scrutiny for her role in the affair .
He said serious doubt had been cast on her voting record , especially since she abstained on a vote to investigate Mr Buswell 's expenses claim .
Mr Ripper also called on the Corruption and Crime Commission to oversee the Wauchope investigation , saying an inquiry could not be independent if simply carried out by the Public Service Commissioner , who was answerable to Mr Barnett .
He said the Premier had talked about openness and accountability being the hallmarks of his government , but had yet to finalise a ministerial code of conduct and had resisted the Opposition 's efforts to obtain documents through the Freedom of Information process .
Mr Barnett will take on the Treasury portfolio in the short term , including delivering the budget on May 20 .
The cabinet signed off on the budget last week , so most of the work has been done .
However , Mr Barnett conceded that being Premier and Treasurer was not ideal and he would look to make a permanent appointment later this year .
While he did not rule out Mr Buswell returning to Cabinet , he would remain on the outer " for the forseeable future " .
" The changes I 've indicated are designed to cause minimum disruption , " Mr Barnett said .
Nedlands MLA
Bill Marmion has been promoted to the Cabinet to take on Mr Buswell 's portfolios of Commerce , Science and Innovation , and Housing and Works .
Helen Morton will become Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier , Treasurer and State Development Minister .
Taxpayer funds abused in affair Yesterday , Mr Buswell fronted a media pack to say he was " truly sorry " for the four - month affair , but he would not resign from his Cabinet post .
Mr Buswell broke his silence after Ms Carles revealed that the pair had recently broken off their relationship .
He admitted using ministerial privileges , and taxpayers ' money , to arrange secret liaisons with Ms Carles .
Mr Buswell said he would pay back the cost of those meetings , which he estimated could be between $ 200 and $ 300 .
He said he did not want the affair to become public , because of the effect it might have on his wife , Margaret , who it is understood has already thrown Mr Buswell out of the family home .
However , he refused to answer when asked if he would have repaid the money had it remained private .
Ms Carles said she " at no time " misused any of her parliamentary entitlements .
She paid for the trip to Canberra and Sydney , and claimed for one night in Albany when she went there " to tour the Albany Wind Farm and to discuss renewable energy options for the electorate of Fremantle " .
However she did not lodge any claim for the Thursday night she spent with Mr Buswell .
Buswell pleads for forgiveness
Mr Buswell said he would be seeking professional help for his indiscretions and asked for forgiveness from his family , parliamentary colleagues and Ms Carles ' family .
" I would like to offer my sincerest , most heartfelt apologies for all those who have been hurt by these events , " he said .
" I would particularly like to apologise to my wife and boys .
My lack of judgement in this matter has disappointed a great number of people who have stood behind me .
" Good , decent , hard - working people who have offered me their unflinching support feel let down . "
Mr Buswell refused to confirm whether or not he had personally told Mr Barnett that he had spent taxpayers ' money during the affair .
" My understanding is that the Premier 's office is fully aware of those matters , " he said .
But when pressed on why would he not tell Mr Barnett about the misuse of taxpayer funds , he said " the Premier has been away on his ( Toodyay ) farm " .
The pair discussed the affair " a while back " , and Mr Barnett had expressed " his extreme disappointment with me for my actions " .
Mr Buswell acknowledged it was Mr Barnett 's prerogative to sack him , should he so wish , but he wanted to remain as Treasurer to deliver the May 20 state budget .
He would not be drawn into comparisons with more than 40 doctors and nurses sacked last month after fraudulent salary packaging claims , instead claiming some had kept their jobs .
" I acknowledge what I 've done is wrong , I will be repaying the money . "
Mr Buswell refused to say whether he was still living with his wife , or whether he believed he could save his marriage .
However , he said " I can give an unequivocal no " when asked if Ms Carles had voted with the government on various bills because of the affair .
Ms Carles had contacted him after releasing a statement on Saturday , and he in turn told her he would speak today .
Carles confesses to affair Ms Carles , 41 , who is married with three daughters , confessed to the " brief " affair on Sunday .
Mr Buswell , 44 , is also married , with two sons .
He is reported to have moved out of the home he shared with Margaret last week and is believed to be living with Energy Minister Peter Collier .
Both Ms Carles and Mr Buswell laid low over the weekend after news of the affair broke .
Mr Buswell cancelled plans to attend the Anzac Day service in his home town of Busselton yesterday , and refused to comment when approached by media , while Ms Carles is believed to be in the Margaret River area .
" It is with deep regret that I acknowledge having an affair with the Treasurer , Troy Buswell , " Ms Carles was quoted as saying .
" It lasted several months and it is over now .
" I could attempt to portray myself as the vulnerable one who was taken advantage of .
However , this is simply not true .
" We made a mutual , albeit stupid , decision as two consenting adults .
" To my constituents in Fremantle , I apologise . "
She told Greens MPs about the affair last week .
It is understood they told her to make it public .
Track record counted against Buswell
Edith Cowan University and Curtin University political analyst Harry Phillips said Mr Barnett had no option but to seek Mr Buswell 's resignation .
" But Troy Buswell beat that by reading the play , " Dr Phillips said .
" It 's a blow for the government .
Most people regard ( Mr Buswell ) as a very capable treasurer and politician . "
Mr Buswell would now have to prove himself again on the back bench in the next 18 months in order to be readmitted to cabinet in future , Dr Phillips said .
" He will probably have to show the Premier - who is a great supporter of him - that he has tried to amend his ways . "
Mr Barnett had also made the right move by taking over the Treasury portfolio .
" He may not know the micro-details , but he would know the dimensions of the state budget , " Dr Phillips said .
Because of the scandal , Ms Carles would find it difficult to retain Fremantle at the next election , Dr Phillips said .
She defeated Labor candidate - and former Fremantle mayor - Peter Tagliaferri to win a by - election last year .
Mr Tagliaferri has declined to comment on the latest matter .
Greens back Carles Greens leader Giz Watson commended her parliamentary colleague on coming forward about her relationship with the former Liberal leader .
" Adele has had the courage to say that she is an equal partner in this brief relationship that they have had , " Ms Watson told Radio 6 PR .
" She 's not trying to stick the blame to Mr Buswell alone . "
Ms Watson said she had briefed Mr Barnett about the affair and said the matter was deeply distressing for all involved .
" All of us , all the branch members of parliament , including Adele to her full credit , have agreed to make a statement and to end any kind of rumour and speculation in this regard , " she said .
" There are consequences and there is a lot of distress around these matters .
All I can say is that I again thank Adele for having the guts to come out and make a statement .
" It 's obviously a matter for the party to consider , but I would give my personal support to Adele in this very difficult time .
" Be mindful that if hurtful things are said , both these families have children and they are completely innocent in this process . "
Careers spent in the spotlight Mr Buswell resigned as leader of the WA Liberal Party in August 2008 after revelations of inappropriate behaviour came to light .
He admitted sniffing the chair of a female staff member , and snapping a Labor staffer 's bra .
He was replaced by Barnett , but was handed the powerful Treasury and Commerce portfolios after the shock 2008 state election result , which saw Labor dumped from power .
Ms Carles became the first member of the WA Greens ever elected to the WA Legislative Assembly when she won a by - election for the seat of Fremantle in May 2009 .
The seat had long been a Labor stronghold , held by former powerbroker Jim McGinty .

Ms Carles ran a strong campaign against Mr McGinty in the 2008 election , narrowly missing out on toppling the incumbent .
However , she went one better after Mr McGinty announced he was quitting politics following the election loss .

Recently Microsoft announced a new product it will be releasing called Oragami .
It is an interesting piece of hardware that falls somewhere between a PDA and a laptop in both size and functionality .
Unfortunately for Microsoft , products like these are practically doomed to fail outside of their niche markets .
And this trend continues not because quality products are n’t produced , but rather they are solutions in search of a problem .
As products , they have fundamental flaws which inevitably lead to their failure in the marketplace .
Here is a brief summary of the main reasons why Oragami ( and devices like it ) wo n’t be successful .
Who is it geared to ?
The biggest problem with a device like this is that everyone who might buy it , already has something that works just fine right now .
Thus , for a product like this to survive , Microsoft must convince a sufficient number of consumers that the current way they are doing things is n’t very good .
And the only way to make their lives better is to use the new product .
This is a very hard task to accomplish because this type of device is trying to pull people in from two different consumer groups , PDA users and ultra-portable laptop users .
PDA users will most likely look at Origami and conclude that it is too big for what they need .
These are users who favor BlackBerries , PDA Cell Phones , Palm Pilots and the like .
They are looking for a small device that will organize their life and fit in their pocket .
This Origami device should easily do the former , but its dimensions prevent it from realizing the latter .
So , all but the most diehard of PDA junkies wo n’t be interested in Origami .
Having failed in the PDA market , an enterprising company will turn to another promising market , laptop users .
Sadly Microsoft ( or any another company ) wo n’t have much more luck here than it did with the PDA crowd , but that wo n’t prevent a valiant attempt from being made .
What argument can possibly be made that will convince someone who already owns a small laptop or a tablet PC to give Origami a try ?
What can it do that a standard laptop can ’t ?
Yes it is smaller , but also much harder to use due to a small screen , cramped keyboard and tiny controls .
Dedicated Devices vs Mutli-Use Systems
Where are tablets most popular ?
In industries that need a dedicated device that performs a small set of functions very well .
Nurses , deliverymen , inventory control clerks , Firemen ( they use them in the trucks for maps and reports ) .
Other professionals in similar industries can always find a use for a moderately cheap , fairly durable tablet PC .
These types of users will gladly buy a device like this . . .
FOR THEIR JOB .
But when quiting time rolls around they get dropped on the desk as everyone heads home .
Meaning , they do n’t use these products at the office and then go out and order one for home too .
They have no need for one at home , only in their work environment .
Thus these users are a profitable niche market , but one that is incapable of driving any explosive growth on the consumer side .
Why ?
Because the current group of dedicated devices has the market locked up pretty tight already .
Consumers have no reason to go out and spend $ 1,000 on Origami when the same functionality can be had in 3 or 4 cheaper products .
Need to play music ?
Get an iPod , $ 100
Need to organizes your life ?
Get a PDA , $ 100
Need to play movies ?
Get a portable DVD player , $ 100
Need to make phone calls ?
Get a cell phone , $ 50
$ 350 – 4 devices vs $ 1,000 – 1 device
Consumers will look at this and realize that if they really wanted to scrap most of their dedicated devices , then they are much better off spending an extra hundred dollars or so and getting a decent laptop .
It will have a bigger screen , bigger harddrive , more RAM , a keyboard and trackpad , DVD drive , lots of ports and will be easier to use than Origami .
It might be heavier , but how many of us are really going to care about a few extra pounds when there is so much else going for the laptop ?
Interface
This is the most difficult problem , by far , that must be overcome before adoption of Origami ( or any other such product ) can really take off .
And unfortunately for Microsoft ( and in fact most other companies ) they will never be able to beat this one .
Not because they do n’t have the programmers to write the code or the resources to make the product ( s ) , but rather , they lack someone who will put “ ease of use ” above everything else .
Someone who will focus on style before features .
That someone is not Bill Gates .
Origami ( or Apple ’s fabled ‘ SuperPod ’ ) will ultimately be faced with the same question .
Should the device run a specialized OS ( think Palm Pilot or iPod ) or an actual operating system ( Windows CE , OS X kitty cat ) ?
This is a crucial choice because if the device is to complex then operating it will be too much of a hassle and no one will use it .
Make it too simple and you will never be able to convince people to spend $ $ $ on a glorified PDA .
A balance must be struck , but where ?
What is more important , funcitonality or ease of use ?
If Microsoft does this I see it as a laptop that is just really hard to use .
If Apple does it , I see it as a much simpler portable media device .
Where Origami will have a keyboard , Apple will have a scroll wheel .
Origami can be used with one hand , a device from Apple can be operated with one finger .
And yet , I still do n’t know what the point would be .
If Apple produced this product tomorrow it might succeed .
Notice I said might .
If a product such as Origami came from Apple it would definitely look cool .
And it would be easy to use .
It would integrate tightly with all of Apple ’s other products .
. . but even with all of that going for it , I am not sure we are really ready for such a device .
What will we do with it ?
Seriously , at the end of the day what makes this product special enough for you to spend almost a thousand dollars on it ?
Do you really need your media portable that bad ?
Even if it was as easy to use as the iPod , what would be the main selling point ?
It plays movies ?
I do n’t think the demand is there yet .
Wireless internet ?
Get a laptop .
Music ?
Pictures ?
Games ?
Maybe what you really need is a PSP .
This alone should be the biggest indicator that the market is n’t ready for something like this .
If you look at things fairly and are struck by the fact that even Apple might not be able to pull this one off , well , at that point it is time to reconsider what it is exactly Microsoft hopes to accomplish .
But maybe I am wrong .
Maybe the demand is there .
Maybe Origami will be everything Microsoft hopes it will be .
Maybe people will use it to listen to music , watch movies , organize their lives , read books , play games and maybe it will become a sensation on par with the iPod .
Maybe . . .
But I would n’t bet the farm on it .
