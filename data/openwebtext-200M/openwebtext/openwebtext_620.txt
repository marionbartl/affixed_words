Does wearing the color red give you a sexual edge ?
Maybe , according to a new study , which found that men find women sexier if they 're sporting a crimson hue rather than , say , blue or green .
One of the images used in the study that found red clothing fans the flames of passion .
However , red wo n't make you look smarter or more competent , says study author Andrew Elliot , Ph.D. , a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester in New York .
" We only found the effect for attraction , so males do n't rate females in red as more intelligent , more likable , or as having a better personality ; they only rate her as sexier and more attractive , " he says .
Men also were more likely to say they wanted to have sex with a woman and that they would be willing to spend more on a date if she were in red , according to the report in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
In a series of five studies , about 150 heterosexual men ( homosexual men and those with red- green color blindness were excluded ) rated photographs of women framed in red , white , gray , green , or blue , or with the woman in a red or blue shirt .
On a 7 - point scale , with 1 being the least sexy and 7 a white - hot sex goddess , the color red added about 1.25 points to the rating , says Elliot .

That 's nice , but given the looming election , one might wonder :
Does wearing red make you more attractive in the voting booth too ?
Elliot says the study results do n't really apply to the presidential candidates .
However , he does say that red can be a negative color , depending on the setting .
" We actually have other research showing that red on the cover of an IQ test leads to worse performance , so red is actually a negative color [ in some instances ] , " says Elliot .
" In terms of the election , I will say that if a politician wears a red tie he -- or she -- may be viewed as more dominant and that might have an effect , but again , that 's way beyond our data , " he explains .
" Red in competence and achievement settings has a negative effect , so these things are really hard to talk about and predict right now . "
Why is red so sexy ?
The researchers have a couple of theories .
Read four myths about healthy sex
One is cultural : From red roses to Valentine 's Day , red is the universally recognized sign of romance ; it makes sense that men may subconsciously associate the color red with sex .
" We think that red , due to the association with hearts and Valentine 's Day and lingerie and things like that , takes on a sexy meaning , " says Elliot .
" There 's also a possibility -- a rather provocative possibility -- that there 's a deeply embedded sort of tendency for heterosexual men to see red as an attraction cue because that 's what happens in the wild . "
For example , the rumps of some primates turn red during ovulation , so it 's possible that men have some tiny portion deep in their brain that recognizes red as a mating symbol -- even though it's an association that has n't come in handy for a few million years .
And it 's not just men .
The researchers think that women will find the color sexy too ( tests are under way ) , possibly because red symbolizes dominance in male primates .

However , it 's all speculation at this point .
The study can't determine if red is sexy because we 're all just a bunch of animals running around in business suits , or if red is a culturally determined sex symbol .
It also can't determine if wearing red has an effect outside the laboratory .
" In the real world , we have a welter of information coming at us about smell , sight , words -- who knows what accounts for the most variance in liking and behavior ? " says Elliot .
" My strong guess is that if you bring this to the real world and have females who are interested in their date and wear red , they are sending the message to the male that a male is n't even aware of -- they are sending a message that ' I 'm available ' . "

What the Bible says about homosexuality and other abominations
Today voters go to the polls in California to vote for or against Proposition 8 , which “ Eliminates Right of Same - Sex Couples to Marry . ”
If passed , Prop 8 will “ change the California Constitution to eliminate the right of same - sex couples to marry in California . ”
A new section would be added , stating “ only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ”
Because of the importance of precedence in the law , and the size and importance of California in American politics , this proposition is historic .
The issue of Gay marriage in particular , and homosexuality in general , is a case study in how religion , especially Christianity , has erred egregiously .
The overwhelming evidence from science shows that gender preference is primarily determined by our genetics and prenatal biochemistry , especially embryological hormone balance .
Almost everyone is born attracted to members of the opposite sex .
A small percentage — perhaps as few as one to two percent ( but probably not as high as ten percent , as some estimates have put it ) — are attracted to members of the same sex .
Asking a homosexual when he or she chose to become gay is like asking a heterosexual when he or she chose to become straight .
The answer you will get ( I know because I ’ve asked ) is “ Uh ? I did n’t choose .
I ’ve always felt that way . ”
And that ’s the answer I get from straights as well as gays .
Nevertheless , on this particular issue Christianity remains mired in pre-civil rights , pre-enlightenment , even pre-scientific medieval thinking , basing their beliefs on a few biblical passages , most famously Leviticus 18:22 : “ Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination . ”
This prohibition is tucked in between other passages in Leviticus and Deuteronomy that should be repeated every time someone cites the above passage .
( All biblical passages cited within are from the Revised Standard Version . )
For example , for professional women thinking of adorning themselves in business attire that may resemble men ’s business ware ( or for guys who dig cross dressing ) , Deuteronomy 22:5 does not look kindly on such behaviors : “ A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man , nor shall a man put on a woman ’s garment ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God . ”
An even worse abomination is a rebellious child .
Deuteronomy 21:18 –21 offers this parental moral guideline : “ If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son , who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother , and , though they chastise him , will not give heed to them , then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives , and they shall say to the elders of his city , ‘ This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton and a drunkard . ’
Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones ; so you shall purge the evil from your midst ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear . ”
If that is n’t jarring enough , here is the Bible ’s recommendation on how to deal with women who may or may not have had sex before marriage .
According to Deuteronomy 22:13 –21 , “ If any man takes a wife , and goes in to her , and then spurns her , and charges her with shameful conduct , and brings an evil name upon her , saying , ‘ I took this woman , and when I came near her , I did not find in her the tokens of virginity , ’ then the father of the young woman and her mother shall take and bring out the tokens of her virginity to the elders of the city in the gate . ”
( For those not accustomed to reading between the biblical lines , the phrase “ goes in to her ” should be taken literally , and “ the tokens of virginity ” means the hymen and the blood on the sheet from a virgin ’s first sexual experience . )
If the father of the bride can produce the tokens of virginity , then he “ shall spread the garment before the elders of the city .
Then the elders of that city shall take the man [ the husband ] and whip him ; and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver , and give them to the father of the young woman , because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel ; and she shall be his wife . ”
However , lo to the woman who has dared to have sex before marriage .
“ But if the thing is true , that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young woman , then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father ’s house , and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones , because she has wrought folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father ’s house ; so you shall purge the evil from the midst of you . ”
To be fair , not all biblical ethics are this antiquated and extreme .
There is much to pick and choose from that is useful for our thinking about moral issues .
The problem here is consistency , and selecting ethical guidelines that support our particular personal or social prejudices and preferences .
When slavery was the social norm , it was simple for pro-slavery defenders to point to passages such as those in Exodus 21 , which outlines the rules for the proper handling of slaves , for example , “ when you buy a Hebrew slave , he shall serve six years , and in the seventh he shall go out free , for nothing , ” and “ when a man sells his daughter as a slave , she shall not go out as the male slaves do . ”
Of course , we no longer endorse slavery , or the death penalty for disobedient children , nonvirginal women , and adulterers , so why pick on the gays ?
What happened to the ethic of Christian charity and Jesus ’ doctrine of love for all humanity ?
In their stead , we find Christian preachers , writers , and theologians who think nothing of tormenting gays by telling them that their desire to love another person of the same sex is an “ abomination , ” by telling them that they have a disease that can be “ cured ” through “ treatment , ” and by telling them that promiscuity is evil but that the single best prophylactic against it — marriage — is legally banned from them .
Worse , some Christians actually believe they are being charitable by proclaiming that they “ hate the sin , not the sinner , ” which is not dissimilar to what Christians declared just before lighting faggots to burn women to save their souls for allegedly practicing witchcraft , or when Christians called for pogroms against Jews for being Christ - killers .
Mark my words .
Here is what is going to happen .
Within a decade , maybe two , Christians will come around to treating gays no differently than they now treat members of other groups whom they previously persecuted — women , Jews , blacks — but not because of some new interpretation of a biblical passage , or because of a new revelation from God .
These changes will come about the same way that they always do : by the oppressed minority fighting for the right to be treated equally , and by a few enlightened members of the oppressing majority supporting their cause .
Then what will happen is that Christians will take credit for the civil liberation of gays , dig through the historical record and find a few Christian preachers or bloggers who had the courage and the character to stand up for Gay rights when their fellow Christians would not , and then cite those as evidence that were it not for Christianity , gays would not be equal .
Finally , politics and religion aside , are we to believe that the biggest concern of the creator of the universe — that all - knowing , all - powerful all - good deity capable of constructing stars , planets , life , consciousness and love — is what consenting adults do with their sexual organs in the privacy of their bedrooms ?

The 2001 VW Microbus concept was really cool ; so much so that it looked like it was headed for 2005 production .
Then the project started getting expensive at the same time the U.S. dollar began to hit the skids .
So , then - boss Bernd Pischetsrieder swung the axe , and it was curtains for the retro breadbox .
Fast - forward to the present .
Instead of a spiffy new Microbus , we now have the Routan , which is fake German for " Dodge Caravan . "
Not very exciting , to say the least .
A revival of Flower Power 's official vehicle seemed hopeless -- until now .
The Sydney Morning Herald reports that VW 's entertaining the possibility of a 21st - century Microbus built on the same platform as the new sedan that 'll pe produced at VW 's Chattanooga , TN facility .
An unnamed " senior Volkswagen official " told the paper that European production 's basically a non-starter , and Volkswagen Group of America 's Jill Bratina played it coy , saying only that a second vehicle line out of Chattanooga is " conceivable in the foreseeable future . "
A locally - built , car - based Microbus is an idea that certainly piques our interest .
How about yours ?

Enlarge By Eric Jamison , AP Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , the governor of Alaska , arrives at a rally in Henderson , Nev. , on Tuesday with daughters Willow , to her immediate left , and Piper .
Federal records indicate the Republican National Committee spent about $ 150,000 to clothe and accessorize Palin and family members .
PALIN AIDE : CANDIDATE'S CLOTHING TO BE DONATED PALIN AIDE : CANDIDATE'S CLOTHING TO BE DONATED
A spokeswoman for Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin says the campaign will donate to charity some $ 150,000 in clothing and accessories the Republican National Committee has purchased for the Alaska governor .
Money donated to the Republican campaign paid for the clothes and others items .
The announcement comes after Politico.com reported that the RNC had spent more than $ 49,000 at Saks Fifth Avenue stores in St. Louis and New York and another $ 75,000 at Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis .
The purchases were reported in the McCain campaign 's September FEC report .
Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt released a statement saying it was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign .
- The Associated Press The Republican National Committee has spent more than $ 150,000 to clothe and accessorize vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family since her surprise pick by John McCain in late August .
According to financial disclosure records , the accessorizing began in early September and included bills from Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis and New York for a combined $ 49,425.74 .
POLITICS BLOG : Would male politician face same scrutiny ?
The records also document a couple of big - time shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis , including one $ 75,062.63 spree in early September .
The RNC also spent $ 4,716.49 on hair and makeup through September after reporting no such costs in August .
The cash expenditures immediately raised questions among campaign finance experts about their legality under the Federal Election Commission 's long - standing advisory opinions on using campaign cash to purchase items for personal use .
Politico asked the McCain campaign for comment , explicitly noting the $ 150,000 in expenses for department store shopping and makeup consultation that were incurred immediately after Palin 's announcement .
Pre -September reports do not include similar costs .
Spokeswoman Maria Comella declined to answer specific questions about the expenditures , including whether it was necessary to spend that much and whether it amounted to one early investment in Palin or if shopping for the vice presidential nominee was ongoing .
" The campaign does not comment on strategic decisions regarding how financial resources available to the campaign are spent , " she said .
But hours after the story was posted on Politico 's website and legal issues were raised , the campaign issued a new statement .
" With all of the important issues facing the country right now , it 's remarkable that we 're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses , " said spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt .
" It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign . "

The business of primping and dressing on the campaign trail has become fraught with political risk in recent years as voters increasingly see an elite Washington out of touch with their values and lifestyles .
In 2000 , Democrat Al Gore took heat for changing his clothing hues .
And in 2006 , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) was ribbed for two hair styling sessions that cost about $ 3,000 .
Then , there was Democrat John Edwards ' $ 400 hair cuts in 2007 and Republican McCain 's $ 520 black leather Ferragamo shoes this year .
A review of similar records for the campaign of Democrat Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee turned up no similar spending .
But all the spending by other candidates pales in comparison to the GOP outlay for the Alaska governor whose expensive , designer outfits have been the topic of fashion pages and magazines .
What has n't been apparent is where the clothes came from – her closet back in Wasilla or from the campaign coffers in Washington .
The answer can be found inside the RNC's September monthly financial disclosure report under " itemized coordinated expenditures . "
It 's a report that typically records expenses for direct mail , telephone calls and advertising .
Those expenses do show up , but the report also has a new category of spending : " campaign accessories . "
September payments were also made to Barney 's New York ( $ 789.72 ) and Bloomingdale 's New York ( $ 5,102.71 ) .
Macy's in Minneapolis , another store fortunate enough to be situated in the Twin Cities that hosted last summer 's Republican National Convention , received three separate payments totaling $ 9,447.71 .
The entries also show a few purchases at Pacifier , a top notch baby store , and Steiniauf & Stroller Inc. , suggesting $ 295 was spent to accommodate the littlest Palin to join the campaign trail .
An additional $ 4,902.45 was spent in early September at Atelier , a high - class shopping destination for men .

I personally happen to be anti gun , I believe people should not kill each other so there is no need for handguns .
but Switzerland , a Utopian society is a good example of how the 2nd amendment maybe should have worked .
every male ( and voluntary females ) is required to be part of the militia , and they are issued weapons and gear accordingly to keep stowed properly or else !
yet there is little crime and everyone keeps their doors unlocked .
this site http://www.cncguns.com, was created by a true gun enthusiast [ Justin ’s ] been CNC milling his own gun parts for quite a while .
We ’ve been a fan of his work simply because of the technical challenge that this sort of milling presents .
Even if you ’re anti-gun , you should check out the work he ’s been turning out .

The answer is , yes - I prefer to go down in flames , hitching a ride with the Valkyries to Valhalla rather than cheerleading for a man who would choose a woman as his running mate with such a wretched moral sense .
I have , with few exceptions , tempered my criticism of John McCain ’s proposed policies during this latter part of the campaign , concentrating instead on the horse race because frankly , there are many conservatives more qualified than I and more familiar with the issues who are doing a much better job than I could in making the conservative case for McCain despite his more problematic stands on issues .
I have also , for the most part , given a pass to McCain on the question of judgment , although I think the post mortems on McCain ’s campaign will reveal some monumental blunders on the economic crisis as well as their electoral strategy ( where they expended limited resources ) .
On the question of the Palin pick , however , I have had no such qualms in supporting McCain .
Marc Ambinder ( no fan of Palin ) explains why the Alaska governor was really the only pick McCain could make :
A Sunday morning quarterback still makes a persuasive argument for picking Palin .
In this environment , the Republican candidate could only win if he consolidates his base and wins a majority of persuadable votes ; the Democrat simply has to turn out Democrats .
Though McCain at one point wanted to pick Joe Lieberman , he ’d have cut a leg from the stool and replaced it with one that , aside from his party affiliation — independent Democrat — has no real appeal among independents anymore .
One step backward and no steps forward .
By the time the news began to leak out that McCain wanted Lieberman , the trail balloon was also leaky .
Republican delegations made it clear that they ’d walk out on McCain .
We still do n’t know why McCain decided that the risk was n’t worth taking — that ’s for another Draper piece — but we know that he suddenly shifted back to someone who had impressed him early on , someone who , at the time , could check the two boxes : excite Republicans and convert independents and persuadables .
Whether the vetting was complete or rushed , whether Palin and her advisers were completely forthcoming about her record ….
again , wait for the Draper piece .
The point here is that the choice was defensible .
That almost every piece of information that has come out subsequent to the pick has hurt Palin can be interpreted in several ways : either the media was preordained to crush her spirit from the beginning , or the McCain campaign did n’t know about them , or they ’ve been distorted beyond any sense of the rational .
I would add that Palin defenders have hit the nail on the head when they make the case for distortion , bias , double standards , and outright lies and rumors being printed by the MSM .
The case of Palin ’s belief in creationism is a perfect example .
The rumor started on a site written by a Palin hater in Alaska that she believed people walked the earth with dinosaurs and that she wished to teach creationism “ alongside ” evolution in Alaskan schools .
The rumor was printed verbatim and passed off as truth in the Los Angeles Times among other outlets .
Palin never said any such thing nor does she believe that creationism has a place in a public school curriculum .
It was a lie made up out of whole cloth , swallowed by the press , and given wide distribution by liberal blogs who never bothered to check the provenance of the story .
Pattericio points out that the Times never retracted one bit of the story .
Ambinder makes the same case I ’ve been making since Palin was chosen ; that McCain basically had no choice but to pick her .
( For your Romneyites I only have one word : Mormon ) .
But this does n’t negate certain facts .
Palin is unready to hold high office and wo n’t be , in my opinion , for perhaps a year .
The public is n’t buying the counter argument and her negatives are so high now she has become a huge drag on the campaign with two groups that McCain absolutely must win over if he is to win ; white women and independents .
Palin may have solidified the base but you do n’t win too many elections getting 30 % of the vote .
No doubt a large part of the problem has been the unfair treatment she has received in the media .
But you ca n’t just explain away the voter ’s unhappiness with Palin by ascribing all her negatives to media bias and manipulation .
The American people are a little smarter than that .
Perhaps they sense something about her that Palin worshipers fail to see .
It certainly does n’t help Palin ’s case when she makes a statement like this :
Brian Williams :
Is an abortion clinic bomber a terrorist under this definition ?
Sarah Palin : [ Sighs ]
There ’s no question Bill Ayres , under his own admittance , was , um , one who sought to destroy , er , our US Capitol and our Pentagon .
That is a domestic terrorist .
There ’s no question there .
Now , others who would want to engage in harming innocent Americans or facilities , that , uh , er , that would be unacceptable .
Uh , I do n’t know if you ’re going to use the word “ terrorist ” there , but it ’s unacceptable and , uh , um , it , er , would not be condoned , of course , on , on our watch , but [ sigh ]
I do n’t know what you ’re asking is if I regret referring to Bill Ayres as an unrepentant domestic terrorist .
I do n’t regret characterizing him as that .
Brian Williams : I ’m just asking what other categories you would put in there .
Abortion clinic bombers , protesters in cities where fires were started , molotov cocktails were thrown , people died .
Sarah Palin : I would put in that category of Bill Ayres anyone else who would seek to campaign to destroy our United States Capitol and our Pentagon and would seek to destroy innocent Americans .
There is no mistaking her answer .
I sought out a fuller transcript in order to ascertain her exact words as well as her full response and any follow up question asked by Williams .
Sarah Palin is refusing to call people who would bomb abortion clinics terrorists .
Yes , she condemns their actions .
But she is parsing the definition of terrorism so as not to offend that small , but vocal part of the conservative base who may not see clinic bombers as heroes , but refuse to place their actions in a a moral context that equates the tactics of the jihadis with the Eric Rudolphs of the world .
This is moral cowardice .
The purpose of bombing abortion clinics ( it has n’t happened in a decade ) is exactly the same as fanatics who set off car bombs in crowded markets ; that is , to intimidate and to terrorize people .
Have Muslim fanatics set off more bombs than Christians ?
Of course they have .
But if you are going to base a moral judgment on numbers of dead , then you are probably able to parse the moral guilt of Hitler compared to Stalin - or perhaps Hitler compared to Idi Amin .
The death of innocents perpetrated for political ends , be it fewer abortions due to the terrorizing of women and fewer abortion clinics due to their destruction , or the blowing up of a marketplace to intimidate and frighten people into abandoning support for their government is terrorism .
It is always terrorism .
It was terrorism yesterday , it is terrorism today , and it will be terrorism tomorrow .
And anyone who ca n’t make the moral judgment that this is so is , in my opinion , a coward - especially since if Palin had admitted that bombing abortion clinics was terrorism , she would have angered a small but significant part of the conservative base .
Do n’t believe me ?
Here are some observations by those moral titans in the anti-abortion crowd about whether bombing clinics is terrorism :
“ No , you pro-abortion baby killing fanatics are the terrorists .
What is a terrorist ?
Someone who murders innocent people .
That is YOU .
You pro-abortion babykillers murder innocent children each and every day . ” — Rev Donald Soitz .
“ We have shed the blood of the innocent in the womb , and we are now reaping it in the streets . ” — Rev. Flip Benham , Operation Rescue
Ever since then , whenever someone brings up a terrorist attack carried out by Islamic fundamentalists , you are expected to practice the Fairness Doctrine and give appropriate lip service to the “ Christian ” attacks on abortion clinics in order to demonstrate that neither side is beyond reproach .
Of course , there is something to be said about the fact that when “ Christians ” attack , they are not supported by a body of religious figures that can be recognized as a legitimate authority , are wholly condemned by the Christian community both far and wide , and are doing so not for religious reasons but because in their minds these abortion clinics are clinics of death where babies are daily being killed and thus their existence means the continued death of another child .
Somehow it ’s hard to generate the same feelings against someone who wants to preserve life as it is to generate against someone who uses planes as torpedoes .
But I digress .
Perhaps the most telling thing about how absurd this argument is are the simple numbers .
A simple glance indicates that , across America , there have only been 168 attacks against abortion clinics since 1982 , the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) Bureau reports .
These attacks come with surprisingly little casualties , and most attacks are rather measured in property damage , rather than human lives lost .
Therefore to run it on average , every year there will be six or seven abortion related attacks across America , with a marginal increase in these numbers in Canada and Australia ( one in Australia ’s history , for example ) .
Moral equivalency between jihadis and Christians is not , cannot be based on comparative body counts but only on the intent of the attacker - the only possible moral context you can place any attack on innocents .
Palin ’s parsing is an ignominious example of a politician who would rather pander to the extreme of her base instead of taking a clear , unambiguous moral stand against political violence .
She should be condemned for this by those on the right who claim moral ascendancy over the rest of us due to their religious beliefs as well as any thinking conservative who cares about the moral standing of our candidates .

It has become conventional wisdom that culling deer is a necessary measure that humans must take in order to protect deer and their habitats from the effects of over - population .
But new research has found that , in fact , areas with more deer actually have higher biodiversity .[ social_buttons ]
The study , performed by researchers with the National Park Service and Ohio State University , seems to support the position of many animal rights activists have held for years — deer should be left alone .
The study found that many insects and other animals preferred to live in the area with deer activity .
While centipedes , pill bugs , millipedes , and beetles were found in similar quantities in both sections , the researchers found almost three times as many salamanders , over five times as many snakes , and 11 percent more snails in the area where deer were allowed .
“ We need to be aware of what ’s happening in these forest ecosystems , ” said Katherine Greenwald , co-author of the study .
“ Culling deer may cascade into affecting plants , salamanders , and other creatures in ways we ca n’t even imagine .
So before we start removing deer we should study what ’s really happening in these areas because there are a whole host of other issues that go along with culling . ”

( CNN ) --
In many states across the country , voting has begun , and in some cases , so have the headaches .
Long lines of early voters have been reported in several states across the country .
With the issues that marred the 2000 election singed into the electorate 's collective memory , the reports of problems are troubling signs for many who are skeptical of whether their votes will count .
Forty - two percent of those surveyed in a recent CNN / Opinion Research Corp.
poll said they were not confident that their votes could be " accurately cast and counted . "
That number is up 15 percentage points from a similar poll conducted four years ago .
The poll was conducted October 17 through October 19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
As of Tuesday , 29 states were accepting early ballots , and election officials are reporting record turnouts .
Voting problems , ranging from computer glitches to long lines , have been reported in a few states .
Read about how the early voting numbers suggest a historic turnout may be in store
Florida has switched to its third ballot system in the past three election cycles , and glitches associated with the transition are causing headaches and long lines , election officials said .
The state went back to using paper ballots this year after trying out touch screens .
" We 're having problems with the poll machines , " a voter in Jacksonville , Florida , told the CNN Voter Hotline .
" They 're not aligned correctly , so you 're not sure about which candidate you 're voting for , so they said they brought in 10 new machines as backup machines , but they 've corrected the issue . "
CNN Voter Hotline
If you have a problem voting or see a problem , call the CNN Voter Hotline at 877- GOCNN08 ( 1-877-462-6608 ) ; CNN will report on some of your calls and our partner , InfoVoter Technologies , can help get you in touch with your election board or find your voting location .
Part of the trouble stems from having to train election workers for the new system , said Buddy Johnson , the elections supervisor for Florida 's Hillsborough County .
" When you 've got brand new equipment and you 're shifting from a touch screen , a digital system , to a more paper - oriented system , as we are this year , it 's a familiarization process , " he said .
Early voters are waiting for hours to cast their ballots as a result of the transition .
In Broward County , 17 of approximately 300 polling places are open for early voting , which ends November 2 .
" Total disaster , " said a voter in Florida 's Broward County .
" You get up there , and you waited three hours , and then the line totally stops .
It 's very frustrating . "
On Monday night , one Broward County polling site closed at 10:30 p.m. , three hours past the scheduled time , reported CNN's Sean Callebs .

High turnout was causing long lines in other states , including North Carolina , Ohio and Nevada , states that are key to the electoral strategies of Barack Obama and John McCain 's campaigns .
If early tallies are indicative of overall voter interest , it raises the question of whether states and counties are prepared for what might be a historic turnout on Election Day .
Voting machine troubles in West Virginia
In West Virginia 's Jackson County , there were some reports that voting machines were accidentally recording the wrong vote .
" I went in there and pushed the Democrat ticket , and it jumped to the Republican ticket for president of the United States , " said Calvin Thomas , an 81 - year - old West Virginian .

Tell us about your early voting experience
Thomas has voted in West Virginia in every election since Harry Truman defeated Thomas Dewey in 1948 .
The same thing happened to his daughter , Micki Clendenin , when she cast her ballot .
In both cases , poll workers at the site had them touch the screen a few more times , and the voting machine changed their ballot to their candidate choice .
" The lady came in , and she was -- very nicely , she just said , 'it 's just been doing that . '
She said , ' just hit it again . '
So we hit it again , and this time it did go to Obama , " Clendenin said .
CNN 's Brian
Todd reported that at least five voters in two West Virginia counties said they encountered the same problem .
State and local officials said that they were isolated cases and that poll workers fixed the problems so the correct vote was cast .
The machines were manufactured by an Omaha , Nebraska - based company , Election System and Software .
The machines will be used in several states this year and were among those that had problems in Ohio in 2004 .
The company said that it has inspected the machines in West Virginia and that no one there has cast an inaccurate vote .
The West Virginia secretary of state 's office said most of the problems occur because the machines are not calibrated properly .
Jeff Waybright , the Jackson County clerk , disagreed and said the problems reported there were probably the result of voter error .
" There are no problems with the machines as recalibrated , " West Virginia Secretary of State Betty Ireland said Wednesday , according to an Associated Press report .
" Touch - screen voting in West Virginia is accurate and secure . "
Ireland directed the state 's county clerks to recalibrate their machines each morning during the early voting period and on Election Day .
In Georgia 's Fulton County , several polling sites apparently lost their connections to the state 's voter database , causing some long wait times for voters .
" We live in a country that can send a guy to the moon , but they can't get the computers up , so it 's very discouraging for me , " voter Quentin Cottrell told WGCL , an Atlanta - based news outlet .

The Georgia secretary of state 's office told CNN that the glitches were intermittent connectivity problems that did not involve voting machines .
Election officials said the problems have been resolved .
Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel said the long lines were the result of robust turnout , generated by a high level of interest in the election .
" I 'll be candid : Voters should expect some wait time , " she said .
" Voters understand that this is a truly historic election . "

7 Cannibalistic Sushi
For many Americans , eating rolls of raw fish can be a tough sell .
But if youâre one of the thousands of open - minded Yanks whoâve fallen under the spell of sushi in recent years , then what better way to totally ruin it for yourself than eating it out of a dead person ?
At Cannibalistic Sushi , an edible body is wheeled out to your family on a gurney , along with as much scotch as you need to disinfect your forks and convince yourself that this was a good idea .
Then , itâs time to dig in !
Whether youâre using chopsticks , a knife and fork , or your bare hands , one thingâs for certain : youâll be feasting on the entrails of a human being .
The artisans at Cannibalistic Sushi have taken pains to ensure that the human body you are ripping into is as lifelike as possible .
The sushi inside is shaped to resemble human organs , a red âblood sauceâ is embedded in the skin layer so as to create realistic bleeding , and your corpse even has a set of papier mach Ã© genitals !
Itâs like your third grade arts and crafts project all over again .
If youâre an experienced cannibal , make sure to specify a male or female corpse when ordering , and show the other diners just how sophisticated your taste in human flesh is .
And although eating at Cannibalistic Sushi may not quell the voices in your head that command you to kill and devour those around you , it will certainly shut them up for a day or two .

Palin , Biden answer questions about Roe v. Wade Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday October 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska gov. evasive as Couric corners her on high court decisions
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden were asked by CBS ' Katie Couric to explain their views on the historic Roe v.
Wade case and other Supreme Court decisions in a preview clip released this evening .
Previous installments of Couric 's interview with Gov. Palin aired Tuesday night .
" Why do you think Roe v. Wade was a good decision ? " Couric asked Sen. Biden .
" Because , " he said , " I think it 's as close to a consensus that can exist in a society as heterogeneous as ours .
" What does it say ?
It says in the first three months , the decision should be left to the woman .
Then , the second three months , Roe v. Wade says ... then the government has a role , along with the woman 's health .
They have a right to have some impact on that .
In the third three months , they say , the weight of the government 's input is on the fetus being carried ... I think the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment offers a right to privacy . "
Biden disagreed with the Supreme Court 's ruling on the Violence Against Woman Act , which allocated new funding to investigating and prosecuting violent crimes against women and opened a legal avenue for a battered woman to sue in civil court , even when no criminal charges were filed .
The latter part of the 1994 law was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2000 .
Asked why she thought Roe v. Wade was a bad decision , Gov. Palin said " I think it should be a state 's issue , not [ the ] federal government mandating yes or no on such an important issue .
" I'm in that sense a federalist , where I believe that states should have more say in the laws of their lands and individual areas .
Now , foundationally , also , though , it 's no secret that I 'm pro-life -- that I believe that a culture of life is very important for this country .
And , personally , that 's what I would like to see further embraced by America . "
" Do you think there 's an inherent right to privacy in the Constitution ? " Couric followed up .
" I do , " Palin said , " and I believe that individual states can best handle what the people within the different constituencies in the fifty states would like to see their will ushered in in an issue like that . [ sic ] "
" What other Supreme Court decisions do you disagree with ? " Couric asked .
" Of course , in the great history of America there have been rulings that there 's never going to be absolute consensus by every American , and ... there are those issues , again , like Roe v.
Wade , where I believe are best held on a state level and addressed there .
So , you know , going through the history of ... America ... there would be others , but --"
" -- Can you think of any ? " asked Couric .
" Well , I would think of any , again , that could best be dealt with on a more local level [ that ] maybe I would take issue with , but ... you know , as a mayor , and then as a governor , and even as a vice president , if I 'm so privileged to serve , [ I ] would n't be in a position of changing those things , but in supporting the law of the land as it reads today . "
On the separation of church and state , Palin said that Thomas Jefferson wanted to make sure " that government did n't mandate a religion on the people , and Thomas Jefferson also said ' Never underestimate the wisdom of the people . '
And the wisdom of the people , I think , in this issue , is that ... people have the right and the ability and the desire to express their own religious views , be it on a very personal level , which is where I choose to express my faith , or in a more public forum , and the wisdom of the people , thankfully , ingrained in the foundation of our country is so extremely important .
And Thomas Jefferson wanted to protect that . "
" The best way to look at it , " Senator Biden said , " is look at every state where that wall is not built .
Look at every country in the world where religion is able to impact on the governance .
[ In ] almost every one of those countries , there 's real turmoil .
Look , the Founders were pretty smart .
They 'd gone through several hundred years of wars -- religious wars .
They were in the midst of religious wars in Europe , and they figured it out : the best way to do this is keep the government out of religion .
They took religion out of government , but they did n't mean religion could n't be ... in the public square . "

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp posted a 90 percent fall in quarterly profit as the global slowdown boosted the yen , battered stocks and stoked price competition , and the company kept its annual profit outlook of a 58 percent decline .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The steep profit slide was expected after the electronics and entertainment conglomerate last week cut its annual operating profit forecast by 57 percent , citing yen strength , slowing digital camera and flat TV demand and tumbling share prices .
The maker of Bravia flat TVs , Cyber - shot digital cameras and PlayStation game machines warned on Wednesday it might miss even the revised - down target by a large margin if the yen continues to trade at current levels against the dollar and euro .
A firmer yen eats into exporters ’ overseas revenues when they are converted into the Japanese currency .
Operating profit totaled 11.05 billion yen ( $ 111.5 million ) in July - September , down from 111.62 billion yen a year earlier as a sharp fall in Tokyo shares forced Sony ’s financial unit to post appraisal losses in its convertible bond holdings .
A one - off profit of 60.7 billion yen from a land sale that Sony posted in the corresponding period a year earlier also made impacted the scale of the decline .
Net profit fell 72 percent to 20.8 billion yen on sales of 2.07 trillion yen , down 0.5 percent .
The electronics and entertainment conglomerate competes with Canon Inc in digital cameras , Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in LCD TVs , and Microsoft Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd in video games .
Sony reaffirmed an operating profit forecast it issued last Thursday of 200 billion yen for the year to March , down from 475.3 billion yen a year earlier .
Earlier this week , Canon cut its annual operating profit forecast by one quarter on a firmer yen and cooling consumer sentiment , while Panasonic Corp stood by its original full - year outlook of 8 percent profit growth .
“ If Panasonic ends up posting a year - on - year profit decline , it would be a fall of 20 or 30 percent tops , ” Daiwa Institute of Research analyst Kazuharu Miura said .
“ On the other hand , Sony ’s earnings cannot help swing violently due to changes in outer factors .
Unless
Sony rectifies this structural problem , it would be experiencing a profit decline of a similar magnitude in five years or so . ”
In announcing its latest outlook on Thursday , Sony said it may close some plants , reduce capital spending and cut jobs .

This " Are you joking ? "
That was one of Sen .
Joe Biden 's responses during an interview with a Florida news station that the Obama campaign said was so " unprofessional " it canceled another planned interview with his wife , Jill Biden .
Barbara
West conducted the interview for WFTV - Channel 9 and asked the Democratic vice presidential candidate if Sen. Barack Obama was a " Marxist , " referenced a recent statement Obama made in Ohio to Joe the lumber about " spreading the wealth around , " and was Biden " embarassed " about Obama 's alleged ties to ACORN .
" You may recognize this famous quote , " West said .
" ' From each according to his abilities to each according to his needs . '
That 's from Karl Marx .
How is Sen. Obama not being a Marxist if he intends to spread the wealth around ? "
Biden did not immediately take the question seriously .
" Are you joking ?
Is this a joke or is that a real question ? "
Biden said .
" It 's a ridiculous comparison with all due respect . "
For her final question , West asked Biden what he would say to the people " who are concerned that Barack Obama will want to turn American into a socialist country , much like Sweden ? "
WFTV news director Bob Jordan defended the interview as hard - hitting journalism and rebuked criticisms of West as mere complaints that she did n't ask " softball questions , " The Orlando Sentinel reported .
" When you get a shot to ask these candidates , you want to make the most of it , " Jordan said .
" They usually give you five minutes . "
But the Obama campaign lambasted the station for its " 100 percent false " statements that Obama worked for ACORN and for the " combative " nature of the interview .
Campaign spokeswoman Adrianne Marsh wrote a statement condemning the station for what she called a " disturbing attempt to associate Barack Obama with socialism . "
West said her questions needed to be asked and were important given the short amount of time available .
" I do n't think I was rude or inconsiderate to him , " West said .
" I think I was probing and maybe tough .
I can't believe that in all of his years in politics , and all of his campaigning and such , that he has n't run into some tough questions before . "
ABC 's Jake Tapper listed West 's questions here .

WASHINGTON , Oct 12 ( Reuters ) - Billionaire investor George Soros predicted on Sunday that the financial crisis would mean the end of a U.S. - led market system that has dominated the global economy with debt and deregulation since the 1980s .
“ Globalization , America as the center of the globalized financial markets , was sucking up the savings of the world , ” Soros said in a CNN interview .
“ This is now over .
The game is out .
It does mean a very serious adjustment for America , ” added Soros , a staunch backer of the Democratic Party .
As world leaders rushed to help banks weather the crisis that has sent stocks into steep decline , Soros blamed the turmoil on the faith in market forces that began under President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher a generation ago .
The notion that markets are self - correcting led to a massive expansion of debt financing that culminated in the sub - prime mortgages that epitomized the easy - money mentality at the root of the disaster , he said .
“ This belief became the dominant creed .
And this , then , led to the globalization of markets , the deregulation of markets and the increased use of leverage and all the financial engineering , ” Soros said .
“ This whole enormous construct is built on false conceptions , ” he added .
“ You can go a very long way .
But in the end , reality rears its ugly head and that ’s what happened now . ”
Jeffrey Sachs , special adviser to U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and director of the Earth Institute at New York ’s Columbia University , appeared to agree with Soros .
“ The age of Reaganism is over , ” Sachs said in a separate CNN interview .
“ The no-regulation , low - taxes ( philosophy ) has broken the back of our economy .
We now have to get serious about reconstructing normal government that pays its way and a normal financial sector that ’s properly regulated . ”
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s embrace of the same “ market fundamentalist ideology ” has made the Bush administration slow to respond to the crisis , said Soros , who blamed Paulson for not saving the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy .
“ That ’s what actually kind of unleashed the current phase of meltdown , ” he said .
Soros said U.S. authorities could effectively address the crisis by recapitalizing banks , first with private money , and restructuring home loans to minimize foreclosures .

Researchers from McGill University , the California Institute of Technology , the Curie Institute in Paris , Princeton University and other institutions , have unearthed crystalline magnetic fossils of a previously unknown species of microorganism that lived at the boundary of the Paleocene and Eocene epochs , some 55 million years ago .
The research might help scientists understand more thoroughly the potential effects of significant changes in the Earth 's climate .
Though they are only some four microns long , these newly discovered , spear - shaped magnetite crystals ( magnetofossils ) – unearthed at a dig in New Jersey – are up to eight times larger than previously known magnetofossils .
Magnetofossils are remnants of magnetite crystals produced by a type of bacteria called magnetotactic bacteria that are capable of orienting themselves along the direction of the Earth 's magnetic field .
The new fossils are " unlike any magnetite crystal ever described , " the study 's first author Dirk Schumann – a graduate student at McGill 's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences – told Nature News .
" Previous reports suggested that the source of the magnetic signature in the boundary layer was a type of magnetite that was formed by the impact of a comet , " said lead researcher and corresponding author Dr. Hojatollah Vali .
" In our previous paper we proved that the magnetic signature comes from biogenic material .
" This is an entirely new class of organism that no one has reported before , " explained Vali , a professor jointly appointed in McGill 's Departments of Anatomy and Cell Biology and Earth and Planetary Sciences .
" When my colleagues and I first discovered magnetofossils in deep - sea sediments in the mid-1980s , we knew already that magnetotactic bacteria produced magnetite and then we looked for the magnetofossils .
In our new study , we discovered the magnetofossils first without knowing the organism . "
This species of microorganism , explained Vali , lived during a period of abrupt global warming known as the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) , when worldwide temperatures rose by 5° to 6° C over a period of 20,000 years .
" What 's very interesting is that we know the very specific time frame when these organisms existed , " he said .
" If you go below it , we do n't find them , and if you go above it , we do n't find them .
Five degrees warmer may not seem like much , but there was much more iron available due to increased weathering .
The additional iron is required for the microorganism to produce the giant magnetofossils .
It is clear that a similar abrupt global warming climatic event could have a severe impact upon our biosphere . "

Though much of my time over the past couple of weeks has been devoted to the behind - the - scenes work of bringing The Inspired Economist into the Green Options Media blog network , I ’ve also made sure to follow the discussion regarding Wal - Mart ’s comments to the FTC regarding carbon offsets and renewable energy credits .
In a post titled “ Wal - Mart Lobbies Against Carbon Offset Guidelines , ” Tony Calero at Wal - Mart Watch got this discussion started by pointing to the company ’s comments filed in response to an FTC request :
Herein lays the scandal : Despite the company ’s “ green ” initiatives , Wal - Mart is actively lobbying against the clarification of offset guidelines .
The company ’s hypocritical stance on the issue came to light last week in a hearing of the Federal Trade Commission .
The FTC is attempting to modernize the “ Green Guides , ” guidelines issued for corporations defining acceptable marketing claims regarding environmental products and initiatives .
In response to the FTC ’s solicitation of retailer comment to guide the process , Wal - Mart ’s Director of Energy Regulation , Angela Beehler , expressed Wal - Mart ’s firm opposition towards the clarified scope and definition of carbon offsets …
As you might imagine , other media outlets picked up on this pretty quickly : Grist , for instance , noted that Consumers Union and other groups have “ been advocating for clear , specific definitions to avoid misleading green claims , ” and that “ the FTC ’s definition of carbon offsets could most affect the retailer ’s ultra-ambitious goal to someday run on 100 percent renewable energy — a huge amount of which would likely have to come from offsets or renewable - energy certificates . ”
US News and World Report‘s “ Fresh Greens ” blog asked “ Is Wal - Mart being hypocritical , or are its green efforts in good faith ? ” Eoin O’Carroll of the Christian Science Monitor ‘s “ Bright Green Blog ” not only expressed a reaction similar to my own ( essentially head - scratching ) , but also took a step further than the rest of us : he gave Wal - Mart a call .
Much of the response he received followed the typical MO of a corporate communications department : the company restated its broad sustainability goals , and offered some more specific ones related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency .
It addressed offsets and renewable energy credits in the last paragraph :
In order to have the best collaborative decision in the formal definition of what constitutes a Renewable Energy Certificate ( REC ) or an offset , there are several governmental entities and highly technical experts with vast environmental expertise that could and should be included in these important regulations , to enable the flexibility of new innovation and technology that is occurring daily across the world .
This statement seems to run counter to Wal - Mart Watch ’s claim that the company is “ lobbying against the clarification of offset guidelines ” ; rather , it seems that they ’re questioning whether the FTC is the proper body to set such definitions .
Granted , this statement was issued after the Wal - Mart Watch post , and could be interpreted as a method for drawing out the process .
But . one would also have to concede that the FTC ’s own language on interpretation and substantiation of environmental marketing claims parallels Wal - Mart ’s statement :
… any party making an express or implied claim that presents an objective assertion about the environmental attribute of a product , package or service must , at the time the claim is made , possess and rely upon a reasonable basis substantiating the claim .
A reasonable basis consists of competent and reliable evidence .
In the context of environmental marketing claims , such substantiation will often require competent and reliable scientific evidence , defined as tests , analyses , research , studies or other evidence based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area , conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so , using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results .
In other words , in determining whether a marketing claim is misleading or not , the FTC expects to see scientific evidence .
From my reading , the Green Guides do n’t establish definitions ; rather , they set standards for determining whether advertising and marketing claims adhere to definitions created by those qualified to do so .
It seems to me that the company is n’t arguing for casual standards , but is noting that , as of now , strict definitions for carbon credits and renewable energy credits do n’t exist , and it ’s not the FTC ’s job to pick one .
Of course , I ca n’t say definitively that Wal - Mart ’s innocent of trying to undermine the establishment of commonly - accepted definitions for these instruments ; I do n’t think that their comments to the FTC in this instance establish anything beyond an argument for standard practice , though .
If the company is purchasing third - party certified offsets and RECs , that ’s the best any of us can do right now .
I do think a “ clarified scope and definition of carbon offsets ” and RECs is critical to consumer understanding and acceptance of them , and support those calling for such benchmarks .
But I also think referring to Wal - Mart ’s actions as a “ scandal ” overstates the case .
Let me know if I ’m wrong …

The accident occurred near Klagenfurt , capital of the province of Carinthia where 58 - year - old Haider was governor -- around 2 am ( 0000 GMT ) , police official Meinhard Schiller told German news agency dpa .
Haider was driving by himself when his car veered off the road after passing another vehicle .
It then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times .
The politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to Thomas Koperna , medical chief of the Klagenfurt hospital .
His left arm was almost severed , he said .
Police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
Austrian police inspect the wreckage of Haider 's car
' The end of the world '
Haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far - right Alliance for the Future of Austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions .
" For us , this is like the end of the world , " Alliance spokesman and deputy leader Stefan Petzner was quoted as saying by the Austrian press agency APA .
Haider " was a politician who moved and changed Austria , " Petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion .
Austrian President Heinz Fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of Haider .
But he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying Haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism .
Notorious for Nazi- friendly comments
Haider turned Austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments .
Haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the Third Reich under Hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
Nazi Germany had enslaved Jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
Haider was forced to sep down as governor of Carinthia after that comment .
He was reelected as governor in 1999 .
Conservative leader Josef Proell said Haider had brought a new style to Austrian politics that had been " very successful . "
In parliamentary elections in late September , the populist leader 's Alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 .
Haider 's party split in 2005 from the Freedom Party , which gained prominence under Haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s .
In 2000 , Haider led the Freedom Party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative People 's Party .
When the Alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the Freedom Party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 .
The 2000 centre - right coalition , in which Haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from European Union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against Austria .
Haider responsible for " incredible changes "
Haider with his supporters in September after his Alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote
Freedom Party leader Heinz - Christian Strache , Haider 's right - wing political rival , said Saturday that Haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in Austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
Filip Dewinter , a leader of Belgium 's far - right , anti-foreigner Flemish party Vlaams Belang , praised Haider on Saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right - nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
In his last interview published by the regional Kleine Zeitung on Saturday , Haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country .
" We changed a lot in Carinthia and we will go on doing so in Austria .
I do n't have to become chancellor to do that . "

Object oriented languages like C# and Java use method dispatching techniques to select a concrete method to invoke when given a polymorphic type .
By far the most common technique is the virtual method table , or vtable for short .
Long ago I had updated the above Wikipedia page with information regarding alternative dispatch techniques .
Research published a few years back indicated that dispatching through a vtable incurred astonishing overheads , as high as 50 % of total execution time .
Alternative dispatch techniques based on runtime tests , such as a linear sequence of if statements checking for the various concrete class types , or a sequence of nested if statements forming a binary search , were often more efficient on a variety of hardware .
Vtables are rather flexible however , and the composition of a number of vtables can encode a variety of advanced dispatching behaviour .
The .NET CLR utilizes vtables , and I 've sketched out rough encodings of first - class functions , algebraic data types and pattern matching , higher - ranked polymorphism , and even a form of first - class messages , all by encoding them as virtual method dispatches .
Unfortunately , research indicated that vtable dispatch is quite expensive , and many of these idioms require at least one and often two virtual dispatches .
Runtime tests and casts might be usable here instead , but a call site compiled for a fixed hierarchy of classes cannot be extended as easily as vtable - based dispatching .
The only exception is a JIT using a technique called " polymorphic inline caches " , which neither the CLR nor JVM utilize .
So I set about to measure the dispatch overhead on the CLR .
Here 's the source for my test , which consists of 3 classes in a hierarchy , each of which provide a visitor for double - dispatching , and a single method for the single virtual dispatch test .
The driver code performs the runtime tests and casts at the dispatch site for the last case .
The numbers are total CPU ticks for the entire test , so lower numbers are better .
It 's a purely CPU - bound test , and I ran it on a Core 2 Duo 2.13GHz .
I used .NET 's high resolution timer , and I threw away the highest and lowest numbers :
As you can see , runtime tests and casts are surprisingly efficient , beating out even single dispatch .
Any functional language targeting the CLR will definitely want to use runtime tests to implement pattern matching .
I might try a deeper hierarchy at some point , but research has shown that up to 95 % of algebraic types have 3 cases or less Unfortunately , when the complete set of concrete types is not known , a vtable dispatch is unavoidable , unless one resorts to runtime code generation to recompile the dispatch site .
This is essentially a polymorphic inline cache , and it requires more sophisticated runtime infrastructure than the CLR natively supports , though it is possible if the language abstracts program execution away from how the CLR natively works .
So in summary , vtables are nice and simple , but rather inefficient on current hardware .

What we ’ve seen in the last week is the state at work — and by the state , I do not mean a particular set of leaders .
If we watch carefully , we can gain insight into what the state is and why our fundamental problem extends far above and below the political party system .
The moment is complicated by the upcoming election , so some people are distracted by the circus of McCain vs. Obama and all the characters associated with that silly little battle .
What they are looking at is really the veneer .
It is a covering designed to prevent you from seeing what the state is and why it matters .
The party system and the elections lead us to believe that we live under conditions that Martin Van Creveld calls the personal state .
( I ’m relying here on his important book The Rise and Decline of the State . )
This is the ancient form of the state under which all the resources the state owns are the personal property of the king or ruler .
The ruler is the state .
If he dies , the state dies with him .
It is very much in the interest of democracy to perpetuate this idea that we are living in a personal state .
This way all credit for the well - being of the nation falls to one person or persons .
They are elected .
If things go badly , people are encouraged to blame these elected officials and vote them out of office .
New people are given a new chance to do better .
But the truth is that the personal state is long gone from history in the developed world .
In the 17th century we begin to see the emergence of the impersonal state .
Under this approach , the ruler does not use his own resources .
He is a manager .
If he dies , nothing changes .
The state itself takes on a permanent form .
It is not elected .
It is hired and lives on regardless of the changes at the top .
The U.S. has never hosted a personal state .
The president was always to be the manager and overseer of a tiny state that ruled with the permission of the people and the lower orders of government : the people and government are one , and this would serve as a check on power .
Of course this was a mistake , a reflection of the naïveté of the classical liberal position .
In time , the U.S. took on all the features of an impersonal nation state .
It developed a permanent bureaucracy , especially after the tragic end of the “ spoils system . ”
It developed a money machine and monopolized and created its own currency .
It began to host its own unelected military that was a “ professional ” fighting force and not a citizen militia .
It became home to a million hangers - on who made the state their careers and their source of economic security .
Today , the state embodies all the worst features of the unaccountable , impersonal leviathan that had been the goal of every bad - guy political dreamer in world history .
We can see this in operation during the financial meltdown .
The people making the decisions and conducting policy were not elected by anyone .
They report to no one .
They are the Secretary of the Treasury and the head of the Fed , and each represents certain private sector interests among the financial elite .
They conduct their policies based on their private assessment of what is good for those they represent , and they do it in cooperation with the permanently entrenched bureaucracy and financial managers who rule the country .
Only after the plans were in place and announced did the impersonal state approach the personal part of the state for codification and confirmation , which the personal state was glad to grant with conditions .
We can also see this at work in the political parties .
McCain and Obama were quick to endorse the entire bailout on grounds that it is a national emergency , so , of course , they must set aside their partisan differences .
They always set aside their partisan differences !
This is the way the impersonal state works .
It is not the people we elect who are in charge .
They are only the human face on the machine .
In fact , if they do n’t know this before the election , they quickly discover it after the election .
They find themselves on a conveyor belt of tasks and photo - ops and duties .
These consume them completely .
They are in awe of the operation of the state and feel immediately powerless to do anything about it .
The same goes for those who the new president hires to run his cabinet departments .
So far as the permanent bureaucracy is concerned , they do n’t even need to know the name of the new secretary , except to make up silly jingles and use his or her name in jokes .
The new hires might start silly new programs or make perfunctory changes , but the permanent class that runs the department knows that it only needs — if it disagrees — to wait out their tenure until things get back to normal .
They know that they are the gears of the engine and that the supposed driver is just the temporary frontman .
In this sense , who wins or who does n’t win the election does n’t matter nearly as much as we are led to believe .
It ’s true that Bush started a war when he did n’t have to .
Someone else might have done better .
It is also true that Obama could fire up a range of new regulations and programs and that McCain could start ever more wars .
It is also true that even without a sitting president and without a Congress , the state would function pretty much as it does today .
That ’s a frightening but true statement .
And yet there is no reason to despair .
In some ways , impersonal states are just as vulnerable as personal ones , sometimes even more so since they rule without ideological conviction .
The state always and everywhere constitutes a tiny minority of the population , Murray Rothbard argues .
It is outnumbered by the people many times over .
For this reason , it must rely on a false consciousness to sustain its rule .
This is why Mises writes that : “ In the long run even the most despotic governments with all their brutality and cruelty are no match for ideas .
Eventually the ideology that has won the support of the majority will prevail and cut the ground from under the tyrant ’s feet .
Then the oppressed many will rise in rebellion and overthrow their masters . ”
Van Creveld himself says that the state can ultimately be done in by both ideological and technological forces that race past the state and its ossified ways .
The impersonal state relies most strongly on a changeless setting in which to manage its affairs .
We live in times of incredible change .
And state crises like the Wall Street meltdown can open up cracks in the official climate of opinion .
There is another point we learn from these observations : working within the machinery of a political party is a futile path for serious change .
Real change comes from working in the world of enterprise and ideas .

The police recovered four grams of hashish from his bag .
Both the accused and his wife were then referred to the Bur Dubai Police Station .

A few weeks ago I did a post about McCain ’s “ frequent liar program ” that gives out prizes to people who spam political blogs .
When his program started , I suffered a dramatic ( 15 x ) drop in new readers coming to my blog from news aggregators like Digg and Reddit , but yesterday I noticed an ironic twist to this .
After weeks of my posts getting downvoted in Reddit , one of my posts suddenly started getting lots of new traffic !
I could n’t figure out how this could have slipped by the McCain ditto - heads .
The post was titled “ I just do n’t know about this Obama fellow “ , started with a funny comic from Tom Tomorrow , and finished with a analysis of how lack of experience does n’t predict the greatness of a president .
In other words , all of McCain ’s attacks on Obama for being “ inexperienced ” do n’t really mean much .
But when I read the comments on Reddit , I just had to laugh .
Several commenters thought that this was an anti-Obama article .
For example ,
Wow , A popular cartoon on Reddit which compares Obama to George W. Bush unfavorably .
Given the overtly pro-Obama sentiment of reddit I do n’t many of the people upvoting this really thought through the implications of the cartoon .
Or
This comic seems to think that Barack Obama is capable of doing to this country what George Bush did .
My guess is that people looking to down - vote anti-McCain articles saw an article with the title “ I just do n’t know about this Obama fellow ” and left it alone ( or maybe even voted it up — would n’t that be a hoot ? ! )
Today , the same thing seems to be happening again .
A comic ( not submitted by me , and included below ) has been in the top five stories on Reddit all morning .
Its title is “ What ’s Wrong with Obama ? ” but it is actually making fun of people who believe the negative things about Obama that are being circulated .
If you read the comments on Reddit ( many of which are racist and stupid ) you realize that these people just do n’t get it .
You could n’t ask for anything more ironic .
It is funny when people who are all pissed off end up pissing on themselves .

Advertisement Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe has signed a historic power - sharing deal with his long - time rival , opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
The two smiled and shook hands at the ceremony in the capital , Harare , which was attended by African dignitaries .
Mr Tsvangirai said the agreement provided the best hope for Zimbabwe and called on President Mugabe to work together to implement the deal .
Mr Mugabe said he was committed to national unity and would do " his best " .

Zimbabwe deal : Key points Mr Mugabe , Mr Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara - leader of a breakaway faction of Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) - signed the agreement in front of some 3,000 invited guests in Harare 's International Conference Centre .
The signatories were introduced in the terms used in the agreement - Mr Mugabe as president and Mr Tsvangirai as prime minister .
To rapturous applause , the leaders shook hands after exchanging signed copies .
Mr Mugabe accused the former colonial power - the UK - of meddling in his country 's affairs by calling for a " regime change " and by imposing sanctions .
I 've signed this agreement because I believe it represents the best opportunity for us to build a peaceful and prosperous democratic Zimbabwe
Morgan Tsvangirai
Leaders proclaim new era Speech highlights
The deal calls on the UK to pay compensation to the white farmers who have lost their land under President Mugabe 's controversial land reform process .
But he received loud jeers when he said opposition parties in Zimbabwe and other African nations used any means , " including violence " , in order to achieve power .
Diagram of Zimbabwe 's power - sharing deal
He said there were " lots of things " in the deal that neither leader liked but that they would work together to " find our way " .
" As long as salient principles are recognised , there will be room for more agreement , " Mr Mugabe said .
In his speech , Mr Tsvangirai said the agreement was a " product of painful compromises " and that it did not provide " an instant cure " to the fortunes of Zimbabwe .
" I 've signed this agreement because I believe it represents the best opportunity for us to build a peaceful and prosperous democratic Zimbabwe , " he said .
DEAL'S KEY POINTS Robert Mugabe : President Chairs cabinet Chairs National Security Council ( ministers + security chiefs ) Zanu - PF has 15 ministers Morgan Tsvangirai : Prime minister Chairs council of ministers
Runs the country day - to - day Member of National Security Council MDC has 16 ministers - 3 from smaller faction Other agreements :
Both men needed to dissolve parliament End violence , abusive language Free political activity Press freedom Carry out land audit , UK urged to compensate white farmers Demand end to international sanctions , calls for regime change State bodies must be non-partisan
Zimbabwe deal : World quotes Zimbabwe voices
His hope for the future was stronger than the grief felt for " the needless suffering of the past years " , he said .
In a gesture of reconciliation , Mr Tsvangirai quoted a speech on reconciliation made by Mr Mugabe in 1980 , saying " it is time to turn our swords into ploughshares " .
The MDC leader said his first priority was to stop Zimbabwe 's devastating food shortages and open the country to aid from the international community and its African neighbours .
" This unity government will let businesses flourish so our people can work and provide for their families with pride , " he said .
The new Deputy Prime Minister , Mr Mutambara , said the compromise agreement was a victory for Zimbabwe .
The ceremony was somewhat marred , however , by clashes between MDC and Zanu - PF supporters outside the conference centre , who threw stones at each other and trampled part of the perimeter fence .
The BBC's George Alagiah in Harare says that the mood among ordinary Zimbabweans is one of relief rather than outright jubilation .
People just want to get on with their lives .
' Highly polarised '
The full details and content of the deal have not been confirmed but it proposes a 50 - 50 division of power , with Mr Mugabe remaining head of state and head of the cabinet .
Morgan Tsvangirai will head a council of ministers , which will be responsible for the day - to - day managing of the country 's affairs .
The MDC and its breakaway faction are expected to have 16 ministers , while President Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party will have 15 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Let 's just say the deal is a step in the right direction GS , Harare The BBC's Adam Mynott says the eyes of Zimbabwe 's neighbours , Africa and the whole world will be fixed now on seeing whether this deal does result in a genuine sharing of executive authority .
Negotiations started at the end of July , with a breakthrough coming late on Thursday after negotiations mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki .
Speaking after the accord was signed on Monday , Mr Mbeki warned that the make - up unity government had yet to be finalised .
" Some discussions have already started about the constitution of this inclusive government , [ but ] they have not yet concluded , " he said .
" I am confident that they will do so as soon as possible . "
While welcoming the deal as a " great day " for both Africa and the world , African Union chairman Jakaya Kikwete also noted that doubts remained over how long it would last .
" Will it hold or will it not ?
That is the question , " he said .
Some MDC members have called the power - sharing deal a climb - down , although others have said it is the best available .
' A new page '
The deal opens the way for international donors to help to revive Zimbabwe 's economy , where inflation is at more than 11,000,000 % .
The International Monetary Fund , which suspended financial and technical assistance in 2006 , said it stood ready for talks with the new government about its policies to stabilise the economy , improve social conditions , and reduce poverty .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said a decision on lifting sanctions on Zimbabwean officials had been postponed until October .
Some MDC supporters are celebrating - others remain wary Mr Solana said the EU needed to study the details of the agreement but that he expected it to open " a new page " for Zimbabwe .
The US government expressed cautious optimism about the deal , but stressed that it was " anxious " to see the full details .
" Our number one priority is that you have a legitimate government in Zimbabwe that represents the will of the people , " said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
The UK Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , said it would want to see the administration make significant progress before it considered lifting sanctions .
Mr Mugabe , in power since independence from Britain in 1980 , won a controversial presidential run-off election in June .
He ran unopposed after Mr Tsvangirai withdrew , claiming the MDC was the target of state - sponsored violence .
In the first round of the presidential election in March , Mr Tsvangirai gained more votes than Mr Mugabe but official results say he did not pass the 50 % threshold for outright victory .

What are these ?
" The giveaway here is the phrase ' a non-cooperative human subject ' .
What we have here are the beginnings of something designed to enable robots to hunt down humans like a pack of dogs .
Once the software is perfected we can reasonably anticipate that they will become autonomous and become armed .
We can also expect such systems to be equipped with human detection and tracking devices including sensors which detect human breath and the radio waves associated with a human heart beat .
These are technologies already developed . "
" This is a clear step towards one of the main goals of the US Army 's Future Combat Systems project , which aims to make a single soldier the nexus for a large scale robot attack .
Independently , ground and aerial robots have been tested together and once the bits are joined , there will be a robot force under command of a single soldier with potentially dire consequences for innocents .
... If you have an autonomous robot then it 's going to make decisions who to kill , when to kill and where to kill them .
The scary thing is that the reason this has to happen is because of mission complexity and also so that when there 's a problem with communications you can send a robot in with no communication and it will decide who to kill . "
Lumen is a project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University .
Lumen is an independent research project studying cease and desist letters concerning online content .
We collect and analyze requests to remove material from the web .
Our goals are to educate the public , to facilitate research about the different kinds of complaints and requests for removal - - both legitimate and questionable -- that are being sent to Internet publishers and service providers , and to provide as much transparency as possible about the “ ecology ” of such notices , in terms of who is sending them and why , and to what effect .
Our database contains millions of notices , some of them with valid legal basis , some of them without , and some on the murky border .
The fact that Lumen has a notice in its database does not mean that Lumen is authenticating the provenance of that notice or making any judgment on the validity of the claims it raises .
Conceived , developed , and founded in 2002 by then - Berkman Klein Center Fellow Wendy Seltzer , the project , then called " Chilling Effects " , was initially focused on requests submitted under the United States ' Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
As the Internet and its usage has evolved , so has Lumen , and the database now includes complaints of all varieties , including trademark , defamation , and privacy , domestic and international , and court orders .
The Lumen database grows by more than 40,000 notices per week , with voluntary submissions provided by companies such as Google , Twitter , YouTube , Wikipedia , Counterfeit Technology , Medium , Stack Exchange , Vimeo , DuckDuckGo , aspects of the University of California system , and Wordpress .
As of the summer of 2019 , the project hosts approximately twelve million notices , referencing close to four billion URLs .
In 2018 , the project website was visited over ten million times by users from virtually every country in the world .
Lumen is supported by a grant from Arcadia , a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin .
Though hard numbers are scarce , estimates are that foreclosures will surpass one million this year .
Losses on home loans are piling up faster than banks can deal with them .
First Federal Bank of California said this week that as of June 30 it owned 380 foreclosed houses .
It managed to sell 329 of them during the third quarter but acquired another 450 .
This sense of rapidly losing ground underlies the urgency behind the Treasury ’s new plan , which is being developed even as various homeowner bailouts that were announced earlier are just getting under way .
A White House spokeswoman , Dana M. Perino , said on Thursday that the plan was not “ imminent ” and that several different proposals were being considered .
“ If we find one that we think strikes the right notes and could meet all of those standards that we want to protect taxpayers , make sure that it ’s also fair and that it would actually have an impact , then we would move forward and we would announce it , ” Ms. Perino said .
The Federal Housing Administration began Hope for Homeowners on Oct. 1 , aimed at making as many as 400,000 mortgages affordable .
Under the program , lenders will refinance loans to 90 percent of a house ’s current value , automatically giving the owner 10 percent equity .
The loans will be insured by the government , which will take a share of any gain when the house is sold .
If a sale occurs in the first year , the government takes it all .
The second year , it takes 90 percent ; and so on down a sliding scale .
After five years , it takes half the gain .
To guard against fraud , an F.H.A. spokesman said , borrowers will have to certify they did not “ intentionally ” default .

The Foo Fighters are mad at John McCain for using their song " My Hero " at his campaign rallies .
A similar thing happened when Heart said they did n't want Sarah Palin to use " Barracuda . "
Legally speaking , the candidates can use whatever song they want at their rallies , but having Dave Grohl and the Wilson sisters mad at you just makes your campaign look desperate .
Fortunately , there 's plenty of songs out there that John and Sarah can use , as well as songs that would be great for Barack and Joe .
Here 's my picks : Barack Obama - AC / DC , " Back in Black . "
Get it ?
It 's called " Back in Black , " and Barack Obama is . . . someone who would fix the economy so it is no longer in the red , but " in the black . "
Also , AC / DC rocks , and it's way better than that will .i.am .
" Yes We Can " song .
John McCain - Blue Oyster Cult , " ( Do n't Fear ) The Reaper . "
John McCain is old .
We all know this .
Yet McCain does n't really bring his age up very much .
Why not embrace it ?
With this song , McCain would be saying , " yes , I 'm old , but I 'm fighting off death because I 'm not afraid .
In fact , I bet death is a little afraid of me . "
A close second choice for McCain would be Hall & Oates ’ " Out of Touch . "
But only because they never recorded a song called " Erratic . "
Sarah Palin - No Doubt , " Do n’t Speak . "
Kind of self - explanatory .
If this song was played whenever Palin was introduced to give a speech , the lyrics might remind her to just keep her damn mouth shut .
Or if Palin wants to use her alleged sex appeal , she could always go with Katy Perry ’s " I Kissed a Girl . "
Not that she actually has ever done this , but something tells me Sarah Palin would n’t be above giving voters the wrong impression if it meant some extra votes .
Joe Biden - Warren Zevon , " Werewolves of London . "
Yes , I know Joe Biden is not a werewolf .
At least as far as I know .
But Joe should n’t use this whole song , just the part near the end when Warren says , " and his hair was perfect . "
Whenever Joe Biden is introduced anywhere , that clip of the song should be playing on a loop .
A terminally ill woman who fears that her husband will be jailed for helping her die painlessly will go to the High Court next month in a landmark challenge to the law on assisted suicide .
Debbie Purdy , 45 , says she wants to end her life with her Cuban - born husband by her side in a Swiss clinic which helps patients die at a time of their own choosing .
But under British law , anyone who assists another person commit suicide – for example , by helping them travel to a suicide clinic – is at risk of criminal prosecution and up to 14 years ' imprisonment .
Ms Purdy , and hundreds of terminally ill people like her , believe the law is depriving her of the comfort and solace of the man she loves at the time when she needs him the most .
If the law can't be changed , then she asks for the right to know how the law is enforced in these kind of cases ; she wishes to die knowing her husband will not be prosecuted .

Ms Purdy first met Omar Puente , 46 , in a Singapore bar in 1995 , just as she was first experiencing the early symptoms of a progressive form of multiple sclerosis .
He was playing violin with a Cuban salsa band and she had been assigned to write a magazine review of the performance .
" I think he was told by the band leader to be nice to me , " she told The Independent yesterday .
" We soon started dating and a few weeks later I returned to England , when the family doctor diagnosed me as suffering from MS .
We have been together ever since .
Omar jokes that he has only ever known the MS Debbie , not the healthy Debbie . "
The High Court judicial review to force the Director of Public Prosecutions to declare his policy on prosecuting assisted suicide cases begins on 2 October .
Ms Purdy will be represented by David Pannick QC , a leading expert in public law and human rights .
It has just emerged that 650 British citizens have now signed up with Dignitas , the Zurich clinic which helps terminally ill patients end their lives in comfort and dignity abroad .
Many British Dignitas members wish to know whether or not their relatives will be liable for prosecution under the Suicide Act 1961 if they accompany them to the clinic or assist in any way with their travel arrangements .
The uncertainty of not knowing what risks her husband faces under British law has caused Ms Purdy great anxiety .
" I can't let him travel with me to Switzerland because that might be construed as assisting me in my death , " she said .
" He says he is prepared to face jail if it means he could do something to stop making my life unbearable . "
As a younger woman , Ms Purdy enjoyed travelling the world working as a dancer , waitress and writer .
" I learnt to ski and waterski and I loved throwing myself out of aeroplanes , " she said .
Today she is confined to a wheelchair and has trouble taking a sip of water : " I 'm much more frightened of choking to death or being in extreme pain than dying early , " she said .

Ms Purdy first knew something was wrong when she went dancing with friends at a Yorkshire nightclub .
" It was like dancing in sneakers with chewing gum on .
My feet were moving very slowly and I did n't know why ...
At first the doctors said that it was depression after the death of my mother . "
By the time Ms Purdy returned to Singapore to join Mr Puente , she had sought a second doctor 's opinion which confirmed her worst fears .
" I rang the Spanish embassy to ask what the Spanish for MS was so that I could telephone Omar and tell him what I had , " she said .
" I did n't know what he would think , how could I ?
But when I arrived at the airport , he was waiting for me . "
Mr Puente asked her to move in with the band and for the next two years she travelled all over Asia with them .
" Whenever anyone booked us , the band always said I was part of the deal . "
But Ms Purdy 's health was rapidly deteriorating and she decided to return home to Bradford .
" I asked Omar if he would give England a try .
He came for a month and got to know a Bradford salsa band .
Although he finds the weather too cold and wet , he likes the people very much .
Omar decided to stay and in 1998 we were married . "
The couple are still together today .
When Mr Puente 's mother died , his wife was there to help him through it .
Now Ms Purdy , the youngest of five siblings , says the time is fast approaching when she will have to choose the way she ends her own life .
In the past six years , nearly 100 British people have chosen to end their lives with Dignitas .
Now , 40 relatives of former Dignitas patients have submitted witness statements to the High Court in support of Ms Purdy 's case .
The charity Dignity in Dying , which campaigns for a law that will permit the assisted death of terminally ill adults at a time of their choosing , is also backing the High Court action .
Its chief executive , Sarah Wootton , says the rate of inquiries from people wishing to follow the Dignitas route has increased over the past year .
In the past fortnight she said she had been contacted by two men , one suffering from advanced leukaemia , who both wanted advice .
She described them both as in the advanced stages of arranging their own deaths .
Although nobody has been prosecuted for providing assistance to a relative who used Dignitas , Ms Purdy believes her husband faces a great risk .
" He is black , foreign and has very little money – that 's not a great thing to be today , " she said .
" After I have gone I do n't want him to fall foul of the law for being the wrong colour , from the wrong country and from the wrong class . "
Assisted suicide
Netherlands
In 2002 the Dutch government became the first to introduce an assisted dying law .
The courts permit about 3,500 cases a year .
All patients must have an incurable condition .
Switzerland
The only country to permit non-Swiss residents to take advantage of its assisted dying code .
The law makes clear that a person can assist another 's suicide providing they act out of the highest sense of morality .
But voluntary euthanasia is still forbidden in Switzerland .
Belgium
The Belgium Act on Euthanasia was passed in May 2002 .
Patients have to be in a " futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated " .
Luxembourg
The latest country to bring in an assisted dying bill , which is expected to come into force this year .
The law was passed by a majority of just four .
Oregon
In 2006 the US Supreme Court upheld a law allowing doctors in Oregon to help terminally ill patients to die .
Justices voted by 6 to 3 to back the law .
At the heart of every operating system is the file system that provides read / write access to data .
Since 2001 , Ext3 has been the mainstay of Linux file systems .
But the winds of change could be blowing toward a better file system in the works .
BTRFS ( pronounced better FS ) is currently under development in an effort led by Oracle engineer Chris Mason .
With the support of Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) , Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) , HP ( NYSE : HPQ ) , IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , BTRFS could become the engine that brings next generation filesystem capabilities to Linux .
" The main goal is to let it { Linux} scale for the storage that will be available , " Chris Mason Director of Linux Kernel Engineering at Oracle told InternetNews.com .
" Scaling is not just about addressing the storage but also means being able to administer and to manage it with a clean interface that lets people see what 's being used and makes it more reliable . "
After all , Mason noted , although hard drives are getting bigger , the error rates on those drives are not going down .
" We need to be able to easily determine when disks have the wrong information on them , " Mason said .
" And we need to be able to do filesystem consistency checking and need to be able to recover from errors in a much more robust fashion then we currently do . "
With the current Ext3 Linux filesystem , scaling to meet the needs of large storage is a challenge for several reasons .
One of them is that Ext3 was never designed for the large data pools that enterprise and even consumer desktop users now have available to them .
Mason noted that on Ext3 , for every 4 k of data there is a piece of metadata pointing to where that 4 k of data is on the drive .
So as files grow larger , the grows the amount of metadata .
It 's not very efficient .
" BTRFS uses something called extents , which just says that from this starting position for this number of blocks , use this part of the disk , " Mason said .
The extents approach is more scalable and efficient than the 4 k block approach of Ext3 .
Extents are also part of the new Ext4 file system , which is part of the upcoming 2.6.28 Linux kernel release .
Though Ext4 adds extents , Mason noted that BTRFS adds a number of other features beyond that .
Among those features are items like snapshotting , online file consistency checks and the ability to perform fast incremental backups .
" Btrfs is a file system that we think has a lot of potential to be a key next generation file system for Linux , " Ric Wheeler , file system kernel for Red Hat , told InternetNews.com .
Wheeler noted that Red Hat engineers are actively contributing to its development and have made substantial contributions to the project .
Intel is also active in BTRFS .
Imad Sousou , the Director of Intel 's Open Source Technology Center told InternetNews.com that Intel likes and contributes to Btrfs .
Intel 's view is that it has the right technology and architectural decisions to evolve Linux file systems to support the increased demands in areas such as performance and fault tolerance .
HP is also a key backer of the effort and is putting some of its UNIX heritage in play to help out .
" BTRFS is very interesting to HP because its goal is to provide a core set of features that are very similar to what we have with Tru64 AdvFS and a set of features that go beyond that , " said Bdale Garbee , chief technologist for HP 's open source and Linux organization .
In June of this year , HP open sourced its Tru64 AdvFS file system , which has its roots in Digital Equipment Corporation 's Digital Unix .
Oracle 's Mason noted that he was a Tru64 user years ago and that the open sourcing of AdvFS by HP has been a major benefit to the BTRFS effort .
Mason is now pushing to have a testable version of BTRFS available to Linux user before the end of 2008 .
He 's currently targeting to have a version of BTRFS available as part of the 2.6.29 Linux kernel as well .
" This week I pushed out the last huge format change and there are still a few small ones to come , " Mason said .
" Once all that is done it will make it much easier to get out to a broad number of testers . "
At this point , Mason 's biggest challenge in getting BTRFS together is keeping it stable .
" There is a big volume of changes coming in because we have a lot of contributors , " Mason said .
" It 's mostly just a software engineering effort to make sure we make it easy to test and do n't introduce regressions . "
This week , Valve 's Steam Cloud will become the latest addition to the company 's ever - growing list of features comprising its Steam digitial distribution service .
First announced in May , the Steam Cloud stores save games and configuration options for supported games on Valve 's own servers rather than on users ' hard drives , allowing those files to be accessed from any PC .
Steam already allows users to install games any number of times on any PC by signing into the service , but user - specific game data is not saved .
The release corresponds with thedemo launching this week , and Valve will also equip its own back catalogue with Steam Cloud support .
Any developer whose game is distributed via Steam has the option of using Steam Cloud , although major third - party publishers have traditionally shied away from implementing Steam features other than digital distribution itself .
Last week , however , Sega announced that The Creative Assembly 's upcomingwill take advantage of the feature set .
Said Valve president Gabe Newell , " Steam Cloud is a natural extension of the portability Steam affords gamers and developers , and we intend to expand its feature set as it is used inand other games coming to Steam . "

That was fantastic Brad !
You really stood up for the people .
I doubt Fox News will want you on their show anymore because your honesty and integrity might adversely affect their ratings , but maybe they will !

There 's also Arno , who hired YPM and JSM ( John Sydney McCain ? ) .
Appears to be downtown LA on skid row registering Republicans maybe ?
Snip : The Skid Row campaigns have been linked to a national petition management firm called JSM Inc. , which has handled hotly contested petition campaigns and been accused of fraud in at least six states since 2004 .
The firm and its staff have never been convicted of wrongdoing .
Jennifer Breslin , the president of JSM Inc. , currently based in Fullerton , was not available for comment , according to employees .
A local coordinator who works for JSM denied knowing anything about the Skid Row locations or the exchange of food .
However , voter registration cards distributed at one of the Skid Row booths were tracked to JSM using serial numbers that are printed on each card .
A spokeswoman for the California Secretary of State said they came from an order of 5,000 registration cards placed by Breslin .

BTW that was in 2007 , so if you keep registering republicans steadily even in the off years , by petition , you could probably drum up enough registered republican non-voters to hack into the state servers and cast a vote for them on election day without drawing too much attention could n't you ?
Hypothetically speaking of course I 'm turning blue in the face , man

You spanked them with knowledge of elections and voting terminology ( too bad the clarification of the terms was n't forced , as John Fund in the end reverted back to the same propaganda ) , and breaking news ( GOP vote registration contractor busted ) , but they spanked you by focusing on the housing market and facing you off with an old school hard core wall street guy .
The Market - Ticker guy Karl Denninger will tear John Fund up if given a chance .

I thought you did a great job , Brad .
My sense is that , the next time Fox has you on , they 'll be sure to get someone opposite you who 's over - the - edge rude and disruptive , because not only are they going to want to prevent you from making substantive statements that they can't refute , they 're going to want to discredit you as a journalist and as a person .
Because that 's what they do !
This was their test - run of you .
Now that they know what they 're dealing with , they 'll work on their signature smear job .
I have to say this : I am coordinating and facilitating six California phone banks into swing states every week during which we dial 3,000 + voters .
The worst thing we are up against are individuals who spout Fox and right - wing radio talking points .
They are in a class of stupidity and ignorance unsurpassed by even uneducated and illiterate peoples in developing nations .
At least in areas of the world where people are uneducated and illiterate , there are plenty whose minds are not closed .
If you seek further feedback on your Fox TV spot , I 'd be happy to provide that to you off - line .
I have total confidence in your ability to self - critique , however .

Brad ,
Did they tell you that the discussion would be about the housing crisis ?
Or were they vague about about their purposes in having you on ?
This is weird to say , but the Fox news host was uncharacteristically not as horrible .
What ' up with that ?
It is like the criminal who 's acting nice .
Very suspicious .
It seemed to be like a weird snow - job of some kind , I 'm not really sure .
It is great to see you get your word in .
You projected well , but the exchange was like one topic juxtaposed over another .
A little strange , but it is amazing that you broadcast such important information that the mainstream media has been dangerously negligent in not reporting .
Just adding my humble thoughts on this .
I say this from the perspective of someone who knows of you in your capacity of someone who promotes election integrity .
Are you also involved in Real Estate ?
I do n't think you 'll be invited to Fox News for segments devoted to election integrity .
Fox News is a far too cowardly and intellectually dishonest fascist propaganda entity for that .
Fox News decision makers are sniveling wimps who'd be scared to have you on a news show about election integrity .
They 're too weak for that .
Bill O'Reilly is scared of you because he lacks huevos .
He 's a bully without backbone .
It wo n't happen , because he'd just fearfully shout you down as is typical of Fox News , and look like the wimp that he is , too scared to hear facts contrary to their cultish beliefs .

Fund either does n't fully understand the factors directly responsible for the meltdown on Wall St. or is purposely trying to deflect attention from the real causes and the real people who prioritized personal greed over the safety of the global economy .
HERE is a FACT CHECK on Fund 's last - second insertion of the Community Reinvestment Act to rebut Brad 's charge that " no one forced anyone to make bad loans " .
For some reason it's not letting me do a hot - link , so copy and paste into your browser : https://bradblog.com/?p=6466 PLEASE DISTRIBUTE
THESE LINKS to combat specious arguments attempting to lay the blame for the meltdown on long - overdue fair lending practices that ended banks ' racist red-lining of low - income communities : Sandra F. Braunstein , Federal Reserve Director , Division of Consumer and Community Affairs
Testimony before the Committee on Financial Services
U.S. House of Representatives
February 13 , 2008 " Neither the CRA nor its implementing regulation gives specific criteria for rating the performance of depository institutions .
Rather , the law indicates that the evaluation process should accommodate an institution 's individual circumstances .
Nor does the law require institutions to make high - risk loans that jeopardize their safety .
To the contrary , the law makes it clear that an institution 's CRA activities should be undertaken in a safe and sound manner . " ( emphasis added ) MORE NEWS YOU CAN USE : h/t Echidne of the Snakes ( click on link for direct sourcing ) 2008 - ComplianceTech , a provider of technology and business intelligence for consumer lending institutions and government agencies , has released an industry report indicating that the majority of subprime - rate loans originated in 2006 were made to non-Hispanic Whites and upper - income borrowers ( conventional , 1st lien , 1 - to - 4 family , owner - occupied , home purchase and refinance ) .
The findings are contrary to the way subprime - rate lending has been portrayed .
Frequent media portrayals and congressional dialogue refer to subprime - rate lending as a minority and low - income issue .
Findings in the report are based on data submitted by lenders under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ) analyzed with the data - mining tool LendingPatterns ( TM ) .

ADD THIS to your arsenal to fight misinformation on the Wall St. meltdown :
Two developments seem to have spurred the easing in US standards .
First , a range of legislative and policy changes had been made to encourage the development of a non-conforming ( Alt - A and subprime ) lending sector , lying outside the model defined by the government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) .
Part of the motivation for this was a desire to ensure that home ownership was accessible to households who had historically been underserved by mortgage lenders ( Gramlich 2007 ) .
In addition , the administration had wanted to reduce the GSEs ' domination of the mortgage market .
Following problems with accounting and governance at both institutions , the GSEs ' capacity to expand lending was capped by new regulatory limits on their activities ( Kiff and Mills 2007 , Blundell - Wignall and Atkinson 2008 ) .
[ emphasis added ]
Facts are such inconvenient things when there are minority populations to smear ....

If you can't respond in an educated way to Fund on his issue then the Fund / FAUX position goes unchallenged in any meaningful way .

Now that you can add " breaking a ( factual ) LIVE FOX NEWS ALERT " to your esteemed resume , it must put you alongside the great odd - makers of all time -- like people who 've been struck by lighting twice , or Hall - of - Famers who have n't been supoened .

I wonder if he , or FOX , had been tipped off to Bowen 's bombshell before the hour they switched the topic of debate to the housing crisis .
Or maybe he knew about THIS , and therefore could n't rightly look you in the eye on voter fraud issues :

It 's so INFURIATING how that woman on Fox was trying to suck you into some kind of blame game .
The reason that Fund did n't want to " go there " is because he KNOWS that the " blame " for the housing crisis rests squarely on the shoulders of the GOP .
I wish you would have said so and pointed out the recent articles that mention the lobbying against regulation and what exactly the Democrats voted against in that scenario ( i.e. , removing government oversight of Fannie and Freddie entirely and giving the regulatory responsibility to an outside independent agency as recommended by the Hagel bill that McCain " endorsed " 16 months later after it had died .
The Democrats voted against it because it would have made the exposure of Fannie and Freddie to subprime mortgage securities fraud even MUCH larger than it already was owing to Bush 's " Ownership " policies ) .
Nonetheless , good job of discussing the vote suppression .
P.S. I hate John Fund .

Carol , as much as I 'd like to see all the Republicans not only removed from office , but never allowed to work , contract , or hold a security clearance ever again .
The blame for the screwed up markets is EQUALLY the democrats and the republican 's fault , and their current fix is not going to restore trust , it 's only delaying and setting things up to make things much worse .
Eventually the markets will correct themselves regardless of what the criminals Ben and Hank do , and if it corrects itself it 's going to be worse than if they put the Genesis Plan in place .
1 . Force all off - balance sheet " assets " back onto the balance sheet , and force the valuation models and identification of individual assets out of Level 3 and into 10Qs and 10 Ks .
Enact this requirement beginning with the 3Q 2008 reporting period which begins next month .
Total taxpayer cost : $ 0.00 2 .
Force all OTC derivatives onto a regulated exchange similar to that used by listed options in the equity markets .
This permanently defuses the derivatives time bomb .
Give market participants 90 days to get this done ; any that are not listed in 90 days are declared void ; let the participants sue each other if they can't prove capital adequacy .
Total taxpayer cost : $ 0.00 3 .
Force leverage by all institutions to no more than 12:1 .
The SEC intentionally dropped broker / dealer leverage limits in 2004 ; prior to that date 12:1 was the limit .
Every firm that has failed had double or more the leverage of that former 12:1 limit .
Enact this with a six month time limit and require 1/6th of the excess taken down monthly .
Total taxpayer cost : $ 0.00
All these bailouts and stimulus plans are treason .

A group of 15 alleged Islamist terrorists arrested in India yesterday included a trio of techies - one a principal engineer at Yahoo !
Indian police alleged that the 15 were linked to recent bombing attacks in Ahmedabad and Surat , The Hindu reports .
The paper described most of the men as criminals linked to a Pakistan - based crime lord .
However , three were what the paper describes as “ model citizens ” , including 31 - year - old Mohammed Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy , who is reportedly a principal software engineer at Yahoo !
India .
Peerbhoy , from Pune , acted as the terror cell ’s in - house spin doctor , and emailed Indian Mujahideen manifestos before and after the recent blasts , the authorities claim , apparently by hacking into unsecured Wi -Fi connections .
His colleagues in the alleged terror cell included two other computer science grads , 24 - year - old Mubin Kadar Shaikh ( alias Salman ) and 25 - year - old Mohamed Atique Mohamed Iqbal ( alias Musab ) , who was described by The Hindu as an “ active member of an Indian Mujahideen module ” .
The Hindu reported that Peerbhoy had become radicalised during a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2004 and before long was hanging out in radical Islamist internet chat rooms .
Peerbhoy ’s family rejected the government ’s charges , telling The Times of India that , " He was earning a handsome salary and we know that he will not do anything wrong … Mohammed is a highly qualified person and we are a very respectable family " .
The arrests are being presented as a major coup in India , with The Times of India carrying plenty of detail of the interrogation of what it is already describing as “ the techie terrorist ” .
Yahoo ! was not available for comment , though The Hindu quoted the company saying it would give every assistance to the authorities . ®
Last year , a graduate student , Virgil Griffith , created a clever Web site , Wiki - Scanner , that made it easy to detect where anonymous editors of Wikipedia were accessing the site .
In the process , companies , government agencies and , yes , politicians were caught in the act of spiffing up their Wikipedia entries , even as many assumed that anonymity would make them safe .
( Wikipedia , incredibly and mercilessly , keeps a record of every change made to every article . )
YoungTrigg made the last edit Friday morning , hours before the news of the Palin selection became official .
But in the wee hours the day before , when no one was really paying attention , YoungTrigg did contact other Wikipedians , who were initially impressed by the rapid improvements to the article .

YoungTrigg was given a virtual unit of praise , the Barnstar , for the effort .
When another Wikipedia contributor asked gently if YoungTrigg could include page numbers to his footnotes from “ Sarah , ” YoungTrigg wrote back excitedly : “ Thank you !
I ’m afraid I did n’t use the page numbers when I did the edits , so I do n’t have them now .
The book has a pretty good index , though , and I can look something up if anything I added was controversial .
I apologize if I misunderstood the format . ”
Also , YoungTrigg reached out to an anonymous editor who had changed the Palin article on Thursday night , without any evidence , to say that she was Mr. McCain ’s choice .
In a public note to the anonymous editor , YoungTrigg wrote : “ Where did you hear that Palin was the VP nominee ?
I ca n’t find anything online . ”
Whether this pokes a hole in the idea that YoungTrigg had inside information , or rather confirms that the user had an unusually acute interest in whether the news had leaked out , is hard to tell .
Or maybe it was dumb luck .
When news outlets like National Public Radio and Washingtonpost.com reported on the editing on Friday , they classified it as another example of Wikipedia ’s mysterious ability to predict about - to - break news , if we only knew to look there .
When the liberal Web site Daily Kos , enmeshed in the rough - and - tumble of the presidential election , picked up on the news in a highly read post , commenters were quick to raise the specter of dirty tricks .
From the moment the branded helicopter landed on the Nursery End at Lord 's that warm June day the project was doomed to be a fiasco .
Out stepped the Texan real estate multibillionaire Sir Allen Stanford , and up strolled officials of the England and Wales Cricket Board , all but prostrating themselves before him .
The two parties were there to announce an extremely oddball cricket match between England and the so - called Stanford Super Stars – effectively the West Indians .
Prize money for the game would be $ 20 m ( £ 12 m ) , of which each winning team member would receive $ 1 m .
It was unheard of .
They brought along the sum in cash to emphasise what was at stake .
This was the home of cricket , a place that represents all that is decent and noble about the game of cricket , and here was an exhibition of naked commercialism .
The fit was starkly uncomfortable .
It has led to tears and recriminations .
The proceedings this week have been enveloped in tawdriness , and the Big Match , the Twenty20 for $ 20 m , as it has become known , has yet to take place .
It should still be played on Saturday night but wherever the money goes it will be beset by controversy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Calls have been made for the resignations of the England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke and chief executive David Collier – so far steadfastly ignored .
Put plainly , the feeling is that they have been responsible for getting England into this mess – which has reflected well on nobody involved .
Sean Morris , the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers '
Association , stopped short of that yesterday , but he made it clear the players feel utterly let down .
" They 're pretty uncomfortable with a number of things , " he said .
" There is a feeling that it 's turning out to be a bit of a garden party , which should n't really be the case with England cricket .
" The players are very concerned about how they will be perceived .
The reality is that they 're here working because their employers have decided that is where they will come to work .
You have to behave a certain way as an England cricketer , upholding the heritage and tradition of Team England , and as far as the players are concerned they feel that people who should be protecting them have left them exposed to potential criticism and ridicule . "
This was strong stuff and the players , while publicly diplomatic , feel used .
Only the prospect of the money keeps them here .
England simply want to leave Antigua as quickly as possible , albeit preferably with the loot .
" Just let 's get the hell out of here , " is how it is being put .
They fly straight to India , and never have the sub- continental destinations of Guwahati and Kanpur been more alluring .
Whatever happens on Saturday cannot erase the enduring shoddiness of what has already gone before .
The series of warm - up matches on the eponymous Stanford Cricket Ground have caused grave concern .
The cricket has been of poor quality and quite unlike what Twenty20 was meant to be : high scoring and breezy .
The pitch has not been of international standard and the lights are so low as to make catching a lottery .
Above all , however , there has been the presence of the man bankrolling the event .
Sir Allen has , it is fair to say , loomed large .
The Stanford Super Series has been just that – about the man himself .
According to Forbes Magazine , he is worth $ 2.2bn , making him the world 's 239th richest man .
The 6ft 4in Texan began his career in Houston in the early 1980s , making a fortune in real estate before expanding the company his grandfather had founded into the Stanford Financial Group , a global wealth management firm worth $ 50 bn .
Clients include Oprah Winfrey .
The 58 - year - old divorcee and father of six took Antiguan citizenship and was knighted for services to the island 's economy – he is the island 's biggest private employer , owning its principal newspaper , national bank , its airline and several hotels .
He also bankrolled the hospital .
His companies have , however , attracted the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission over deposits in Antigua .
He gives away millions of dollars to charity and is also a major sponsor in polo , sailing and golf .
He built the Stanford Cricket Ground for his staff after watching them play on waste ground .
He is also said to have once hired two historians to research a 180 - page dossier proving he is distantly related to Leland Stanford , founder of Stanford University .
So it was always known that he would be an effervescent figure , but on Sunday night , during England 's opening match against Middlesex – who are here as the domestic T20 champions – he was seen flirting with wives and girlfriends of England 's players .
He sat one – the pregnant wife of wicketkeeper Matthew Prior – on his knee , bouncing her around , and put his arms round others .
This uncomfortable image was shown on the big screens overlooking the ground .
England 's players were seething but this was the man who could make them millionaires , as their partners ( who according to one , did not know where to put themselves ) , realised only too well .
Sir Allen was informed of the concerns and apologised to Kevin Pietersen , England 's captain , and Prior .
Then came England 's next match , against Trinidad & Tobago , and more of Sir Allen .
It was a nerve - shredder which England won by one run , when T&T scored only a single rather than the three they needed from the final ball .
To their general astonishment , Sir Allen then wandered into the dressing room , which his pass says he is perfectly entitled to do .
But in English sport dressing rooms are sacrosanct places .
It might seem a nonsense , but it is historic nonsense .
Sir Allen said yesterday that he would not repeat the mistake .
By now , he could have told the ECB precisely where they can go but for some reason – ego , financial , or because he genuinely wants to be involved – he has remained silent .
The ECB have signed a five - year deal with Stanford .
This embraces five of the Twenty20 for $ 20 m matches , as well as a series at Lord 's each summer which would include England , the Stanford Super Stars and two other national sides .
The Marylebone Cricket Club , owners of Lord 's , are known to be anxious about the events in Antigua .
There is a strong likelihood that they will withdraw from the agreement .
It may be that the issue will settle down and there should , for once , be slight sympathy for the ECB .
They played their hand ineptly but it was probably a hand they had to play .
When Sir Allen came calling they worked out that if England did not take the money , someone else would .
Sir Allen might have said jolly nice things about the ECB , but so long as he could lure an international side he was probably not worried who they were .
The details were hammered out quickly – and much made of the need to help West Indies cricket .
But there have been no clinics for children this week , no coaching , no help , merely a circus .
The players may or may not become rich , but cricket is much the poorer .
McCain says protesters ' just do n't get it ' David Edwards and Diane Sweet
Published : Saturday October 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican presidential contender Senator John McCain held a town hall rally in Davenport , Iowa just moments ago this afternoon .
As McCain asks the crowd " Who is ready to lead , " protesters holding signs that read ' No more war ' with photos of John Lennon and Yoko Ono began chanting " No More War , " and then calls of " We want John " filled the hall .
Senator McCain 's speech is completely stopped by the crowd , and it is so raucus that it 's difficult to discern if there are McCain supporters trying to drown out anti-war protesters by chanting " We want John , " or if the calls for John are referencing John Lennon .
Lennon 's birthday was on October 9 , and he would have been 68 years old this year had he not been gunned down in front of his NYC home in 1980
As the crowd finally settles , a smiling McCain says " There 's a perfect example of some people that just do n't get it . " and continues on with his speech on bi-partisan efforts needed to confront the crisis that faces the nation .

Ponty , eat your heart out .
I have n't seen that kind of enthusiasm since Ben Stein 's cameo in Ghostbusters 2 .
Oct. 8 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama says the personal attacks levied against him by the campaign of his presidential rival , Sen .
John McCain , particularly references to his association with 1960s anti-war radical Bill Ayers , are an attempt to " score cheap political points . "
" Why do n't we just clear it up right now , " Obama told ABC News ' Charlie Gibson in an exclusive interview for World News .
" I 'll repeat again what I 've said many times .
This is a guy who engaged in some despicable acts 40 years ago when I was eight years old .
By the time I met him , 10 or 15 years ago , he was a college professor of education at the University of Illinois . . .
And the notion that somehow he has been involved in my campaign , that he is an adviser of mine , that . . .
I 've ' palled around with a terrorist ' , all these statements are made simply to try to score cheap political points . "
Obama said that the McCain campaign is making personal attacks " the centerpiece of the discussion in the closing weeks of a campaign where we are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and we 're in the middle of two wars . "
" I think that makes very little sense , not just to me but to the American people , " Obama said .
Obama said he believes the personal attacks are an attempt to " change the subject " and draw attention away from the issue at the front of most voters ' minds : the struggling economy .
" I mean , you 've had their spokespeople over the last couple of days say if we talk about the economic crisis , we lose .
I mean , you can't be much more blatant than that , " he said .
Obama also said he was surprised some of those attacks were n't brought up by his opponent at the debate Tuesday night at Belmont University in Nashville , Tenn .
" I am surprised that , you know , we 've been seeing some pretty over - the - top attacks coming out of the McCain campaign over the last several days , that he was n't willing to say it to my face .
But I guess we 've got one last debate .
So presumably , if he ends up feeling that he needs to , he will raise it during the debate . "
Obama Challenges McCain on Economic Crisis
Speaking about the lack of faith Americans have expressed in the government 's ability to solve the economic crisis , Obama told Gibson that " people are right to be cynical " and criticized his opponent 's approach to the crisis .
" Frankly , you know , Senator McCain ended up lurching from place to place on this issue , " he said .
" And that , I think , is not the kind of leadership that we 're going to need if we 're going to be able to guide the economy out of this perilous position . "
Obama said he was frustrated by the discussion of the financial crisis .
" Part of it's the format , " he said .
" Look , you 've got two minutes to respond to a financial crisis .
And so , you know , if we had had more time , I think we could have had a better debate about what 's happening right now . "
" One of the reasons that we are doing well right now in the campaign -- and we 've still got four weeks , which is eternity in politics -- I think the people looked at my approach over the last three or four weeks during this economic crisis , which was consistent , which set out very clear principles from the first day , principles , by the way , that ended up being adopted by Secretary Paulson and were embedded in this rescue plan , that they saw I was n't trying to play politics with the issue , " Obama said .
The Democratic candidate cited a need for a " measured , calm , steady response to the crisis but one that recognizes that it 's outrageous we 're in this position to begin with and that we 've got to make sure that whatever we do is working for ordinary people . "
' Trust Is Broken ' Between Bush and Financial System
Obama praised short - term actions such as the worldwide interest rate cuts to increase liquidity and the boosting of commercial paper markets to help with short - term loans , but said that the ultimate solution would need to be a long - term restructuring of the financial regulatory system .
" I do think that we do n't have the regulatory infrastructure , either domestically or globally , to deal with global capital markets .
We have a 20th century system , and we 've got a 21st century market , " said Obama .
In addition to making sure that the $ 700 billion dollar economic rescue or bailout plan succeeds , Obama also said there 's a need to " go back to basics " and " deal with a fundamental imbalance in our economy . "
In addressing his economic plan , Obama said he would focus on four fundamental " linchpins " of the U.S. economy : creating jobs , developing an energy strategy that works , fixing the health care system -- " the real looming nightmare out there when it comes to our budget deficits and our national debt " -- and changing the education system .
" I think [ Alan ] Greenspan , the former Fed chairman , talked about irrational exuberance , we now have irrational despair , " Obama told Gibson .
" You know , trust is broken down in our financial institutions . "
McCain Labels Obama as Untested Risk
The McCain campaign has presented Obama as an untested and unknown political figure , but Obama said , " the notion that people do n't know who I am is a little hard to swallow . "
" I 've been running for president for the last two years .
I 've campaigned in 49 states .
Millions of people have heard me speak at length on every topic under the sun .
I 've been involved now in 25 debates , going on my 26th .
And I 've written two books which any -- everybody who reads them will say are about as honest a set of reflections by , at least , a politician as are out there , " Obama said .
The day after the second presidential debate , Obama held a rally before nearly 20,000 people at the State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis .
Though the state has n't favored a Democratic presidential candidate since President Lyndon B. Johnson over Sen.
Barry Goldwater in 1964 , Obama is in a tight race with McCain in Indiana .
At the rally , Obama also said we need new direction and leadership in Washington , and said that if he was elected he would do a number of things differently .
" If you 've seen President Bush come out of the Rose Garden for two minutes at a time and , you know , not give a clear sense of what is taking place , describing this -- describing this rescue package as -- seeing it described as a bailout where the average person still thinks that what 's happening is $ 700 billion is going out the door , and we 're never going to see it again , and it 's going to a bunch of Wall Street types , " he said .
On the " Great American Battleground Bus Tour " Gibson spoke to voters about what it will take to sway undecided voters in highly contested states and the economy was on top of almost everyone 's list .
Gibson watched the debate with college students at Bowling Green , and many felt that the candidates did n't address their issues , such as student loans .
" First of all , we 've been talking about student loans probably every day during course of this campaign , " Obama said .
" I mean , I 've got a very specific plan to make sure that students are able to afford to go to college in exchange for community service or military service . "
" Our health care costs are escalating so quickly that we may not be able to do anything about it , " he said .
" But one thing I 've got say , though , despite the expressions of concern and skepticism on the part of young people , I would n't be sitting here a month away from the election with a pretty good shot at getting elected president had it not been for the extraordinary idealism and hopefulness of young people .
We have seen an outpouring of involvement and passion on their part that I do n't think we 've seen in a generation .
And that makes me optimistic . "
I was lunching with a couple of politically active attorneys Tuesday , and the big thing they wanted to know was : what 's the turnout going to look like in November in Oregon , and how is that going to affect the U.S. Senate race ?
It 's a common question and one that usually leaves me shrugging .
But there 's a new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Myspace poll ( wow , that 's a mouthful ) that sheds some light on the subject .
The new survey does n't predict turnout but it does confirm the conventional wisdom that there is indeed a potential wave of new and occasional voters who heavily favor Democrat Barack Obama .
It found that among those who have n't voted before or who failed to vote in 2004 , Obama is favored 61 percent to 30 percent for Republican John McCain .
So , clearly , if these voters show up in any kind of numbers , it could have a huge impact on the presidential race .
NBC's First Read calculated that if turnout goes up by similar percentages as it did in 2004 , it could flip Colorado , Florida , Ohio and Virginia into the Democratic column .
If there is that big increase , that still leaves open the question of how it will affect Oregon 's Senate race .
Would those new and lapsed voters who so heavily favor Obama also vote Democratic in the Senate race ?
Will they even vote in the race at all or will we see another big undervote like we did in the May primary ?
That 's when more than 91,000 voters - 14 percent of the total - cast ballots in the D presidential race but failed to vote in the heated Senate primary between House Speaker Jeff Merkley and Portland consultant Steve Novick .

Hello , stylish clothing is available for purchase .
Fox exec John Moody has it precisely right : the " Obama fan attacked McCain worker " hoax in fact does " forever link " the McCain campaign to race - baiting .
However , it 's not just McCain .
The entire Republican Party this year has been revealed as the Party of Racial Fear .
Nor is it anything new : Republicans for years have tried to make hay off of racially incendiary cases that turn out to tell us more about the motives and worldviews of the torch - bearing mob than anything they might be chanting .
Pam Spaulding nails it :
It 's like Susan Smith and Charles Stuart all over again -- a disturbed person blaming a non-existent black man for a crime , fomenting the fear of " the Other " based on our country 's inability to acknowledge and deal with race , difference , and stereotypes .
That this perpetrator of a hoax was a McCain campaign worker underscores the whole whipped up race frenzy of the McCain mob that we 've seen in the last several weeks .
It 's time to flush this toxic sludge away .
What 's equally remarkable , we might add , is the eager role played both by the McCain campaign and by the wingnutosphere -- led by Matt Drudge -- in whipping up a frenzy around this case without considering the potentially incendiary nature of the charges , not to mention the actual credibility of the storytellers .
This is particularly the case with the Mark Noonans out there , furiously clinging to their belief that the story is true , and claiming that the attack heralded the onset of " Nazism 2.0 " under Obama : " God help us if Obama wins . "
Along with John McCain , their credibility has just sustained a serious body blow .
Could n't be happening to a nicer bunch .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The percentage of Americans saying now is a " bad time " to find a quality job is up 26 percentage points from a year ago and now stands at 82 % -- the highest level since Gallup began asking this question in October 2001 .
Job -Market Conditions Are Not Good
Over the first three quarters of this year , the U.S. economy lost more than three - quarters of a million jobs -- giving up many of the 1.1 million jobs created in 2007 .
In early October , Americans ' perceptions of the job market are worse than they 've been at this time of year since Gallup began monitoring the issue in late 2001 .
Today 's 82 % of Americans rating now as a bad time to find a quality job far exceeds the 56 % and 54 % who felt this way in October 2007 and October 2006 , respectively .
In fact , the current degree of pessimism about the job market is the highest level Gallup has recorded at any time over the past seven years -- the previous high was 81 % , reached around the beginning of the war with Iraq , in March and August 2003 .
This degree of pessimism is shared broadly across demographic groups , with 80 % of men and 85 % of women holding this view of the job market .
And 80 % or more of Americans in each region of the country have a similar job - market perspective .
Huge Increase in Republican Pessimism About Jobs
In May of this year , the largest differences in job - market perceptions were by political affiliation .
Republicans were least pessimistic about current labor - market conditions , with a relatively low 57 % saying it was a bad time to find a quality job .
In contrast , 86 % of Democrats felt this way , along with 72 % of independents .
By October , the party differences remained but the percentage of Republicans pessimistic about the jobs outlook surged 17 points to 74 % ; the percentage of Democrats increased 5 points to 91 % ; and the percentage of independents increased 8 points to 80 % .
Commentary
Earlier this year , far fewer Republicans than either Democrats or independents were pessimistic about the job - market outlook .
Although differences in perspective remain , nine consecutive months of job losses and the financial crises of the past several weeks have significantly closed this gap in perceptions , with pessimism now dominating the outlook .
Further , the impact of the crisis in confidence that Gallup began detecting around mid-September is yet to be fully reflected in today 's job - market perceptions .
The current lack of confidence on top of the many other challenges to the U.S. economy is creating what appears to be a traditional and fairly severe recession .
In turn , this suggests that the jobs situation will continue to worsen before it begins to get better .
Although the next government report on jobs wo n't be released until after the November elections , the presidential candidates would do well to have a plan to deal with the potential of a sharply deteriorating post-election job market .
Congress left town without addressing this seeming stealth issue , as it failed to extend unemployment insurance benefits .
It would seem unwise for the candidates to avoid the issue in Tuesday night 's debate .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,011 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 3 - 5 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Nations has called an emergency meeting for Oct. 24 aimed at halting a precipitous drop in oil prices .
Crude , despite an uptick Friday , has crumbled to $ 72 a barrel , half the price it fetched in July .
See Futures Movers .
Funny how fast things can change .
Gone is the steady drone of peak - oil forecasts .
Gone is the fear that we are in the pockets of " folks that do n't like us very much . "
Prices are down at the pump , and talk radio has moved on , feasting now on banks , bailouts and rampant greed and corruption on Wall Street .
As the industrial world withdraws into a recessionary shell , it takes oil demand with it .
China and India 's insatiable thirst for oil looks meager now as factory output slows to a trickle .
But there 's also been a rush of roving capital out of the market .
According to the latest data from Hedge Fund Research , third - quarter hedge fund redemptions hit a record - high $ 210 billion , spearheading an exodus wealth that burst one of the biggest commodities bubbles of all time .
See full story .
It 's no coincidence that oil prices plunged in tandem with these record withdrawals , exposing for all to see just how much of the summer 's oil - price spike was driven by speculators .
While oil 's deep " correction " alarms Big Oil , it 's even more alarming to producing nations whose economies are entirely grounded in petro-dollars .
The extreme pain caused by this sudden revenue loss can be gauged by OPEC 's decision to move up their next meeting from November to October , less than two weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election .
This raises the likelihood of another severe tongue - lashing by a politically supercharged Washington , but that 's clearly better than enduring further losses .
This time , however , OPEC is on its own .
With speculators fleeing , the cartel is going to have to build a floor under oil prices through disciplined production cuts .
This is n't a group known for discipline , however .
And given the wheezing global economy , OPEC has only an outside chance of pushing prices back up to $ 100 a barrel even if they manage to significantly slash output .
Unless , of course , another war or natural disaster disrupts supply lines -- at which point all bets are off , and OPEC has us all once again over the proverbial barrel .

Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin yesterday shrugged off the findings of a state inquiry into the ' Troopergate ' affair , which concluded that she had used her position as governor to pursue a private feud with a State Trooper .
Speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania , she remained defiant , insisting the inquiry outcome proved she had not broken the law .
Shrugging her shoulders while addressing her audience , she said : ' If you read the report , you will see there was nothing unlawful ... or unethical about replacing a cabinet member .'
Her solicitor , Thomas Van Flein , said there was no evidence she had breached any ethical code .
' In order to violate the ethics law , there has to be some personal gain , usually financial .
[ The report ] has failed to identify any financial gain . '
However , an already tense US presidential election campaign was electrified by the publication of the damning verdict , delivered by Stephen Branchflower , a retired prosecutor who was appointed as investigator last July by a Republican - dominated committee of the Alaska state legislature .
Branchflower found that Palin had breached the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act , which states that 'each public officer holds office as a public trust and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust ' .
He also concluded that Palin 's feud with her former brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , a State Trooper , or officer , in the Alaskan state police , was ' likely a contributory factor ' in her decision to dismiss the head of that force , Walt Monegan .
His report detailed the way in which Palin and the people around her repeatedly pressurised Monegan over Wooten .
However , Branchflower concluded that Monegan 's dismissal had been carried out in a ' proper and lawful ' fashion .
Under Alaskan law , it is for the state 's personnel board , which is conducting its own inquiry , to decide whether Palin violated state law and , if so , must refer it to the senate president for disciplinary action .
Violations can carry a possible $ 5,000 fine .
Meg Stapleton , a spokeswoman for the Republican Presidential candidate John McCain , said the legislative council was ' making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact ' .
A campaign statement said : ' This report also illustrates what we 've known all along : this was a partisan - led inquiry run by [ Barack ]
Obama supporters and the Palins were completely justified in their concern regarding Trooper Wooten given his violent and rogue behaviour . '
The report could not have come at a less opportune time for the McCain campaign .
According to the latest Gallup poll , published on Friday , he is trailing Barack Obama by 10 points , with 41 per cent to the Democrat 's 51 per cent .
Palin gave the McCain campaign an extraordinary boost after she first burst on to the American national scene at the Republican convention last month .
Since then she has done little for his chances of success , with the polls suggesting many voters doubt she has the experience or ability for high office .
Publication of the report is likely to fuel claims that McCain showed poor judgment , or even recklessness , in selecting her .
Palin had agreed to co-operate with the inquiry , but when McCain selected her the following month she changed her mind , claiming the inquiry had been hijacked by Democrats .
Palin has given a number of reasons for her decision to sack Monegan , but always denied wrongdoing .
Shortly before the report was published , her husband Todd attempted to draw some of the investigation 's fire by admitting that he had repeatedly complained about Wooten , believing him to be a danger to the public .
In 2005 , Wooten had been through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle with Palin 's younger sister , Molly McCann .
A number of complaints that the Palin family made about him at that time were upheld - including a charge that he had shot his own stepson with a Taser stun - gun on a low setting .
In March 2006 he was disciplined , suspended for five days and given a final written warning , but allowed to keep his job .
Palin came into office as governor of Alaska nine months later , and appointed Monegan as her public safety commissioner .
Monegan says he immediately came under pressure to sack Wooten .
He told Branchflower he was summoned to see Todd Palin , who complained that Wooten 's punishment had been merely a ' slap on the wrist ' .
Monegan said : ' I had this kind of ominous feeling that I may not be long for this job if I did n't somehow respond accordingly . '
A further finding of Branchflower 's 263 - page report was that the office of the Alaska state attorney - general , Talis Colberg , failed to comply with his request to release information about the case held in various emails .
Some of these emails may now surface as a result of Friday 's court case , shedding more light not only on Troopergate but also on the conduct of the politician who would , as American commentators repeatedly remind the voters , be just a heartbeat from the presidency were McCain elected .
Palin is now known to have used at least two personal email accounts to conduct official business : gov.palin@yahoo.com and gov.sarah@yahoo.com .
Both have now been shut down .
The judge ordered the Alaskan attorney general to contact Yahoo and other private carriers to preserve any emails sent and received on those accounts .
If the emails were ditched when the accounts were deactivated , he directed state officials to have the companies try to retrieve them .
Freedom of information campaigner Andrée McLeod , who brought the case , said : ' We should n't be in a position where public records have been lost because the governor did n't do what every other state employee knows to do , which is to use an official , secure state email account to conduct state business . '

It seems like not a week goes by without some sort of EA - related DRM nightmare .
This week , the DRM for EA 's recently released Command and Conquer : Red Alert 3 is causing problems for faithful consumers .
Some of those who purchased the title received a CD key with a missing number , and EA has told customers to solve this problem by " guessing . "
The error occurred as a result of a spree of misprints in the activation keys of select copies of Red Alert 3 .
Rather than receiving full 20 - character codes , some users reported receiving 19 - character codes .
EA has offered to fill in codes for those who send in a physical picture of their serial via e-mail , but for those unwilling to do that , the company has offered the alternative " guessing " solution .
On the game 's help site , the guessing procedure is laid out for users .
" There is currently a workaround that may allow you to bypass this issue , " the entry reads .
" Since you have the first 19 characters of the code already , you can basically try ' guessing ' the last character .
To do this , simply enter your existing code , and then for the last character , try the letters A - Z , and then the numbers 0 - 9 .
You should eventually get the right combination , and be able to play the game .
If this does not work , you can follow the instructions below . "
Command and Conquer : Red Alert 3 is one of many EA titles that includes a restrictive implementation of SecuROM , limiting the number of installs .
Without the key , the game is virtually useless for most consumers .
Regarding the error , EA had little to say on the matter .
" This was due to a misprint on a small number of manuals and we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused , " reads the official apology on the game 's help site .
This , of course , is n't the first time that EA has messed up one of its titles with poor DRM decisions .
Spore has became an infamous example of the negative effect on consumers that DRM can have , as the game 's limited SecuROM implementation left a bitter taste in users ' mouths which spawned a campaign that saw a bombardment of negative user reviews and anti-DRM sentiment on the game 's Amazon listing .
While EA continues to drive the DRM bandwagon , companies like Stardock are championing other methods which go so far as to eliminate DRM altogether .
The company 's Sins of a Solar Empire has become an outstanding example of the way that games can perform as products without DRM , as the relatively low - key title went on to sell well over a half - million units without any form of copy protection .
EA 's latest DRM snafu may be due to a relatively harmless printer error , but it still shows that DRM does little to deter pirates and punishes only the legitimate customers who actually went out and bought the software — especially those who have to sit and guess the magical number that will make their game work .

Video the Vote has a video showing Jackson County Clerk Jeff Waybright demonstrating how votes cast on uncalibrated touchscreen machines can jump from one candidate to another .
This is the kind of problem that voters reported having in several West Virginia counties last week on touchscreen machines made by Election Systems & Software .
Voters in Tennessee also complained about the same problem on ES&S machines .
In the video , after Waybright demonstrates the phenomenon on the uncalibrated machine , he calibrates the machine and votes again .
But even though the machine is supposed to be fixed at that point , it appears to record a vote incorrectly .
( See update after the jump . )
In the first part of the video demonstrating an uncalibrated ES&S iVotronic touchscreen machine , Waybright touches the screen to cast a vote for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , but a check mark appears three boxes below Obama 's name in the slot for Constitution Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin .
When he touches the box next to Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney 's name , the machine sends him to a new screen where a box and keyboard are displayed for filling in a write - in candidate 's name .
When he selects the option for voting a straight - party Democratic ticket , the machine shows a check mark in the box next to Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's name .
He then inserts a cartridge in a port at the front of the machine to calibrate it .
When the calibration is completed , he pulls up a new ballot on the screen and selects the option to vote a straight - party Democratic ballot .
The machine correctly marks a vote for Barack Obama .
He touches a box next to Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader 's name to change the vote from Obama to Nader .
But when he presses the screen to change to a straight - party Republican ticket , instead of placing a check mark in the box next to John McCain 's name , the machine still shows a check in the box next to Independent candidate Nader 's name .
" Ah , it 's out of calibration , " Waybright says , unfazed .
He then adds , as if the error proves a point he was making , " If that happens , again , the machine lets you know . "
Threat Level called Waybright to see if the video really shows what it appears to show .
I say " appears to show " because the video jumps during the demonstration and it's unclear if there are any steps left out .
ES&S did not respond to a request for comment .
Waybright tells Video the Vote that the county will dispatch technicians trained by ES&S to examine machines that cause problems for voters .
But when three voters in Jackson County first complained about the issue to his office , Waybright said the problem was the voters , not the machines .
After the voters complained to the secretary of state 's office , Secretary of State Betty Ireland contacted Waybright and directed him to re-calibrate the machines .
" People make mistakes more than the machines , " Waybright told the Charleston Gazette , " but I went in yesterday and re-calibrated the machines .
We are doing everything we can not to disenfranchise anybody . "
When voters in other counties complained about the problem as well ,
Ireland instructed all 34 West Virginia counties that use the machines to re-calibrate them each morning during early voting and on election day .
All of the West Virginia voters complained that when they touched the screen to vote for Obama , the machine marked a vote for McCain .
Shortly thereafter , however , three voters in Tennessee complained that when they touched their voting screen to cast a vote for McCain , the machine marked a vote for Obama .
The voting machines used in Tennessee were also iVotronic touchscreen machines made by ES&S .
The machines in West Virginia and Tennessee differ in one regard .
West
Virginia 's iVotronic machines produce a paper print - out that scrolls behind a window , allowing voters to check that the machine has registered their selection as they make their choices .
If voters make a change , the machine will print out their new selection as well .
Tennessee 's machines do not produce a paper trail .
But all of the machines , in West Virginia and Tennessee , provide a review screen at the end of the electronic ballot so that voters can check their final choices before casting the ballot .
Video the Vote is a grassroots organization that has been sending volunteers into the field to monitor elections since 2006 .
UPDATE : Computer World interviewed Waybright as well as the videographer who shot the video and it turns out that Video the Vote , as I suspected , deleted more than 30 minutes from the video – including important parts that would have shown what really occurred during the demonstration .
The machine actually did function as it was supposed to function .
Waybright , however , misinterpreted what the machine did and assumed that when the machine still showed a vote for Nader that it was a mistake .
The ES&S machines are designed to retain votes if a voter selects an individual candidate and then chooses to vote a straight - party ticket .
This allows the voter to cast what 's called a " cross - over " vote outside of the straight - party ticket .
In the video , Waybright is seen choosing Nader 's name , then choosing the option to vote a straight - party Republican ticket .
When the machine still shows a vote for Independent candidate Nader instead of Republican John McCain , Waybright misspeaks and assumes the machine made a mistake and that it 's miscalibrated .
Video the Vote has now published the entire video , showing all of the steps Waybright took to calibrate the machine as well as all the comments he made during the interview .

NEW YORK -- A suburban police chief likened the conflicting accounts of an accidental overdose at Isiah Thomas ' home to a " cover - up " and rebuked the former New York Knicks coach Saturday for saying it was his teenage daughter who required treatment .
" It was n't his daughter , " Harrison Police Chief David Hall told The Associated Press .
" And why they 're throwing her under the bus is beyond my ability to understand . "
Authorities were called early Friday to Thomas ' Westchester County home , where police said a 47 - year - old man was taken to the hospital and treated for an overdose of sleeping pills .
Several media outlets reported that police confirmed it was Thomas who went to the hospital .
But reached on his cell phone Friday , the 47 - year - old NBA great told the New York Post he had not been treated for a sleeping pill overdose , and that it was 17 - year - old daughter Lauren who had a medical issue .
It " was n't an overdose , " he told the newspaper .
" My daughter is very down right now .
None of us are OK . "
Hall forcefully refuted Thomas ' statement .
" My cops ... know the difference between a 47 - year - old black male and a young black female , " Hall said .
" These people should learn something from Richard Nixon -- it 's not the crime , it 's the cover - up , " he added .
Voice mails and text messages from the AP were left on Thomas ' cell phone Saturday .
Messages left earlier with Thomas ' publicist and two of his attorneys were not returned .
Thomas ' 20 - year - old son , Joshua , lashed out at Hall 's comments .
" Saying that someone is being thrown under the bus when you are talking about health issues is disrespectful , " the Indiana University student wrote in a text to the New York Daily News .
Isiah Thomas is accompanied by his daughter , Lauren , at a June 2005 gala in New York City .

" I love both my sister and dad and am glad that both are doing well , " he told the newspaper .
" Thanks for all the support , but as a family we are fine and stronger than ever . "
On Friday , he also said it was his sister , not his father , who required treatment .
No suicide note was found , and police were classifying the case as an " accidental drug overdose " on " a number " of prescription sleeping pills , Hall said .
Hall would not confirm the identity of the hospitalized man .
Thomas ' 20 - year - old son , Joshua , also said it was his sister , not his father , who required treatment .
" He 's fine , " the Indiana University student told the New York Daily News .
" Reports of sleeping pills are false . "
The developments , days before the start of another season , are the latest drama in what has been a difficult year for Thomas .
He was fired as Knicks coach April 18 after a season of dreadful basketball , a tawdry sexual harassment lawsuit and unending chants from fans demanding his dismissal .
Still , he was retained by the organization as an adviser and consultant .
" Isiah Thomas spoke with members of the New York Knicks organization and is OK , " the Knicks said in a statement .
" He is dealing with a family matter , and we will have no further comment .
He has asked that we respect his privacy , and we will . "
An ambulance and two police officers responded to a 911 call that came in from the Thomas home a couple minutes after midnight , Hall said .
The victim was taken about 5 miles from the home to White Plains Hospital Center , where officials declined to identify the overdose patient .
Thomas ' house is on a luxury cul de sac of multimillion - dollar homes , about 30 miles from midtown Manhattan .
As a player , Thomas won NBA titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990 and an NCAA championship with Indiana in 1981 .
He joined the Knicks as the team president in 2003 and became coach in June 2006 after Larry Brown was fired .
Last season , Thomas drew the wrath of fans , who serenaded him nightly with chants of " Fire Isiah ! "
When he was dismissed , his record in New York was 56 - 108 .
Overall , he is 187-223 as an NBA coach , leading the Indiana Pacers to the playoffs in three straight years from 2000 - 03 .
The first round of media commentary on the vice - presidential debate is in .
And it looks like the Obama - Biden ticket has survived what was potentially the most treacherous moment of the campaign .
Following Sarah Palin 's disastrous interviews with Charles Gibson and Katie Couric , there was a real danger she'd be declared the winner of last night 's encounter with Joe Biden if she could somehow manage to stand upright and keep talking .
All of a sudden it would be Palinmania , round two .
That did n't happen .
Though Palin is receiving deservedly high marks for her folksy , feisty performance , the substance - free nature of her answers has not gone unnoticed by either the press or the public .
Perhaps the most remarkable piece of opinionating today comes from the right .
In her Wall Street Journal column , Peggy Noonan , former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and for George Bush 's father , weighs in with admiration for Palin 's performance skills and contempt for the emptiness behind them .
Last month , as you may recall , an open microphone caught Noonan referring to the Palin pick as " political bullshit " .
Noonan attempted then to deny the obvious meaning of those words , but today she makes it clear that she meant what she said .
" There were moments when she seemed to be doing an infomercial pitch for charm in politics .
But it was an effective infomercial , " writes Noonan , adding : " A question is at what point shiny , happy populism becomes cheerful manipulation . "
Noonan also lambastes the McCain campaign 's " obnoxious political game " of pretending that criticism of Palin amounts to " knocking the real America " .
Other conservative commentators are more kind to Palin , but they want us to know they can see and hear , too .
For instance , Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard pronounces Palin the winner , but then goes on to observe that she was " utterly incoherent " at times and " seemed to settle back on material that she seemed to have memorised . "
So how did she win ?
" She won , " Hayes says , " because to a vast majority of those who watched the debate tonight she likely came off as a plausible vice - president .
And that was all that mattered . "
In other words , Hayes thinks she lost , but condescendingly assumes the rubes will come to a different conclusion .
Paul Mirengoff , writing for the conservative Power Line blog , tells us : " Palin , forced by circumstances to prove her merit to an increasingly sceptical electorate , accomplished that mission and then some . "
But he can't leave well enough alone , adding : " From a technical standpoint , it was Biden who had the more detailed command of the facts ( and the greater ability to fudge them ) .
He was able not just to hammer McCain , but to do so at a level of specificity that Palin could not address . "
Perhaps bolstered by snap CBS and CNN polls that show viewers thought Biden won by a wide margin , many mainstream and liberal commentators are coming out of their defensive crouch today .
If Republicans want to accuse them of liberal bias , they seem to be saying , so be it .
Washington
Post columnist Dana Milbank is especially brutal , writing that Palin made it through the debate " with an unnerving mixture of platitudes and cute , folksy phrases that poured from her lips even when they bore no relation to the questions asked . "
At the Politico , John Harris and Mike Allen 's verdict is that " she got out alive , though there were white - knuckle moments along the way : questions that were answered with painfully obvious talking points that betrayed scant knowledge of the issue at hand . "
Just in case you missed the point , they add : " It is hard to count any objective measures by which Biden did not clearly win the encounter . "
At the New York Times , Adam Nagourney begins more mildly , telling us that Palin managed to meet the ridiculously low expectations that had been set for her performance : " Sarah Palin made it through the vice - presidential debate on Thursday without doing any obvious damage to the Republican presidential ticket . "
That may be the best outcome the McCain campaign could have hoped for .
Palin was good enough that her presence on the ticket , as John Dickerson of Slate argues , should become less of a burning issue than it was in the immediate aftermath of her inability to identify any newspapers she reads , any supreme court decisions disagrees with ( other than Roe v Wade ) or any measures her running mate has undertaken over the years to reform the imploding financial system .
So it 's back to Barack Obama versus John McCain , with their running mates fading into their traditional supporting roles .
That has n't been working so well for McCain in recent weeks , but at least it 's a dynamic over which he has some control .
Palin 's erratic but energetic performance may end the recent run of bad news for the Republican ticket .
But it 's not going to accomplish anything more than that .

Frank Rich : McCain is ' too weak ' to be President Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday September 16 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC's Rachel Maddow sat down with New York Times editorial columnist Frank Rich to discuss eerie similarities they observed between a McCain / Palin administration and that of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney since they took office in 2000 .
Governor Palin's office has taken such measures as instructing staffers not to speak to the press and using personal E - mail accounts for state business with aims to circumvent public records requests , and posting personal friends and former classmates in well - paying positions .
Quipped Maddow : " Disturbing secrecy ?
Seems like it .
Cronyism ?
Looks that way .
( Hello , Liberty University . )
The ability to mangle the truth with a straight face ? "
And cut to a clip of one of Governor Palin 's public claims that she rejected the infamous " Bridge to Nowhere . "
" What 's left ? " Maddow continued .
" Dangerous hawkishness and a clear lack of understanding of foreign policy ?
Well , Palin did give the old ' perhaps , so ' to [ ABC's ]
Charlie Gibson when he asked about a possible war with oil - rich , nuclear - armed Russia .
" Like I said : Scary . "
Frank Rich concurred .
Senator McCain , said Rich , is n't even aware enough of what 's going on to be " surprised or not surprised " by Palin 's " celebrity status . "
" I 'm sure he 's happy with this , " Rich opined .
" He probably did n't anticipate it -- it probably went beyond their expectations .
But there 's of course a downside to it for him ... it raises the question of who 's really running the show and , you know , who 's really going to be the stronger person should they get to the White House . "
Whether or not McCain made the decision to make Palin his running mate , Rich said , is unclear , though it was , either way , to placate his base at the expense of his preferred mate , Sen. Joe Lieberman .
" He crumbled , " Rich said , " and now we have Sarah Palin . "
" She 's really like a less talented Mike Huckabee with less accomplishment than Mike Huckabee , " he added of Palin , noting her social conservative credentials and lack of executive experience .
Wall Street , as a major source of funding for Republican candidates , may indeed be charmed by the idea of a President and Vice President who have little knowledge of economic matters , Maddow said .
" And they think , ' Perfect !
Empty vessel .
They know nothing , and they know they know nothing , so let 's use them to advance a special interest agenda , the kind of agenda we can push through with strong - minded advisors who talk well . '
And these people wo n't resist in any way because they do n't have any ideas of their own . "

Manga with a higher calling
In the United States , manga have been regarded largely as a form of entertainment , an escapism that can be read at the beach or in a comfy chair or someplace similar .
Japan , though , has a much broader view of manga .
It 's become a part of daily life , after all .
Not only is manga entertainment there , it 's also been used to educate audiences about certain people , places or things .
Now that manga 's become popular across the Pacific , some of those educational manga are coming over as well .
Here are a few examples of educational manga that have caught our eyes in recent years .
The ' Edu - Manga ' books
Albert Einstein , Ludwig von Beethoven , Anne Frank , Helen Keller and Mother Teresa -- all of them were great people in their respective eras , and all of them are profiled in the " Edu - Manga " line of manga being released stateside by Digital Manga Publishing .
Astro Boy , Osamu Tezuka 's classic star of anime and manga , acts as the anointed " guide through the ' Edu - Manga ' adventure , " This basically translates into Astro and his family doing something that 's somewhat related to the featured character 's area of expertise , someone asking , " Oh , hey , what was [ INSERT FAMOUS PERSON'S NAME HERE ] like ? " and the biography beginning in earnest ... without Astro ever appearing in the manga again .
The Beethoven manga reads like a typical " shoujo " ( young girls ' ) romance , filled with angst for the main character .
The composer is depicted as a tragic figure , abused by his father , losing the young woman he loved to another man because of class differences and an affliction with his hearing .
At least the Beethoven manga is entertaining reading .
The Einstein manga instead reads like an illustrated physics textbook , rattling off the scientist 's theories and adding the slimmest of biographical flourishes to force the story slowly along .
Mother Teresa 's manga offers an overview of her life , with an emphasis on her charity work , her care for the destitute and dying in India and her trip to Japan in 1981 .
Meanwhile , the Anne Frank manga plays out main events in the book " Anne Frank : Diary of a Young Girl , " with additional scenes of the rest of her brief life in the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp .
Helen Keller 's story is much like other versions that have introduced young readers to the deaf and blind woman :
It focuses on Keller 's distressing childhood and the tireless efforts of her tutor , Anne Sullivan , who taught her not only language , but manners and etiquette as well .
The strong focus on Sullivan and others who support Keller makes the manga worth a read .
The Edu -Manga books share the unfortunate characteristic of presenting lists of important related people in a drab , crowded layout that overwhelms the reader before one word is actually read .
That aside , the Edu - Manga series will likely inspire readers to learn more about the chosen subject , which is perhaps the main reason for these books in the first place .
' Project X : Cup Noodle '
It 's always a trip to read about the history behind the everyday gadgets and conveniences that we take for granted , and " Project X : Cup Noodle , " also published stateside by Digital Manga Publishing , certainly soaked up our attention .
The manga details the arduous process from conceptualization to reality and , ultimately , success of the world 's first instant ramen in a container , Cup O' Noodles ( originally named " Cup Noodle " in Japan ) , by Nissin Foods founder and director Momofuku Andou and his development team .
The inclusion of archival photos , from the Nissin research lab to a picture of youths walking and slurping up the noodles at the Pedestrian 's Plaza introductory sales events , and an interview with one of the development team put a nice realistic touch on what could otherwise be dismissed as an overdramatized retelling .
( Although we do have to question the repeated remarks of " Ooh , there 's shrimp ! " and wonder whether people really did react that positively to the inclusion of that particular garnish . )
Still , " Cup Noodles " is a thoroughly fascinating read .
The struggle to create any successful product makes for great material , and the story of Cup O' Noodles reads as well as any drama , with the right splash of humor included .
It definitely made me go out to buy -- and eat -- a few servings .
For those hungering for more , publisher DMP has released other books in the " Project X " series detailing the rise of 7 - Eleven and the Datsun Fairlady Z ( the 240Z in the U.S. , whose latest incarnation is the Nissan 350Z ) .
' Manga Cvn 73 : uss George Washington '
With the nuclear aircraft carrier USS George Washington due to make Yokosuka , Japan , its home port in August , the U.S. Navy wanted to find a way to explain the carrier 's mission to its future neighbors in a way that went beyond a typical pamphlet .
Their solution was to commission writer Harumi Sato and artist Hiroshi Kazuma to produce a manga about the carrier .
The strategy worked ; the military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported that about 800 copies of the manga 's 30,000 - copy print run were given away June 8 ... in three hours .
Fortunately , curious American fans do n't have to wait in line in Japan to get a copy ... or know Japanese , for that matter .
An English - translated PDF file ( requiring the free Adobe Acrobat reader ) is available online at tinyurl.com/6d2v8o .
The art retains its original , right - to - left orientation in the translation .
In " CVN 73 , " readers meet Petty Officer 3rd Class Jack Ohara , a Navy sailor on his first overseas assignment and his first tour of duty on board a carrier .
Between the carrier 's departure from ( presumably ) San Diego and Yokosuka , Jack transforms from a seasick rookie to THE MOST AWESOME NAVY SAILOR EVER .
There 's no other way to explain it .
Halfway through the book -- about 100 pages -- he declares that he 's accustomed to ship life .
He helps fix aircraft .
He puts out a laundry fire .
He pushes a dumbfounded guy out of the way of an oncoming jet .
AWESOME .
That rah -rah spirit prevails throughout " CVN 73 . "
Sure , readers get to see what life on board a carrier is like , but it all seems so sterile and efficient , one big happy family working together to defend allies and warn off potential enemies .
The most contentious issue regarding the carrier 's arrival in Japan -- its nuclear - powered core -- gets boiled down to two sentences : " Not only does the heart of GW have approximately a 50 - year lifespan , it efficiently provides stable energy and does n't require refueling .
Considering the lifespan of the vessel , it could be said that GW can virtually sail infinitely . "
The translation can get a bit clunky at times ; prepare to see lines like " I'm Jack Ohara .
Nice meet to you " and " This ship is built with a - few - inch - thick ultrahigh - strength steel , it weighs 97,000 tons you know ? "
The PDF file format also ends up breaking up several two - page spreads into single pages , making for a few awkward transitions .
Sure , " CVN 73 " may be nothing more than a curiosity to Western audiences in the grand scheme of things .
But it does offer an intriguing , somewhat entertaining peek into the inner workings of a carrier at sea .
And if that 's what the Navy wanted to do with this manga , then mission accomplished .
The life of Leona Helmsley presents an object lesson in the truism that money does not buy happiness .
Born in 1920 , she overcame a hardscrabble youth in Brooklyn to become a successful condominium broker in Manhattan , eventually alighting , in the nineteen - sixties , at a firm owned by Harry B. Helmsley , one of the city ’s biggest real - estate developers .
The two married in 1972 , and Leona became the public face of their empire , the self - styled “ queen ” of the Helmsley chain of hotels .
In a series of ads that ran in the Times Magazine and elsewhere , Helmsley ’s visage became a symbol of the celebration of wealth in the nineteen - eighties .
She would n’t settle for skimpy towels , the ads proclaimed —
“ Why should you ? ”
Photograph from Splash News
In private , as it turned out , the grinning monarch was n’t just demanding but despotic .
Throughout her life , Leona left a trail of ruin — embittered relatives , fired employees , and , fatefully , unpaid taxes .
Knowing that the Helmsleys had used company funds to renovate their sprawling mansion , Dunnellen Hall , in Greenwich , Connecticut , disgruntled associates leaked the records to the Post .
Among the charges billed to the company were a million - dollar dance floor installed above a swimming pool ; a forty - five - thousand - dollar silver clock ; and a two - hundred - and - ten - thousand - dollar mahogany card table .
In 1988 , the U.S. Attorney ’s office charged the couple with income - tax evasion , among other crimes .
( Harry Helmsley avoided trial because of ill health ; he died in 1997 , at the age of eighty - seven . )
At the trial , a housekeeper famously testified that Leona had told her , “ We do n’t pay taxes .
Only the little people pay taxes , ” and the public warmed itself on a tabloid bonfire built under the Queen of Mean .
Leona was convicted of multiple counts and served eighteen months in federal prison .
In time , following her release , she became largely a recluse , and she died at Dunnellen Hall on August 20 , 2007 .
After her husband died , Leona Helmsley got a dog named Trouble , a Maltese bitch .
In her will , which she signed two years before her death , Helmsley put aside twelve million dollars in a trust to care for Trouble .
Further , she directed that , when Trouble died , the dog was to be “ buried next to my remains in the Helmsley Mausoleum , ” at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery , in Westchester County .
Helmsley made only a handful of relatively small individual bequests in the will , and left the bulk of her remaining estate to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust .
Based on the figures in court files , that trust may turn out to be worth nearly eight billion dollars , which would make it one of the top ten or so foundations in the United States .
( Leona ’s estate was so large because Harry left his fortune to her . )
According to a “ mission statement , ” which Helmsley signed on March 1 , 2004 , the trust was to make expenditures for “ purposes related to the provision of care for dogs . ”
The size of the bequests , to Trouble and to dogs generally , has generated widespread astonishment .
In fact , the clear motivation underlying Leona Helmsley ’s will — her desire to pass her wealth on to dogs — is more common than might be expected .
Pet - lovers ( many of whom now prefer the term “ animal companion ” ) have engineered a quiet revolution in the law to allow , in effect , nonhumans to inherit and spend money .
It is becoming routine for dogs to receive cash and real estate in the form of trusts , and there is already at least one major foundation devoted to helping dogs .
A network of lawyers and animal activists has orchestrated these changes , largely without opposition , in order to whittle down the legal distinctions between human beings and animals .
They are already making plans for the Helmsleys ’ billions .
For a couple that became emblematic of late - twentieth - century New York , Harry and Leona Helmsley were an unlikely pair .
Harry , born in 1909 and raised in the Bronx , was sixteen when he joined a small Manhattan real - estate firm as an office boy for twelve dollars a week , and soon worked his way into a partnership .
In 1938 , he married the former Eve Green , a widow .
Tall , stooped , a workaholic before the term was invented , Helmsley started buying buildings that were , in a way , a reflection of himself — drab but profitable .
Often collaborating with a rotating group of partners on different projects , he moved on to a few more glamorous acquisitions , like the Empire State Building , in 1961 , but he seemed to go out of his way to avoid calling attention to himself .
He and Eve had no children .
“ My properties are my children , ” he would say .
Lena Rosenthal , in contrast , was a raucous , disputatious presence seemingly from birth .
( She later changed her name to Leona Roberts . )
Nearly every aspect of her biography has been challenged , particularly if she was the source for it .
She claimed to have worked as a model for Chesterfield cigarettes in her early years , but evidence for that assertion is elusive .
She was married three times , but generally acknowledged having had only two husbands .
She married Leo Panzirer in 1940 , and they divorced twelve years later .
Then she married and divorced Joseph Lubin ( she usually neglected to mention him at all in later years ) , before her marriage to Harry Helmsley , who had left his wife of thirty - three years shortly after Leona ’s arrival at his firm .
Leona had one child , Jay Panzirer , who died , of a heart ailment , in 1982 , at the age of forty .
Jay Panzirer had four children , and these grandchildren survived Leona .
The will hints at the tense relationship between her and her only descendants .
Leona had contentious relationships with almost everybody ( except Harry ) .
In particular , she came to despise Jay ’s widow , Mimi , his third wife , for reasons that Mimi later said she never understood .
Following Jay ’s death , the Helmsleys moved immediately to evict Mimi and their eldest grandchild , Craig , from their home in Florida , which was owned by a Helmsley subsidiary .
During the next several years , the Helmsleys filed no fewer than six lawsuits against Mimi , asserting that they were entitled to the money in Jay ’s estate , a distinctly modest sum compared with their own fortune .
After five years of rancorous litigation , Leona won about two - thirds of the two hundred and thirty - one thousand dollars at issue .
As a result of Leona ’s legal triumph , each of her grandchildren was left with an inheritance from their father of a little more than four hundred dollars .
In her will , Leona Helmsley was more generous to two of her grandchildren , David and Walter Panzirer , who were left trusts and bequests worth ten million dollars , on the condition that they visit their father ’s grave at least once a year .
( Jay was buried in the family mausoleum , alongside Harry and Leona . )
To make sure that they did , the will stipulated that the trustees “ shall have placed in the Helmsley Mausoleum a register to be signed by each visitor . ”
Leona ’s other two grandchildren , Craig Panzirer and Meegan Panzirer Wesolko , were excluded from any inheritance , “ for reasons which are known to them . ”
( The reasons were not disclosed . )
That omission led to the first legal skirmish regarding the Helmsley estate .
Lawyers for the two disinherited grandchildren filed a notice in Manhattan Surrogate ’s Court announcing that they planned to challenge the will on the ground that Leona “ was not of sound mind or memory and did not have the mental capacity to make a Will ” in 2005 .
Leona ’s executors — her surviving brother , Alvin Rosenthal ; her grandsons David and Walter Panzirer ; her lawyer Sandor Frankel ; and John Codey , a family friend — decided to settle the dispute quickly .
They agreed to amend the will so that Craig and Meegan also received bequests : four million dollars for Craig , and two million for Meegan .
In return , Craig and Meegan agreed to an elaborate confidentiality provision , promising not to “ directly or indirectly publish or cause to be published any diary , memoir , letter , story , photograph , interview , article , essay , account or depiction of any kind ” concerning the dispute over the will .
Likewise , they agreed that all of their “ personal correspondence . . . records , tapes , papers and financial information of or relating to ” Leona must be given to the estate ’s lawyers .
( Consequently , neither Craig nor Meegan , nor their attorneys , would comment on the dispute . )
Still , the conflict among the human beneficiaries of the will was easy to resolve compared with the legal matters relating to dogs .
The modern history of legal rights for animals begins with a chimpanzee named Washoe .
“ He was the first ‘ signing chimp , ’ the first chimpanzee who learned sign language to communicate with people , ” Victoria Bjorklund , the head of the exempt - organizations practice at the New York law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , said .
“ There came a time when he was going to be sent off to be used in medical testing , and there was a lot of distress about that possibility . ”
So Bjorklund and others set up a trust ( funded with the proceeds of a book about Washoe ) , and appointed a guardian to protect him and several other chimps like him .
The problem was that New York law said that a guardian could be appointed for a “ person with a disability . ”
Was Washoe a “ person ” under New York law ?
The lawyers at Simpson Thacher argued that “ the mental , emotional , sociological , and biological characteristics ” of Washoe and the other chimps “ warrant their treatment as persons ” entitled to representation .
The lawyers submitted affidavits from such animal experts as Jane Goodall , who said that “ chimpanzees are biochemically closer to humans than they are to any other of the great apes . ”
According to the brief in the case , the chimps “ are capable of rational thought , communication , and other higher cognitive functions , ” justifying their treatment as the legal equivalent of minors or disabled humans .
In a 1997 decision , the surrogate of Nassau County agreed and appointed a guardian to administer the trust for the benefit of the chimps .
“ That trust was then respected by the State of Washington , where Washoe lived , ” Bjorklund said .
“ We think it was the first trust ever established for the benefit of specific nonhuman primates . ”
Jane Hoffman , a former associate at Simpson Thacher , had brought the Washoe case to the firm .
“ The idea was to create a right for a nonhuman animal to receive money — to push the envelope on the law , which at that point had only allowed trusts for the benefit of children or disabled adults , ” she said .
In 1990 , Hoffman and a group of other lawyers founded a new committee at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York , on “ Legal Issues Pertaining to Animals . ”
One of the first subjects that the committee ’s members took up was the issue of inheritance .
In 1996 , they helped change the law to make it easier for any animal — especially a pet — to become the beneficiary of a trust .
Many people wanted to make provisions for the care of their pets in their wills , but the law allowed no simple mechanism to do so .
Frances Carlisle , a New York trusts - and - estates lawyer and a member of the committee , pushed the New York State Legislature to allow the creation of “ pet trusts , ” which permit individuals to put aside money and instructions for their pets .
New York approved the changes , and now thirty - eight states allow for the creation of such trusts .
“ We decided we did n’t want people to have to leave the disposition of their pets to chance , or a sudden decision , after they died , ” Carlisle told me .
“ We want to give people peace of mind about their animals . ”
The legal movement , which largely focussed on pets , was , of course , symbiotically aligned with the broader animal - rights movement , which also grew in the nineteen - nineties .
But the theme remained the same — to extend the rights of humans to animals .
In a country where most people eat meat , many hunt , and most others give little thought to the legal rights of their pets , the complexities of such a change are considerable .
Even pro-animal - rights scholars , like Peter Singer , a professor at Princeton , recognize the difficulties .
As Singer said at a recent conference in New York City , “ We ’re talking about beings as different as chimpanzees , pigs , chickens , fish , oysters , and others , and you must recognize those differences . ”
For the moment , the goals of the movement are modest , and largely limited to domestic animals .
“ What the law is doing is catching up with the idea that people do n’t consider their pets property , in the way a car or a chair is , ” Hoffman told me .
“ I am not pumping for my cats to be able to vote for McCain or Obama .
I ’m not saying they could visit me at the hospital , though that ’s probably a pretty good idea .
The right category for pets is closer to children , who ca n’t vote , and ca n’t own property , but you ca n’t inflict pain on them , either .
The law is catching up with societal beliefs . ”
“ Leona had never had a dog before she got Trouble , ” Elaine Silverstein , a co-founder of the Miami agency that created the “ queen ” advertisements for the Helmsley hotels , told me .
“ She treated her like a person , and took her everywhere .
She would take that dog to bed with her every night . ”
After Helmsley ’s release from prison , she returned for a time to her hotels ’ ads , but for one campaign she insisted that Silverstein feature Trouble instead .
The ad showed the tiny white dog perched on a red velvet chair , and text that said , “ ‘ Trouble , ’ the Helmsley ’s favorite four - legged guest , ” recommends that you call for reservations .
“ It did n’t make much sense for a dog to endorse a hotel , but that ’s what Leona wanted , ” Silverstein said .
Still , Helmsley ’s relationship with dogs reflected some of the distemper of her dealings with humans .
According to Silverstein , one of Helmsley ’s friends , seeing how much she loved Trouble , gave her another Maltese , who was named Double Trouble .
“ But Leona never liked that dog , so she got rid of it , ” Silverstein said .
“ That was usually Leona ’s solution .
It was what she did with people . ”
For all Helmsley ’s love of Trouble , her will certainly made life complicated for the dog .
She stipulated that Trouble , when her time came , join Leona , Harry , and Jay in the family mausoleum .
( Leona also established a three - million - dollar trust for the “ perpetual care and maintenance ” of the mausoleum , directing that it be “ acid washed or steam cleaned at least once a year . ” )
According to Carlisle , however , a joint human - canine burial is not possible at Sleepy Hollow .
“ Under New York law , animals ca n’t be buried in human cemeteries , ” she said .
“ Leona could possibly be buried in a pet cemetery with Trouble , but not the other way around .
That was an error in the drafting of the will . ”
( Trouble is still alive , so it ’s not clear where she will be buried . )
The twelve - million - dollar trust for Trouble also created problems .
The will stated that custody of Trouble should go to Rosenthal , Leona ’s brother , or to her grandson David , and the trust agreement directed them to “ provide for the care , welfare and comfort of Trouble at the highest standard . ”
But neither man wanted the dog .
After the will was made public , Trouble received death threats , which may have had something to do with their refusal .
( Both men declined to comment . )
So the trustees had to find the dog a home .
Moreover , the bequest to Trouble was so self - evidently excessive for a single , aging dog that the trustees decided to take steps to reduce it .
As a guardian for Trouble , the trustees settled on Carl Lekic , who is the general manager of the Helmsley Sandcastle Hotel , in Sarasota , Florida .
According to his affidavit in the case , Lekic had known
Trouble since she was born , because Leona spent several months a year , late in life , at the hotel .
“ When I visited New York on business while Mrs. Helmsley was alive , I would also see Trouble and would pay attention to and play with her , ” Lekic said .
The trustees agreed to pay him five thousand dollars a month to take care of Trouble .
Lekic estimated annual security costs for the dog of a hundred thousand dollars , grooming costs of eight thousand dollars , food costs of twelve hundred dollars , and veterinary care of up to eighteen thousand dollars .
But how many years would Trouble likely live ?
To answer this question , the trustees sought an affidavit from Dr. E. F. Thomas , Jr. , Trouble ’s veterinarian .
Trouble was nine years old in early 2008 and had , according to Thomas , “ several ongoing medical problems , ” including hypothyroidism and compromised kidney function .
In the light of her medical issues , and the patterns of Maltese generally , Thomas estimated that Trouble was likely to live only three to five more years .
In all , then , Lekic and the trustees concluded , only two million dollars of the trust ’s principal would suffice to cover all of Trouble ’s needs .
On April 30 , 2008 , Judge Renee Roth , the New York surrogate who is supervising the Helmsley will , approved the reduction of ten million dollars in the trust .
( If there is any leftover money in Trouble ’s trust following her demise , it goes to the Helmsley charitable trust . )

fans who have been getting their fix via the PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box are in for a shock :
The updates coming to the PC and Xbox 360 versions of TF2 wo n't be landing on Sony 's console , reports 1up .
Additionally , the monolithic console is unlikely to ever see any updates from Valve .
" We do n't have PlayStation developers , " said Valve marketing head Doug Lombardi .
" They 're not doing ongoing development on The Orange Box for the PS3 . "
It does n't seem to be a matter of disdain for the PlayStation 3 , so much as a lack of resources that 's preventing Valve from showing Sony 's console the same affection they offer to Microsoft's .
When asked about the Xbox 360 exclusive zombie shooter Left 4 Dead , Valve founder Gabe Newell told 1 up that the decision to make the game an exclusive came down to a matter of not having the " bandwidth " to port the title .
" For The Orange Box , EA did the PS3 version .
They 're interested in getting a PS3 version done .
We just have to figure out where the resources can come from .
We do n't have the bandwidth .
We 're doing the
360 and PC version ourselves , " Newell said , adding that he would like to craft a PS3 version , but that will only be possible as their " bandwidth allows . "

Team Fortress 2 Updates Not Coming For PlayStation 3 [ 1up ]
Mr. Bush will spend Saturday as the host of an extraordinary emergency meeting of international finance ministers at the White House .
For him , the economic turmoil is the financial equivalent of 9/11  a bookend to a presidency that has grappled with challenges brought on by terrorists , Mother Nature and two long - running wars .
No longer will Iraq be the sole determinant of the Bush legacy ; now the president ’s fate is tied up in the economy as much as the war .
Mr. Bush has always been confident of himself , even when the American public was not , and that has not changed .
Just as he is convinced he did the right thing in Iraq , he is convinced he is doing the right thing on the economy  despite job approval ratings at historic lows and a presidential campaign in which both candidates have used him as kind of a battering ram .
“ He seems burdened , and he seems confident , ” said David Guernsey , the owner of Guernsey Office Products , who hosted the Chantilly , Va. , session .
“ He seems sort of like a guy who ’s saying , ‘ Boy , I ’m kind of winding this thing down and now this happens , so the next four months are going to be anything but quiet . ’
But he seemed very confident that what Bernanke and Paulson and that crowd have put together is the fix . ”
Even if burdened , he also has the lightness of a man who knows the burden will soon be lifted .
At a closed - door fund - raiser in St. Louis last Friday night , Mr. Bush was humorous and relaxed , said John C. Danforth , the former senator from Missouri , who was there .
The president sounded a note about “ tough times , ” in reference to the economy , and “ seemed relieved ” that his presidency was nearly over , Mr. Danforth said .
“ It was very unusual , I thought , ” Mr. Danforth said .
“ I think it was a man who was relaxed and funny and looked as though he was about to shed this burden of the presidency .
In a way , his speech seemed kind of like a valedictory .
I took it as though , ‘ I ’ve done the best I can , I think I made the right decisions and now it ’s almost over . ’ ”
McCain is desperate , desperate to convince everyone that Pennsylvania is in play .
We saw from the Ashley Todd hoax that the McCain crew in Pennsylvania will try anything .
You ’d think they ’d have learned something from Ms. Todd .
But , it ’s getting even worse .
The Pennsylvania Republicans sent out a viciously nasty e-mail to Jewish voters .
Knowing the McCain campaign modus operandi , the disavowal rings hollow .
Really hollow :
Pennsylvania Republicans are disavowing an e-mail sent to Jewish voters that likens a vote for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to events that led up to the Holocaust .
” Jewish Americans cannot afford to make the wrong decision on Tuesday , November 4th , 2008 , ” the e-mail reads .
” Many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s and made a tragic mistake .
Let ’s not make a similar one this year ! ”
A copy of the e-mail , provided by Democratic officials , says it was ” Paid for by the Republican Federal Committee of PA – Victory 2008 . ”
It warns ” Fellow Jewish Voters ” of the danger of a second Holocaust due to the threats to Israel from its neighbors and touts Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s qualifications over those of Obama .
How low can they go ?
That ’s the question for the next 10 days .
It ’s going to get even worse .
These people are despicable .
The fall guy claims the e-mail was , in fact , authorized :
Political consultant Bryan Rudnick was identified as the person responsible for it .
Rudnick , reached Saturday night , confirmed that he no longer works for the party , which employed him a few weeks ago as a consultant to do outreach to Jewish voters .
” I had authorization from party officials ” to send the e-mail , Rudnick said , but he declined to say who had signed off on it .
” I ’m not looking to drag anyone else through the mud , so I ’m not naming names right now , ” he said .
Yeah , it ’s okay to lie and smear Obama , but protect your fellow Republicans .
What a slimy bunch .
Sarah Palin , Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President of the United States of America , will be the guest of the St. Louis Blues on Friday , Oct. 24 , when she will drop a ceremonial pregame “ first puck ” prior to the Blues ’ game vs. the Los Angeles Kings Palin today confirmed that she will make the stop at Scottrade Center in St. Louis following a previous visit to Springfield , Mo. , during her campaign trail in the state of Missouri .
Additional details will be announced on Thursday , Oct. 23 .

When you called me so unexpectedly at 6:00 last night , I was expecting a call from my sister and brother - in - law .
I tried to explain to you that there were steaks on the grill and I had guests coming for dinner , so I really was n't in a position to talk to you about a time - share in Vegas .
You persisted .
I am not the rude type , so I continued to indulge you rather than hanging up the telephone in your ear .
I figure that probably happens quite often and you were only doing your job .
However , I think we had a real misunderstanding and I 'd like to set the record straight here .
When I asked you what you were wearing you became very defensive .
I am in sales myself and I am required to wear a suit and tie to work every , single day .
I simply wanted to make sure you were prepared to make a good first impression .
When I asked you what type of panties you were wearing it was because I wanted to make sure I was dealing with a " normal " person and not a pervert .
Asking you if you were masturbating when you spoke with customers was my way of checking your professionalism .
When you started making claims of sexual harassment , I was flabbergasted .
There was really no need to call me names .
I was also appalled that you had the audacity to hang up on me !
Need I remind you that YOU called me ?
The least you could have done is to have been grateful that I took the time to speak to you in spite of the fact my steaks were burning .
As for the Vegas time - shares , I am very interested .
How about you come over to my place , bring a couple of steaks to grill ( as you kind of owe me a few steaks anyway ) , and we can talk more .
Storage is becoming cheaper and cheaper : you can find hard drives that cost less than a dollar per GiB .
Buying an external hard drive to make backups ( or even having a backup server ) is a must if you value your work and what you have stored in your computer .
However , doing backups should be easy enough to be done on a regular basis .
The more automated , the better .
So , I find no excuse not to do regular backups and looked for a tool easy - to - use but powerful .
rdiff - backup is a python script that helps doing local and remote incremental backups .
To backup your $ HOME to an external hard drive mounted in / media / backup simply do :
$ rdiff - backup $ HOME / media/ backup/home_backup
If after some days you want to backup your new files , run the same command to update the backup .
Now , in / media / backup / home_backup you have an exact copy of your home as it was when you did the last backup .
If you want to restore a directory , you can just copy it :
$ cp -a /media/backup/home_backup/src/myprogram ~/src/
Which is equivalent to :
$ rdiff - backup -- restore - as - of now / media / backup/home_backup/src/myprogram ~/src/
Of course , you can restore previous versions of the file .
For example , to restore the source of myprogram as it was a mounth ago :
$ rdiff - backup -- restore - as - of 1M /media/backup/home_backup/src/myprogram
~/src/
You can see all the incremental backups you have done executing :
$ rdiff - backup -- list - increments / media/backup/home_backup
If you run out of space in your backup device and you ’re sure you do n’t need the backups you made three years ago , you can remove them with :
$ rdiff - backup -- remove - older - than 3Y / media/ backup/home_backup
rdiff - backup works exactly the same with remote directories .
You need to have ssh access and rdiff - backup must be installed in the remote (s ) machine(s ) .
Note that in any example above , you can change the local directories to remote ones , so you can backup a remote machine locally , or do a backup of this machine to a remote backup - server .
For example , say backup .
mysite.org is your backup server .
You can backup regularly using :
$ rdiff - backup local - dir / user@backup.mysite.org ::/remote-dir
If you use RSA or DSA authentication , you can even put that in a cron job .
See rdiff - backup documentation and other examples to discover all the functionality of this package .

Conclusions
Pros :
Easy to use .
Now there ’s no excuse not to do backups !
Works from the command line , so you can easily put it in a script or cron job .
Simple recovery from last snapshot , you can use standard tools like cp or find .
Cons :
Not having a GUI may scare some users .
It stores the last snapshot uncompressed , so depending on what you are backing up , it can be very space consuming .
Older snapshots are compressed , which makes this con a not - so - con ;-) .
What do you put on your sweet potato fries ?
At Hubcab Grill in downtown Houston , my friend gets extra mayo to dip his in .
At Beechwood American Bistro in Venice , California , they come with aioli .
Other L.A. restaurants serve them with chipotle mayo , horseradish mayo and
.
At Silver K Café in Johnson City , Texas , customers dip them in ranch dressing .
( Along with everything else on the table . )
“ Sweet - potato fries have spread through Seattle like an epidemic , ” wrote Anna Roth in the Seattle Weekly ’s 2008 Best of Seattle issue .
“ No matter how great regular fries seemed before , one bite of the exciting new tuber 's sweet taste and firmer texture makes old spuds seem pedestrian and ordinary . ”
The exciting new tuber ?
Is she talking about the same sweet potato that was domesticated in South America 5,000 years ago ?
Maybe she meant that frying sweet potatoes was new ?
Okay , so George Washington Carver published a recipe for sweet potato fries ( among many other sweet potato recipes ) back in the 1930s , while he was at Tuskegee University in Alabama .
How are they supposed to know about that in Seattle - - or Canada ?
" Sweet potato fries are ruining my life , ” wrote Rebecca Eckler in Canada ’s National Post back in August .
“ Never before have I felt so much pressure to like something .
Every conversation , during every dining experience I have had lately , ends up in a discussion of sweet potato fries .
Summer used to be the season of patios .
Now it 's the season of the sweet potato fry .
The conversations always go something like this :
" ‘ You have to try the sweet potato fries here .
They are amazing !’ a friend will say as we look at menus .
" ‘ Yeah , I do n't really like sweet potato fries , ’ I 'll answer .
" ‘ What ?!
You do n't like sweet potato fries ?
How could you not like sweet potato fries ?!
What is wrong with you ? ’ she or he will say , as if I just said I do n't like puppies .
" The conversation ends with me apologizing profusely ... for not liking orange fried sticks in a basket .
" ‘ I 'm sorry , ’ I 'll say .
‘ I just do n't like them .
I 'm really sorry .
Can we please change the subject ? ’
" It 's at the point where I almost feel like asking for forgiveness .
I feel like I 've personally hurt their feelings by not liking sweet potato fries .
Which I think I have . "
Salt Lake magazine ’s snooty
On the Table blog declares the sweet potato fry fad must already be over because a local fast food joint called Arctic Circle is serving them .
( I guess they were considered fine dining fare until the Utah hamburger heathens got their hands on them . )
Arctic Circle serves their sweet potato fries with the locally popular mayo - ketchup mixture known as “ fry sauce , ” though the blogger insists on the superior acidity of ketchup .
Blue cheese dressing would be my idea of the perfect dip .

ABSTRACT
Googling for “ SQL injection ” gets about 4 million hits .
The topic excites interest and superstitious fear .
This whitepaper dymystifies the topic and explains a straightforward approach to writing database PL / SQL programs that provably guarantees their immunity to SQL injection .
Only when a PL / SQL subprogram executes SQL that it creates at run time is there a risk of SQL injection ; and you ’ll see that it ’s easier than you might think to freeze the SQL at PL / SQL compile time .
Then you ’ll understand that you need the rules which prevent the risk only for the rare scenarios that do require run-time - created SQL .
It turns out that these rules are simple to state and easy to follow .
1. McCarthy's , Fethard , Co Tipperary
Fethard ( pronounced " Feathered " ) stands in the middle of a beautiful , undulating plain of smoky mountains and wet roads , co-ops and creameries , ruined monasteries and lean racetracks .
By day , the banter in McCarthy 's is dominated by the conundrums of the dairy industry and the cryptic world of horse racing .
The pub is the spiritual home of the Coolmore Stud , the most successful thoroughbred stud in the world .
McCarthy 's possesses a dark and inviting interior , its tobacco - stained walls smothered by images of men clutching trophies , well - toned horses in mid-flight , revolutionaries at play , the Bloody Sunday football team .
Rattan stools wait along a counter of solid oak that runs the length of the right - hand wall , broken midway by an arch .
McCarthy 's has a catchphrase : " We wine you , dine you and bury you . "
Sure enough , the pub offers both an upmarket restaurant and an acclaimed undertaker service .

2. EJ Morrissey's , Abbeyleix , Co Laois
In more carefree times , there was an unofficial commandment that stated : " Thou shall not drive through Abbeyleix without pausing in Morrissey 's for a pint . "
Considering Abbeyleix 's beguiling location on the main Dublin - Cork road , this law firmly established the premises as an institution of major importance .
The pub is effectively a large wooden cavern , softly lit by lamps that hang from a ceiling held up by metal beams .
The room is loosely carved into a warren of snugs and seating areas by dint of wooden partitions and stand - alone walls seemingly crafted from old biscuit tin lids and dismantled clocks .
The legendary charm of Morrissey 's undoubtedly hails from the incredible collection of old - world goods on display on its dark shelf - lined walls .
These shelves are packed with the sort of products that would have abounded in a village grocery half a century ago : huge jars of sweets , an old slicing machine , Boyne Valley cornflakes and Morrissey 's own Famous Tea , right beside the scales on which the packs were weighed .

Ger Clancy is a passionate fan of the old - style Irish bar .
As such , he and his wife Breda have done much to bring the pub back to its original Edwardian state .
Clancy's is considered one of the great music pubs of eastern Ireland .
Every Thursday night , somewhere between 12 and 15 musicians now congregate here .
They play fiddles , bodhráns , flutes and mandolins , and sing songs about long - gone tyrants , rising moons and rose - peppered valleys .
The tobacco - stained walls are pasted with scores from songbooks , classical and traditional .
The audience sways upon scruffy benches and assorted chairs , tapping their heels on the wide - plank floor and allowing their voices to join in with the repetition of each rousing chorus .

Nearly 300 years after it was founded , Kelly 's manages to find its feet somewhere between everyman drinking pub , political meeting place and historic museum .
Folk music is a regular fare at weekends .
As the pints and shorts slide across the bar , so the session players gather momentum by a roaring turf fire , a riot of button accordions , banjos , bodhráns , tin whistles , concertinas , flutes and fiddles .
Between the reels , the Irish language is heard throughout the bar , used by staff and customers alike .
If you 're hungry by day , you might get lucky with a bowl of Irish stew , champ and sausages or an Ulster fry .

Why do so many people hold beliefs that are clearly false ?
A recent story on ABCNews.com said 80 million Americans believe we have been visited by aliens from another planet , and numerous studies show that millions of people believe in ghosts , extrasensory perception and , of course , alien abductions .
According to biologist Lewis Wolpert of University College , London , all those beliefs are clearly false , and they all share a common beginning .
It may well have started when the first human realized he , or she , could make a fire by rubbing two sticks together .
Wolpert is the author of a new provocative book exploring the evolutionary origins of belief , called " Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast . "
The title comes from Lewis Carroll 's classic " Through the Looking Glass , " when Alice tells the White Queen that she cannot believe in impossible things .
" I dare say you have n't had much practice , " the Queen replied .
" When I was your age , I always did it for half - an - hour a day .
Why , sometimes I 've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . "
Wolpert argues that our wide range of beliefs , some of which are clearly false , grew out of a uniquely human trait .
Alone in the animal world , humans understand cause and effect , and that , he says , led ultimately to the invention of tools , the rapid rise of sophisticated technology , and of course , beliefs .
Even the earliest humans understood that many events that shaped their lives resulted from specific causes .
Therefore , there must be a cause behind every event .
Searching for that cause , Wolpert says , led to the rise of religion because surely there must be some purpose behind all this , some ultimate cause at work in the universe .
Wolpert is an atheist , but he says he is n't trying to convert anyone to atheism .
If so , he may be the only person on the planet who is willing to share his deeply held beliefs without caring whether he can convince anyone to believe the same way .
But his basic premise is sound .
We all know other people , not ourselves of course , who hold some beliefs that are absurd , or at least grossly lacking in evidence .
Why ?
It all goes back to that first character who rubbed two sticks together .
No other animal has the mental framework for understanding cause and effect , Wolpert says .
Chimps , apes and those famously clever New Caledonia crows come close , but they are n't there yet .
Once humans reached that point , they turned a corner that ultimately shaped what we are today .
Some animals have used various things as tools , but only humans have put at least two different materials together to fabricate a tool for a specific purpose , and then go on to discover other uses for that same tool .
Those first discoveries gave humans an edge on the competition , allowing the species to thrive .
But along the way things happened , some good and some bad .
The effort to understand why bad things happen to good people , and so on , gave rise to what Wolpert and others call the " belief engine " in the brain .
We want to believe there is a reason for it all , and that leaves us predisposed to believe in some things for which there is little or no evidence .
If a certain belief makes sense out of an otherwise senseless event , then it must be true , right ?
Wolpert argues that even false beliefs can serve a useful purpose .
He concedes that religion , which he regards as false , has a purpose and has played a role in the evolutionary processes .
People tend to look out for people of like faith , as in churches , and that support can make them stronger , thus improving the chances that they will live long enough to see their genes passed along .
If Wolpert 's compelling argument is right , does that mean we have no control over what we believe ?
He says he was a very religious child , but became an atheist at the age of 16 because he no longer believed in religion .
But could it be that his own " belief engine " made the decision for him ?
Ever since Sigmund Freud dug into the secrets of the subconscious , many psychologists have argued that many of our beliefs are beyond our control because they are shaped by unknown secrets buried inside the brain .
But if that 's true , how do psychologists escape their own scenario ?
Would n't they be just as likely to be deluded as the rest of us ?
Similarly , many biologists think the complex organism between our ears is driven entirely by biology .
But if we all have a biologically based " belief system , " are n't we all -- even biologists -- victims of false beliefs ?
As Wolpert concedes , maybe people just believe what they want to believe .
None of us approach complex issues , like whether or not to believe in a specific religion , or even a political candidate , with a clean slate .
How else can you explain 80 million Americans who believe we 've been visited by aliens ?
Surely , if aliens invested the enormous costs of interstellar travel and came our way , they must have had a reason .
Would n't they drop by the White House instead of a desert in New Mexico or Texas ?
Would there really be any confusion if they had , indeed , visited Earth ?
The late astronomer Carl Sagan had a wonderful formula for measuring the truthfulness of any belief .
Extraordinary claims , he said , demand extraordinary evidence .
The fact that so many are willing to believe so many impossible things with so little evidence is not comforting .
First , Tao Shoulong burned his company ’s financial books .
He then sold his private golf club memberships and disposed of his Mercedes S -600 sedan .
And then he was gone .
And just like that , China ’s biggest textile dye operation -- with four factories , a campus the size of 31 football fields , 4,000 workers and debts of at least $ 200 million -- was history .
“ We ’re pretty much dead now , ” said Mao Youming , one of 300 suppliers stiffed last month by Tao ’s company , Jianglong Group .
Lighting a cigarette in a coffee shop here , the 38 - year - old spoke calmly about the bleak future of his industrial gas business .
Tao owed him $ 850,000 , Mao said , about 60 % of his annual revenue .
“ We can not pay our workers ’ salaries .
We are about to be bankrupt too . ”

Government statistics show that 67,000 factories of various sizes were shuttered in China in the first half of the year , said Cao Jianhai , an industrial economics researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
By year ’s end , he said , more than 100,000 plants will have closed .
As more factories in China shut down , stories of bosses running away have become familiar , multiplying the damage of China ’s worst manufacturing decline in at least a decade .
Even before the global financial crisis , factory owners in China were straining under soaring labor and raw - material costs , an appreciating Chinese currency and tougher legal , tax and environmental requirements .
When the credit crunch took hold -- prompting Western businesses to slash orders for Chinese goods and bankers to curtail loans to factories -- many operations were pushed over the edge .

China ’s engine slows
China ’s industrial decline is a main factor in the sharp economic slowdown of late .
The nation ’s gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 9 % in the third quarter , the lowest in five years and worse than what analysts had forecast .
China ’s GDP expanded 11.9 % last year .
Now , economists worry that the one big remaining engine of global growth is rapidly losing steam .
Chinese leaders are trying to maintain stable and fast growth to control rising joblessness and the risk of political and social turmoil .
Last month , Beijing increased tax rebates for many exported goods and pledged to take other steps to spur development , including prodding banks to boost lending to small companies .
But many businesses and analysts are not optimistic .
“ Honestly , I think whatever measures government would take at the current stage would not turn around this trend , ” said Ye Hang , an economics professor at Zhejiang University .
“ The government can only try its best to put out a fire here and there . ”

In recent weeks , there have been many fires , increasingly large - scale .
In Zhejiang province , south of Shanghai , Ye counted at least six major bankruptcies , including Jianglong ; Feiyue Group , China ’s biggest sewing machine maker ; and Zhejiang Yixin Pharmaceutical Co. , among the largest in that industry .
“ Of these six , one [ owner ] committed suicide , one was detained by police , and the remaining four all escaped , ” he said .
“ I can imagine that in the future , there would be more such cases as a result of the chain reaction . ”
The wave of factory closings began in Guangdong province , where the nation ’s economic reforms were launched three decades ago .
The region accounts for about 30 % of China ’s exports , but over the last couple of years , Shenzhen , Dongguan and other cities in the area have sought to clean up the environment and create an economy based more on services and higher - value products .
Makers of labor - intensive goods such as shoes , garments and furniture no longer felt welcome .
Advertisement
By the official numbers , Chinese exports remained brisk through September , except for a few categories such as apparel , which fell 3 % in September from the same month in 2007 .
But many exporters are n’t making a profit , and others are seeing shrinking orders or are starving for cash .
Newspapers in Hong Kong , which is close to Guangdong , have been running virtually daily reports of the latest factory to falter .
“ Do n’t even mention the U.S. market , ” grumbled Zhong Shijun , general manager of Foshan City Golden Furniture Co . “ Even our EU market is dropping seriously in the last two months because the euro is depreciating . ”
Toy makers are among the hardest hit .
More than 3,600 such factories have closed -- about half the industry ’s total , government figures show .
Most were small operations , but last month Smart Union Group ’s three huge factories stopped production , leaving more than 8,700 workers jobless .
After workers protested in the streets , Guangdong ’s government said it would cover $ 4 million in back wages and help them find jobs .
But many others have no one to help them .
Migrant workers generally do n’t qualify for unemployment benefits , and although China ’s bankruptcy laws give unpaid workers priority , that ’s of little value if owners run away and there are few corporate assets .

Left without wages
Yang Shenggang , 33 , had been at a Shenzhen shoe factory for seven years , working his way up from the assembly line , making $ 50 a month , to become a supervisor earning six times that amount .
This spring , he said , the Hong Kong owner fell behind in paying wages .
One morning in September , the plant abruptly closed .

“ The boss was just gone , ” Yang said .
“ I have to get my five months ’ salary back .
My family needs money to eat and live . ”
Stanley Lau , deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries , a trade group with 3,000 members , said he did n’t know how many owners in Hong Kong had run away .
“ I think it ’s wrong , ” Lau said .
But he added :
If a factory operator went by the book , it could take two years to close a shop because of regulations and red tape .
Others may flee not out of aversion to bureaucracy but because they want to get away with what cash they have left and not face angry suppliers , lenders , employees or regulators .
Sometimes relatives and managers who help run operations flee too , and without anyone who can take responsibility , some factories have little choice but to shut down .

Lau ’s trade group has estimated that as many as 15 % of the 70,000 factories run by Hong Kong businesspeople in the mainland will close this year .
He says many more are likely to shut after Chinese New Year in February , when millions of migrant laborers will return home for several days .
“ Once workers go home , they can close down the factory quietly , ” he said in an interview in Hong Kong .
Taiwanese operate about 20,000 plants in Guangdong , and some of them also have walked away from their factories , workers and labor groups say .
In northern China ’s Shandong province , dozens of South Korean export company managers have fled , according to state - run media reports .
“ If these laid - off migrant workers stay in the city , it might cause social problems in the urban areas , ” said Cao , the Chinese academy economist .
“ But if they go back to their hometown , they wo n’t have enough to do to make money . ”

Few were bigger than Jianglong , which is Chinese for “ River dragon . ”
The company posted sales of about $ 110 million and a profit of $ 14 million last year , according to its annual report .
Its owner , Tao , boasted of the company ’s sophisticated research and development capabilities and a base of global customers that included Wal - Mart .

Tao , a balding man with thick bags under his eyes , was a mystery to most workers and suppliers .
He and his wife arrived in Shaoxing earlier in the decade , opening a four - person trading firm catering to Middle Eastern buyers , said people from Tao ’s hometown in neighboring Jiangsu province .
By 2004 , he was exporting $ 2.5 million of goods , and two years later , after listing the company on Singapore ’s stock exchange under the name China Printing & Dyeing Holding Ltd. , Tao bought two companies and built a massive factory outfitted with Japanese and Italian equipment .
This year , as he began to miss or delay payments to suppliers , Tao told them he would soon be raising tens of millions of dollars by listing the company on the Nasdaq Stock Market .
But Tao ’s plans were foiled by the global financial crisis and the sudden turn of fortunes for exporters , according to suppliers , many of whom fault the local government for supporting Tao and continuing to assure them and employees that the company ’s listing on Nasdaq was on track .
Government officials said last week that Tao and his wife had been caught , but they refused to comment further .
“ It ’s very hard for me to analyze why or how it had this problem , ” said Jin Agen , vice director of Shaoxing ’s Publicity Department .

On the day Jianglong was shut down , 2,000 workers jammed the streets outside the factory , blocking traffic and demanding answers .
Several hundred police officers scuffled with workers .
Later that day , government officials agreed to pay employees .
“ I ’ll go home and farm , ” said Yang Chaoxian , 43 , who had earned about $ 260 a month working 12 hours a day , seven days a week .
“ Labor here is too hard , ” said the Chongqing native , a cigarette tucked behind his ear .
“ After I leave , I do n’t ever want to come back . ”

In one of the numbers from “ Fiddler on the Roof , ” Tevye sings , with a mixture of emotions : “ We have n’t got the man ... we had when we began . ”
Back in January when Barack Obama pulled off his stunning win in the Iowa caucuses , and people were lining up in the cold and snow for hours just to get a glimpse of him , there was a wide and growing belief  encouraged to the max by the candidate  that something new in American politics had arrived .
His brilliant , nationally televised victory speech in Des Moines sent a shiver of hope through much of the electorate .
“ The time has come for a president who will be honest about the choices and the challenges we face , ” said Senator Obama , “ who will listen to you and learn from you , even when we disagree , who wo n’t just tell you what you want to hear , but what you need to know . ”
Only an idiot would think or hope that a politician going through the crucible of a presidential campaign could hold fast to every position , steer clear of the stumbling blocks of nuance and never make a mistake .
But Barack Obama went out of his way to create the impression that he was a new kind of political leader  more honest , less cynical and less relentlessly calculating than most .
Barbara West vs Joe Biden Interview VIDEO
of WFTV Channel 9 in Orlando had what was billed as a ' One on One ' interview with Senatoron Thursdaythat did n't sit well with the Democratic VP nominee .
Several times during the course of the question and answer session , Biden remarked , " I do n't know who is writing your questions . "
Biden was so hot about the four minute grilling that he promptly canceled a planned interview that station had arranged with Jill Biden .
When the Orlando Sentinel questioned the Obama campaign , they cited what they felt was an unprofessional interview by Barbara West .
They used words like ' combative ' and ' woefully uninformed ' to portray West .
West responded by saying : " I think I asked him some pointed questions .... I do n't think I was rude or inconsiderate to him . "
Check out the video below .
The questions were definitely tough and Biden appeared to handle himself well , though you could sense his exasperation .

NILIN --
The window through which Salam Amira , 16 , filmed the moment when an Israeli soldier shot from close range a handcuffed and blindfolded Palestinian detainee has a large hole at its centre with cracks running in every direction .
“ Since my video was shown , the soldiers shoot at our house all the time , ” she said .
The shattered and cracked windows at the front of the building confirm her story .
“ When we leave the windows open , they fire tear gas inside too .
” Her home looks out over the Israeli road block guarding the only entrance to the village of Nilin , located just inside the West Bank midway between Jerusalem ( Beit - ul - Moqaddas ) and Tel Aviv .
It was here that a bound Ashraf Abu Rahma , 27 , was shot in the foot in July with a rubber bullet under orders from an Israeli regiment commander .
The treatment of the family stands in stark contrast to the leniency shown to the soldier and his commander involved in that incident .
B’ Tselem , an Israeli human rights group , has accused the Israeli army of seeking “ revenge ” for the girl ’s role in exposing the actions of its armed forces in the West Bank .
It may also be hoping to dissuade other families from airing similar evidence of army brutality , particularly since B’Tselem began distributing dozens of video cameras to Palestinians across the West Bank .
Scenes captured on film of hooded settlers attacking Palestinian farmers near Hebron came as a shock to many early this summer .
The village of Nilin has been the focus of the Israeli army ’s actions since May , when its 4,700 inhabitants began a campaign of mainly non-violent demonstrations to halt the building of Israel ’s separation wall across their land .
After the wall is completed , the village will be cut off from 40 percent of its remaining farmland , effectively annexing it to half a dozen large Jewish settlements that encircle Nilin .
The settlements are all illegal under international law .
Several times a week the villagers , joined by small numbers of Israeli and international supporters , congregate in olive fields where bulldozers are tearing up the land to make way for the wall .
The people of Nilin have tried various non-violent forms of protest , including praying in the path of the heavy machinery , using mirrors to reflect sunlight at the construction workers , banging pots and pans , and placing rocks in the way of the bulldozers during the night .
The army has responded with tear gas and stun grenades , as well as on occasion , with rubber - coated steel bullets and live ammunition .
Last month it was reported that Israel was also experimenting with a new crowd dispersal method called “ skunk ” , which involves firing a foul - smelling liquid at demonstrators .
In the past few weeks , two youngsters have been shot dead by the army , including one , Ahmed Moussa , who was 10 .
The army claimed he was throwing stones .
An autopsy showed he was hit in the head by a bullet from an M - 16 rifle .
This week a soldier fired from close range three rubber bullets at Awad Surur , a mentally disabled man , as he tried to prevent his brother from being arrested .
Two bullets penetrated his skull , according to B’Tselem , which denounced the army as increasingly “ trigger - happy ” and “ reckless ” .
Salam ’s family , like many other villagers , bear the injuries from attendance at protests .
Most of her five brothers have been hit by rubber bullets , as has her father , Jamal Amira , 53 .
The army has sealed the village off on several occasions and , according to villagers , beaten and terrorized inhabitants .
Mr. Amira is among at least 100 farmers whose livelihoods will be devastated by the wall .
He will lose all 14 hectares of his land , fields on which his ancestors have made their living by growing olives , cucumbers , aubergine and tomatoes .
But Salam ’s five - minute film of the roadblock incident , taken during a four - day curfew imposed on the village , has only intensified the family ’s troubles .
Three days after the video was aired , the army arrested her father during a peaceful protest .
He was the only one seized after the army claimed the demonstrators had entered a closed military zone .
Mr. Amira was also charged with assaulting a soldier .
He was held for three and a half weeks before an Israeli military judge rejected the army ’s demand that he be remanded for a further three months until his trial .
In an almost unprecedented rebuke to the prosecution , the judge questioned the army ’s case , saying he could see no evidence of an assault .
He also asked why Salam ’s father was singled out from all of those protesting .
Mr. Amira ’s lawyer , Gabi Laski , said the decision confirmed “ our preliminary claim that the arrest was out of vengeance and punishment for the video filmed by the girl ” .
Nonetheless , Mr. Amira still faces a military trial .
A report last year by Yesh Din , a human rights group , found that in only 0.25 percent of cases heard by military tribunals was the defendant found innocent .
Even if acquitted , Mr. Amira is expected to face legal costs amounting to nearly US $ 10,000 ( Dh36,700 ) , a sum the family says it cannot pay .
In contrast , the two soldiers responsible for the shooting of the detainee at the roadblock have been reprimanded with the minor charge of “ unbecoming conduct ” .
Neither will stand criminal trial .
B’Tselem has called the decision “ shameful ” .
According to the legal group the Association of Civil Rights in Israel , the punishment under Israeli law for aggravated abuse of a detainee is seven years imprisonment .
ACRI ’s lawyers have submitted a petition arguing the lenient charge “ transmits to officers and other soldiers an extremely grave message of contempt for human life ” .
Lt Col Omri Borberg , the commander who gave the order to shoot Abu Rahma , resigned his post but was immediately moved sideways to a senior post in a different unit .
In a show of support , Gabi Ashkenazi , the head of the army , said Lt Col Borberg may be reinstated to a command position .
Meanwhile , the villagers said the army ’s behavior would not dissuade them from protesting or cause them to renounce their commitment to non-violence .
Salah Hawaja , a protest organizer , said : “ When we started our demonstrations , maybe 50 soldiers showed up .
Now there are hundreds stationed permanently around us .
Israel is treating us like a major war zone , even though we are using non-violence .
“ The people of Nilin have accepted that the best strategy to stop Israel ’s plans to steal our land and leave us inside a ghetto is non-violence , ” said Mr. Hawaja .
“ We need to show the world who is the occupier and who the occupied .
Israel understands how threatening this is , which is why it is using so much force against us .
” A fund has been established to help the Amira family .

' My bones are like glass ' : Why Bond Girl Ursula Andress blames herself for becoming ravaged by osteoporosis
As a Bond girl , she became an iconic beauty .
But as Ursula Andress reveals for the first time , she 's now ravaged by osteoporosis which could leave her crippled .
What 's more , she admits it 's all her own fault ...
To many , Ursula Andress is the ultimate Bond girl - the shot of her emerging from the sea in a white bikini in Dr No has become an iconic image .
Now aged 72 , she is still beautiful and her figure remains trim .
For despite a passion for good food , she still regularly skis , swims and thinks nothing of walking miles each day .
But she does n't know how much longer this will be possible .
For the past eight years Ursula has suffered from osteoporosis .
Iconic : Ursula Andress emerges from the sea in the 1962 film Dr No .
But she has now revealed that she has become ravaged by osteoporosis
For a long time she refused to acknowledge the severity of her condition and did n't take any preventative action , not realising the risks .
Fragile
Then she discovered her hips are so fragile they could easily break - news that has come as a huge shock .
' I do n't want to become a crippled old lady , bent double , who can only shuffle along .
There would be no point for me , ' she says , talking for the first time about her condition .
' If I can not be active , I would rather die .
I could not cope without full mobility .
My life would be over .
' My doctor told me that I had to take medication to save my way of life .
I find it so strange because I had no pain , no warning .
But that is the nature of the disease .
' You carry on as normal and you do n't realise that your bone is becoming like glass . '
Ursula played the role of Honey Ryder alongside Sean Connery who played Bond
Osteoporosis is an increasingly common condition that affects three million people in Britain : one in two women and one in five men over the age of 50 develop the disease .
After the age of 35 , we all naturally lose some bone strength as old bone is lost faster than new bone is made .
However , in someone with osteoporosis this process is speeded up , so the bones become critically brittle - women are particularly vulnerable after the menopause because they have lower levels of bone - protecting oestrogen .
A serious condition
While most common in the over - 50s , osteoporosis can also affect much younger people .
Often the disease progresses silently , with no symptoms , until a bone breaks or fractures .
Even the impact of a sneeze may be enough to break a rib in the later stages of the disease .
Some sufferers become stooped as minor fractures in the spine make it unable to support their body weight .
Patients can live in severe pain for years .
Ursula partying in London in 2004
In many cases , fractures are life - threatening : one in five women who fracture their hip as a result of osteoporosis die within six months .
The problem is that many women with the condition are going undiagnosed .
And even in those cases that are detected , many , like Ursula , do n't take their medication - with serious results .
Ursula was unaware of how serious the disease could be when it was detected during a routine health check eight years ago .
A scan revealed the bones in her hips were showing early signs of weakening , but she disregarded the diagnosis .
As she says , she was n't an obvious candidate for osteoporosis , being physically fit and eating calcium - rich foods .
' I have always been sporty and done lots of exercise , ' says Ursula , who has one son Dimitri , 28 , from her relationship with actor Harry Hamlin .
' I have never smoked , I 've always eaten well , including dairy , and drink wine only with a meal .
And while my mother had a hip replacement , she did n't fracture a hip to my knowledge and she lived to be 96 .
' True , I was post - menopausal , but otherwise had none of the risk factors .
I did n't think someone like me - a former Bond girl who from 7 am until late is go , go , go , who eats well and walks miles every day - would get this disease .
' Foolishly , I refused to take the diagnosis seriously .
The doctor told me to take a daily pill to help stop my bones from getting any weaker and to take calcium to help keep the bones strong .
' But I am the world 's worst pill - taker and always have been .
About four years ago , I was in India and caught pneumonia .
I pleaded with the doctor to give me the shortest dose of antibiotics possible because I knew otherwise I would n't finish the course .
' With the osteoporosis pills , I would think : " I will take it later " - and it would get later and later , and days passed without me taking the medication .
' Within a few months I gave up altogether and just took calcium when I remembered .
I thought I would be fine , especially as I had no pain and was still swimming and walking miles every day , which I thought would keep my bones strong .
' Besides , by drinking a bit more milk and eating a bit more cheese I thought my bones would improve .
' I was totally wrong .
By not taking my medication I have put myself at great risk . '
Wake - up call
Earlier this year , Ursula had her first full medical since her diagnosis and was horrified by what the doctors had told her .
A scan found that her bones had deteriorated greatly .
' The doctor told me that unless I took my medicine , I would definitely fracture my hip within the next few years , ' she says .
' Even a stumble would be enough for this to happen .
' It was a total wake - up call for me .
I 've always been so healthy , and the idea that just going about my day - to - day life could put me at risk was a real shock .
' Bones do n't heal themselves with a sticking plaster ; this was serious .
That scared me a lot .
Arriving at her 70th birthday party in May 2006 in Scotland .
The Swiss actress says she would rather die if her condition stopped her from being active
' I am passionate about life and the things I love , such as my garden at my home in Italy , tending to my animals and seeing my friends .
It would devastate me if I could not enjoy those things because my body had let me down .
' I would also feel so embarrassed if I had to become dependent on anyone to help me with day - today life .
I adore my son and he is good to me , but I would hate to become reliant on him .
It made me realise I had to take this condition seriously and start taking medication . '
Treatment
The most common treatment for osteoporosis is bisphosphonates - drugs that slow down the rate at which old bone is absorbed and help the cells that make new bone work more efficiently .
These are normally taken as a daily , weekly or monthly pill .
But to be effective , the medication does need to be taken regularly and at specific times of the day - generally an hour before food , which can become problematic , says Professor David Reed , chairman of the National Osteoporosis Society .
Indeed , there are many women like Ursula who neglect to take their medication .
A recent survey found that 70 per cent did n't take it regularly - almost half of them deliberately because of the fear of side - effects such as irritation to the gut or because they were confused by the instructions .
The good news is that generally , it is never too late for properly taken medication to make a difference .
' You 're not going to be able to get the bones back to the way they used to be , but you can retain their strength and stop them from getting worse , ' says Prof .
Reed .
Because of her blind spot in regards to pill - taking , Ursula and her doctor have agreed she can have a once - a - year treatment .

Zoledronic acid , a form of bisphosphonate , is given during an annual 15 - minute infusion .
Studies have found that it can reduce the risk of a hip fracture by more than 40 per cent and a spinal fracture by more than 70 per cent .
Although available in Britain , it 's more expensive than other treatments and is generally given only to those for whom other medications have not worked or who've had side - effects .
' People should discuss with their doctor if they do not think they are on the right medication , ' says Professor Reed .
' Generally , they will be started on the cheapest , which might not be the right drug for them . '
Ursula is so alarmed by the dangers that she is speaking about her condition as part of The Timeless Women campaign .
The aim is to challenge the assumption that osteoporosis is a disease suffered by old ladies and to encourage women of all ages to consider their bone health before it 's too late .
' The problem is that there is a lack of awareness among some GPs and members of the public about osteoporosis , ' says Professor Reed .
' They do n't think about the health of the bones until a fracture has occurred . '
The earlier the disease can be caught the better , as medication can reduce the risk of a fracture by as much as 70 per cent .
The World Health Organisation has introduced a questionnaire called the Frax system which GPs can use to assess the risk of fracturing a bone due to osteoporosis .
However , it is not yet mandatory .
It 's estimated that without changes to the diagnostic system , the number of fractures caused by osteoporosis will double in 50 years .
' I think it 's strange that women get told to have a mammogram regularly to check their breasts for cancer , but are not urged to get their bones checked for osteoporosis , ' says Ursula .
' Tragically , many people break bones and are then bed - ridden for a long time because they did not know they had the disease .
' I refuse to become a prisoner of my condition and I urge other women to do the same .
' Getting older brings lot of strange surprises .
It affects your body in ways you do n't expect .
' I have a dog who is getting old and he is losing his hearing , his sight and his capacity for thinking straight .
I think this will be me , too , one day , but at least I hope my bones will be OK . '

Eleven writers , including JM Coetzee , have signed a letter of support for the dissident Czech writer Milan Kundera , who they say has been wrongly accused of denouncing a western spy to communist authorities :
An attempt has recently been made to stir up a defamatory campaign with the aim of sullying the reputation of Milan Kundera .
He is accused of having denounced a western spy to the authorities in 1950 , when he was a student in communist Czechoslovakia .
We note that Kundera has issued a categorical denial of these claims , and that a witness statement by an eminent Prague scientist clears him of any guilt .
Too often , the press has spread this defamatory rumour without taking care to report the evidence refuting it .
This is nothing less than an effort to tarnish the reputation of one of our greatest living novelists on grounds that are , to say the least , dubious .
We wish to express our outrage at this orchestrated slander and to affirm our solidarity with Milan Kundera .

America 's 2008 election has at last come down to a national conversation about Barack Obama .
When it began , 20 months ago , this was an election about George Bush , Iraq and Katrina .
More recently it has become a contest about economic decline and insecurity , which explains more than anything why both Obama and his party have drawn steadily ahead over the past eight weeks .
Now , having essentially decided which political offer to accept , Americans must go to the polls on Tuesday and sign off on the man himself .
That is why the argument this week , and now over the final weekend , has morphed near the end into a contest over Obama himself .
Bill Clinton , as ever , posed the key question when he appeared with Obama in Florida this week .
" Are you ready , " he asked , " for a new president ? "
The Obama campaign understands this , too , just as it has understood most other things along the 2008 trail .
Wednesday 's unprecedented 30 - minute TV election advertisement boiled down to a simple message , aimed unerringly at independents and middle - ground voters .
It 's OK to elect this man , it told them .
It 's the right thing to do .
The Republicans understand this .
The final days are about Obama for them , too .
It is why the McCain campaign has again turned so negative as election day nears , trying to make the Chicago - based Palestinian Rashid Khalidi into the new Jeremiah Wright or the new Bill Ayers .
It is why McCain 's stump speech accuses Obama of being " redistributionist - in- chief " and why supporters waved placards this week saying " Stop socialism .
Vote McCain " .
It is why Sarah Palin , running hard with a ball that Hillary Clinton passed to the Republicans months ago , has spent the last week pitching to what she none too subtly calls " real Americans " , " patriotic Americans " or " pro-Americans " .
But what does it mean to say that , between now and election day , it is all at last about Obama ?
Travel through the US this week ( as I have been doing in a series of nightly discussions on the west coast for Guardian America and the New York Review of Books ) , and it is impossible not to be profoundly aware that this country stands on the threshold of something that once seemed impossible .
And yet when , a week from now , we reflect on the immense fact that America has elected a black president , or even if we are reflecting on the scarcely less immense fact that it has not , it will be important to remember what it feels like now - that this campaign has not fundamentally been about race at all .
Do n't get this wrong .
The Republicans are engaged in an " othering " of Obama into which race is inextricably woven .
But the othering of 2008 is not something new and unique but something old and familiar .
In 2004 they othered John Kerry as a rich liberal .
In 2000 they othered Al Gore as a beltway geek .
In the 1990s they othered Bill Clinton as a draft - dodging child of the 60s .
Before that they othered Michael Dukakis , Jimmy Carter and George McGovern , each in his turn , right back to the othering of John Kennedy as a Catholic in 1960 .
Othering , in other words , is what Republicans - and sometimes even Democrats - do .
But this othering is more diabolically potent this time because it 's about race , right ?
No , actually , that 's wrong .
The assumption that an inner racist demon lurks latent and uncontrollable in the souls of all white Americans , waiting to jump to the Republican dog whistle , is simply untrue .
Europeans , so easily prone to condescension when talking about Americans , should not throw stones from inside their glass houses .
Nor should journalists , who too often use the lazy cliche that , in the privacy of the polling booth , white Americans will do the opposite of what they say they will do .
Barack Obama is not the black candidate .
He is the Democratic candidate .
He is not just the representative of an ethnic group that has never even been close to winning the presidency .
He is also the nominee of a party that has become something of an expert at losing it .
That is the reason why , next Tuesday , American voters face a double choice - electing a president of a race they have not previously voted for ; and , at least as important on the day , electing a president from a party that , in modern times , they rarely vote in .
Look at it this way .
Obama may or may not have a problem getting white Americans to vote for him .
But he is doing much better than most of his recent Democratic predecessors ever managed among such voters .
In 2004 , white Americans split 58 % for Bush and 41 % for Kerry .
Four years before that , they went 54 % to Bush and 42 % to Gore .
In 1992 Bill Clinton had a two - point lead among white people .
Four years before that , George Bush Sr beat Dukakis by 20 points .
Against that historical backcloth , Obama 's one - point lead over McCain among white voters in the most recent New York Times - CBS poll looks pretty significant , while his bigger leads among white women , white men under 45 and , especially , white independent voters look potentially like a set of decisive turnabouts from recent Democratic experience .
In fact , if you are looking for one theme from late 20th - century elections that marked American contests out from western European ones , it was not the politics of race but the politics of gender .
For much of the past century in most European industrial nations including Britain , men tended to vote to the left of women , though that has begun to change recently .
In the US , by contrast , women have in recent decades tended consistently to vote to the left of men .
That certainly makes white men - who are around one in three of all adults - a key group of voters next week .
But the fact that Obama is polling more or less even with McCain among them looks like a strength , not a weakness .
Yes , there is a lot of evidence from things like implicit association tests that racist assumptions still lurk in millions of white American minds ( and European minds too , of course ) .
But that does n't mean that racism is the only thing you need to know about such people , or that it dominates their minds , or that they are incapable of overcoming it .
In particular , it does n't mean that , when asked to vote for this black man at this time , they will not do so .
Americans have spent a long time getting to know Barack Obama .
The evidence is that they like what they see , and that they are about to do something both right and great .

Advertisement Iraq has denounced a raid into Syria at the weekend , saying it does not want its territory to be used as a launch - pad for US attacks on its neighbours .
Syria urged the UN Security Council to hold the US responsible for the attack , which it says killed eight civilians .
And Syria 's cabinet called the attack " barbaric " , ordering a US school and cultural centre in Damascus to be shut .
Unnamed US officials have said the operation killed a key figure involved in the smuggling of fighters into Iraq .
But Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem denied the US claims calling them " totally unjustified " .
' War crime attempt '
He branded the attack a " war crime attempt " and said it had claimed the lives of civilians - a father and his three children , a farm guard and his wife , and a fisherman .
Profile : Abu Ghadiya
In pictures : Grief and anger in Syria Syria fears damage to Europe ties Speaking after a Baghdad cabinet meeting on Tuesday , Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh also explicitly criticised the US over the unconfirmed helicopter strike .
" The Iraqi government rejects the US helicopter strike on Syrian territory , considering that Iraq 's constitution does not allow its land to be a base for launching attacks on neighbouring countries , " he said .
But he urged Damascus to prevent groups using Syrian territory for " training and sending terrorists for attacks on Iraq and its people " .
The White House has neither confirmed nor denied Sunday 's strike near Abu Kamal , some eight kilometres ( five miles ) north of Iraq 's border with Syria .
Syria had protested to the UN Security Council in a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , the state news agency Sana said on Tuesday .
It urged the Security Council " to hold the aggressor responsible for the deaths of the innocent Syrian nationals " .
' Successful operation '
An unnamed US official told Reuters news agency the raid killed Iraqi Abu Ghadiyah , a former lieutenant of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the al - Qaeda in Iraq leader who was killed in 2006 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's hard to believe the Syrians could not see this coming G Battista , Brazil " It was a successful operation .
[ Abu Ghadiyah ] is believed to be dead .
This undoubtedly will have a debilitating effect on this foreign fighter smuggling network , " the official said .
If confirmed , Sunday 's strike would be the first US attack in Syria since the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The attack reportedly took place during the afternoon rest period , with a troop assault preferred over a missile strike to reduce civilian casualties , the intelligence official said .
The US had repeatedly asked Syria to hand over Abu Ghadiyah but Damascus said it was monitoring his activities , another US military official told AP .
Meanwhile Iraq 's cabinet authorised PM Nouri Maliki to put forward unspecified proposed changes to a security pact with the US .
The Status of Forces Agreement will govern US troop presence in Iraq when a UN mandate expires at the end of 2008 .
The US and Iraqi governments had previously said the pact , which would authorise the presence of US troops in Iraq until 2011 , was final and could not be amended .
On Tuesday , the White House said it was reluctant to accept any changes to the agreement .

Quick Tips
Shooting from the hip
Lifting the right hip in the backswing , Mae West style , is a guarantee of inconsistency because this kind of movement blocks the action of the arms , causing the upper body to over react and the left side to collapse towards the ball .
The result is usually seen as an overswing and no amount of tips or hints will produce a consistent strike from such a position .
The correct body position , as seen in most top class golfers , is the hallmark of a good swing .
Conversely , the ‘ Mae West ’ action is the opposite .
Compare our two illustrations , noting particularly the angle of the back .
Most golfers fall into the ‘ Mae West ’ trap because they lift the club too steeply in the backswing .
This causes the The ‘ Mae West ’ trap
SWING Full turn
Most major faults in golf stem from poor shoulder turn .
The two main problems are tilting the shoulders instead of turning them , and turning with the left shoulder and not the right , so that the left arm is pulled across the chest .
The first objective of full shoulder turn is accuracy and the second is distance .
The less you turn your shoulders and hips on the backswing , the more U - shaped and upright your swing will be , and consequently the less chance you will have of making a solid strike , or getting any further than the edge of the tee box .
Concentrating on turning the right shoulder will help you turn both shoulders completely .
THE SWING
left shoulder to dip down towards the ball and forces the right hip up above the height of the left .
To cure this fault you should concentrate on turning the shoulders on a level plane .
This will not only help to cure the problem , but to encourage a much wider swinging arc which in turn will promote more consistent striking and create a source of additional power .
The correct body position
Brace your right leg for balance .
If you swing too fast then problems of balance arise .
What happens is that during the upswing as the weight is naturally transferred onto the right foot , the weight goes too far to the right , buckling the right ankle .
You lose both balance and the chance of making an effective swing .
By bracing the right leg you can concentrate your weight on the inside of the right foot to maintain your balance before the downswing and transfer of weight to your left foot .
The alignment of the right foot at the finish of the swing can reveal a lot about the swing itself .
If your right foot is roughly vertical after you have gone up onto its toes , it is likely that you have
swung correctly .
Adolescents who have high levels of exposure to television programs that contain sexual content are twice as likely to be involved in a pregnancy over the following three years as their peers who watch few such shows , according to a new RAND Corporation study .
The study , published in the November edition of the journal Pediatrics , is the first to establish a link between teenagers ' exposure to sexual content on TV and either pregnancies among girls or responsibility for pregnancies among boys .
" Adolescents receive a considerable amount of information about sex through television and that programming typically does not highlight the risks and responsibilities of sex , " said Anita Chandra , the study 's lead author and a behavioral scientist at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
" Our findings suggest that television may play a significant role in the high rates of teenage pregnancy in the United States . "
Researchers from RAND
Health say that exposure to sex on television may influence teen pregnancy by creating the perception that there is little risk to engaging in sex without using contraceptives and accelerating the initiation of sexual intercourse .
" The amount of sexual content on television has doubled in recent years , and there is little representation of safer sex practices in those portrayals , " Chandra said .
" While some progress has been made , teenagers who watch television are still going to find little information about the consequences of unprotected sexual practices among the many portrayals promoting sex . "
She said that the findings hold implications for broadcasters , parents and health care providers .
Broadcasters should be encouraged to include more realistic depictions of sex in scripts and to portray consequences such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases .
Parents should consider limiting their children 's access to programming with sexual content and spending more time watching programs with their children so they can explain the consequences of sex .
Pediatricians should ask adolescents about their media use and discuss with them both contraception and the consequences that may accompany sexual activity .
The new findings are from a RAND research project that previously linked viewing of TV programs with sexual content with earlier initiation of sexual intercourse and other sexual activities .
The RAND study is based on a national survey of about 2,000 adolescents aged 12 to 17 who were recruited in 2001 and asked about their television viewing habits and sexual behavior .
The participants were surveyed again in 2001 and in 2004 .
The latest analysis is based upon results from about 700 participants who had engaged in sexual intercourse by the third survey and reported their pregnancy history .
Information about television viewing habits was combined with the results of a separate analysis of television programs to determine the frequency and type of sexual content the adolescents were exposed to during their TV viewing .
Researchers focused on 23 programs popular among teenagers that were widely available on broadcast and cable television , and contained high levels of sexual content ( both depictions of sex as well as dialogue or discussion about sex ) .
The shows included dramas , comedies , reality programs and animated shows .
RAND researchers found several other factors , in addition to TV viewing , that influenced whether adolescents were likely to experience a pregnancy .
Adolescents living in a two - parent household had a lower probability of pregnancy , while girls , African - Americans and those with more problem behaviors such as discipline problems were more likely to experience a pregnancy .
Youths who intended to have children early also were more likely to experience a pregnancy .
Chandra said future research topics should include whether inconsistent contraceptive use may help to explain the relationship between exposure to sex on television and pregnancy .
" Television is just one part of a teenager 's media diet that helps to influence their behavior , " Chandra said .
" We should also look at the roles that magazines , the Internet , and music play in teens ' reproductive health . "
Although the teenage pregnancy rate in the United States has declined sharply since 1991 , the nation still has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates among industrialized nations .
Nearly 1 million young women become pregnant each year , with the majority of these pregnancies unplanned .
Research has shown that young mothers are more likely than others to quit school , require public assistance and to live in poverty .

Support for the RAND study was provided by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Other authors of the study are Steven Martino , Rebecca Collins , Marc Elliott , Sandra Berry , David Kanouse and Angela Miu .
RAND Health , a division of the RAND Corporation , is the nation 's largest independent health policy research program , with a broad research portfolio that focuses on quality , costs and health services delivery , among other topics .
Today , scientists from Procter &Gamble ( P&G ) , the University of Calgary and the University of Virginia announced results from the first study to examine the entire human genome 's response to the most common cold virus , human rhinovirus .
The research state ( at the genomic level ) that the immune system response to the virus , and not the virus by itself , results in common cold symptoms .
Data generated by the study will be crucial in the search for new treatments for the common cold , which is the most common illness worldwide , affecting billions of people every year .
Specifically , the study identifies several categories of therapeutic targets that could balance the immune response in order to minimize symptoms during an infection and potentially even lead to therapies that may prevent infection .
Results of the study are published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine ( AJRCCM ) .
Research Methodology
" Rhinovirus is the major cause of the common cold , but it is also an important pathogen in more serious conditions , such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , " said David Proud , PhD , Professor , Department of Physiology & Biophysics , University of Calgary and senior author of the study .
" The study 's findings are a major step toward more targeted cold prevention and treatment strategies while also serving as a valuable roadmap for the broader respiratory science community .
" Over 200 different viruses cause the common cold , but the rhinovirus accounts for 30 to 50 percent of cases .
Because of the complexity of our immune response , research has been a lengthy process , with previous human studies only examining the response to infection in a select number of genes .
In the randomized , placebo - controlled study , researchers infected 17 volunteers with rhinovirus - 16 and an additional 18 volunteers ( who served as the study control group ) were given a sham inoculation in the form of a nasal saline spray .
The volunteers were all healthy college students who signed informed consent forms .
The rhinovirus - 16 used in the study was first isolated and purified by Procter &Gamble and the University of Virginia .
After infection , researchers scraped small samples of nasal epithelial cells , which line the passages of the nose , from the volunteers .
Rhinovirus - 16 and other cold viruses infect these nasal cells , which are the body 's first line of defense against airborne pathogens .
The researchers then used microarray gene chip technology to compare the gene expression levels between the infected volunteers and the control group .
" Advances in genomics technology now allow us to analyze tens of thousands of genes in the same amount of time required to analyze just a handful of genes just a decade ago , " said Jay Tiesman , P&G Genomics Group Leader and study author .
Forty - eight hours after inoculation , the expression of 6,530 genes in infected volunteers were significantly either up - regulated or down - regulated compared to the same genes in the control group .
In other words , rhinovirus infection triggered a massive immune response in the nasal mucosa .
Because rhinovirus is not as destructive as other more serious viral infections , this response appears to be disproportionate to the threat .
The researchers classified the active genes according to function , and found many involved in a process known as chemotaxis , which recruits various immune cells to the site of infection .
These particular genes have been correlated with symptoms such as inflammation , congestion and runny nose .
Other groups of active genes have also been classified ; among them are genes which make antiviral compounds thought to help thwart infections .
" This study shows that after rhinovirus infection , cold symptoms develop because parts of our immune system are in overdrive , " said Lynn Jump , Principal Researcher at P&G and study author .
" The findings are important because they provide us a blueprint for developing the ideal cold treatment : one that maintains the body 's natural antiviral response while normalizing the inflammatory response .
"
Of the many antiviral compounds made by the epithelial cells , one , called , was especially intriguing .
The study volunteers produced on average 6.5 times more of the viperin gene product than the control group .
Previous work found that viperin helps fend off influenza virus , but the new study is the first in humans to show that the compound also combats rhinovirus .
This demonstrates that the body generates a similar antiviral response to the cold as it does to more serious viruses like influenza .
The researchers confirmed viperin's role in cold defense with two follow - up experiments , also reported in the current study .
Beyond identifying viperin's role in cold defense , scientists also discovered changes in gene expressions that signaled reductions in the body 's natural antioxidant defenses .
Additional data from the study , to be published in a follow - up paper , looked at correlations between vitamin D levels and cold symptoms .
Together , these insights provide fertile ground for further investigating the impact of nutrition on optimum immune system function .
Now that I have an account for this weblog I thought it might be nice to keep everyone informed about what ’s going on inside Xfce every now and then .
Unlike Erik with the weekly news he wrote some time ago I ’ll probably not be that funny ( you can tell from the picture in my previous post that I really suck at this ) and maybe not even as informative as the weekly news were , but I hope I can at least keep you posted on the latest and hottest news from the Xfce front .
So , let ’s first talk about what ’s going on right now .
For the last two weeks we ’ve been busy finishing the new settings dialogs .
For those who do not know yet : for Xfce 4.6 we developed a completely new configuration backend based on D - Bus .
It ’s called xfconf and is really cool .
As the name already suggests it ’s somewhat similar to GConf – you have a daemon which acts as an abstraction layer for the actual storage backend and you have clients which can read and write their configs from / to the daemon via D - Bus .
So why use D - Bus at all ?
In the case of xfconf it helped us designing a new property change notification mechanism .
Applications interested in a property ( usually a settings dialog that modifies a property or an application that uses this property ) can ask the daemon to be notified whenever this property changes .
And this works really well .
Anyway , back to the initial topic : almost all settings dialogs have now been ported to xfconf and we have started to package the alpha .
We ’ve agreed on preparing the release notes together and hopefully we ’ll be able to finish those tomorrow so we can release the alpha named Pinkieon Saturday or Sunday .
We would be lousy developers if we did n’t already make plans for the beta .
Alpha does n’t mean feature freeze , right ?
So while Stephan has plans to finish work on his editor for xfconf ( which makes it possible to skip the settings dialogs and just edit all properties by hand using a GUI ) I thought about our settings dialogs again .
I ’ve always hated how all those dialogs cluttered the screen .
So instead of using dialogs , what about embedding the widgets into the main settings dialog of Xfce ?
I had only found out about GtkSocket / GtkPlug one or two days before and so I read the reference manual on how to use them and started modifying the new main settings dialog and two of the other dialogs for keyboards and the user interface settings to see whether embedding these into the main dialog was actually possible .
You can see the results of this short hacking session ( it still needs some work ) in this video .
Instead of having dialogs popping up whenever you click on an item in the settings dialog the dialog content is now embedded into the dialog and you ’re provided with a back button to return to the overview .
The video also shows some of the new features like customizable the DPI value and dialogs designed to aid in resolving keyboard shortcut conflicts .
So , I leave you with this for tonight ( damn , 3 am already … ) and hope we can surprise ( ha…ha … ) you with the alpha release this weekend .
Cheers ,
Jannis

Denis Leary Offends Gay Community
Outspoken Rescue
Me actoris back at running his mouth .
First it was his attack on autism and now he has offended the gay community .
In fact , gay magazine The Advocate is questioning his behavior in next month 's issue .
Leary has a book coming out called Why We Suck and the chapter that is causing the uproar is titled Matt Dillon Is a Giant Fag.
Brandon Voss , who conducted the interview for The Advocate , demanded some answers .
He asked Denis : " What gives you the right to use the " F - word ? "
Leary responded :
" I also have a chapter called We'd Hate You Even If You Were n't Black .
I do n't believe in the power of words .
My parents came from Ireland , where the ( C - word ) is literally a word your mother and father would use to describe the weather or the car .
' That ( C - word ) ing car wo n't start ! '
And I come from a Catholic background where the nuns were always telling you , ' Do n't do this , do n't say this , ' so any time anyone tells me I should n't say something , my reaction is , ' Why not ? ' "
Leary called children with autism , " just stupid " or " lazy " or both .
His detractors launched the website denislearysucks.com in response .
What do you think ?
Will calling out Leary on his words make a difference ?
We think probably not .

At a meeting with reporters in Chicago , IL late this afternoon Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama responded to comments made by Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader who claimed that Obama was trying to talk white , and exploit white guilt to get elected .
When he was asked about Nader ’s comments Obama said , “ What ’s clear is , Ralph Nader has n’t been paying attention to my speeches .
Ralph Nader ’s trying to get attention .
He ’s become a perennial political candidate .
I think it ’s a shame , because if you look at his legacy … it ’s an extraordinary one .
…
At this point , he ’s somebody who ’s trying to get attention , whose campaign has n’t gotten any traction . ”
I think that Nader was n’t just trying to get media attention for his campaign .
To Ralph Nader , Barack Obama is another in a long line of corporate Democrats .
Nader ’s biggest problem with Obama is that is the Democrat is n’t far enough to the left .
The race angle is getting all of the play in this story , but Ralph Nader is n’t a racist .
I do n’t think Nader sees race .
In his ideology the world is corporate and anti-corporate .

I do agree with Obama that Nader has an amazing legacy .
He has probably done more for his fellow citizens than any other U.S. private citizen of the past 100 years , and it is sad to Nader out there campaigning every four years .
I do believe that Nader has hurt his legacy with his campaigns in 2004 and 2008 , and I do n’t think that Obama fits the Nader narrative of the corporate Democrat .
Obama is the most liberal Democratic nominee since 1988 , but he still needs to minimize the number of votes Nader could take away from him .
That was the true intention of his response today .
Obama ’s quote came from this story .

Palin yesterday in Pennsylvania :
“ In times like these with wars and financial crisis , I know that it may be easy to forget even as deep and abiding a concern as the right to life , and it seems that our opponent kind of hopes you will forget that , ” Palin told a Pennsylvania crowd .
Still think this woman should be in charge of your 401k ?
Oh , who cares if you lost half your retirement , at least with a Palin administration you can be sure women will be forced to keep and give birth to their rapists ’ babies ( after we make them pay for their rape kits ) .
After all , is n’t that what really matters right now ?

Saturday ’s terrorist attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad , Pakistan , caused massive destruction and loss of life .
One of the reasons why :
The bomb contained a lethal accelerant , found in some of the world ’s most powerful munitions .
The BBC coverage of the bombing notes :
There is no footage of the main blast because it destroyed the camera , but officials said the vehicle was packed with 600 kg of high quality explosives as well as grenades and mortars .
Aluminum powder was also used to accelerate the explosion and added to the ferocity of the blaze , officials said .
Aluminum powder has long been used to boost the power of explosives .
Blast weapons like the 15,000 - pound BLU - 82 Daisy Cutter and the 21,600 - pound " Mother of All Bombs " use it to increase their destructive force .
Devices with a high proportion of metal powder to explosive are termed " thermobaric . "
When the explosive goes off , the metal powder at the leading edge of the fireball burns as it contacts the air .
With a crude device , the powder simply burns and adds to the fireball .
In more advanced weapons , the burning metal produces a sub-sonic shockwave ( known as deflagration ) ; the most advanced produce a detonation ( supersonic shockwave ) of tremendous destructive power .
I noted the potential risk from terrorist thermobaric devices back in 2004 .
Normal , condensed explosives produce a very short pressure pulse .
A " volumetric " one , from a detonating fireball , produces an extended blast pulse that is far more damaging to buildings .
The
Marriott attack left a large crater , indicating that much of the blast came from a point source .
The metal powder seems to have contributed only to the incendiary effects .
According to the Guardian , " the temperature had reached 400C , investigators said , which made the hotel ’s sprinkler system and the fire service useless . "
By all accounts , there was a long delay before the device went off , with the truck burning sometime before the explosion .
( See the video , above . )
This was not a device built by master bombmakers .
And the hotel ’s security barrier performed a vital function of keeping the bomb away from the building .
Distance is life in these situations .
( Compare the Marriott blast with the Oklahoma City bombing ; there was a lot of structural damage to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , because
McVeigh was able to drive right up to it . )
However , a thermobaric blast would extend the radius of effect of such a truck bomb significantly .
The blast and fire damage at the Islamabad Marriott were severe enough as it was .
But a similar device with enhanced engineering could have leveled the building and caused far worse casualties .
Terrorists showed that one of the most secure buildings in Islamabad was still vulnerable to attack , but there was far less damage than there might have been .
Come to Alishan to take a ' trip of tea ' !
Being internationally known as one of the best places in Taiwan to greet sunrise , Alishan is also attractive to domestic and foreign visitors for its forest train , sea of clouds and primitive forests .
Tea , however , remains to the visitors a local specialty and upmarket souvenir from a journey to Alishan , despite the vast green landscape of tea gardens seen in many parts of the region and the fact that tea farming is a major way of making a living for many residents of the mountain .
Chiayi County government , therefore , launches a theme festival this year based on the Alishan High Mountains tea industry , in the hope of introducing the public to a trip that creates an unprecedented experience of tea drinking : tasting delicacies made from tea while spending a night in a homestay hosted by a tea farmer and waking up early the next morning to greet sunrise in a tea garden .
The county government sponsors six activities during the festival from September 27 to November 16 to lure visitors .
The activities include a lucky draw that presents winners top prizes like hi-tech home appliances or the popular home video game console , Wii .
Tea planting in Alishan bourgeoned at the beginning of the 1980s after No.18 Provincial Highway , also known as the Alishan Highway , was opened to transport services .
The opening of the highway allowed residents to bring excavators to their uphill residences , allowing them to reclaim more tea gardens , said Huang Chang - hao , a second - generation Alishan tea farmer .
The tea of Alishan is planted in an environment shrouded in mists and raindrops at an average altitude of 1,000 - meter and over an area spanning 50 kilometers south and north of the Tropic of Cancer .
The tea yields a mixed flavor of natural , powerful but refreshing tastes , commented Chiayi County Commissioner Chen Ming - wen .
The so - called Alishan High Mountains tea comprises two types of tea : Oolong ( 烏龍 ) and Jinshuan ( 金萱 ) .
The oolong tea crop , planted in the mountain 's upper region of Shihjhuo ( 石棹 ) and Top Shihjhuo ( 頂石棹 ) , was additionally given the name " Ju-lu " ( 珠露 ) by former Vice President Hsieh Tung - ming in praise of its unique aroma which results from the higher altitude planting environment and the beauty of tea leaves teeming with morning dew .
The quality of the tea has been endorsed in many international competitions , making it highly valuable in the market .
The tea farmers of Alishan produce a volume of approximately 1,700 tons of tea every year from some 2,300 hectares of tea gardens scattered over the mid-slope areas of Alishan , said Chang Yuan - po , a division chief from Chiayi County government 's tourism promotion department .
" The output value of Alishan High Mountains tea is estimated to be around NT $ 2 billion to NT $ 2.5 billion , " Chang told reporters , who took part in a press mission at the beginning of October , adding that the tea is hardly available in overseas markets given its high popularity among local consumers and limited production .
Recommended route
for exploring Alishan tea
A 'trip of tea ' at Alishan can start off along the No. 18 Provincial Highway through the southern part of Alishan , including Siding , where swirling clouds and mists always impress visitors , Shihjhuo and Top Shihjhuo -- a region which is famous for having plenty of homestays scattered about the high - altitude tea gardens .
The landscape of the southern region features a large tract of tea gardens , spreading over hills between the villages .
The majority of the region 's residents are tea farmers .
Having concentrated on planting and producing the best tea over the past two decades , more and more tea farmers have joined the business of running B& Bs as a sideline and providing visitors homemade tea delicacies and tea drinks .
The 30 - year old Huang is one of the many second - generation Alishan tea farmers who stay home to help maintain the family business .
Unlike other remote villages of Taiwan , where young people usually leave home to work in the metropolis , the brain - drain problem does not occur in Alishan because of the booming tea farming industry , Huang disclosed .
Huang said he stays with his family rather than working in the city because tea planting is labor - consuming .
Moreover , the output value of tea farming is fair enough for livelihood , he noted .
Huang and his wife have furthermore integrated tea and other agricultural produce of the family -- also bettering their financial circumstances -- by presenting gourmet homemade delicacies at their cafe , Sheng Li Tea Factory .
One of the must - try delicacies at the cafe is Honeyed Ice Coffee , a combination of a coffee bean Huang inherited from his grandfather and honey gathered from bees cultivated by the family .
" The honey produced by Huang 's family has the best fragrance of its kind that I 've ever smelled , " said a reporter from the press mission .
Chicken Soup with Oolong Tea is another recommended dish for its refreshing fragrance resulting from a fusion of rich chicken soup and fresh tea leaves .
" Oolong is not the only kind of tea that can be used in soup , " revealed Huang , adding that either Jinshuan or fresh green tea can also perfect the taste of chicken soup .
Those who start the journey from the northern part of Alishan can follow the No.162 Highway through Meishan ( 梅山 ) , Taiping ( 太平 ) , Ruifeng ( 瑞峰 ) and Ruili ( 瑞里 ) .
Differing from the gradual landscape of the south , tea gardens in northern Alishan are located on steep hills , toughening the tea farmers ' mission of weeding and harvesting the crop .
Among the numerous household tea factories at Alishan , the Ruili - based Yu Chia Li Farm is one of Taiwan 's only two tea factories whose operation has been recognized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) for meeting its International Standards .
Farm owner Liu Hsien - tan disclosed that he started his tea farming business from scratch and spent more than NT $ 20 million setting up the tea- manufacturing facilities to fit in with the ISO requirements .
But it was worthwhile , Liu told reporters , based upon his foresight that the ISO recognition would help him expand into the international market .
Bourgeoning B&B homestay business
Running homestays is not merely aimed at earning extra income , but also at providing outsiders a chance to experience the joy of the lives led by the inhabitants of Alishan , the tea farmers said .
Visitors can choose to spend a night at Alishan in a traditional Taiwanese or a western romantic - style compound before getting up early the next morning to greet a gorgeous sunrise .
Most of the homestay families in Top Shihjhuo offer guest accommodation in their traditional three - section compounds , which are situated at the center of compound owners ' tea gardens , said Liu Ning - yuan , a B&B owner , creating a distinguishing feature of the region .
At least two homestay families provide western style accommodation .
Gordon Chu and his wife have run the three - story Alishan Season Star in Siding ( 隙頂 ) , southern Alishan , for three years in the style of an English B&B , which can be easily told from its appearance .
In the north , Yeh Sheng - han and his wife run a western style homestay in Ruili .
The Rui Sheng Holiday Resort is well known by the local community not only because of the owner 's charming wit and humor but also for the excellent cooking skills of his wife , said Chang .
An English - speaking homestay , the Small Swiss Homestay , is managed by Charlies Liu and his family , receiving foreign visitors with attentive care and without a language barrier .
A couple of years ago , at the height of the boom , a friend in New York publishing described to me the indignities of being a five - figure employee commuting daily from suburban New Jersey on trains packed with traders , stock brokers and hedge - fund types .
“ These were the guys who , in college , I used to step over on Sunday mornings when they were lying in a pool of their own vomit , ” he said .
“ And now they ’re earning millions and millions – in bonuses alone . ”
The image , as you might imagine , stuck in my mind .
For it summed up so well a certain kind of resentment and sense of injustice that a particular class of non-monied professionals in the New York area came to feel sometime in the late 1990s .
The feeling of injustice was n’t just about money , though it was partly about being more than solidly middle class and still struggling to pay the bills , as New York writer Vince Passaro captured so well in his “ Reflections on the Art of Going Broke ” ( “ Who ’ll Stop the Drain ? ” ) in Harper ’s in 1998 .
It was , rather , about a sense that the wrong people had inherited the earth .
They had taken over everything .
Their salaries ( and bonuses in particular ) had pushed real estate costs and living expenses sky - high .
Their values had permeated every aspect of life .
And their choices seemed to have become the only acceptable — even viable — ones possible .
In the 1970s , even in New York , it had been financially possible for a middle class family to survive if parents — even one parent — built a professional life around something other than purely making money .
In the 1980s — even in the “ greed is good ” ( which was of course meant to be a damning phrase ) 1980s — it seemed respectable , honorable and , dare I say , valuable to do things other than make a lot of money .
But by the late 1990s , in New York , if you were n’t in the financial industry , it was hard to survive .
And so it went , in a more general way , throughout the country , in the whole winner - take - all - era ushered in by the boom years of the late 1990s .
The model for success narrowed .
The goal posts marking success grew more out of reach .
For all the people who did something with their lives other than doggedly , single - mindedly — and successfully — pursuing wealth ( “ You mean , some people ’s jobs are just about making money ? ”
Julia once asked me in the course of one of our “ What the World is About ” conversations ) , life got harder and scarier and more confusing .
Many of us who ’d proudly decided , in our twenties , to pursue edifying or creative , or “ helping ” professions , woke up to realize , once we had families , that we ’d perhaps been irresponsible .
We could n’t save for college .
We could barely save for retirement .
If we set up a “ family - friendly ” lifestyle , we threw our financial futures down the drain .
So , like just about everyone , we worked hard and treaded water , but felt we were entitled to do better than that .
And if we lived in the New York area , or another similarly wealthy area where the spoils of the new Gilded Age were constantly thrust in our faces , we felt , like my friend on the train , a little something more : we knew that we were losers .
( “ The Big L , ” a friend , an art school grad turned design consultant , declared last week , calling me in tears after her stockbroker told her how little she cared about her modest portfolio .
“ Why not just brand it right on my forehead and be done with it ? ” )
This financial crisis is supposed to be a big moment of reckoning .
“ 666 - Mark of the Beast ” and “ Root of all Evil ” the End - of - World Web sites are shouting , quoting prominent economists on the demise of the American banking system .
“ Wall Street , R.I.P. ” , a headline in The Times proclaimed last weekend .
“ The Master of the Universe Era is over , ” New York magazine chimed in .
For those of us who have hated this period — the wealth worship , the wealth gap , the elevation of everything suspiciously shiny and irrationally bubbly and stupidly ebullient , there should be some feeling of vindication .
But it just is n’t coming .
A great emptiness — and a gnawing kind of fear — has taken its place .
After 9/11 , psychologists said that the tragedy and trauma would magnify whatever emotional state people were already experiencing .
Depressed people would become much more depressed .
Anxious people would become much more anxious .
The current financial crisis has , I think , proven to be a similar sort of emotional Rorschach test .
People who felt impotent feel even more powerless .
Those who felt lied to see new levels of conspiracy .
Demagogues are engaging in even more demagoguery .
And those of us who felt , well , like losers , are feeling like even bigger losers , as we shove our unopened 401 K or ( if we ’re double - loser freelancers ) SEP - IRA statements into bottom desk drawers and wait for a cathartic burst of schadenfreude that simply refuses to come .
Schadenfreude is impossible because the fat cats — the ones who bent the rules , the ones who pushed the envelopes , the ones who paid lower taxes because capital gains were most of their income , the ones who opposed regulations on the banking and mortgage industries — are taking us down with them .
The very wealthiest are , as always , likely to do just fine .
Real , hard - core Wall Street , as Tom Wolfe reminded us last weekend , long ago decamped for the hedge funds of Greenwich .
The political leaders who allowed this mess to develop have turned into the great defenders of “ Main Street . ”
( If I have to hear the juxtaposition of “ Main Street ” and “ Wall Street ” one more time , I will be the one drowning in a pool of vomit . ) .
It ’s a whole host of other people — vulnerable middle class homeowners and small business owners and , now , universities unable to make payroll — who are hurting .
I called my friend in publishing yesterday to ask him how things were going on the train .
“ There ’s a lot of rueful chuckling .
There ’s a lot of talk about riding this out , about maintaining , ” is all he had to say .
It was 23 years ago that Tom Wolfe introduced us to the Masters of the Universe .
They were curiosities then — remote , very rich , and decidedly not like you and me .
But now , the world of Wall Street has become our world ; there is no outside to it , there is no other option than to pay and play .
Our fortunes rise and fall together to a degree like never before , and our values are enmeshed like never before .
The language of Wall Street — of cost - cutting and efficiency , self - interest , using each situation to maximize profit , is the language of everyday life and social interaction .
We ’re all losers now .
There ’s no pleasure to it .
When a politician starts speaking , you should already have your guard up .
Get ready to become a filter , because there ’s a big difference between what a politician says , and what he or she actually means .
Fortunately , a lot of politicians have put themselves in a lot of compromising situations .
This gives us a chance to observe those critical moments right before they actually admit to their misdeeds .
It is in these moments where we can see the mind of a professional liar break down .
When one of the world ’s greatest liars starts going down , we get to see what desperate attempts they make to try to stay afloat .
Those desperate acts are the ones that show us the inner workings of mass manipulation
And when we see those moments , we can remember and point out when others use them .
The following are five terms that politicians have used when they ’re going down in flames .
Check them out , and see if you can tell when politicians try to use the same tactics in the future .
________
5 ) Redirection and Deferment :
We ’ll start out with a popular example from about a decade ago .
President Bill Clinton ’s position was compromised after he put intern Monica Lewinsky in a compromising position .
It does n’t matter what your personal opinion is about the situation , the fact that Clinton lied is n’t up for debate .
Clinton said he did n’t have any kind of sexual relations with the intern , but later admitted he did .
This gives us an opportunity to see Slick Willy ’s tactics of untruth .
This video takes place after Clinton cracked under the pressure , but there are still some key strategies we can get out of it .
Notice how he immediately tries to redirect the conversation at the beginning .
That ’s a very successful way politicians get out of what they do n’t want to talk about .
It did n’t work in this instance , but it has in many others .
His answers also give us some information .
If a politician is being asked a serious question , and ca n’t give a “ yes ” or “ no ” answer , there ’s a problem .
If someone ’s making sure not to answer a question , it ’s probably because they do n’t like the answer they would give .
________
4 ) Unprovoked confirmation that a statement is true :
Recently , John McCain has been put in a situation that has forced him to defend “ robocalls ” he ’s decided to make .
These are automated calls into people ’s homes that campaign for McCain .
A video of him defending these calls gives us some insight into how politicians will sometimes start defending an accusation that was never made .
McCain starts defending how true the robocall is , when that was never an issue .
By doing this , he not only redirects whatever accusation was going to be made , but he also gets off without having to lie about anything ( even though what he ’s doing is suspect ) .
________
3 ) Make it personal :
Richard Nixon ’s most popular phrase of all time is probably , “ I am not a crook . ”
The problem was , that statement was n’t exactly true .
He was involved in the Watergate scandal .
While his ship was sinking , he was able to give us a statement , which we can now look back on and see as a not - always - effective tactic to cool down the heat .
He makes the accusations more personal by using “ I am ” and “ I ’ve earned ” statements .
These are an effective way to confront everyone who is thinking bad thoughts about you .
It makes people think they are attacking you , because they do n’t like you .
If they think you did something wrong , call them out on it , and they ’ll usually back down .
That is , unless they have a lot of recorded evidence to back themselves up .
________
2 ) Realistic , but not necessarily real , links :
One of the best ways to get Americans to fight who you want them to fight , is to link your enemies to people Americans already do n’t like .
Dick Cheney gave a good example of this when he was trying to link Iraq to the attacks on Sept. 11 .
Cheney made statements suggesting that Iraq was somehow involved , and not only was this later proved wrong , but Cheney also backtracked on the statements himself .
Even though he backtracked , this was still a factor in getting support for the Iraq War from the public .
This tactic can be very dangerous , because it can lead to a constant war where we keep attacking people who our leaders tell us are linked to people we ’ve already fought .
The 7 - step Kevin Bacon rule proves that this can eventually kill us all , since we ’re all linked in someway .
Thank you , Kevin Bacon , for proving the eventual apocalypse .
________
1 ) Fear :
Fear is what politicians use most to control us .
People will do almost anything to not feel fear , and that ’s why politicians keep feeding it to us .
It ’s the most effective way to get what they want .
This last one is a little bit of a compilation of politicians , but they ’re all from basically the same administration .
We need to realize that there ’s always going to be something to be afraid of , but it ’s not a reason to allow others to control what we do .
We have to keep our guard up when politicians are talking about scary stuff , because it usually means they want something .
It ’s the equivalent to a child being really nice to their parents all of the sudden .
They ’re only doing it to get what they want , and they ’ll do it again when they need something else .
- William Kammer
The younger you were at the time , the better .
I can not remember too much from my young childhood , besides the warm feeling from sitting in a basket of laundry just come from the dryer , my dad teaching me how to ride a bike , and the days my mom would pick me up from grade school and we would eat and talk at Arthur Treacher 's while we were waiting for my brothers to finish school .
And I can remember one vacation with my family by the seashore when I was very young , when my grandmother showed me how to dig for clams , as well as a trip to Disneyland where we stayed in a loft with a circular staircase surrounded by orange trees .
All of these memories leave me with happy , warm feelings about my childhood .
I also remember playing with my brothers and reading in my room alot and other minor incidents , but these more mundane memories do n't really carry the same emotional weight .
I would like to know if other people have more happy memories from their childhoods and , if so , what are they like ?
If your parents created loving memories for you , what sorts of things were you doing together ?
I guess I 'm partly trying to understand why some things stick in our minds , to become happy memories , and others do n't .
As well as how to help create positive memories for a child .
( Obviously , " be a good parent / aunt / sitter / friend " is the default answer , but beyond that , what makes the memory ? )
What happy memories do you have of being a young child that make you think either " those were good times " or " that was good parenting " ?
Some workers have not been paid for months , unions say All work in India 's film and television hub of Bollywood has stopped after thousands of technicians and actors began a strike over pay and conditions .
Unions representing film employees in Mumbai ( Bombay ) say many members have not been paid for months and are threatening to strike indefinitely .
Meanwhile , film producers have told the BBC they will meet to decide their response on Thursday .
They say that they are prepared to weather a long dispute if necessary .
' No compromise ' " Employees sometimes work for as long as 30 hours at a stretch .
There have been serious health issues and even accidents .
We have been writing to producers but it got us nowhere , " said Dinesh Chaturvedi of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees .
He said that workers ' patience had reached " saturation point " because wages had not been paid for months and contracts were not being honoured .
Mr Chaturvedi - whose federation of 22 unions represents 147,000 members - said that in some cases wages had been withheld for up to six months , leaving workers on the verge of starvation .
The new film industry has suddenly gone quiet Mr Chaturvedi says the Senior Artists Association is also part of his federation and are part of the non co-operation , although it is not clear if any major stars are taking part in the strike .
Daily wage workers , comprising lighting technicians and camera crew , insist that they are not ready to compromise until their demands are satisfied .
Premsingh
Thakur , who heads a union mostly made up of lighting technicians , said that about 35,000 of his members had not reported for work on Wednesday .
" We do not want any bonus .
We just want the wages which were decided by producers .
Until this matter is solved we will not start work , " he said .
The BBC's Prachi Pinglay in Mumbai says that television productions on tight schedules like reality shows are the most affected by the dispute and several shooting schedules for daily shows have been cancelled .
Those on strike range from from dancing girls to carpenters , lighting technicians to cameramen , and soundmen to script writers .
Farhan Khan , who works on the production team of a reality show , told the BBC : " All shooting has come to a complete halt .
We are losing money and we just have to wait till it is resolved . "
But Sushma Shiromanee of the Indian Motion Picture Producers ' Association said employers were prepared to hold out for months if need be .
" There is no shooting at all today , but there is no panic here .
The biggest problem is with the TV producers , " she told the BBC .
" This is not only harming producers , but daily wage workers , too , who are n't earning anything because of it ...
They should have sat down with us to talk about this .
We can wait for six months if necessary . "

Slide Film
Slide films make positive images designed for projection and viewing on a light table , so they are designed for higher contrast and thus have a correspondingly small dynamic range .
Most slide films are developed using the E - 6 process , with Kodachrome being the main exception .
There is one lab left in the whole wide world who can develop Kodachrome .
For 35 mm ( and , back in the old days , 126 and 127 ) film , you tend to get film back in 4 cm x 4 cm frames that you can shuttle in and out of slide trays , slide pages , scanners .
If you want , you can also get them in sleeves like other kinds of film .
For medium and large format , I 've never seen any options other than getting it back in sleeves , although they have 6 cm x 6 cm and 75 mm x 75 mm frames for projection usage and projectors to hold them if you want to do it yourself .
You can also crossprocess slide film ( put it in the chemicals for negative film ) to get a negative .
You keep the film 's inherent high contrast but you get a negative that does n't have the orange mask .
The dye formulations are different and only similar enough to mostly work , so even if you correct for the lack of orange mask , the colors still go weird .
The way the chemicals work is that the first developer generates a negative image , then that negative image is bleached away , the film is either chemically or optically fogged , and then one or more second developers develop a positive image .
Then the film can be fixed , bleached , and washed just like any other film .
E - 6 uses dye couplers that are built into the film and a chemical reversal agent .
It 's been said that the E - 6 chemistry is temperamental in ways that C - 41 chemistry is n't .
So , even though E - 6 is fairly common , you generally do n't see it in the minilabs at the drug store .
There are kits to do it at home if you are confident with your temperature control .
There 's one film lab in America and a bunch of homebrew recipes that can take most black and white films and make black and white slides out of them .
I 've never tried them .
They work for most , but not all , films , and they generally change the working properties of the film .
This works fairly well in my workflow for most subject matter , especially if I have a polarizer and my flash handy so I can control the lighting .
Velvia has beautiful saturated colors , high contrast , and beautiful deep blacks with impressive shadow detail .
Great for scenery , awful for people .
I found that it takes a lot of Photoshop time to make people not look funny .
There 's a lot of tricks that Fuji 's applied to it that make it record an image that looks good but differs from reality .
For most people , shooting Velvia for the first time is an eye - opening experience and you will either love or hate it .
Either way , you should definitely try it at least once .
Velvia 100 was the intended replacement for the famed Kodachrome - killing Velvia 50 .
Most folks still prefer Velvia 50 , so it 's coming back .
I have n't tried the new Velvia 50 yet , but I prefer the extra stop , finer grain , and dramatically improved reciprocity .
I also never tried the old Velvia 50 .. during its heyday , I was shooting Kodak Gold 100 because I did n't know better .
There was a Velvia 100 F , but I never bothered trying it .
The way I understand it , 100F was made when Fuji considered the elaborately crazy saturated colors of Velvia 50 to be an abberation and an accident and make a saturated film for scenery that did n't make people look all messed up .
Which , it turns out , meant that they ruined the exact colors that everybody was loving .
Velvia 100 is better .
It 's been said that Velvia 50 is even better , but given my propensity for nighttime photography , reciprocity is important .
It 's also said that Velvia is unforgiving .
The most frustrating part is that it 's got mad crazy DMax , so you can see a very dark image on the slide even if you can't get the image out with a scanner .
In general , however , I have n't had too much trouble getting consistently exposed Velvia slides because I understand my meter quite well .
If Velvia gets pulled from the market , I 'm buying a digital SLR .
Seriously .
Kodak makes E100VS to compete with Velvia .
It 's grainier .
It 's got better reciprocity than Velvia 50 .
I do n't think it can really compare to Velvia 100 , however , given that it does n't have the same DMax or color distortions .
It 's also more expensive .
I 've tried it and it did n't seem to be that different in most useful measurements , except that it 's more expensive .
According to photographers more hardcore than myself , Velvia 50 , Velvia 100 , and E100VS each emphasize a different set of colors best , so if you want to carry all three , you can use all of them .
Provia 100 F is a good general purpose film .
The only film with better reciprocity is Acros .
It 's easy to scan , great for all kinds of subject matter , and often times suffers from a master - of - none problem .
If you only use one slide film , this is it .
The color balance is a little cool for noontime sun , but it 's fine otherwise .
I buy it in bulk .
Kodak makes E100G and E100GX to compete with it .
E100GX is designed to be more orange for outdoor photography without a filter .
Reciprocity is important to me with my style , so I use Provia 100 instead .
Some folks I 've talked to like the grain pattern of the Kodak films more .
By the RMS numbers , they are neck - and - neck .
I tend to like the colors of Provia more , even though a lot of folks complain about how blue Fuji slide film is .
I was shooting Fuji Sensia for a while , which appears to be vaguely similar to Provia , but there 's something subtle about Provia that 's better .
Generally , I use this in situations where I might be taking pictures of people or of scenery .
If I know I 'm going to be doing one or the other , I 'll shoot Velvia or Astia .
Kodak is positioning their new Ektar 100 as a viable alternative , but it 's C - 41 print film , not slide film .
I shot the same model with Provia and Astia in the same light and conditions and they are n't kidding when they say that Astia 's meant for people and fashion .
It 's the polar opposite of Velvia , so the colors are n't realistic , they are more pastel - ish , but still punchy .
It somehow manages to warm up skintones without making the scene look like it has been put through a warming filter , which I suspect is being done through careful tuning to the wavelengths the film is sensitive to and not by simply making the film orange .
They always say that it 's got a bigger dynamic range , although I 've found that it 's just as unforgiving of exposure as the other films .
The biggest problem is that if you do n't expose it correctly , the tonality does n't look so good anymore .
It 's finer grained by the numbers , although I doubt you 'd notice an actual difference when you compare it to Provia .
Kodak E100GX seems to be the closest Kodak equivalent .
It 's fairly hard to do gross color balance when you are shooting slide film .
A good filter to adjust daylight film to tungsten is going to suck up several stops of light and you are pretty much guaranteed failure if you try to do it after the fact .
So , there 's a market for tungsten color balanced slide film in ways there has n't been for tungsten color balanced print film .
There used to be more films available , now it 's just Fuji's T64 and Kodak 's 64T .
It used to be that you 'd shoot Ektachrome 320T and push it a few stops ... but you can't anymore .
I started out shooting more Tungsten film , but lately it just sits in the freezer .
Either way , the intended use is generally to shoot indoor shots where , if there 's a window , it 's been covered up with a huge piece of 85N6 or 85N9 plastic to turn the sunlight into tungsten color balance and cut the amount of sunlight coming in .
So , the film is designed for long tripod exposures .
I 've heard noises from people who really hate the difference in colors between the previous generation ( Fujichrome 64T ) and the current generation ( Fujichrome T64 ) .
I have n't shot much of either one , but I have n't noticed much difference either .
Some folks prefer Kodak 's 64T .
I was starting to like 160T , but it 's gone .
I 've been working on a project to shoot all of the films and materials that are likely to disappear , so I shot some Kodachrome 64 .
For the most part , I think Fuji 's latest slide films have surpassed it in all possible ways , which is why people generally do n't shoot it anymore .
The thing I found interesting about it is that it 's got a DMax like Velvia but does n't have the high saturation .
The colors are distorted , but not in a particularly interesting fashion -- kinda greenish .
The basic technological principles of Kodachrome are superior to Ektachrome .
It is easier to make a Kodachrome emulsion that wo n't fade in dark storage than it does to make an Ektachrome emulsion that wo n't fade .
It 's also easier to make it fine - grained .
Even better , the way the layers work ends up creating an approximation of an unsharp mask in the slide to increase the perception of sharpness .
The problem is , you can't get around how fiddly the developing process ends up being .
Towards the 80s and 90s , Kodak tried to develop new versions of Kodachrome using their tabular grain technologies and improved dyes and they might have been able to go somewhere with it , but they did n't get sufficient response from the community and shelved any further effort on it , so the colors of Kodachrome are what you 'd expect from other films that were formulated around the same time .
The real thing that kills Kodachrome is the K - 14 process .
See , unlike everything else , Kodachrome film does n't have incorporated dye couplers , so the chemistry is much more complicated and requires you to expose it carefully to light in the middle of the process .
It 's also fairly toxic compared to E - 6 or B &W chemistry , so you need to be much more careful and you need to go through more efforts to dispose of the chemicals safely .
The guys at Kodak used to develop Kodachrome by hand in the lab if they wanted to run tests , but pretty much everybody else would use huge machines .
Kodak did at one point make a minilab - sized Kodachrome machine that did n't really catch on .
So , while I suspect that a notational new - research Kodachrome would out - perform any slide film on the market , E - 6 seems to be good enough for most folks .
This is an old film .
I shot it because I 've shot it crossed a lot and wanted to try it shot normally .
I do n't think there 's too much to recommend it over modern films for normal use , unless you are matching an existing shot taken with EPP .
It 's really grainy in 35 mm .
I have n't tried it in medium format , but based on how its cousins look , I bet that it looks much better in medium and large format .
The big thing about EPP -- and Ektachrome 100 ( EPN ) and Ektachrome 64 ( EPR ) -- is that they were formulated at a point where Kodak was pretty good at getting the colors accurate , but before everybody started really playing with getting the colors right .
And also because they were the standards for so long in various markets that everybody compensated for any inadequacies by shooting medium or large format and adjusting when you made the printing plates .
It 's pretty much the standard film for crossprocessing , which is where I use it the most .
Now that EPN and EPR have been discontinued , this and Kodachrome 64 are the only color films that are n't modern t- grain emulsions .
E200 is a fairly specialized film for me .
Normally , it 's just like Provia or E100G , just one stop faster and a little grainier .
However , if you pull it out right around sunset , it looks totally different and makes the sky an impressive shade of purple .
But I have n't shot it in 35 mm format yet , so I can't talk about grain .
It used to have a decent advantage in grain size over 400 speed films , but Provia 400X has closed the gap quite a lot .
Most modern films have been tweaked to have very little sensitivity in the extreme red region .
This is great for making people look better and awful for astrophotography because that 's where the hydrogen alpha line lives that 's important for making nebula look impressive .
Except for E200 , which keeps the red region around .
I 'm pretty sure that 's what 's making my sunsets purple in a good way .
Much has been made about Provia 400X by the remaining slide film shooters .
It 's got the grain of a 100 speed film , supposedly , but at 400 speed .
I tried it .
The colors are decent , just like Provia 100 F .
It 's better than Provia 400 F ( the previous generation ) .
The grain is rather much like an old pre-T - grain 100 speed slide film , so I really do n't like it in 35 mm format .
It is good in medium format , however , so I use it for light paintings outdoors .
It 's fastest slide film on the market .
Ektachrome 320T , Ektachrome 400 , Ektachrome P1600 , and MS 100/1000 have all disappeared from the market .

Many religious people suggest that criticism of their beliefs is ' offensive ' and tantamount to ' persecution ' .
This seems quite odd and inappropriate .
Many feel that a person 's beliefs , world - view and lifestyle are a conscious choice that any reasonable person should be allowed to examine , and even scrutinize .

President Barack Obama .
President Barack Obama .
Nope , still can't get used to it .
It 's literally too good to be true .
I must 've died in my sleep and am now having an insane fantasy pumped into my head by the Matrix .
Any minute now Salma Hayek is going to float through the door with a tray of biscuits and I 'll know the game 's up .
Or perhaps I 've just come round from a coma .
The election took place 10 years ago , and what I 've just sat through was actually a Hollywood movie loosely based on real events .
And in a bid to appeal to the multiplex crowd , they decided to jettison all semblance of subtlety .
On the one hand , you had Obama ( Will Smith in admittedly impressive makeup , although the ears never really convinced ) .
He was practically walking on water .
No one 's that nice .
And pitched against him , the Republican campaign , which was so nakedly horrible it could only have been orchestrated by Skeletor .
Nudge - wink comments about " the real America " , underhand attempts to link Obama with terrorism , automated robo-calls whispering desperate fibs into the ears of voters ... if Obama 's grandmother had died while he was at her bedside in Hawaii , they'd have erected billboards claiming he could n't be trusted around white women .
Jesus , guys , why not just change your name to the Bastard Party and march around in long black capes ?
Vote for us , we 're openly despicable .
The scriptwriters clearly decided to balance the nastiness by introducing some satirical comic relief in the form of Sarah Palin , but she was scarcely plausible either .
And they never really nailed her story arc , instead being content to have her wandering through every scene she was in , screeching inept banalities like a rightwing version of Phoebe from Friends .
And what was with the whole Joe the Plumber sub - plot ?
I mean , c'mon , they invited him on tour and everything .
As if .
In the real world , no one would 've bought that for a second .
That 's precisely the sort of thing that breaks the all - important suspension of disbelief .
It did n't help that the guy they cast to play him , Michael Chiklis , is instantly recognisable from his leading role as the corrupt , brutal cop Vic Mackey in the hit TV series The Shield .
And the ending was far too saccharine .
Dancing in the streets ?
Tears of joy around the globe ?
Oh please .
I give it four out of 10 .
A rental at best .
Speaking of fantasy worlds , apologies for being :
a ) indulgent and b ) nerdy , but I have to defend myself here .
Last week Simon Pegg wrote a piece for this paper complaining about the running zombies in my preposterous horror series Dead Set .
Proper zombies do n't run , they walk , he said .
I was all ready to write a stinging riposte until I read his article all the way through and realised it was dauntingly well - argued .
So I 'll keep this short and combative and hope I get away with it .
Simon : your outright rejection of running zombies leaves you exposed , in a very real and damning sense , as a terrible racist .
And if the recent election of Obama has taught us one thing , it 's that the age of such knee - jerk prejudice is firmly behind us .
Still , let 's indulge your disgraceful bigotry for a moment by assuming speedy zombies need defending , and list the reasons why ours ran , shall we ?
1 ) I like running zombies .
I just do .
2 ) They HAD to run or the story would n't work .
The outbreak had to knock the entire country out of action before the producers had time to evacuate the studios .
3 ) We had to clearly and immediately differentiate Dead Set from Shaun of the Dead , which had cornered the market on zombie - centric horror - comedy .
Blame yourself , Simon : if you 'd made that film badly , it would n't have been so popular , and drawing a distinction would n't have been an issue .
Each time one of our zombies breaks into a sprint , it 's your own stupid talented fault .
4 ) Even George Romero , the godfather of zombies , bent the rules from time to time .
Witness the very first zombie in Night of the Living Dead , which moves at a fair old whack and even picks up a rock to try to smash a car window .
Or the two kiddywink zombies in Dawn of the Dead , who burst out of a room and run - yes run - towards Ken Foree .
I know you saw these scenes .
You know you saw these scenes .
And you also know that if this were a trial , this would be the moment where you splutter in the witness box and admit you 're completely wrong .
5 ) Running zombies are , to be frank , cheaper than stumbling ones .
You only need one or two to present a massive threat .
I love a huge mass of shambling undead as much as the next guy , but we could n't afford that many crowd scenes .
The original plan was to set the final episode six months in the future , by which time the zombies were badly decayed and could only shuffle ( although " freshies " would still run ) , but budget and time constraints ruled this out .
Which would you rather see - running zombies or absolutely no zombies at all ?
Hmm ?
HMM ?
Face facts .
It 's time to embrace diversity , Simon .
Make room in your heart for all breeds of zombie .
Except ones that talk .
They 're just silly .

Former Yahoo !
CEO 's daughter to a Vegas bouncer after punching him for not letting her into a club .
He 's suing .
Why do we think in this environment that the jury is going to side with him ?
( Are those guillotines we hear being sharpened ? )
TMZ : A security guard at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas is suing the daughter of former Yahoo honcho Terry Semel for allegedly pummeling him in a drunken stupor .
In a lawsuit filed yesterday in L.A. County Superior Court , Jaroslaw Jarczok claims he was working security last August at 4:00 AM at PURE Nightclub when Courtenay was " quite intoxicated due to alcohol and / or chemical or other substances . "
He claims she got all foul - mouthed on him .
One thing led to another and he eventually handcuffed Semel , the GF of Tila Tequila .
That 's when she allegedly struck Jarczok in the face and uttered these soon - to - be immortal words , which deserve a separate line in bold type :
" Do you even know who I am , f** king idiot ?... Google me , you dumb f**k . "
Jarczok says he 's been humiliated and " anxious about receiving harassing comments by friends ... "
He wants unspecified damages .

In - flight Internet access may also enable videoconferencing on board airplanes , effectively closing off one of the last refuges from meetings for business travelers .
At least , that 's what Cisco Systems Inc. CEO John Chambers predicted at Symposium / ITxpo 2008 last week .
During a keynote question - and - answer session at the Gartner Inc. conference , Chambers continued to make the argument that videoconferencing can significantly reduce corporate travel .
He claimed that Cisco has cut its own travel by 30 % , thereby saving about US $ 150 million , through the use of its Tele Presence technology -- one of a new breed of high - definition videoconferencing systems from various vendors .
" I want to be on a plane and have TelePresence in front of me , " quipped Thomas Bittman , one of the Gartner analysts who interviewed Chambers onstage here .
" Well , the answer is , you are probably going to , " said Chambers , who predicted that the arrival of Wi-Fi services and other types of Internet connections on planes will enable travelers to hook up devices to the Web -- potentially moving in - flight Internet access well beyond mere entertainment options .
Chambers said he sees such capabilities becoming available within 18 months or so .
Chambers also bucked the economic gloom and doom by saying that he plans to expand Cisco 's IT spending during 2009 .
" We are going to grow our expenses in IT , regardless of what the economy does , by 10 % next year , " he said .
If other companies follow Cisco 's lead on spending , it likely would be a good thing for the networking vendor 's bottom line .
But Chambers advised IT managers that budget cuts are likely at companies where IT is primarily viewed as an expense .
At businesses where technology is seen as " the enabler of business strategy , " he said , economic slowdowns can be used to " gain huge competitive advantage . "
For instance , a CIO can make an argument for increasing IT spending if he tells his company 's CEO that doing so could help grow business activity by 5 % to 10 % or " dramatically reduce the risk " involved in combining two companies that are being merged , Chambers said .
This story , " Expect Videoconferencing in Flight Soon , Cisco Says " was originally published by Computerworld .
On October 15 , Chairman Ben Bernanke delivered a lecture to the Economic Club of New York , titled , “ Stabilizing the Financial Markets and the Economy . ”
I am sure the title resonated to members of the Economic Club of New York , who saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall another 733 points before the day was over .
He began his speech with these inspiring words :
I will focus today on the economic and financial challenges we face and why I believe we are well positioned to move forward .
I am reminded of Mort Sahl ’s comedy album in 1958 : “ The Future Lies Ahead . ”
Yes , it does .
I , for one , have no desire to be well positioned to move backward .
The problems now evident in the markets and in the economy are large and complex , but , in my judgment , our government now has the tools it needs to confront and solve them .
Does he mean that only now does the government have the tools ?
Is he saying that for the last sixty years , Keynesian economists , Chairmen of the Federal Reserve System , and Secretaries of the Treasury did not have these tools ?
They said they did .
Were they wrong ?
The government has always had the tools by which it has dealt with the crisis over the last six weeks : taxation , inflation , and blarney .
It would have been polite of Dr. Bernanke to tell us about these “ large and complex ” problems .
He did n’t .
He gave no indication of a looming crisis so large that it would bring the international capital markets to gridlock , i.e. , “ frozen . ”
Actually , the capital markets were not frozen .
I was offered a 30 - year fixed - interest mortgage for 5.7 % two weeks ago , with 10 % down .
Prevailing interest rates revealed no evidence of freezing up , according to free market economist Robert Higgs .
But without the hoopla about frozen markets , politicians around the world would not have capitulated to an increase of government debt of something in the range of $ 4 trillion in one month .
Our strategy will continue to evolve and be refined as we adapt to new developments and the inevitable setbacks .
“ Evolve . ” “ Be refined . ” Translation : “ Making this up as we go along . ”
But we will not stand down until we have achieved our goals of repairing and reforming our financial system and restoring prosperity .
“ Restoring prosperity . ”
Yes .
Yet somehow I do not recall that Dr. Bernanke , President Bush , or Henry Paulson ever admitted before that we had lost our prosperity .
As I recall — I am getting older — they all insisted repeatedly that there was no recession at all .
As in all past crises , at the root of the problem is a loss of confidence by investors and the public in the strength of key financial institutions and markets .
A lack of confidence is a symptom of the crises , but the question arises :
What was the basis of this loss of confidence ?
He avoids the answer : a looming recession in the real economy .
The possibility of such a recession was denied by all policy - makers until about six weeks ago .
The crisis will end when comprehensive responses by political and financial leaders restore that trust , bringing investors back into the market and allowing the normal business of extending credit to households and firms to resume .
This is the Party Line , all over the West : the crisis stems from the financial system .
A bailout of the financial system by taxpayers is the only workable solution .
No one has suggested that the crisis was engineered by Alan Greenspan ’s policies of loose money , and the bankers ’ faith that the government would bail out the system in a crisis — which is exactly what the government is attempting to do .
In that regard , we are , in one respect at least , better off than those who dealt with earlier financial crises :
Generally , during past crises , broad - based government engagement came late , usually at a point at which most financial institutions were insolvent or nearly so .
What would Dr. Bernanke call the Bear Stearns fire sale in March ?
What would he call the Office of Thrift Supervision ’s seizure of Washington Mutual on September 15 ?
What would he call the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15 ?
That was the largest bankruptcy in American history , dwarfing Enron : half a trillion dollars .
The value of its bonds was recently settled at less than 9 cents on the dollar .
Waiting too long to respond has usually led to much greater direct costs of the intervention itself and , more importantly , magnified the painful effects of financial turmoil on households and businesses .
That is not the situation we face today .
It is n’t ?
It surely looks as though it is .
The recession has not played out .
That was the message sent by the stock market before the day was over .
Fortunately , the Congress and the Administration have acted at a time when the great majority of financial institutions , though stressed by highly volatile and difficult market conditions , remain strong and capable of fulfilling their critical function of providing new credit for our economy .
Substitute the words “ fiat money ” for “ new credit , ” and you have the Federal Reserve ’s solution .
It was Greenspan ’s solution in the 22 % stock market meltdown in October 1987 .
It was his solution in 1999 .
It was his solution after 9 - 11 .
Each time , it has created asset bubbles .
This prompt and decisive action by our political leaders will allow us to restore more normal market functioning much more quickly and at lower ultimate cost than would otherwise have been the case .
Moreover , we are seeing not just a national response but a global response to the crisis , commensurate with its global nature .
In short , politicians have put taxpayers on the hook for at least $ 4 trillion in just six weeks .
What caused this ?
Federal Reserve policy under Greenspan ?
This was never mentioned .
It was world confidence in the United States .
Large inflows of capital into the United States and other countries stimulated a reaching for yield , an underpricing of risk , excessive leverage , and the development of complex and opaque financial instruments that seemed to work well during the credit boom but have been shown to be fragile under stress .
But what was the source of these large inflows of capital ?
The capital fairy , perhaps ?
No ?
Actually , a team of capital fairies .
One capital fairy is the People ’s Bank of China , which inflates at 20 % per annum .
It buys U.S. Treasury debt .
Another is Russia , whose oil exports have blessed the central bank with half a trillion in foreign exchange reserves .
But China and Russia are still buying Western governments ’ debt .
So , what happened ?
Why did the West ’s financial system go into decline ?
The Austrian theory of the business cycle tells us .
As I have been writing since early 2007 , Greenspan ’s policy of monetary inflation was followed by Bernanke ’s policy of tight money .
The Austrian theory of the business cycle teaches that this reduction in monetary inflation creates a recession .
That was why I began predicting recession in 2007 .
That was why Dr. Kurt Richebächer predicted a monumental financial crisis around the world .
He predicted this for six years , 2001 to 2007 .
He died in August 2007 , as the first stage of the crisis revealed itself .
The unwinding of these developments , including a sharp deleveraging and a headlong retreat from credit risk , led to highly strained conditions in financial markets and a tightening of credit that has hamstrung economic growth .
This is exactly what Richebächer had predicted , based on the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
The important thing from the point of view of the men in charge , who did not see this coming and who denied that it was a crisis until the government , without Congress ’s approval , nationalized the American mortgage market by nationalizing Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac on September 7 , is to make it look as though the government has a handle on all this .
The Federal Reserve responded to these developments in two broad ways .
First , following classic tenets of central banking , the Fed has provided large amounts of liquidity to the financial system to cushion the effects of tight conditions in short - term funding markets .
In other words , it returned to Greenspan ’s policies of fiat money .
You can see the chart here .
Second , to reduce the downside risks to growth emanating from the tightening of credit , the Fed , in a series of moves that began last September , has significantly lowered its target for the federal funds rate .
The FED lowered its target because the T - bill rate fell to .03 % in September , indicating total panic in the capital markets .
Banks would not lend to each other , so the FED made fiat money available for them .
We will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to improve market functioning and liquidity , to reduce pressures in key credit and funding markets , and to complement the steps the Treasury and foreign governments will be taking to strengthen the financial system .
What tools ?
Inflation and asset swapping .
The FED swaps T - bills for bonds that banks and finance agencies hold that have no market , despite their AAA - rating .
The banks then tell the regulators that these Treasury assets , borrowed for 30 days ( but renewable forever ) constitute their capital .
“ Look at all this rock - solid Treasury paper .
We ’re solvent ! ”
It is a massive charade that the whole world understands is a charade .
On this charade the recovery of the world economy is supposedly secure — until the FED runs out of Treasury debt to swap .
A chart of its reserves is here .
With the exception of Austrian School economists , who reject government interference — before the crisis and also after — all other schools of economic opinion abandon their commitment to free market solutions as soon as a credit crisis threatens the stock market .
In 1970 , Leonard E. Read of the Foundation for Economic Education , wrote an essay , “ Sinking in a Sea of Buts . ”
He was referring to this statement , “ I believe in the free market , but .
. . . ”
Dr. Bernanke is a typical but -man .
The Federal Reserve believes that , whenever possible , the difficulties experienced by firms in financial distress should be addressed through private - sector arrangements — for example , by raising new equity capital , as many firms have done ; by negotiations leading to a merger or acquisition ; or by an orderly wind - down .
Government assistance should be provided with the greatest reluctance and only when the stability of the financial system , and thus the health of the broader economy , is at risk .
I love this : “ greatest reluctance . ”
That ’s what I have observed of the government over the last half - century : great reluctance to interfere , to tax , and to inflate .
Maybe you noticed that , too .
In those cases when financial stability is broadly threatened , however , intervention to protect the public interest is not only justified but must be undertaken forcefully and without hesitation .
Translation : “ Whenever the solvency of large New York City banks ( or Bank of America ) is threatened , the Federal Reserve System intervenes .
This has been true since 1914 . ”
Importantly , the financial rescue legislation , which I will discuss later , will give us better choices .
In the future , the Treasury will have greater resources available to prevent the failure of a financial institution when such a failure would pose unacceptable risks to the financial system as a whole .
Translation : “ Until the Treasury spends the $ 700 billion , which will not take too long , we have got this under control .
When the Treasury burns through the first $ 700 billion , it will be back to Congress for more .
It will get it , because the 2008 elections will be behind us , so Congress will not even pretend to resist . ”
With respect to the Treasury ’s access to more money , see this .
It explains Bernanke ’s confidence .
If the crisis originated with flows of capital coming into our capital markets — his argument — and if Asian and Russian central banks were the primary sources of this credit — my argument — then what we need is a free market program to block this from ever happening again .
The FED has now adopted a policy where the United States , as the world ’s leading debtor nation ( an $ 800 billion a year balance of payments deficit ) will lend newly created dollars to European central banks , so that they can lend to American banks and brokerage houses operating abroad .
Indeed , this week we agreed to extend unlimited dollar funding to the European Central Bank , the Bank of England , the Bank of Japan , and the Swiss National Bank .
These agreements enable foreign central banks to provide dollars to financial institutions in their jurisdictions , which helps improve the functioning of dollar funding markets globally and relieve pressures on U.S. funding markets .
It bears noting that these arrangements carry no risk to the U.S. taxpayer , as our loans are to the foreign central banks themselves , who take responsibility for the extension of dollar credit within their jurisdictions .
No risk to the taxpayer ?
Why , it ’s the capital fairy again .
The FED creates money to lend , which creates worldwide dollar inflation , and the taxpayer does not bear the costs .
Is n’t central banking creative ?
The expansion of Federal Reserve lending is helping financial firms cope with reduced access to their usual sources of funding and thus is supporting their lending to nonfinancial firms and households .
Nonetheless , the intensification of the financial crisis over the past month or so made clear that a more powerful , comprehensive approach involving the fiscal authorities was needed to address these problems more effectively .
On that basis , the Administration , with the support of the Federal Reserve , asked the Congress for a new program aimed at stabilizing our financial markets .
Translation : “ The FED in September pumped in new money at an annual rate of 132 % ( adjusted monetary base ) .
This could not go on without destroying the dollar .
So , the Treasury got Congress to borrow money to bail out the financial industry .
This way , the FED can back off the printing press . ”
Second , the Treasury will use some of the resources provided under the bill to purchase troubled assets from banks and other financial institutions , in most cases using market - based mechanisms .
Market - based mechanisms ?
What market - based mechanisms ?
We have seen the nationalization of the mortgage market .
We have seen an enormous increase in government debt .
Mortgage - related assets , including mortgage - backed securities and whole loans , will be the focus of the program , although the law permits flexibility in the types of assets purchased as needed to promote financial stability .
“ Flexibility in the type of assets purchased ” means “ anything that large New York City banks want to palm off on the government . ”
Unclogging the markets for mortgage - related assets should put banks and other institutions in a better position to raise capital from the private sector and increase the willingness of counterparties to engage .
With time , the provision of equity capital to the banking system and the purchase of troubled assets will help credit flow more freely , thus supporting economic growth .
Translation : “ When the banks stick taxpayers with toxic debt , private investors will start buying bank stock again . . . especially since the Treasury will also be buying bank stock , as Paulson has announced . ”
These measures will lead to a much stronger financial system over time , but steps are also necessary to address the immediate problem of lack of trust and confidence .
Translation : “ The economy is still heading into the tank , despite fiat money , asset swaps , and the $ 700 billion bailout .
Lack of trust and confidence are with us still . ”
I would like to stress once again that the taxpayers ’ interests were very much in our minds and those of the Congress when these programs were designed .
Translation : “ Ho , ho , ho .
And , I might add , ha , ha , ha . ”
In the case of the TARP program , the funds allocated are not simple expenditures , but rather acquisitions of assets or equity positions , which the Treasury will be able to sell or redeem down the road .
Indeed , it is possible that taxpayers could turn a profit from the program , although , given the great uncertainties , no assurances can be provided .
Taxpayers could turn a profit .
“ No assurances can be provided . ”
He ’s got that right !
If there is any profit to be turned , Congress will allocate it for more pork .
That $ 700 billion is gone forever .
But still the charade goes on .
Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step , but even if they stabilize as we hope they will , broader economic recovery will not happen right away .
Economic activity had been decelerating even before the recent intensification of the crisis .
Translation : “ A recession is coming , and it is going to be a whopper . ”
Ultimately , the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning .
Translation : “ If Main Street suffers , Main Street will be compelled by Congress to bail out Wall Street . . . again . ”
I have laid out for you today an extraordinary series of actions taken by policymakers throughout our government and around the globe .
Americans can be confident that every resource is being brought to bear to address the current crisis : historical understanding , technical expertise , economic analysis , financial insight , and political leadership .
Translation : “ It is business as usual : inflate , tax , and juggle the books . ”
I am not suggesting the way forward will be easy , but I strongly believe that we now have the tools we need to respond with the necessary force to these challenges .
The tools have not changed .
The rhetoric has changed .
In short , it ’s lipstick on the pig .
Again .
Although much work remains and more difficulties surely lie ahead , I remain confident that the American economy , with its great intrinsic vitality and aided by the measures now available , will emerge from this period with renewed vigor .
Translation : “ Deficits do n’t matter . ”
CONCLUSION
The more things change , the more they stay the same .

Chandrayaan - 1 , India ’s first unmanned spacecraft mission to moon , successfully entered lunar orbit on November 8 .
The spacecraft fired its engines to reduce velocity and enable the Moon ’s gravity to capture it ; engines were fired for 817 seconds when Chandrayaan - 1 was about 500 km away from the moon .
Next up for the spacecraft will be to reduce the height of its lunar orbit to about 100 km .
Then , on Nov. 14th or 15th , the Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) will be launched , and crash into the Moon ’s surface ( more about the MIP below ) .
If you enjoy watching animations and want to see exactly how the spacecraft attained its lunar orbit , here ’s a few animations for you :
A simple animation of how the spacecraft went from its spiraling elliptical orbit around Earth to its now spiraling elliptical orbit around the moon can be found on the India Space Agency ’s site .
( Sorry , the file was to big to insert here . )
Another quite large animation that was created by Doug Ellison ( of UnmannedSpaceflight.com ) shows how the X-ray Spectrometer aboard Chandrayaan - 1 will work .
This one takes a long time to download , but the wait is well worth it : the animation is spectacular .
Here ’s a video that shows an animation of the entire mission ; again , some great animation here .
Enjoy .
The spacecraft is now orbiting the moon in an elliptical orbit that passes over the polar regions of the moon .
The nearest point of this orbit ( perigee ) lies at a distance of about 504 km from the moon ’s surface while the farthest point ( apogee ) lies at about 7502 km .
Currently , Chandrayaan - 1 takes about 11 hours to orbit the moon .
The MIP carries three instruments :
Radar Altimeter – measures the altitude of the probe during descent and for qualifying technologies for future landing missions .
Video Imaging System – acquires close range images of the surface of the Moon during descent .
The video imaging system consists of analog CCD camera .
Mass Spectrometer measures the constituents of lunar atmosphere during descent .

MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
A car bomb exploded Thursday in a parking lot at the University of Navarra in Pamplona , Spain , sparking a massive fire , but " luckily , " no one was nearby and there were no deaths , Spain 's interior minister said .
" There could have been an enormous tragedy today at the University of Navarra , " Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said hours after the attack in a televised address .
Hospital officials told CNN that 27 people suffered minor injuries , including one American woman and five other non-Spaniards .
The Basque separatist group ETA is suspected to be behind the attack .
The car , packed with an unknown quantity of explosives , was parked in a lot near the university 's library and detonated shortly after 11 a.m. local time ( 6 a.m. ET ) , Rubalcaba said .
Watch witness describe the blast »
Campus authorities shut down the entire campus shortly after the blast to search for a possible second explosive device near the science building , about a half kilometer ( .3 mile ) from the car bombing , according to CNN 's partner station in Spain , CNN + .
Watch report on Pamplona car bomb »
No device was found and the search was called off Thursday afternoon , according to a university spokesman and a representative for the national government 's main office in Navarra .
Most of the campus was reopened ; only the area surrounding the bomb blast remained cordoned off , they said .
Classes are expected to resume as scheduled on Friday , the university spokesman said .
The car bomb sparked a massive fire in the campus ' Central Building , where about 400 students and staff were located at the time , university spokesman Jesus Diaz told CNN +.
Video from the scene showed fire engulfing part of the building and thick clouds of black smoke billowing over the campus .
Authorities in Spain 's Basque province of Alava received a warning call at 9:50 a.m. in the name of ETA .
Watch aftermath of the blast »
The warning call to the DYA emergency services in Alava said the car bomb would strike a university campus in the city of Vitoria about an hour after the phone call , prompting emergency officials to search that campus and determine that the call was merely a false alarm , Rubalcaba said .
" So whoever planted the bomb either gave an intentionally misleading warning call or they made a mistake , " he said in his televised address .
According to CNN+ , the University of Navarra has been targeted by ETA six times in the past 30 years , and one faculty member said it is unclear why .
" It is not a political university , " Professor Maria Teresa La Porte told CNN .
" We do n't understand . "
" If they are looking for innocent victims , the place to find them is here , " she said .
" There is no way to stop them . "
She said it is an open campus with students from various backgrounds -- including Basque -- where people " can come here completely freely . "
The blast could be heard across the campus of the private school , which has 12,000 students -- including more than 1,000 scholars from countries outside Spain .
It is also home to Spain 's top- rated journalism school , which is located not too far from the blast site .
A spokeswoman for Clinica Universitaria de Navarra -- located across the street from the university -- said that 24 patients were treated for injuries ranging from glass cuts to hearing problems .
Most have been released and only two are expected to remain overnight , she said .
Two other patients are being treated at Hospital Virgen del Camino , also in Pamplona , but their nationalities were not clear .
Those being treated at Clinica Universitaria de Navarra included 18 Spaniards and six others with the following nationalities : American woman from California , age 20 ; Italian woman , age 28 ; Portuguese woman , age 23 ; Chilean woman , age 25 ; Peruvian man , age 28 and Philippines man , age 34 .
Thursday 's explosion came just days after Spanish police arrested four suspected ETA members early Tuesday .
Authorities accused them of forming a terrorist cell that was ready to attack , the Spanish Interior Ministry said in a statement .
Three of the suspects were arrested in or near the city of Pamplona , in Spain 's northern Navarra region , which has Basque roots and was to be the base for the alleged cell , the statement said .
The fourth suspect was arrested in the city of Valencia , on Spain 's eastern coast .
Police seized two revolvers and ammunition ; various timers that might be used for bombs ; detonating cord ; items that might be used to make a bomb attached to the underside of vehicles ; various substances that might be used to make explosives ; and computer documentation , the ministry said .
All four suspects -- three men and a woman -- were born in Pamplona and range in age from 26 to 29 , the ministry said .
ETA is blamed for more than 800 killings in its four - decade - long fight for Basque independence .
The European Union and the United States list ETA as a terrorist group .

SHOULD Barack Obama win the presidency and Democrats take full control of Congress , next year will see a real legislative attempt to bring back the Fairness Doctrine – and to diminish conservatives ’ influence on broadcast radio , the one medium they dominate .
Yes , the Obama campaign said some months back that the candidate does n’t seek to re-impose this regulation , which , until Ronald Reagan ’s FCC phased it out in the 1980s , required TV and radio broadcasters to give balanced airtime to opposing viewpoints or face steep fines or even loss of license .
But most Democrats – including party elders Nancy Pelosi , John Kerry and Al Gore – strongly support the idea of mandating “ fairness . ”

Ralph Peters : America the Weak
Editorial : Get Well , Dick Cheney
Would a President Obama veto a new Fairness Doctrine if Congress enacted one ?
It ’s doubtful .
The Fairness Doctrine was an astonishingly bad idea .
It ’s a too - tempting power for government to abuse .
When the doctrine was in effect , both Democratic and Republican administrations regularly used it to harass critics on radio and TV .
Second , a new Fairness Doctrine would drive political talk radio off the dial .
If a station ran a big - audience conservative program like , say , Laura Ingraham ’s , it would also have to run a left - leaning alternative .
But liberals do n’t do well on talk radio , as the failure of Air America and indeed all other liberal efforts in the medium to date show .
Stations would likely trim back conservative shows so as to avoid airing unsuccessful liberal ones .
Then there ’s all the lawyers you ’d have to hire to respond to the regulators measuring how much time you devoted to this topic or that .
Too much risk and hassle , many radio executives would conclude .
Why not switch formats to something less charged – like entertainment or sports coverage ?
For those who dismiss this threat to freedom of the airwaves as unlikely , consider how the politics of “ fairness ” might play out with the public .
A Rasmussen poll last summer found that fully 47 percent of respondents backed the idea of requiring radio and television stations to offer “ equal amounts of conservative and liberal political commentary , ” with 39 percent opposed .
Liberals , Rasmussen found , support a Fairness Doctrine by 54 percent to 26 percent , while Republicans and unaffiliated voters were more evenly divided .
The language of “ fairness ” is seductive .
Even with control of Washington and public support , Dems would have a big fight in passing a Fairness Doctrine .
Rush Limbaugh & Co. would n’t sit by idly and let themselves be regulated into silence , making the outcome of any battle uncertain .
But Obama and the Democrats also plan other , more subtle regulations that would achieve much the same outcome .
He and most Democrats want to expand broadcasters ’ public - interest duties .
One such measure would be to impose greater “ local accountability ” on them – requiring stations to carry more local programming whether the public wants it or not .
The reform would entail setting up community boards to make their demands known when station licenses come up for renewal .
The measure is clearly aimed at national syndicators like Clear Channel that offer conservative shows .
It ’s a Fairness Doctrine by subterfuge .
Obama also wants to relicense stations every two years ( not eight , as is the case now ) , so these monitors would be a constant worry for stations .
Finally , the Democrats also want more minority - owned stations and plan to intervene in the radio marketplace to ensure that outcome .
It ’s worth noting , as Jesse Walker does in the latest Reason magazine , that Trinity Church , the controversial church Obama attended for many years , is heavily involved in the media - reform movement , having sought to restore the Fairness Doctrine , prevent media consolidation and deny licenses to stations that refuse to carry enough children ’s programming .
Regrettably , media freedom has n’t been made an issue by the McCain campaign , perhaps because the maverick senator is himself no fan of unbridled political speech , as his long support of aggressive campaign - finance regulation underscores .
But the threat to free speech is real – and profoundly disturbing .

I was talking with a coworker earlier today about how sad it was for Barack Obama ’s grandmother to have died on the day before the election .
My coworker took the sadness one step further , wondering if Madelyn Dunham ’s vote ( she voted by early absentee ballot ) would now not be counted .
Not knowing the answer , I called the Office of Elections in Hawaii .
Kevin Cronin , chief election officer for the state , just got back to me .
Here ’s what he said :
Ms. Dunhams absentee mail ballot was received and reviewed under the Hawaii standards for processing absentee mail ballots …
She was alive at that time .
Her ballot will be opened tomorrow , and it will be counted in the same way that all absentee voters would be treated under our law .
The key point appears to be that Ms. Dunham was alive at the time her absentee ballot was received and reviewed , and that it met the standards for review at that time .
Madelyn Dunham ’s vote will count , even if she is not here to learn the final tally .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - U.N. member states voted in record numbers on Wednesday to urge the United States to lift its 46 - year - old economic embargo against Cuba , in a non-binding measure adopted for the 17th straight year .

The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to urge the United States to lift its 46 - year - old embargo against Cuba in a resolution adopted for the 17th consecutive year .
REUTERS / Enrique De La Osa
The General Assembly passed a resolution entitled “ necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba ” with 185 votes in favor , three against and two abstentions .
The resolution will have no impact on the outgoing administration of U.S. President George W. Bush , who in an October 10 speech called Cuba a “ dungeon ” and vowed not to lift the embargo until Havana released political prisoners .
“ We will change our policy when the people running Cuba free people of conscience from the prisons .
But until then , we wo n’t change , ” he said in Florida , home to many Cuban exiles who oppose the island ’s communist government .
Neither of the candidates standing in next Tuesday ’s U.S. presidential election is expected to abolish the embargo .
However , while Republican John McCain supports keeping it , Democrat Barack Obama has backed loosening some parts of it .
Voting with the United States against the U.N. resolution were Israel and the Pacific island state of Palau .
Micronesia and the Marshall Islands abstained .
The General Assembly has told the United States to lift the embargo every year since 1992 .
Last year ’s resolution was approved by 184 - 4 , with one abstention .
This year ’s vote was the first since long - time Cuban leader Fidel Castro handed over to his brother Raul in February .
The shift has not swayed the Bush administration , which has tightened the embargo during its term of office , slapping restrictions on visits to Cuba and remittances to families .
The financial and trade embargo , which Cuba calls an “ economic blockade , ” was imposed by President John F. Kennedy in response to Cuba ’s alignment with the Soviet Union during the Cold War .
OLDER THAN OBAMA
Presenting the resolution , Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque denounced the “ illegal and unjust blockade ” .
Seven in 10 Cubans had spent all their lives under “ this irrational and useless policy , ” which , he noted , was older than Obama .
The next U.S. president “ should decide whether he will admit that the blockade is a failed policy ... or if he persists , with stubbornness and cruelty , to try to defeat the Cuban people through hunger and disease , ” Perez Roque said .
U.S. envoy Ronald Godard said the policy was “ carefully designed to permit the Cuban people access to food and humanitarian goods , but to limit the ability of Cuba ’s repressive government to benefit and consolidate power through its authoritarian control over the Cuban economy . ”
Cuba had rejected three offers of U.S. aid following hurricanes Gustav and Ike , which ravaged the island in September , and had not responded to a fourth , Godard said .
The refusals showed “ the lack of interest the Castro regime has in the well - being of its own people , ” he added , saying Cuba chose instead “ to prolong their suffering as a pretext for proposing resolutions such as the one we vote on today . ”
Perez Roque said Cuba could not accept “ alleged assistance from those who have intensified the blockade . ”
The U.S. government had refused to let Havana buy relief supplies with private credits from U.S. companies , he said .
U.S. foes from Iran to Venezuela also lambasted the embargo .
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said it was “ crude pressure by the United States of America against a sovereign state ” that was “ a remnant from the days of the Cold War . ”
But , as in the past , U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere also voted for the resolution , many objecting to the principle of a U.S. domestic law having extra-territorial impact .
Speaking for the European Union , French envoy Jean - Pierre Lacroix said the embargo was “ contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade ” and the EU supported the resolution despite faulting Cuba ’s human rights practices .
The EU scrapped diplomatic sanctions against Cuba in June .
As AIG execs are trying to recover from their spa scandal , news emerges that officials also spent possibly $ 500,000 on a golf retreat at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas .
This is the third retreat AIG had scheduled for the month after it was bailed out by the federal government .
Maybe employees just wanted to take their minds off of the woes at their firm .
Ironic then that this post - bailout partying scandal wo n't seem to go away .
NY Post : The Post has learned that officials [ at AIG ] spent tens of thousands a day on golf outings after collecting a huge government bailout ...
The golf and spa outing Sept. 28-30 came just two weeks after the Federal Reserve stepped in Sept. 17 to save AIG from imminent bankruptcy from it bad bets .
The outing for 50 AIG representatives - said by several sources to cost as much as $ 500,000 - was at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas .
Hosting the junket was Keith Burger , the national sales manager of AIG Sun America 's wholesale variable annuities unit , and Leslie Hunnicutt , the unit 's managing director .
An AIG spokesman called the Mandalay Bay outing a " sales and training event " and disputed claims it cost $ 500,000 , saying it cost only about $ 50,000 .

One Size Fits All Versus The Right Tool for the Job
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 10 , 2008
On Internetnews.com , Christopher Saunders asks if Linux is really necessary for the desktop .
He relates a discussion he had with a creative / marketing executive recently , and the doubts that this executive has about the ability of open source alternatives to meet his company 's needs .
This conversation goes astray with the word " necessary . "
Is Linux necessary ?
Is Windows necessary ?
Perhaps a Mac would do better here ?
A key point that many open source detractors -- and supporters -- miss is that there does n't have to be an all or nothing approach to using free software .
Both sides forget , too often , that a computer is a tool .
Chainsaws and paring knives are at heart the same tool -- they are designed to cut .
But coring an apple with a chainsaw or taking a paring knife to a beech tree is madness .
The tools might be similar , but they might not be the right tools for the task at hand .
For the sake of honesty , I 'll admit this " one size fits all " notion is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to software discussion .
It rubs the wrong way from both sides of the argument .
Saunders mentions the GIMP / Photoshop comparison .
He is talking about using GIMP in place of Photoshop in terms of graphics professionals .
For a vast number of users , GIMP is likely far more powerful an application than they would ever need .
Photoshop , for this audience , would be more than overkill .
Is it necessary to use an application that handles CMYK and other print - specific functions when the end - user 's goal is to simply resize , crop , or color balance photos ?
Is it necessary for straight web design ?
No , and GIMP would do the job quite nicely in this regard .
But the person Saunders was speaking with would likely need the print media features that Photoshop offers .
Though GIMP has plugins that give some support in these areas , they are n't perfected or necessarily complete .
He was discussing replacing Photoshop with GIMP in an industry ( one of the few ) it just would n't fit the bill .
Put aside the notion that trying the mentioned applications ( OpenOffice , GIMP ) would require switching to a Linux desktop ( both are cross- platform ) .
Just as there are not truly any " one size fits all " applications , the introduction to open source software does n't need to be all or nothing .
If an individual , or office , wants and is able to make a clean break into open source software , that 's great .
It 's probably not the norm , though , especially in a workplace environment .
That is fine , too .
I 'd be willing to venture that people and offices using open source applications -- and keep using them , and recommending them to others , over the long term -- have gradually introduced new aspects and applications into existing systems .
Most open source applications operate well and produce the same end result as their proprietary counterparts .
They are not the same though , and not only from an open code standpoint .
From a tech viewpoint , it 's easy to say that the differences are transparent -- even when considering the user interface .
They are n't transparent to many , however .
Easing a business ( or oneself ) into the open source water an application at a time may lead to a more successful transition than just jumping in headlong ever would .
The bottom line is that open source software does a lot of things really well -- and it is , in many ways , equivalent or superior to its proprietary counterparts .
There are areas , however , that go beyond general desktop computing where it just is n't there -- yet .
We need to break ourselves -- and others -- from the notion that it has to be all or nothing .
Keep using that crucial proprietary application , if it is needed to do your job -- but is that closed browser necessary ?
How about that office suite ?
There 's a one - in - four chance that Sen .
John McCain will die in the next four years , according to a contested interpretation of risks posed by the presidential candidate 's history of skin cancer .
" His mortality risk translates to 22 percent over a first term , " said John Alam , a biotechnology consultant and former cancer researcher who crunched the numbers on McCain 's cancer history .
That figure is roughly twice the death risk of a white male of McCain 's age , but without McCain 's past melanoma .
Some researchers , however , think Alam 's model fails to account for McCain 's continued health .
" If after five years there 's no recurrence , his chance of survival for the next five years and the remainder of his life are significantly increased , " said Stanley Leong , a University of California , San Francisco oncologist whose research was cited by Alam in the estimate , published today in The Lancet .
That a metastatic skin cancer removed from McCain 's left temple in 2000
has not reappeared is among the limited health information currently known about the candidate , who has been criticized for failing to disclose his complete medical records .
A statement prepared by Mayo Clinic doctors is available on McCain 's website and includes basic information about that melanoma — enough for Alam to plug the figures into a standard model of post - melanoma mortality risk prediction .
The model was developed in 1996 , and uses four variables : the age and sex of a cancer patient , as well as the site of the tumor and its dimensions .
McCain was 64 when the lesion was found ; it was thick and located on his temple , both of which place him in the model 's high - risk category .
Alam calculated that McCain had a 12 percent annual chance of dying , some four times higher than the average white male of McCain 's age .
But doctors have not found evidence of cancer in tests of McCain's
sentinel lymph nodes , which are used as early warning signs of recurrence .
Such tests did n't exist when Alam 's model was developed ;
using sentinel lymph node research authored by Leong , he accounted for these by halving McCain 's annual mortality risk to 6 percent .
" You can go a long time with no sign of the melanoma being around , and then it comes back , " said Alam .
Leong , however , said that the highest risk of melanoma recurrence exists in the several years following its initial diagnosis and removal .
Referring to newer mortality risk models that emphasize the early years of melanoma recurrence , he said that Alam should have reduced McCain 's risk even further .
" We never say a patient will be cured , " said Leong , but called McCain 's continued health " very encouraging . "
But Alam said that newer models do n't yet have reliable long - term cancer survival data of the sort needed to make sense of McCain 's situation .
Potentially complicating the discussion is Alam 's admitted political and financial support of McCain 's opponent , Senator Barack Obama .
Alam insisted that his politics may have influenced his decision to analyze McCain 's records , but not the analysis itself .
" The facts about the risk need to be on the table .
My goal was to provide objective evidence of what the mortality risk is , " he said .
" My politics have no bearing on the facts . "
Lynn Schuchter , a University of Pennsylvania oncologist who developed the original model used by Alam , agreed with both Alam and Leong : most recurrences do take place in the first five years following an initial skin cancer diagnosis , she said , but that 's not a hard - and - fast rule .
" The fact that he 's seven or eight years out is a good sign , " she said , " but he 's not out of the woods . "

On Independence Day , Americans are probably feeling something approaching national pride .
So we thought we'd take a closer look at the national anthem , that creepy ritual of bland patriotism .
We all know that the American national anthem tells the inspiring story of a brave flag that survives a scary night by believing in itself .
But not all national anthems steal their plots from children 's books .
In fact , some countries are n't satisfied until their national anthem makes any child within earshot weep in terror .
Here are six that take pride in their land to a whole new and insanely violent level .

6 Algeria - " Qassaman " / " We Pledge " Though it pre-dates both heavy metal and rap by several decades , the Algerian national anthem 's lyrics expertly incorporate the prominent cornerstones of both genres ' most violent moments .
Destructive lightning ?

Gratuitous bloodshed ?
Check .
Machine guns ?
Check .
Being held down by the man ?
Word up , son .

The lyrics , written in 1956 by Moufdi Zakaria , are about two " hos " shy of being a Lil ' Wayne single .
At the time of the writing , Zakaria was being held captive in Algiers by French colonial forces .
Realizing that it was , in fact , France that was holding him and his country down , he spent his downtime penning a tune about the ass whooping his fellow countrymen would surely be dishing out sometime in the near future .

Hell yeah !
Beginning with guerrilla attacks by the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) against military and civilian targets in November of 1954 , Algeria launched a bloody war for independence from France that would last almost eight years .
By the time it was done , almost one million Pied - noirs ( Algerian residents of European descent ) had fled the country and Algeria was free to never be fucked with by anyone ever again .

– Lear , 1.4.312
After the economic news — we are now practicing some form of vulgar big - ticket corporatism while hoping the roof does n't fall in — the biggest news yesterday had to be the fault lines suddenly appearing in the McCain - Palin ticket .
Contrary to the ' straight talk ' by McCain about how he routinely consults Palin , it is obvious that she is very much the eighteenth banana when it comes to the decisions that matter : campaign strategy .
Thus it was no surprise to learn that McCain 's tactically understandable but strategically stupid decision to visibly abandon Michigan was made without Palin .
( Tactically , McCain has no hope of carrying Michigan , so every dollar spent there is a waste .
And dollars are very rationed given the decision to rely on federal funding .
That said , strategically this was no time to be seen to waving a white flag , and the political cost – embracing the stench of failure – will outweigh any financial benefits . )
So long as Palin was a political basket case — cf. the Couric tapes — she had to hunker down and hide behind McCain 's skirts .
But if the debate changed next to nothing in the electoral math , we can now see that it changed everything in the McCain - Palin relationship .
As the Palin - invigorated Gail Collins put in the New York Times , ' The Republicans were euphoric over Sarah Palin ’s debate performance , particularly the part in which she stood tall and refrained from falling off the stage . '
That turns out to win almost no new votes , but it did make the base — pretty much the same people who drove the economy over the cliff — feel a lot better .
And thus , at least within the GOP , Palin moves from political basket case to political barracuda .
And the first chomp comes out of McCain 's hide : Palin can read the polls .
They polls all say that she is not going to be Vice - President next January .
So McCain becomes another body for her to step on .
If the ticket is dead , the real game becomes the Presidential nomination in 2012 .
And it 's therefore critical for Palin to sow the seeds of a narrative that it was Not Her Fault but rather that of the old , tired , impulsive , stupid McCain and his crew .
An so here it is .
Act One of our modern Lear :
Decision On Michigan Questioned By Palin .
Sarah Palin questioned Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's decision to abandon efforts to win Michigan , a campaign move she said she learned about Friday morning when she read it in the newspapers .
In an interview with Fox News Channel Friday , the Alaska governor said she was disappointed that the McCain campaign decided to stop competing in Michigan .
In an indication that the vice presidential candidate had not been part of the decision , she said she had “ read that this morning , and I fired off a quick e-mail ” questioning the move .
“ Todd and I , we'd be happy to get to Michigan and walk through those plants of the car manufacturers , ” Palin said .
“ We 'd be so happy to get to speak to the people in Michigan who are hurting because the economy is hurting . ”
Of course Palin would love to go to Michigan .
There are no electoral votes there for the current ticket , there 's nothing in it for McCain , but Palin 's argument , no more specious than many others , will be that she has a chance to stitch together the Reagan coalition in 2012 , and the lunchpail vote is critical element of that coalition .
But saying so out loud only harms McCain .
Which is why she did it .
I await , sans bated breath , the stories in Sunday 's paper about rivalry and dissension at the top of the Republican ticket .

Europe has made the most progress on curbing biodiversity loss
The world 's governments will fail to meet their agreed target of curbing biodiversity loss by 2010 , according to experts questioned by BBC News .
Nearly 200 countries signed up to the target in 2002 .
Ten leading conservationists asked here at the World Conservation Congress were unanimous that the goal cannot be met .
All the global indicators of progress are heading in the wrong direction , and few governments have even translated the target into national legislation .
Not all the experts questioned would go on the record , and some said there was a reluctance to embarrass governments over their failures on the matter .
Others suggested the target was unachievable even at its inception six years ago .
Ahmed Djoghlaf , executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) , told BBC News that the 2010 target was achievable if governments acted urgently , but conceded that " all indicators are telling us it is unlikely " .
Last week saw the publication of the Red List of Threatened Species , showing that between a quarter and a third of mammals are at risk of extinction .
It also saw the head of an EU - commissioned review into the economics of biodiversity loss say that degradation of forests worldwide cost the global economy more each year than the current banking crisis .
Measured approach
The CBD was agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 , but not until 10 years afterwards did it acquire a firm , supposedly binding target - " to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global , regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth " .
Virtually all of the trends that drive the loss of species and ecosystems are continuing at a global level
Georgina Mace , director of the Centre for Population Biology at Imperial College London , said that on the worldwide basis there was absolutely no chance of achieving it .
" We do n't have many measures of biodiversity at a global level , but there are a few , " she said .
" They measure things like the rate at which species are moving down the categories of threat on the Red List towards extinction , they measure average trends in various populations that have been measured over time , they measure trends on habitat change . "
" And at global level , all those data that we have show either continuing downward rates of loss or maybe continuing rates of loss - so some of them are n't getting worse , some are just staying at the same rate of loss - but none of them are getting better , " she added .
In addition , virtually all of the trends that drive the loss of species and ecosystems are continuing at a global level .
" The biodiversity convention does n't deal with cross-cutting issues such as logging , road building , climate change , pollution and the expansion of agriculture , " said Gordon Shepherd , director of global policy at the environmental group WWF .
" In reality the people who own decision - making in those areas , be they in governments or in business , have much more power than environment ministers , who do n't have tools to get to grips with over - use [ of natural resources ] or over - consumption . "
Political paths However , Sebastian Winkler from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) said the time period from 2002 to 2010 was so short that we should not have expected to see any changes in the real world .
He suggested a different way of measuring the lack of progress - that only 16 governments have followed through on their commitment to integrate the 2010 target into national plans for tackling biodiversity loss .
Some experts say the target set by the convention was too ambitious Mr Winkler runs an IUCN initiative called Countdown 2010 , which aims to engage stakeholders across the world such as local authorities and get them to commit to actions that could improve prospects in their own regions .
" Now the CDB is trying to use Countdown 2010 as a fig leaf for governments - we have 800 partners , they 're each taking at least 10 actions , so that 's 8,000 actions and that 's what they hope to report back as progress , " he said .
By March next year , governments must submit assessments of their own progress to the CBD , which will compile them into a global assessment .
Sweet dreams Thomas Lovejoy , president of the Washington DC - based think - tank , the Heinz Center , said there were signs of progress in different corners of the world , citing Costa Rica and Bhutan among countries that were taking the issue seriously .
There 's no longer a question whether there will be a sixth major extinction in Earth history .
It 's already happening , and the question is how big we 'll allow it to get
Thomas Lovejoy
President , Heinz Center
" In 43 years we 've gone from one protected forest in the Amazon to 40 % of the area under some form of protection , " he said .
" It 's not enough to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem but it 's a huge achievement . "
Europe is the continent which has made most progress towards the target .
According to one recent study , it is on course to curb biodiversity loss - but by 2050 , rather than 2010 .
Mr Djoghlaf said the 2010 initiative had at least put the issue of natural decline into the political and public spotlight .
" There is more and more increased awareness , people are ready to be engaged , business behaviour is changing , biodiversity is becoming a business case because businesses know the market of tomorrow is green , and they have to adapt , " he said .
Most of the other leading figures I spoke to here about the issue were not willing to go on the record , although all said in private there was no chance of achieving the target .
Sebastian Winkler said it was important to keep governments engaged with the issue .
" Martin Luther King said ' I have a dream ' , not ' I have a nightmare ' , " he said .
" And if we always paint nightmares , we will not engage the international community . "
But Mr Lovejoy suggested that at the level of species and ecosystems , the nightmare was already unfolding .
" There 's no longer a question whether there will be a sixth major extinction in Earth history , " he said .
" It 's already happening , and the question is how big we 'll allow it to get . "

What are these ?
40 years of corruption down the drain .
Might as well have joined the f’in Peace Corps :
Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens was convicted of seven corruption charges Monday in a trial that threatened to end the 40 - year career of Alaska ’s political patriarch in disgrace .
The verdict , coming barely a week before Election Day , increased Stevens ’ difficulty in winning what already was a difficult race against Democratic challenger Mark Begich .
Democrats hope to seize the once reliably Republican seat as part of their bid for a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate .
Stevens , 84 , was convicted of all the felony charges he faced of lying about free home renovations and other gifts from a wealthy oil contractor .
Jurors began deliberating last week .
The senator showed no emotion as the jury foreman said “ guilty ” seven times .
After the verdicts , Stevens sat in his chair and stared at the ceiling as attorney Brendan Sullivan put his arm around him .
Stevens faces up to five years in prison on each count when he is sentenced , but under federal guidelines he is likely to receive much less prison time , if any .
The judge originally scheduled sentencing for Jan. 26 but then changed his mind and did not immediately set a date .
Former United States Senator , and Democratic Candidate for President , Mike Gravel has , apparently , joined the Libertarian Party :
I just got off the phone with Libertarian Party Executive Director Shane Cory and he confirms the following information : Former US Senator and Alaska House Speaker Mike Gravel has joined the Libertarian Party .
Cory says he ’ll provide more in a media release to be expected over the next few hours .
And here ’s the official LP Press Release :
Washington , D.C. – Mike Gravel , a former Alaskan Senator and Democratic candidate for president , has joined the Libertarian Party .
“ I ’m joining the Libertarian Party because it is a party that combines a commitment to freedom and peace that ca n’t be found in the two major parties that control the government and politics of America , ” says Gravel .
“ My libertarian views , as well as my strong stance against war , the military industrial complex and American imperialism , seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites who are out of touch with the average American ; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens I offered to the Democratic Party at the beginning of this presidential campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy . ”
Gravel served in the United States Senate from 1969 to 1981 .
Most recently , Gravel was a Democratic presidential candidate , though forced out of national debates by Democratic Party leadership and the media .
Gravel officially became a member of the Libertarian Party today .
Gravel is the most recent former member of Congress to switch to the Libertarian Party .
In 2006 , former Republican Congressman Bob Barr joined the Libertarian Party .
“ It is a distinct honor to have another former member of Congress within the Libertarian Party , ” says Barr .
“ Just as Senator Gravel believes Democrats have lost touch with the American public , I too concluded Republicans had lost their core principles , and could no longer associate myself with the GOP .
While coming from opposite sides of the aisle , Senator Gravel and I definitely agree on the fundamental need for systemic change in our political system , and that the only way we have of effecting that change is by supporting and working in the Libertarian Party , which is the only political party in America that consistently works in word and deed to maximize individual liberty and minimize government power . ”
While this move is interesting , I agree with the guys at Freedom Democrats that there needs to be some skepticism about what Gravel is actually up to here :
Not surprisingly , Gravel ’s campaign team has already announced Gravel ’s intentions to possibly seek both the LP and Green Party nominations , to run a “ fusion ” candidacy .
As I obliquely alluded to in my original post , skepticism is warranted in digesting the possible motives of Gravel in making this move .
Is this legitimately about Gravel identifying more with the Libertarians now or is this more about Gravel smelling some of that Ron Paul fundraising cash .
A fusion between the LP and the Greens ?
How would that even be possible without one or both parties abandoning some of their core principles .
The Green Party is unlikely to welcome economic liberty , and the Libertarians , unless they want to sell their soul , would seem to be unwilling to accept an agenda that says , among other stuff , things like this :
Consumers have the right to adequate enforcement of the federal and state consumer protection laws .
Health and safety are of paramount importance , so we oppose lax or inappropriate regulatory actions .
a .
Consumers should have the right to participate in decisions that affect their lives and protect their interests , beyond simply voting on election day .
b.
We support the creation of consumer advocacy agencies in order to protect the interests of consumers against corporate lobbyists who have too often successfully argued before regulatory agencies against consumer rights .
We would require legal monopolies and regulated industries ( including electric , gas , water , and telephone utilities ) to set up statewide consumer action groups to act on behalf of and advocate for consumer interests .
c.
We call for better information for consumers about the products they buy , and where and how they are made .
We endorse truth in advertising , including the clear definition of words like “ recycled ” and “ natural . ” d.
We defend the rights of individuals to participate in class action lawsuits against manufacturers of unsafe products .
We call for restrictions on secrecy agreements that may prevent lawsuits by not revealing damaging information .
e.
We support laws to protect “ whistle blowers . ”
Or this :
We have a special responsibility to the health and well - being of the young .
Yet we see the federal safety net being removed and replaced with limited and potentially harsh state welfare programs .
How will social services be adequately provided if local resources are already stretched thin ?
We believe our community priorities must first protect the young and helpless .
Yet how will state legislatures and agencies , under pressure from more powerful interests , react ?
We believe local decision - making is important , but we realize , as we learned during the civil rights era , that strict federal standards must guide state actions in providing basic protections .
As the richest nation in history , we should not condemn millions of children to a life of poverty , while corporate welfare is increased to historic highs .
The Green Party opposes the privatization of Social Security .
It is critical that the public protections of Social Security are not privatized and subjected to increased risk .
The bottom 20 % of American senior citizens get roughly 80 % of their income from Social Security , and without Social Security , nearly 70 % of black elderly and 60 % of Latino elderly households would be in poverty .
If that ’s the kind of future Gravel would bring to the Libertarian Party , he would , effectively , destroy it as an advocate for individual liberty .
Update : The New York Times has picked up the story and reports that Gravel intends to run for the LP ’s Presidential Nomination :
Fed up with being excluded from the debates and otherwise marginalized , former Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska announced today that he will seek the Libertarian Party nomination for president .
That ’s right , we said Mike Gravel , who had been running as a Democrat – not Representative Ron Paul , who has run on the Libertarian ticket in the past , but recently submitted his name to appear on the ballot in the remaining Republican primary contests .
Skyler McKinley , a Gravel spokesman , said that Mr. Gravel would try to pursue the Libertarian nomination at the party ’s convention , which will be held in Denver on May 22 - 26 .
Whether or not some of our delegates will accept Mike Gravel with some of his positions , that has yet to be seen , ” said Andrew Davis , a spokesman for the Libertarian National Committee , adding that Mr. Gravel ’s advocacy of universal health care , paid for with a national retail sales tax , could turn off some Libertarians .
Frankly , the fact that the LP is even welcoming this crypto-socialist into the party is strong evidence that it no longer deserves to be taken seriously .

Pelosi says voters misunderstood Prop . 8
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed deep disappointment on Friday that California voters approved Prop. 8 , the measure banning same - sex marriage , and defended her ally , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , against critics who say his actions contributed to its passage .
In a wide - ranging interview with The Chronicle , Pelosi said she believes some voters might not have fully understood the initiative , which overturned a state Supreme Court ruling legalizing same - sex marriage .
The measure was approved 52 to 48 percent .
" Unfortunately , I think people thought they were making a statement about what their view of same - sex marriage was , " the San Francisco Democrat said .
" I do n't know if it was clear that this meant that we are amending the Constitution to diminish freedom in our state . "
Newsom played a starring role in TV and radio ads aired by the Yes on Prop. 8 campaign , which seized on his remarks at a rally in May after the court 's ruling that same - sex marriages were " going to happen , whether you like it or not . "
The measure 's passage was seen as a blow to the possibility of a Newsom bid for governor .
Pelosi , a longtime supporter of Newsom , said the mayor should not be blamed for the measure 's success .
" He acted upon his beliefs .
He feels very strongly that there should not be discrimination and that fairness should prevail for all parts of our society , " she said .
" Some may say there are political risks , but I know the ( bigger ) political risk for him was to do what he did n't believe , and he would never do that . "
In the interview , Pelosi talked about her priorities next year after an election in which Democrats picked up at least 20 House seats and six Senate seats and captured the White House .
She also revealed new details of her post-election phone call on Wednesday with President - elect Barack Obama .
In the congratulatory call , Pelosi made clear - if it was n't clear already - that she is a huge fan .
" I said to him , ' Your speech last night was so magnificent .
It makes me wonder what you 're going to say in your inaugural address , ' " Pelosi said .
Obama played coy .
" He said , ' Well , you 're just going to have to wait and hear that .
I 'm not going to let you in on any of that right now . ' "
Closed - door meeting
Pelosi talked about her closed - door meeting Thursday with executives and union officials from the struggling U.S. auto industry , who are seeking at least $ 25 billion in low - cost government loans on top of $ 25 billion Congress has already approved .
Pelosi said she is open to the idea of more aid - with the caveat that Detroit would have to agree to produce more fuel - efficient vehicles .
" We have been very clear that if the taxpayer is going to invest money , the taxpayer 's interest has to be protected , " she said .
" That means not investing money in something that is not viable for the future , and that viability is tied to innovation and green technology to have us prevail in the global marketplace . "
Pelosi suggested for the first time that she 's likely to extend the life of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , which she created in 2006 to press for action on climate change .
It is scheduled to expire at the end of this year .
She said an announcement would come soon , but she made a strong case for keeping it .
" It 's a tremendously valuable resource to both Democrats and Republicans intellectually , in terms of the staffing there , " she said of the panel , which is chaired by her ally Rep.
Ed Markey , D - Mass .
" The exchange of ideas - not everyone agrees , but it emphasizes the importance of it .
It has been a tremendous resource to me as speaker of the House for my flagship issue . "
A plan to stay neutral
The San Francisco Democrat also said she plans to stay neutral in the internal fight between two Democratic House titans - Reps. Henry Waxman of Los Angeles and John Dingell of Michigan - over who will chair the Energy and Commerce Committee .
Waxman , who has clashed with Dingell in the past over environmental policy , is seeking to oust him as chairman , a position that will be crucial in drafting energy , climate change and health care policy .
Pelosi , who has feuded with Dingell over issues such as fuel economy standards , said she wants to leave the decision to her fellow Democrats .
" The two of them are very serious lawmakers and they are well known to the members , " she said .
No matter which man leads the committee , Pelosi said she would pressure him to move a " cap and trade " bill that would limit greenhouse gases and allow emitters to trade credits to emit gases .
She acknowledged it might take Congress time to put together the complex and controversial legislation .
" This is a very challenging issue , " she said .
" We have a great deal of work to do to reach a consensus . "
Pelosi said Democrats will make reviving a weak economy their singular focus for the next several months .
She said the new jobs reports Friday - which showed a loss of 240,000 jobs last month and a rise in the unemployment rate to 6.5 percent - underscored the need to pass a stimulus package when Congress returns for the lame - duck session Nov. 17 .
Democrats are pushing a package of between $ 61 billion and $ 100 billion , which would be spent on infrastructure projects , an extension of jobless benefits , an increase in food stamps and aid to cash - strapped states .
The Bush White House and Republicans in Congress are cool to the idea .
Whether it succeeds or fails , Democrats and Obama are planning , after he takes office in January , a stimulus plan that could be even bigger .
Pelosi said the details are still being debated , but she is pushing for a tax cut for the middle class .
" We did the stimulus package with rebates ( in February ) .
...
It had a good effect , I think , " she said .
" I think a permanent tax cut would have an even stronger impact on the economy . "
Obama echoed Pelosi 's remarks on the stimulus plan at his first post-election news conference in Chicago Friday , urging lawmakers and President Bush to approve the bill now .
He said , " If it does not get done in the lame - duck session , it will be the first thing I get done as president of the United States . "
Stevens to hold homecoming rally Wednesday night
Ted Stevens ’ campaign will hold a homecoming rally Wednesday night , as Stevens returns to Alaska following his conviction on seven felony counts in a Washington , D.C. court .
Stevens is locked in a tight reelection battle with Democrat Mark Begich .
Following the verdict , Stevens maintained his innocence and said he would not drop out of the race .
The rally will be held at 5:30 p.m. local time in a hanger located on the grounds of the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport .

Written by Nick Grace & Abdiweli Ali , Ph.D .
A tense standoff is underway in northeastern Somalia between pirates , Somali authorities , and Iran over a suspicious merchant vessel and its mysterious cargo .
Hijacked late last month in the Gulf of Aden , the MV Iran Deyanat remains moored offshore in Somali waters and inaccessible for inspection .
Its declared cargo consists of minerals and industrial products , however , Somali and regional officials directly involved in the negotiations over the ship and who spoke to The Long War Journal are convinced that it was heading to Eritrea to deliver small arms and chemical weapons to Somalia ’s Islamist insurgents .
It was business as usual when speedboats surrounded the MV Iran Deyanat on August 21 .
The 44468 dead weight tonnage bulk carrier was pushing towards the Suez and had just entered the Gulf of Aden – dangerous waters where instability , greed and no-questions - asked ransom payments have led to a recent surge in piracy .
Steaming past the Horn of Africa , 82 nautical miles southeast of al - Makalla in Yemen , the ship was a prize for the taking .
It would bring hundreds of thousands of dollars – possibly millions – to the Somalia - based crime syndicate .
The captain was defenseless against the 40 pirates armed with AK - 47s and rocket - propelled grenades blocking his passage .
He had little choice other than to turn his ship over to them .
What the pirates were not banking on , however , was that this was no ordinary ship .
The MV Iran Deyanat is owned and operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines ( IRISL ) – a state - owned company run by the Iranian military that was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on September 10 , shortly after the ship ’s hijacking .
According to the U.S. Government , the company regularly falsifies shipping documents in order to hide the identity of end users , uses generic terms to describe shipments to avoid the attention of shipping authorities , and employs the use of cover entities to circumvent United Nations sanctions to facilitate weapons proliferation for the Iranian Ministry of Defense .
The MV Iran Deyanat set sail from Nanjing , China , at the end of July and , according to its manifest , planned to travel to Rotterdam , where it would unload 42,500 tons of iron ore and “ industrial products ” purchased by a German client .
Its arrival in the Gulf of Aden , Somali officials tell The Long War Journal , was suspiciously early .
According to a publicly available status report on the IRISL Web site , the ship reached the Gulf on August 20 and was scheduled to reach the Suez Canal on August 27 – a seven day journey .
“ Depending on the speed of the ship , ” Puntland Minister of Ports Ahmed Siad Nur said in a phone interview on Saturday , “ it should take between 4 and 5 days to reach Suez . ”

Suspicion has also been cast on the ship ’s crew , half of which is almost entirely staffed by Iranians – a large percentage of Iranian nationals for a standard merchant vessel .
Somali officials say that the ship has a crew of 29 men , including a Pakistani captain , an Iranian engineer , 13 other Iranians , 3 Indians , 2 Filipinos , and 10 Eastern Europeans , possibly Croatian .
The MV Iran Deyanat was brought to Eyl , a sleepy fishing village in northeastern Somalia , and was secured by a larger gang of pirates – 50 onboard and 50 onshore .
Within days , pirates who had boarded the ship developed strange health complications , skin burns and loss of hair .
Independent sources tell The Long War Journal that a number of pirates have also died .
“ Yes , some of them have died .
I do not know exactly how many but the information that I am getting is that some of them have died , ” Andrew Mwangura , Director of the East African Seafarers ’ Assistance Program , said Friday when reached by phone in Mombasa .
News about the illness and the toxic cargo quickly reached Garowe , seat of the government for the autonomous region of Puntland .
Angered over the wave of piracy and suspicious about the Iranian ship , authorities dispatched a delegation led by Minister of Minerals and Oil Hassan Allore Osman to investigate the situation on September 4 .
Osman also confirmed to The Long War Journal that during the six days he negotiated with the pirates members of the syndicate had become sick and died .
“ That ship is unusual , ” he said .
“ It is not carrying a normal shipment . ”
The delegation faced a tense situation in Eyl , Osman recounts .
The syndicate had demanded a $ 9 million ransom for 10 ships that were in its possession and refused permission to inspect the Iranian vessel .
At one point , he said , the pirates threatened to “ blow up ” the MV Iran Deyanat if authorities tried to inspect it with force .
A committee of delegate members and Eyl city officials was formed to negotiate directly with the pirates in order to defuse the situation .
Once in direct contact , the pirates told Osman that they had attempted to inspect the ship ’s seven cargo containers after they developed health complications but the containers were locked .
The crew claimed that they did not have the “ access codes ” and could not open them .
The delegation secured contact with the captain and the engineer by cell phone and demanded to know the nature of the cargo , however , Osman says that “ they were saying different things to different people . ”
Initially they said that the cargo contained “ crude oil ” but then claimed it contained “ minerals . ”
“ The secrecy is not clear to us , ” Mwangura said about the cargo .
“ Our sources say it contains chemicals , dangerous chemicals . ”
IRISL has flatly denied the ship is carrying a “ dangerous consignment ” and has threatened legal action against Mwangura .
The syndicate set the ship ’s ransom at $ 2 million and the Iranian government provided $ 200,000 to a local broker “ to facilitate the exchange . ”
Iran refutes that it agreed to the price and has paid any money to the pirates .
Nevertheless , after sanctions were applied to IRISL on September 10 , Osman says , the Iranians told the pirates that the deal was off .
“ They told the pirates that they could not come because of the presence of the U.S. Navy . ”
The region is patrolled by the multinational Combined Taskforce 150 , which includes ships from the U.S. Navy ’s Fifth Fleet .
In a strange twist , the Iranian press claims that the U.S. has offered to pay a $ 7 million bribe to the pirates to “ receive entry permission and search the vessel . ”
Officials in the Pentagon and the Department of State approached for this story refused to comment on the situation .
Somali officials would also not comment on any direct U.S. involvement but one high - level official in the Puntland government told The Long War Journal “ I can say the ship is of interest to a lot of people , including Puntland . ”
The exact nature of the cargo remains a mystery but officials in Puntland and Baidoa are convinced the ship was carrying weapons to Eritrea for Islamist insurgents .
“ We can not inspect the cargo yet , ” Osman said , “ but we are sure that it is weapons . ”
“ Puntland requested the pirates two weeks ago to hand over this Iranian ship , saying that it is carrying weapons to Eritrea , ” Puntland Fisheries Minister Abdulqadir Muse Yusuf told Reuters .
“ I have seen food and other odd items on the ship but I do not know what is hidden underneath . ”
Iran ’s involvement in the conflict in Somalia on behalf of Islamist insurgents is well documented .
In 2006 , Iran flouted arms embargos and provided sophisticated anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to the Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) , intelligence sources told The Long War Journal , including SA - 7 Strella and SA - 18 Igla MANPADS – shoulder fired surface - to - air missiles – as well as AT - 3 Sagger antitank missiles .
A report issued by the United Nations in 2006 states that weapons were transferred to Somalia through Lebanon - based Hezbollah , which also absorbed a contingent of 700 Islamist fighters from Somalia during Hezbollah ’s war with Israel .
The report also states that Iran provided support for Islamist training camps inside Somalia and had sent two emissaries to negotiate with the ICU for access to Somalia ’s uranium mines .

Threesome Finder Sites and Apps to Help People Find the Connections They Desire
For a long time , the Craigslist personals section was the unofficial “ source ” for a lot of people looking for non-traditional dating and sexual relationships .
Now that the category has been removed , many people are left searching for new ways to find non-traditional threesome near me and relationships that were once easily fulfilled by the exploratory nature of the “ casual encounters ” section .
Fortunately , there has been a surge in the influx of dating apps and best sites for couples to find a third , including hookup sites , even since before Craigslist shut their own site down .
By knowing where to look , and probably even more importantly , how to look , it will be easier than you think to find a threesome that satiates your sexual desires .
Why People Need Threesome Websites and Apps
There is a fine line when it comes to seeking out and looking for threesome .
Unlike other hookups , this one involves the consent ( and interest ) of multiple parties .
Since most dating apps and sites are geared toward single - user profiles , this can make finding consensual threesomes a challenge .
Apps like Tinder are full of profiles just waiting to shame people for even thinking of asking about a three - way , making it even more difficult for those seeking a third partner or a couple to become a third partner with .
This is exactly why specific threesome apps and sites are needed .
There are many dating sites for couples looking for a third , women looking for couples , and every combination in between , that are genuinely interested in threesomes , swinging , and other multi-partner sexual experiences .
Apps and sites geared toward this specific niche make it easier for everyone to connect .
Do These Websites and Apps Really Work ?
Like any dating or hookup niche , the quality of websites and apps vary from one to the next .
There are some swinging sites that seem to be more effective than others .
In a recent article , Elle magazine polled users who have used these apps to see how they were being used and how effective they were .
For the most part , people had the same thing to say about using other adult swinger sites and apps to find a threesome : it just does n’t work .
On threesome - targeted finder apps and sites ?
The results were better , if still leaving something to be desired .
Most users report that Feeld ( formerly Thrinder ) is intuitive and seems to offer the best platform for finding these hookups , but that a lot of users still seem to be signing up for curiosity ’s sake or just looking for a certain type of “ unicorn ” partner that does n’t exist .
Those looking for serious connections can try out the various apps and websites that are out there .
One website that often goes unnoticed , but is useful for a variety of kinks , hookups , and fetishes .
Rather than a hookup app , this is a social network for people interested in the BDSM , fetish , and kink communities .
Unfortunately , again , users will be reliant on how many members are actually in their area and active on the site .
How to Get Your Threesome Game On
Finding partners is , by far , the most difficult part of having a threesome for most people .
Fortunately , as the gap left by the loss of the “ casual encounters ” section continues to be filled , more threesome - friendly apps and sites are sure to improve their offerings and new ones will be launched .
If you do n’t want to wait , here are some apps that you can check out today :
Feeld ( mentioned above ) :
This app is hip and inclusive , and includes support for Mal , a sex and erotica literary journal .
The site allows couples or singles to join for threesums and members can browse privately and send anonymous invites to crushes .
FindaThreesum :
This site is ideal for curious folks who are considering or seeking threesums .
Users can register for an account as an individual or a couple and the site offers verification of photos for improved security and peace of mind .
CoupleThreesome :
This is an easy - to - use site that allows couples and individuals to sign up and seek out partners for threesomes .
Users can follow in - site recommendations for local user connections or reach out directly to the other parties they are interested in .
This app is popular among the fetish and BDSM communities , and includes a section for threesomes and other multi-partner experiences .
The downside is that most members are here for other fetishes , so it may be harder to find those just interested in threesomes without another fetish or kink attached .
Roundup
Some members of the threesome community will tell you to stick to the “ real world ” connections if you want success in finding new partners and hookups .
However , the number and quality of apps is continuing to grow , offering more opportunities for singles and couples to meet their respective partners for a good time .
The threesome finder sites and apps discussed here are a good place to begin your search for your next threesome hookup .

I thought this was important enough to post separately rather than just as a response to my recent comment on Hemant ’s post about the latest Senator Dole smear .
I have been getting email appeals for contributions from Kay Hagan ’s campaign ever since I donated to her campaign .
So you can understand the context , re-posted here is what I emailed to them earlier today , followed by a surprisingly prompt and personal reply I received just a few hours ago :
I was pleased and impressed when I learned that Kay , despite her strong devotion to her faith , was willing to attend the fundraiser that included the Godless Americans PAC , and so I contributed $ 200 even though I do n’t live in North Carolina .
Just finding any candidate or official who is even willing to listen to the concerns of secular Americans is extremely rare , and that needs to be encouraged .
Senator Dole ’s vile response is not surprising to me , trying to smear Kay with “ godlessness ” by association , and Kay ’s response is strong , clear and well considered .
She should not tolerate such slander .
HOWEVER , I am disappointed by Kay ’s failure to make even a single statement about how using “ godless ” as an unquestioned dirty word is also inappropriate , that she has not made an assertive statement that all citizens , regardless of their religious beliefs deserve fair representation and should not be scapegoated .
When Kay attended the fundraiser in Boston , I thought and hoped that she was taking a stand to represent all her constituency , including those upstanding Americans who do not believe in any gods .
I understand that in her response to Dole she wants to focus on defending herself against the attack , but by not denouncing the very tactic of using religious bigotry itself , Kay has tacitly agreed that “ godless ” people are the evil and dangerous degenerates that Dole implies they are .
If Kay had also taken that single , simple and fair stance against bigotry , I would be donating more money to her campaign .
She did not , so I am not .
I know that she is busy , but please pass these thoughts on to Kay .
I wish Kay good luck in the election and I hope she wins .
Sincerely , Richard Wade
Here is the response I got back just a while ago :
Mr. Wade :
Thank you for writing to us and thank you for your contribution .
Kay ’s response sought to do two things :
1 ) Correct Sen .
Dole ’s false claim about Kay and 2 ) Return the discussion about this race to what we consider to be far more important issues : the economy , foreclosures , jobs , and any other number of things impacting the citizens of North Carolina and the rest of the country .
People who lose their jobs lose their jobs irrespective of their religious beliefs .
When someone loses their home , it does n’t matter what they do or do n’t believe in - they have still lost their home .
Please understand that Kay ’s remarks in the ad should not be taken , in any way , as an implicit approval of Sen .
Dole ’s suggestion that atheists or people of any other religion are bad people .
Additionally , Kay stating that she is a Christian is intended to be factual , not judgmental or suggestive that any other religious system is inferior .
Kay is strongly opposed to discrimination of any kind and also feels that someone ’s religious perspectives should have no bearing on whether they are fit to run for or hold public office .
To be clear , this event was not , as Sen .
Dole ’s ad states , hosted by the Godless Americans PAC .
Mr. Kaplan , the host in question , is affiliated with this group , but the event itself was not about a discussion of their agenda points .
That said , had we been aware of Mr. Kaplan ’s association prior to the event , this would not have mattered .
It is not the policy of this campaign to vet our supporters and donors on the basis of their religious beliefs , and Kay is fully aware that if she is elected Senator , she will be responsible for representing people with any number of different views .
It seems evident in her ad that Sen .
Dole only finds her Christian constituents as worthy of assistance .
Rest assured that Kay would NEVER assert this kind of litmus test on her constituency when it comes to helping them out .
It is positively unfair and frankly , just not Democratic .
Thank you again for your past support and for taking the time to write in .
Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any further questions .
Respectfully ,
Hagan Senate Campaign

Amy Chozick reports on the presidential race from Asheville , N.C. Barack Obama said he is refusing to let the “ usual political shenanigans and scare tactics ” distract from the issues — even as his campaign is making a major push to publicize John McCain ’s link to the savings and loan scandal two decades ago .
Barack Obama [… ]
CHAPTER VII : THE KEATING FIVE
As a war hero and U.S. senator , John McCain has been chronicled in pictures .
There are grainy mug shots of a young McCain , printed in U.S. newspapers after his jet was shot down over North Vietnam .
There are black - and - white images of his return , grinning and waving .
In happier times , there is McCain holding his newborn daughter while his wife , Cindy , smiles from her hospital bed .
But it is an innocent vacation picture that carries the reminder of the scandal that threatened his political career .
In the picture , taken in the Bahamas , McCain is seated on a bandstand while wearing an outrageous straw party hat .
Next to him on the dais sits Charles Keating III , son of developer Charles H Keating Jr .
McCain calls the Keating scandal " my asterisk . "
Over the years , his opponents have failed to turn it into a period .
It all started in March 1987 .
Charles H Keating Jr. , the flamboyant developer and anti-porn crusader , needed help .
The government was poised to seize Lincoln Savings and Loan , a freewheeling subsidiary of Keating 's American Continental Corp .
As federal auditors examined Lincoln , Keating was not content to wait and hope for the best .
He had spread a lot of money around Washington , and it was time to call in his chits .
One of his first stops was Sen. Dennis DeConcini , D - Ariz .
The state 's senior senator was one of Keating 's most loyal friends in Congress , and for good reason .
Keating had given thousands of dollars to DeConcini 's campaigns .
At one point , DeConcini even pushed Keating for ambassador to the Bahamas , where Keating owned a luxurious vacation home .
Now Keating had a job for DeConcini .
He wanted him to organize a meeting with regulators to deliver a message : Get off Lincoln 's back .
Eventually , DeConcini would set up a meeting with five senators and the regulators .
One of them was McCain .
McCain already knew Keating well .
His ties to the home builder dated to 1981 , when the two men met at a Navy League dinner where McCain spoke .
After the speech , Keating walked up to McCain and told him that he , too , was a Navy flier and that he greatly respected McCain 's war record .
He met McCain 's wife and family .
The two men became friends .
Charlie Keating always took care of his friends , especially those in politics .
McCain was no exception .
In 1982 , during McCain 's first run for the House , Keating held a fund - raiser for him , collecting more than $ 11,000 from 40 employees of American Continental Corp .
McCain would spend more than $ 550,000 to win the primary and the general election .
In 1983 , as McCain contemplated his House re-election , Keating hosted a $ 1,000 - a- plate dinner for him , even though McCain had no serious competition .
When McCain pushed for the Senate in 1986 , Keating was there with more than $ 50,000 .
By 1987 , McCain had received about $ 112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates .
McCain also had carried a little water for Keating in Washington .
While in the House , McCain , along with a majority of representatives , co-sponsored a resolution to delay new regulations designed to curb risky investments by thrifts such as Lincoln .
Reluctant participant
Despite his history with Keating , McCain was hesitant about intervening .
At that point , he had been in the Senate only three months .
DeConcini wanted McCain to fly to San Francisco with him and talk to the regulators .
McCain refused .
Keating would not be dissuaded .
On March 24 at 9:30 a.m. , Keating went to DeConcini 's office and asked him if the meeting with the regulators was on .
DeConcini told Keating that McCain was nervous .
" McCain 's a wimp , " Keating replied , according to the book Trust Me , by Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden .
" We 'll go talk to him . "
Keating had other business on Capitol Hill and did not reach McCain 's office until 1:30 .
A DeConcini staffer already had told McCain about the " wimp " insult .
When he arrived , Keating presented McCain with a laundry list of demands for the regulators .
McCain told Keating that he would attend the meeting and find out whether Keating was getting treated fairly but that was all .
The first meeting , on April 2 , 1987 , in DeConcini 's office , included Ed Gray , chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , as well as four senators : DeConcini , McCain , Alan Cranston , D - Calif. , and John Glenn , D - Ohio .
( Years later , McCain recalled that DeConcini started the meeting with a reference to " our friend at Lincoln . "
McCain characterized it as " an unfortunate choice of words , which Gray would remember and repeat publicly many times . " )
For Keating , the meeting was a bust .
Gray told the senators that as head of the loan board , he worried about the big picture .
He did n't have any specific information about Lincoln .
Bank regulators in San Francisco would be versed in that , not him .
Gray offered to set up a meeting between the senators and the San Francisco regulators .
The second meeting was April 9 .
The same four senators attended , along with Sen.
Don Riegle , D - Mich .
Also at the meeting were William Black , then deputy director of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. , James Cirona , president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco , and Michael Patriarca , director of agency functions at the FSLIC .
In an interview with The Republic , Black said the meeting was a show of force by Keating , who wanted the senators to pressure the regulators into dropping their case against Lincoln .
The thrift was in trouble for violating " direct investment " rules , which prohibited S&Ls from taking large ownership positions in various ventures .
" The Senate is a really small club , like the cliche goes , " Black said .
" And you really did have one - twentieth of the Senate in one room , called by one guy , who was the biggest crook in the S&L debacle . "
Black said the senators could have accomplished their goal " if they had simply had us show up and see this incredible room and said , ' Hi. Charles Keating asked us to meet with you .
' Bye . ' "
McCain previously had refused DeConcini 's request to meet with the Lincoln auditors themselves .
In Worth the Fighting For , McCain wrote that he remained " a little troubled " at the prospect , " but since the chairman of the bank board did n't seem to have a problem with the idea , maybe a discussion with the regulators would n't be as problematic as I had earlier thought . "
McCain concedes that he failed to sense that Gray and the thrift examiners felt threatened by the senators ' meddling .
' Always Hamlet '
The five senators , including McCain , seemed like a united front to Black .
" They presented themselves as a group , " Black said , " and DeConcini is the dad , who 's going to take the primary speaking role .
Both meetings are in his office , and in both cases it 's we want this , with no one going , ' What do you mean we , kemo sabe ? ' "
According to nearly verbatim notes taken by Black , McCain started the second meeting with a careful comment .
" One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion , " McCain said .
" ACC ( American Continental Corp. ) is a big employer and important to the local economy .
I would n't want any special favors for them .
. . .
" I do n't want any part of our conversation to be improper . "
Black said the comment had the opposite effect for the regulators .
It made them nervous about what might really be going on .
" McCain was the weirdest , " Black said .
" They were all different in their own way .
McCain was always Hamlet . . . wringing his hands about what to do . "
Glenn , a former astronaut and the first American to orbit the Earth , was not as tactful .
" To be blunt , you should charge them or get off their backs , " he told the regulators .
" If things are bad there , get to them .
Their view is that they took a failing business and put it back on its feet .
It 's now viable and profitable .
They took it off the endangered species list .
Why has the exam dragged on and on and on ? "
DeConcini added : " What 's wrong with this if they 're willing to clean up their act ? "
Cirona , the banking official , told the senators that it was " very unusual " to hold a meeting to discuss a particular company .
DeConcini shot back : " It 's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators . "
The meeting went on .
McCain was quiet .
DeConcini carried the ball .
The regulators told the senators that Lincoln was in trouble .
The thrift , Cirona said , was a " ticking time bomb . "
Then Patriarca made a stunning comment , according to transcripts released later .
" We 're sending a criminal referral to the Department of Justice , " he said .
" Not maybe , we 're sending one .
This is an extraordinarily serious matter .
It involves a whole range of imprudent actions .
I can't tell you strongly enough how serious this is .
This is not a profitable institution . "
The statement made DeConcini back off a little .
" The criminality surprises me , " he said .
" We 're not interested in discussing those issues .
Our premise was that we had a viable institution concerned that it was being overregulated . "
" What can we say to Lincoln ? " Glenn asked .
" Nothing , " Black responded , " with regard to the criminal referral .
They have n't and wo n't be told by us that we 're making one . "
" You have n't told them ? "
Glenn asked .
" No , " said Black .
" Justice would skin us alive if we did .
Those referrals are very confidential .
We can't prosecute anyone ourselves .
All we can do is refer it to Justice . "
After the meeting , McCain was done with Keating .
" Again , I was troubled by the appearance of the meeting , " McCain said later .
" I stated I did n't want any special favors from them .
I only wanted them ( Lincoln Savings ) to be fairly treated . "
Black does n't completely buy that argument .
If McCain was concerned about Keating asking him to do things that were improper , why go to either meeting at all ?
Black said McCain probably went because Keating was close to being the political godfather of Arizona and McCain still had plenty of ambition .
" Keating was incredibly powerful , " Black said .
" And incredibly useful . "
McCain 's reservations aside , Keating accomplished his goal .
He had bought some time , though the price was very high .
Short - lived reprieve
A month later , the San Francisco regulators finished a yearlong audit and recommended that Lincoln be seized .
But the report was virtually ignored because of politics on the bank board .
Gray was being replaced as chairman by Danny Wall , who was more sympathetic to Keating .
The audit , which described Lincoln as a thrift reeling out of control , sat on a shelf .
In September 1987 , the investigation was taken away from the San Francisco office , away from Black and Patriarca .
In May 1988 , it was transferred to Washington , where Lincoln would get a new audit .
It was a win for Keating .
A battle , not the war .
Back in San Francisco , Black was fuming .
" Clearly , we were shot in the back , " he would say later .
Despite the reprieve , Keating 's businesses continued to spiral downward , taking the five senators with him .
Together , the five had accepted more than $ 300,000 in contributions from Keating , and their critics added a new term to the American lexicon : " The Keating Five . "
The Keating Five became synonymous for the kind of political influence that money can buy .
As the S&L failure deepened , the sheer magnitude of the losses hit the press .
Billions of dollars had been squandered .
The five senators were linked as the gang who shilled for an S&L bandit .
S&L " trading cards " came out .
The Keating Five card showed Charles Keating holding up his hand , with a senator 's head adorning each finger .
McCain was on Keating 's pinkie .
As the investigation dragged through 1988 , McCain dodged the hardest blows .
Most landed on DeConcini , who had arranged the meetings and had other close ties to Keating , including $ 50 million in loans from Keating to DeConcini 's aides .
But McCain made a critical error .
He had adopted the blanket defense that Keating was a constituent and that he had every right to ask his senators for help .
In attending the meetings , McCain said , he simply wanted to make sure that Keating was treated like any other constituent .
Keating was no ordinary constituent to McCain .
On Oct. 8 , 1989 , The Arizona Republic revealed that McCain 's wife and her father had invested $ 359,100 in a Keating shopping center in April 1986 , a year before McCain met with the regulators .
The paper also reported that the McCains , sometimes accompanied by their daughter and baby - sitter , had made at least nine trips at Keating 's expense , sometimes aboard the American Continental jet .
Three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating 's opulent Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay .
McCain also did not pay Keating for some of the trips until years after they were taken , after he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln .
Total cost : $ 13,433 .
When the story broke , McCain did nothing to help himself .
" You 're a liar , " McCain said when a Republic reporter asked him about the business relationship between his wife and Keating .
" That 's the spouse 's involvement , you idiot , " McCain said later in the same conversation .
" You do understand English , do n't you ? "
He also belittled reporters when they asked about his wife 's ties to Keating .
" It 's up to you to find that out , kids . "
The paper ran the story .
In his 2002 book , McCain confesses to " ridiculously immature behavior " during that particular interview and adds that The Republic reporters ' " persistence in questioning me about the matter provoked me to rage . "
" I do n't know how ( The Republic journalists ) would have reported the story had I been more civil and understanding or just more of a professional during the interview , " McCain wrote .
At a news conference after the story ran , McCain was a changed man .
He stood calmly for 90 minutes and answered every question .
On the shopping center , his defense was simple .
The deal did not involve him .
The shares in the shopping center had been bought by a partnership set up between McCain 's wife and her father .
( The couple also had a prenuptial agreement that separated Cindy McCain 's finances and dealings from his . )
But McCain also had to explain his trips with Keating and why he did n't pay Keating back right away .
On that score , McCain admitted he had fouled up .
He said he should have reimbursed Keating immediately , not waited several years .
His staff said it was an oversight , but it looked bad , McCain jetting around with Keating , then going to bat for him with the federal regulators .
" I was in a hell of a mess , " McCain later would write .
Meanwhile , Lincoln continued to founder .
In April 1989 , two years after the Keating Five meetings , the government seized Lincoln , which declared bankruptcy .
In September 1990 , Keating was booked into Los Angeles County Jail , charged with 42 counts of fraud .
His bond was set at $ 5 million .
During Keating 's trial , the prosecution produced a parade of elderly investors who had lost their life 's savings by investing in American Continental junk bonds .
Verdict : ' Poor judgment '
In November 1990 , the Senate Ethics Committee convened to decide what punishment , if any , should be doled out to the Keating Five .
Robert Bennett , who would later represent President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones case , was the special counsel for the committee .
In his opening remarks , he slammed DeConcini but went lightly on McCain , the lone Republican ensnared with four Democrats .
" In the case of Senator McCain , there is very substantial evidence that he thought he had an understanding with Senator DeConcini 's office that certain matters would not be gone into at the meeting with ( bank board ) Chairman ( Ed ) Gray , " Bennett said .
" Moreover , there is substantial evidence that , as a result of Senator McCain 's refusal to do certain things , he had a fallout with Mr. Keating . "
Among the Keating Five , McCain took the most direct contributions from Keating .
But the investigation found that he was the least culpable , along with Glenn .
McCain attended the meetings but did nothing afterward to stop Lincoln 's death spiral .
Lincoln was the most expensive failure in the national S&L scandal .
Taxpayers lost more than $ 2 billion on the bailout .
McCain also looked good in contrast to DeConcini , who continued to defend Keating until fall 1989 , when federal regulators filed a $ 1.1 billion civil racketeering and fraud suit against Keating , accusing him of siphoning Lincoln 's deposits to his family and into political campaigns .
In January 1993 , a federal jury convicted him of 73 counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud in the collapse of American Continental and Lincoln .
Keating was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison but served just 50 months before the conviction was overturned on a technicality .
In 1999 , at age 75 , he pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud .
He was sentenced to time served .
In the end , McCain received only a mild rebuke from the Ethics Committee for exercising " poor judgment " for intervening with the federal regulators on behalf of Keating .
Still , he felt tarred by the affair .
" The appearance of it was wrong , " McCain said .
" It 's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence .
And it was the wrong thing to do . "
McCain noted that Bennett , the independent counsel , recommended that McCain and Glenn be dropped from the investigation .
" For the first time in history , the Ethics Committee overruled the recommendation of the independent counsel , " McCain said .
For his part , DeConcini is critical of McCain 's role in the affair .
The two senators never were particularly cozy , and the stress of the public scrutiny worsened their relations .
In his memoir Senator Dennis DeConcini : From the Center of the Aisle , he praises the decision to keep McCain on the hook .
" It became clear to me , and it was later confirmed by Ethics Committee members , that Bennett was attempting to dismiss the charges against McCain , and in order to appear nonpartisan , he included Glenn in this effort , " DeConcini wrote with co-author Jack August .
" Thanks to the three Democrats on the committee and perhaps with the help of Senator ( Jesse ) Helms ( R - N.C. ) , however , the charges remained in place for all the senators under investigation .
So all of us had to attend the 23 - day public hearing , which was indeed a trial , before the six - member Senate Ethics Committee . "
In the book , DeConcini reiterates his allegation that McCain leaked to the media " sensitive information " about certain closed proceedings in order to hurt DeConcini , Riegle and Cranston .
It 's a fairly serious charge .
The Boston Globe revisited the Keating Five leaks in 2000 .
The story paraphrased a congressional investigator , Clark B. Hall , as personally concluding that " McCain was one of the principal leakers . "
The newspaper also reported that McCain , under oath , had denied involvement with the leaks .
McCain owns up to his mistake this way :
" I was judged eventually , after three years , of using , quote , poor judgment , and I agree with that assessment . "
Watch John Stossel 's report on farm subsidies , highlighting the high and rising levels of income for American farmers ( they make twice as much as the average American ) , and the rising real estate values for U.S. farms ( +77 % in Nebraska over the last four years ) .

REUTERS / Bruno Domingos
RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Three Norwegian tourists came under fire and one was shot after the satellite navigation system in their car guided them straight into one of Rio de Janeiro ’s most dangerous slums .
The three men cut short their vacation in Brazil and headed home Monday after Trygve Killingtveit , 24 , was shot in the shoulder by suspected drug traffickers from one of the gangs that control hundreds of shantytowns in Rio .
The tourists were returning from the beach resort of Buzios about three hours north of Rio Saturday when they got lost , Brazil ’s Globo TV and several newspapers reported .
They reportedly told police their Global Positioning System ( GPS ) system recommended they turn off a main highway as the quickest route back to the airport to drop off the rental car .
But the suggested route took them deep into the Mare slum complex , where their rented car quickly came under fire .
No motive for the attack was given , and no arrests were made .
Killingtveit managed to drive the car to safety despite being wounded .
He told family members in Norway that he probably went astray because of a fault in the GPS , Norwegian daily Dagbladet reported .
“ As far as I understand , the GPS system in their car showed the wrong information , ” his brother , Magne Killingtveit , told the paper .
The Norwegian consulate in Rio declined Monday to comment on the incident , saying only that the three had returned to Norway .
The Qantas fleet of A380 planes will offer live internet access from the second half of next year but the carrier will censor content more heavily than other airlines around the world , blocking out pornography and a host of other sites deemed " offensive " .
Qantas originally intended to offer full internet connectivity on the A380s when they take to the skies from Monday but last month delayed those plans .
It will instead initially offer only a limited selection of what it calls " cached internet content " and access to web - based email and chat services .
American Airlines , which launched its own in - flight internet services last month , was heavily criticised by the US Association of Professional Flight Attendants and lobby groups after passengers and attendants complained of people accessing inappropriate material .

Christian anti-abortionists picketed the Democratic Convention in August
As the dust settles on Washington following the Barack Obama earthquake , one group more than any other is expecting to be out in the cold .
For the past eight years , the so - called Religious Right has enjoyed a warm reception at the centre of White House policy - making , and with the Republican coalition on Capitol Hill .
Mainly white , " born again " evangelical Protestants , who adhere to a literal interpretation of the Bible - and oppose abortion rights above all - the Religious Right comprise around 40 % of the Republican Party 's support .
" The Republican Party as it exists today could not exist without the Christian evangelical vote and the conservative Catholic vote , " said Allen Hertzke , visiting senior fellow at the influential Pew Forum on Religion and Politics .
" Now the Republican Party can't win with them alone - as we 've learned . "
Although there is always a tension between the narrow social agenda of Christian conservatives and the broader , more pragmatic " low tax " wing of the party , the strong US economy kept that argument at bay - until this year 's financial crisis .
Blaming the economy
The imposing facade of the Family Research Council includes the motto " faith , family , freedom " carved into the stone above the door , right across from the National Portrait Gallery in downtown Washington .
I think you 're going to see a surge once again , reminiscent of the early 1990s
Michael Franc
Heritage Foundation vice - president
When it comes to the seemingly never - ending Culture War in America , " we lost a good portion of it , if President Obama is a man of his word " , said the senior vice - president of the council 's Action arm , Connie Mackey , who is in a reflective but steely mood .
She rejects the idea that by focussing on abortion , gay marriage and federal judges who disagree with them , the movement is ignoring the recent election verdict : " It was all played out on an economic playing field , and the economy is a disaster . "
California 's electoral decision to define marriage as only valid between a man and a woman gives her hope that a majority of American voters remain socially conservative , and sympathetic towards moulding a new Republican party that is more conservative , not less .
" I always get a laugh out of the liberals in the Republican Party who think they can walk away from their base , " she said .
" The [ party ] is only the vehicle in which the conservatives travel ...
You have to look at that vehicle and say , is it repairable , or do we get a new one ? "
At the foot of Capitol Hill , the conservative Heritage Foundation was one of the large think - tanks that helped forge the defeated Republican coalition .
Its vice - president in charge of liaising with Congress , Michael Franc , is confident that being denied influence in Washington will revive the Religious Right .
Relaxing rules on stem - cell research and abortion , will " galvanise the social Right - they will find it incredibly easy to generate all sorts of reaction from their donor base , and their supporters , " he said .
" I think you 're going to see a surge once again , reminiscent of the early 1990s . "
Across the lines Although the Religious Right groups see no common ground with the Obama administration , that is not the perception among more moderate evangelicals close to power , during this transition period .
One of the more plugged - in members of the emerging Religious Left is Burns Strider , who was head of religious outreach for Hillary Clinton 's primary campaign .
" Instead of talking about criminalising women , let 's come together in an honest conversation , and find ways to reduce the number of abortions , " said the jovial consultant , in his office in suburban Virginia .
For the hard - core Religious Right " it creates relationships where the edges are smoother , " he added .
For the Pew Forum 's Allen Hertzke , the idea that some " culture warriors " might wander across enemy lines in the less dogmatic post- election environment , would be the continuation of an already visible trend .
" On certain international humanitarian and human rights issues , unlikely alliances have formed between conservative evangelical groups and more liberal human rights organisations , " he said .
" On [ human ] trafficking , on religious freedom , on Darfur , on human rights in China ... "
Christian conservatives may find themselves working alongside Democrats in Washington , he added .
Down to Obama
As the Republican Party struggles to regroup following an emphatic election defeat , it is clear that the Religious Right will have a major say in what happens next .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin certainly helped to enthuse and ignite her fellow Christian conservatives in a way that John McCain could not .
Many are already backing her for a run in 2012 .
But the strength of the movement will also depend largely on what President Obama does .
If he steers clear of a social and cultural policy agenda , preferring to focus all efforts on the economy and foreign affairs , the Religious Right will have nothing much to react against .
Unlikely as it is , given 40 years of polarisation , the culture wars may yet grind to a halt , for lack of ammunition .

Starting a website / business comes with some baggage that can be quite difficult to carry , especially for individuals who have little to no experience with the many legal elements of starting a business .
Due to a limited budget I was forced to tackle some pretty daunting tasks on my own .
One of the more difficult tasks was protecting our business through the registration of a trademark .
The United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) can be an intimidating entity .
They possess the power to approve or deny your trademark registration which , if denied , could end up costing you more than just large sums of money .
Through research , attention to detail , and the drive to reach your goal , registering your own trademark is n’t a pipe dream ; it can be done .
Of course utilizing an attorney for your trademark registration is always the safest choice if you have the thousands of dollars to cover the cost .
However , I ’m willing to bet there are a lot of startups out there that simply can’t afford the added burden to their pocket book .
If you ’ve come to the conclusion that you ca n’t afford an attorney this article was written for you and will hopefully provide you with an overview of the entire process of registering a trademark .
Even with the absence of an attorney you still need to be prepared to pay $ 350.00 – $ 1,500.00 for the USPTO filing fees .
There is a reason the cost can vary so much ; it depends on how many classes you need to register .
At the time this article was written the fee / charge per class was $ 325.00 ( Please follow the second link below to find the current fee schedule ) .
A class or more specifically classification is used to identify the goods or services that correspond to your trademark / business .
Some businesses offer goods or services that ca n’t be adequately covered by just one class , this is when the costs can really add up .
It should also be noted that a trademark can also be considered a service mark depending on the type of business for which the mark is being registered .
Unfortunately , the cost of registering a trademark is n’t the only issue .
The fine folks at the USPTO are meticulous with details ( for good reason ) and offer little room for error .
If you make any critical mistakes on your application you may find yourself out of the non-refundable registration / filing fees .
Your first step should be to review all of the information USPTO offers on their website .
After you feel comfortable with what you ’ve reviewed , search their TESS database for similar logos / marks as well as similar names .
If there are trademarks that bare similarities I would recommend speaking to an attorney or doing additional research before you continue because this presents additional variables that I did not encounter during my trademark registration .
After you ’ve reviewed the information on USPTO.com and made sure there are no similarly registered trademarks , it ’s time to do more research .
The best advice I can give you is to use the TESS search to find similar businesses and / or websites that have successfully registered their trademarks and review the information they used for their registration .
By no means whatsoever am I recommending you copy their information ( this would be illegal and more than likely pointless ) , just use it as a tool to make sure you ’re looking in the right direction .
I would n’t stop with reviewing just one similar businesses trademark , look at several .
I would focus on two things while doing your research .
First , pay close attention to the writing style of the descriptions keeping an eye out for specific terminology and look at the way the description is phrased ; if their trademark was approved they must have done it right .
Secondly , you can use similar businesses to help narrow down an appropriate class or classes for your application .
There are two basic formats for trademark registration ; standard character and stylized .
The standard character format is for the registration of words alone , with no claim to any special font or designs .
The standard character format was used when registering , “ disagreeing has never been so much fun ” – JealousBrother .com ’s slogan .
The stylized format is what was used for the JealousBrother .com name / logo due to the uniqueness of the logo ’s design and the fact that there were special fonts and illustrations claimed as a part of the trademark .
The latter is obviously much more difficult to register due to the scrupulous detail required to satisfy the requirements set by the USPTO .
If your trademark requires a stylized registration I strongly suggest going the extra mile when writing the description of the mark .
In my opinion it is better to cover all of your bases with a lot of detail rather than being too lax with your description leaving room for questions .
If you ’re like me then you would probably expect a pretty quick turnaround after forking out hundreds of dollars to register your trademark ; think again .
I ’m sure the USPTO is very busy and the type of data they handle is very detailed and extremely important to many individuals and companies alike .
However , I was pretty shocked when I found out the timeline was three to six months before an examining attorney would even look at my application .
It took roughly two and a half months for an examining attorney to look at our application .
It is also estimated that the entire process from filing to final registration will take between thirteen and sixteen months .
When you file without an attorney this can be a pretty painful and worrisome wait ; wondering if everything was submitted correctly .
After your application is reviewed by the attorney he / she will give you an approval or denial for the official publication of the USPTO gazette .
If approved you will eventually be provided a date your trademark will be published , at which point there will be a waiting period of 30 days .
During this time anyone who has reason to oppose the registration of your trademark has the right to contact the USPTO .
I guess a good analogy would be speak now or forever hold your peace .
After patiently waiting over five and a half months the day finally came , our logo was published in the official Gazette .
If there was one thing I learned up to this point it was that I should never expect anything to happen overnight with the USPTO .
Thirty days of patience came and went and so did another two months before I heard anything .
I guess I expected the USPTO to throw me a congratulatory party in recognition of my trademarked achievement but they did n’t .
Actually , I did n’t even get an email , I found out our trademark had been finalized by checking the status on the USPTO website .
Either way it is a good feeling to know 252 days of my life did not go to waste .
I did eventually receive a nice certificate of registration from the USPTO which will be framed and placed in my office as a reminder of the completion of this difficult task .
I hope this article helps shed some light on what to expect as you embark on a critical yet time consuming journey of registering a trademark .

“ But , look , I understand this day and age of ‘ gotcha ’ journalism , ” McCain said .
“ Is that a pizza place ?
In a conversation with someone who you did n’t hear the question very well , you do n’t know the context of the conversation , grab a phrase .
Gov. Palin and I agree that you do n’t announce that you ’re going to attack another country . ”
It ’s gotten so bad that John McCain has to chaperon his down syndrome Vice President pick Sarah Palin to all of her interviews .
Do you think he has an electronic buzzer so he can shock her everytime she starts talking about molecules and Vladimir Putin invading Russia so she can have foreign policy experience ?

Haunted by Nazi History German Politicians Divided over Anti-Semitism
The German parliament wanted to pass a unanimous resolution against anti-Semitism to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Night of the Broken Glass .
But the effort has fallen victim to political bickering .
Senator Barack Obama - August 2 , 2008
Orlando , Florida
I stand here before you today feeling no small amount of gratitude .
Because I know that my story , and so many other improbable stories , would not be possible without all that the Urban League has done to put opportunity within reach of every American .
It 's because of the doors you 've opened , because of the battles you 've fought and won , because of the sacrifices of people in this room and all those who came before you , that I come here today as a candidate for President of United States of America .
And I 'll never forget how my journey began .
I 'll never forget that I got my start as a foot soldier in the movement the Urban League built - the movement to bring opportunity to every corner of our cities .
As some of you know , after college , I moved to Chicago and went to work for a group of churches to help families that had been devastated when the local steel plants closed down .
I knew change in those communities would n't come easily - but I also knew it would n't come at all if we did n't start bringing people together .
So I reached out to community leaders , and we worked together to set up job training to get people back to work and afterschool programs to keep kids safe , and to help people stand up to their government when it was n't standing up for them .
That work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me to this day : that change does n't come from the top down , it comes from the bottom up .
Change happens when you teach a child to read , or get a worker a job , or help an entrepreneur set up shop .
It happens when you send a young person to college or help a family keep their home .
That 's the kind of change all of you are making every single day .
Because you know that civil rights and equal treatment under the law are necessary , but not sufficient , to seize America 's promise - as Dr. King once said , " the inseparable twin of racial justice is economic justice . "
You know that you can't take that seat at the front of the bus if you can't afford the bus fare .
You can't live in an integrated neighborhood if you can't afford the house .
And it does n't mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you can't afford the lunch .
You know that there was a reason why the march your fourth executive director , Whitney Young , addressed forty - five years ago this summer was n't just called the March on Washington ; and it was n't just called the March on Washington for Freedom ; it was called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom .
On that hot August day , Whitney Young declared that the civil rights for which they were marching were " ... not negotiable .... "
But he also described other marches that lay ahead : the march from " ghettos to decent , wholesome , unrestricted residential areas " ; the march from " relief rolls " to " retraining centers " ; the march from " ill - equipped schools which breed dropouts and which smother motivation " to " well - equipped , integrated facilities throughout the cities . "
And he concluded , " Our march is a march for America . "
Our march is a march for America .
Not black America or white America .
Not rich America or poor America , rural America or urban America .
But all America .
An America where no child 's destiny is determined before she 's born - and no one 's future is confined to the neighborhood he 's born into .
An America where hard work is still a ticket to the middle class - and you can make it if you try .
But somewhere along the way , we got off course .
Somewhere along the way , we let a reckless few game the system , we let special interests tilt the scale and distort the free market , we stopped making the investments in our children and our workers to help us all rise together .
And today , we 're all paying the price .
Today , we stand at a defining moment in our history .
With seven straight months of job losses ; with the highest percentage of homes in foreclosure since the Depression ; with family incomes down $ 1,000 and the costs of gas , groceries and health care up a whole lot more than that - so many people are looking at their children , wondering if they 'll be able to give them the same chances they had .
Our cities have been especially hard hit - facing shrinking tax bases , growing budget deficits , and social services that just can't keep up with people 's needs .
And let 's be very clear : when more than 80 percent of Americans live in metro areas ; when the top 100 metro areas generate two - thirds of our jobs ; when 42 of our metro areas now rank among the world 's 100 largest economies - the problems of our cities are n't just " urban " problems any more .
When rising foreclosures mean vacant homes , abandoned streets and rising crime that spills over city limits - that 's a suburban problem and an ex-urban problem too .
When tens of millions of people in our cities are uninsured , and our urban emergency rooms are overflowing - that 's a suburban and ex-urban problem too .
When urban roads , bridges and transit systems are crumbling ; when urban schools are n't giving young people the skills to compete , so companies decide to take their business and their jobs elsewhere - that 's a suburban and ex-urban problem too .
As President Kennedy once said , " We will neglect our cities to our peril , for in neglecting them we neglect the nation . "
So we 've got a decision to make .
We can continue President Bush 's economic policies - the policies that got us here in the first place .
That 's the course Senator McCain would have us follow .
He 's said we 've made " great progress economically " under President Bush .
Well , I disagree .
We face serious issues in this election - and have real differences .
But I 'm not going to assault Senator McCain 's character .
I 'm not going to compare him to pop stars .
I will , however , compare our two visions for our economic future .
Senator McCain wants to keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas .
I want to end them and start giving incentives to companies that create jobs here at home .
Because I do n't think 463,000 lost jobs this year is economic progress .
He wants to give $ 300 billion worth of tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans .
Under his plan , more than 100 million middle class families wo n't see a penny in direct tax relief .
I want to put a tax cut of up to $ 1,000 into the pockets of 95 % of working Americans .
And if you 're a family making less than $ 250,000 a year , my plan wo n't raise your taxes one penny - not your income taxes , not your payroll taxes , not your capital gains taxes , not any of your taxes .
Senator McCain is opposed to regular increases in the minimum wage - I want to index it so that it rises with rising costs .
He thinks the Earned Income Tax Credit is fine as it is - I want to expand it .
He has no plans to make childcare more affordable or help people get paid sick leave - while I do .
In the end , Senator McCain 's plans , if you 're doing spectacularly well now , you 'll do even better .
Otherwise , you 'll likely be stuck running in place - or fall even further behind .
Well , I do n't think that 's good enough .
Those policies have n't worked for the past eight years , they wo n't work now , and it 's time for something new .
It 's time for policies that reflect the fundamental truth that we rise or fall as one nation .
That 's the truth at the heart of your Opportunity Compact - that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street and a struggling Main Street .
That when wages are flat , prices are rising , and more and more Americans are mired in debt , our economy as a whole suffers .
Our competitiveness as a nation suffers .
Our children 's future suffers .
So we all have a stake here .
That 's why your opportunity agenda is a compact - not a guarantee , not a promise - but a call to responsibility .
Because we know that government can't solve all our problems , and government can't and should n't do for us what we should be doing for ourselves : raising our kids the right way , being good neighbors and good citizens , becoming leaders in our industries and communities .
We know that the American dream is n't something that happens to you - it 's something you strive for and work for and seize with your own two hands .
And we 've got a responsibility as a nation to keep that dream alive for all of our people .
That 's what I was trying to do working with folks on the South Side of Chicago all those years ago .
Those folks were n't asking for a handout or an easy way out .
They wanted to work , they wanted to contribute , they wanted to give their kids every opportunity to succeed .
They just needed a chance , an opportunity to start climbing - the same thing we all want in life .
And that 's what this election is about .
This election is about the 47 million people who do n't have health care - including 1 in 5 African Americans - people for whom one accident , one illness could mean financial ruin .
That 's why , when I'm President , we 'll bring down health care costs by $ 2,500 for the typical family and prevent insurance companies from discriminating against those who need care most .
We 'll guarantee health care for anyone who needs it , make it affordable for anyone who wants it , and ensure that the quality of your health care does n't depend on the color of your skin .
This election is about the couple I met in North Las Vegas who saved up for decades only to be tricked into buying a home they could n't afford - and all those families whose dream of owning a home has been shattered by that grim foreclosure notice in the mail .
Unfortunately , Senator McCain 's housing plan does n't do anything to help many of the 2.5 million homeowners facing foreclosure - even as he supported spending billions to bail out Wall Street .
I 've got a different approach .
Two years ago , I offered a proposal to crack down on mortgage fraud .
I worked with Senator Chris Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank to pass a housing bill that will help families refinance their mortgages and stay in their homes .
And I support tax credits to help low and middle - income Americans afford their mortgage payments .
Because if we can bail out the investment banks on Wall Street who helped create this crisis , then we can certainly extend a hand to folks bearing the brunt of it on Main Street .
This election is also about every child sitting in a crumbling classroom ; every child taught by a teacher who is n't getting the support he or she needs .
It 's about the 1.2 million students who fail to graduate high school each year - including 100,000 last year in Florida .
It 's about the " catastrophe , " as Colin Powell put it , of children in our nation 's largest cities who have a 50 - 50 chance - literally a coin toss - of graduating on - time .
Now , I think it 's interesting that Senator McCain came before you yesterday and attacked my record on education reform .
For someone who 's been in Washington nearly 30 years , he 's got a pretty slim record on education , and when he has taken a stand , it 's been the wrong one .
So I 'm happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day .
He voted against increased funding for No Child Left Behind to preserve billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans - tax breaks he wants to extend without saying how he'd pay for them .
He voted against increasing funds for Head Start , and Pell Grants , and the hiring of 100,000 new teachers again and again and again .
He even applauded the idea of abolishing the Department of Education .
In fact , his only proposal seems to be recycling tired rhetoric about vouchers .
Now , I 've been a proponent of public school choice throughout my career .
I also believe that well - designed public charter schools have a lot to offer .
That 's why I helped pass legislation to double the number of charter schools in Chicago .
But what I do oppose is using public money for private school vouchers .
We need to focus on fixing and improving our public schools ; not throwing our hands up and walking away from them .
We need to stop the tired old attacks , and start getting results for our children .
That 's why I 've been working to reform our schools for years .
That 's why I introduced a comprehensive plan last fall to recruit , prepare and retain effective teachers across America and why I added a program to the education bill that passed just yesterday to prepare high quality teachers in urban areas .
That 's why I introduced legislation to lower the dropout rate , starting in middle school .
That 's why , when I'm President , we 'll give every child access to high quality pre-kindergarten programs , recruit an army of new teachers for our communities , stop leaving the money behind for No Child Left Behind , and make college affordable for anyone who wants to go .
That 's how we 'll give every young person the skills to get a good job ; that 's how we 'll ensure that America can compete in the twenty - first century global economy .
And if people tell you that we can't afford to invest in education or health care or good jobs , you just remind them that we 're spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq .
And if we can spend that much money in Iraq , we can spend some of that money right here in America , in cities all across this country .
We know the difference we can make when we work together to open the doors of opportunity wide enough for everyone to walk through .
Today , I 'm thinking of one particular example from your history .
Back in January of 1949 , the Urban League brought representatives from General Electric to Howard University to recruit graduating seniors .
It was the first time in history that a company like that had come to a black university campus to hire students .
The next year , thirteen companies recruited at Howard .
Soon after that , more than 500 corporate representatives came to half a dozen other colleges and universities .
And today , national and multinational companies recruit African American students at HBCUs and colleges and universities across this country .
Think about all the careers launched , the wealth built , the homes bought , the tuition paid , and the dreams realized - think about all the grandparents looking back on their achievements with pride , and the children looking forward to their futures with hope - all , at least in part , because of what the Urban League started on a winter day nearly 60 years ago .
That is the march for America that Whitney Young spoke of all those years ago .
The march that led so many of our parents and grandparents north to our cities , looking to start a new life , unafraid of hard work , determined to give their children opportunities they never had .
As the poet Alice Walker once wrote , " ... they knew what we must know without knowing a page of it themselves . "
That 's what we 've always done in America : dream big for ourselves - and even bigger for our children and grandchildren .
And if you 're willing to work with me , and fight with me , and stand with me this fall , then I promise you , we will build a nation worthy of their future .
Thank you , God bless you , and God bless America .
UNC Asheville senior Kenny George had part of his right foot amputated , a source confirmed to ESPN.com .
The source said the amputation , which occurred three weeks ago , was the result of George 's battle with MRSA , a difficult - to - treat and sometimes life - threatening antibiotic - resistant staph infection .
The Asheville Citizen Times first reported the story .
In August , George returned to his Chicago home from Pete Newell 's Big Man Camp in Las Vegas with an infection in his foot .
Doctors there suggested that George immediately see a specialist .
He 's been hospitalized in Iowa since then , the source said , enduring several surgeries and at one time battling for his life .
He 's expected to remain in the hospital for at least another month .
MRSA ( methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) is transmitted through skin - to - skin contact through openings in the skin .
Last month UNC Asheville said that George would not play this semester because of a foot infection but did not release further details .
George , at 7 - foot - 7 college basketball 's tallest player , averaged 12.4 points and 7.0 rebounds for the Bulldogs last season .
The Big South 's defensive player of the year , he led them to a school - record 23 wins .
George 's height and weight -- he was listed at 360 pounds last season and wore size 26 shoes -- is the result of an overactive pituitary gland .
George , who stands 7 - 9 with shoes , could dunk flat - footed and towered over most players .
But he had two major knee injuries , among other problems , and missed nearly three full seasons .
Coach Eddie Biedenbach declined to comment about the specifics but said he expects George to return to campus next semester and complete his degree in mass communications .
" This is a terrible setback for his basketball life but there is so much more to him than basketball , '' Biedenbach said .
" The students at this school think the world of Kenny George outside of basketball .
We 're looking forward to him coming back second semester -- that 's what he wants to do -- and complete his degree .
At that point , we 'd still like him to be a part of our basketball program and part of this school . "

" … people who vote are quick to distance themselves from the guy to whom they gave their support .
It seems to me that if your candidate lies , cheats , steals , or gets a whole bunch of people killed you — the voter who supported him — might share some blame . …
With the secret ballot , everyone can claim to be disappointed with the guy they actually helped elect ! "
~ " I Do n’t Mind If You Keep Voting , But … "
In the piece above , I attempted to lay out some very basic non-voting logic , as well as provide a handy - dandy bibliography to some of the exceptional non-voting prose from giants like Butler Shafer , Wendy McElroy , and others .
From the very positive feedback I received , it would appear that I got my message across .
Still , I know people continue to fight with themselves on this matter .
I have close friends who face internal and external debates about why voting is so necessary , and why anyone who really " understands the struggle " would have to take part , and similar hooey .
The simple fact of the matter is this : Voting — and I 'm talking here about national - level elections for public office , but similar logic is available , if less applicable , at other levels — is a waste of time .
Shaffer 's suggestion that one is better served doing a thorough examination of his navel lint was overly kind .
This essay represents my ( hopefully ) final volley in this debate .
Thereafter , my navel lint will get all my attention on Election Day .
When that 's done , I 'll find something else to do that wo n't involve entering a booth to select the liar I like best .
Why Is Voting for President a Waste of Time ?
Voting for President of the U.S. is a waste because the issues that should garner the most interest and cause decisive post- election changes will remain unchanged no matter who is elected .
This is absolute , undisputed , unmitigated , hard , cold , polished - to - a - high - gloss , quick - fried - to - a- crackly - crunch , naturally - seasoned , artificially - flavored fact .
How do I know ?
Well , for one thing , it 's been true since the first election for president ever held in the U.S.
Yes , it was true immediately after those initial rich white guys — affectionately known as the Founding Fathers — put their let 's - have - a - country - of - our - own scam to pen and paper .
The truths have only gotten more obvious , while developing wider scope , since those early days in the late 1700's .
Jim Davies , a columnist over on Strike - the - Root , put together an interesting list of the items about which one typically complains regarding the government .
His list included many of the oldies but goodies : fair elections , taxation , bankers running America , needless foreign wars , politicians ignoring the Constitution , etc .
He then offered solutions to each , culminating with an analysis of how the completion of this list would result in a " better " government , or not .
His conclusion is the same as mine :
One ca n't get that which he should most desire — freedom and liberty — from the government .
Let 's create another list , shall we ?
( My list wo n't be as long as Davies ' but that 's okay . )
War
Governments exist to make war .
They always have .
This is because war is a racket .
Standing armies , which are remarkably misnamed , are the realization of the fact that without professional soldiers , wars are often quick and indecisive or long and ridiculous .
( That is , states can still fight , but it 's not really that , well , satisfying and the wars can fizzle out due to simple logistics like running out of ammo or food , or having to tend the crops . )
With professional soldiers employed by a highly - developed state , the cost of supplying them , feeding them , and housing them can be off - loaded to others .
This makes it possible to invade and conquer distant lands and make " efficient " war , i.e. , kill a lot of people very quickly .
Best of all , the profits can still be absorbed by the war - racketeers .
Without a standing army , just defending the plot of land you occupy could be a challenge , although frankly , defending it often , or ever , will likely be unnecessary .
The emergence of the State , dating back to Sumer and ancient Mesopotamia led to the rise of the state - military complex .
These early warfare states arose out of the supposed need for state - financed facilitation of the public good via public works .
Make no mistake however .
The real reasons for the existence of the military - industrial complex had ( and has ) little to do with freedom and everything to do with power , control , and corruption .
Question :
Will the incredibly large worldwide U.S. military presence , including over 750 bases , be curtailed dependent upon who wins any election for president ?
Answer : No .
Follow - up question : Regardless of who is elected , will the gargantuan domestic military - industrial complex be popped like a zit on Baron Harkonnen 's festering kiester ?
Answer : Nope .
The subject wo n't even be seriously debated .
Given the pending " financial crisis " one might argue that the gravy train of govern - mint cash for weapons and those who make them will dry up on its own .
Do n't count on it .
Money
Websites such as LewRockwell.com , Strike - the - Root.com , the Foundation for Economic Education ( FEE ) , the Mises Institute , the Library of Economics and Liberty , the Future of Freedom Foundation ( FFF ) , and many others have provided and continue to provide a cornucopia of information on economics , the Federal Reserve ( the Fed ) and all that inhabits the space in - between .
Inspired writers , from Murray Rothbard to Lew Rockwell to Mark Thornton have provided ample education on historically relevant events and currently - held mythical beliefs .
( Occasionally , even a poser like me chimes in . )
The methodology employed by the Fed — the printing of money with no underlying market - generated value — causes inflation .
Inflation — the perceived rise in consumer prices — results in a massive transfer of wealth from those at the bottom of the economic food chain to those at the top .
Frankly , that 's why the Fed was created !
( The debasement of currency for the benefit of the State dates back at least to Roman times . )
Question : Will the Federal Reserve be abolished dependent upon who wins any election for president ?
Answer : No .
Follow - up question : Regardless of who is elected , will the wealth transfer that has corresponded with the loss of over 80 % of the value of the dollar since 1970 be stopped like one of those Toyota Tundra trucks ?
Answer : Not hardly .
Best case , it gets mentioned in passing .
Despite the fact that the abolition of the Federal Reserve would not , I repeat , not result in the end of the State , it would still be a nice step .
Instead , when the current fiat currency scheme goes belly - up — and it will , because they always do — one can be sure that agents of the State will come up with a new one to take its place .
The same financiers ( or people just like them ) who absorbed that transferred wealth the first go - round will return again to the teat , fat and happy as ever .
Any bailout , such as the one currently under discussion , simply provides an opportunity to really gouge from the taxpayer for a specific instance , but the systematic transfer of wealth , caused by the inflation / debt sandwich , both predicated on the printing of money , continues either way .
There is a plethora of great insight out there about why economic crises are the rule versus the exception and why the current " crisis " is just another scam , including but certainly not limited to :
Taxation
Everywhere one goes , he is taxed , often heavily .
When you buy a grande - sized cup of over - priced coffee , you pay taxes .
When you fill - up the tank of that long - term - financed SUV , you pay about 40 % of the cost of each gallon of gas in taxes .
A typical American works about four ( 4 ) months to pay " his fair share " of income taxes .
( How did it come to be true that anyone has a " fair share " of something he did n't volunteer to give ? )
Others have already proven that there is no such thing as a just tax ; but of course , the purpose of taxation has never been justice .
Worse yet , when you die , if you 've somehow managed to sequester any of the money you made along the way , generally in the form of earthy possessions ( while simultaneously managing to keep eating regularly and sleeping inside ) your heirs will pay additional taxes on the value of those possessions , referred to as your estate .
This after you , the deceased , paid taxes on all of that stuff as it was acquired !
The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , just a collection vehicle for income taxes , operates like a police organization , with armed thugs , raids on homes , all that .
The best part :
The amount of " hidden taxation " from the printing of money by the Fed more than accounts for the income generated by the IRS .
I 'd assert that they do n't even " need " the money , despite the amount of government income supposedly due to individual income taxes .
( Maybe that 's better left for another essay . )
Question :
Will the IRS be abolished dependent upon who wins any election for president of the United States ?
Answer : No .
Follow - up question : Regardless of who is elected , will the practice of taxing the citizen at every turn be substantially trimmed back , kinda like the hair during one of Nick Arrojo 's cuts on What Not to Wear ?
Answer : Absolutely , positively , not .
Exemplary of the type of Cat - in - the - Hat lunacy available when viewing the U.S. political system , any suggestion about changing the income tax system almost always includes the term " revenue neutral , " as if the amount of money is okay , it 's just how they collect it that needs modification .
Discussions of taxes by either party take on a surreal air , as if the laws of logic , math , and reality can be suspended at will .
A buddy of mine summed it up after he watched Obama 's acceptance speech at the DNC .
" The best part was when Obama said he'd cut taxes and afterward , buy everyone a pony and later , a saddle for that pony . "
The Republicants are no better and only the mathematically - challenged think so .

A person would have to have spent his entire life in a gated community way off the grid or quietly sleeping under a large rock nourished by only his thumb to not notice that the prison population in the United States is large .
Very .
Large .
There has been no shortage of reporting and opinion about the fact that the United States of America can accurately be described as a prison nation .
I 've personally lamented the fact that much of the prison population in the U.S. is both non-violent and vice - generated .
( When I say " vice - generated " I mean simply that people are in jail for doing something to themselves that other people do n't like . )
The fact that we 've got a war on ( some ) drugs , not a war on ( all ) drugs , is equally obvious .
I 've never been one to decry a good conspiracy theory , but I maintain no strong opinion about the involvement of the CIA in the U.S. drug trade .
For all I know , there is a building at Langley where government workers are actually cooking cocaine for eventual distribution as you read this essay .
I could n't care less , because that 's not the point .
What you ingest is your business and will continue to be so long as people have ownership of their bodies .
( Hat tip : Stephan Kinsella on how we come to own ourselves . )
While I agree with Kinsella , it seems that there are a lot of people who are n't convinced , and many of them have guns and work for the State .
That is the point !
Question : Will marijuana ( or any other supposedly " controlled " substance ) be legalized dependent upon who wins any election for president ?
Answer : No .
Follow - up Question :
Will the prison - industrial complex be smashed like a cockroach crawling out of a trailer park dumpster dependent upon who wins any election for president ?
Answer : Hell no .
Second follow - up question :
Will the fact that , according to a New York Times editorial , " one in nine black men , ages 20 to 34 , are serving time " ( often for drug - related offenses ) be substantially and directly addressed by any elected official , including any black elected official , ever ?
Answer : Never in a million years .
( Frankly , the black politician is probably just glad it 's not him in prison . )
Providing a bit of almost terminal irony , Paul Armentano notes an interesting fact about one of the contenders for this year 's I - run - the - world sweepstakes :
[ D]uring the mid-1980s , [ vice presidential candidate ]
Biden was the chief senate architect of the federal anti-drug laws that re-established mandatory minimum sanctions for various drug possession crimes , and established the racially based 100 - to - 1 sentencing disparity for crimes involving the possession of crack versus powder cocaine .
Many academics have credited Biden ’s law as one of the primary reasons why America now possesses the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world , and why approximately one out of every nine young African - American males are now in prison .
( Emphasis added . )
The chart below shows incarcerated Americans since 1920 .
Note the sharp rise beginning near 1980 .
And now this Biden guy wants to help lead change for America ?
You can not make this stuff up !
And that 's Not Even the Half of It
In this essay I have only examined four ( 4 ) areas — war , money , taxation , and liberty .
No matter what other areas one examines : the chronically - mediocre educational system , the pharma - paid murderers known as the FDA , the theft - fest known as the United Nations , the security - industrial - congressional complex , the answers will generally be the same .
The real problems will not be addressed in any substantial way as a result of a national election for president .
The problems exist as a direct and unavoidable consequence of the existence of a coercive state .
The agents of the State can't fix the problems because the existence of the State causes them !
These issues do n't exist only as an unfortunate result of slightly misinformed public servants desperately trying to meet the challenges they have nobly volunteered to address on our behalf , but failing .
They exist because lying , sack - of - cow - dung megalomaniacs created them , either as unintended consequences of some dubious scheme or as direct means to the acquisition of power and money .
Two other points should be noted .
One , when I assert that voting does n't matter , I 'm not suggesting that the " winners " have been pre-ordained by unknown and powerful men , like some scenario from The Matrix come to life .
I 'm saying it does n't matter who wins since the winners are simply proxies for the game within the game .
The people who finance elections finance both sides and will get paid back either way .
The people who are fleeced as a result of elections inhabit both sides and will keep paying either way .
Two , when I list the failures and evil machinations of the current government , I am not suggesting that such behavior has culminated with the latest set of would - be leaders .
In other words , voting is n't a waste because the present crop of contestants is so bad .
The suggestion that George W. Bush is the worst president ever rests equally on the availability heuristic and a misunderstanding of history .
The first president of the United States led a military force to quell a civilian rebellion caused by one of his cabinet member 's revenue - generation schemes .
That the new nation had just finished an armed rebellion , fought in part against unfair taxation , is rather ironic .
It has only gotten worse since then .
Again , the existence of the State is the problem .
Even a president exhibiting such obvious mental limits as Dubya is but a symptom .
The contests between people like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , and the similar contests between people like John McCain and Mitt Romney may very well be legitimate , with the outcome of primaries and caucuses in places like Iowa and New Hampshire fiercely - contested and unknown to all .
The same might even be said about the general election .
Pretty clearly , voting fraud is not a figment of the imagination , so someone cares about winning .
Fans of a particular NFL team care who wins as well .
Analogous to elections , the people who actually benefit from NFL games are a tiny subset of the people who care .
( By the way , I love the NFL , and can be found watching almost any game telecast at any time .
Now that I consider it , I might actually benefit more from watching the NFL than voting .
Yahtzee ! )
Getting excited about electing a particular master is incredibly stupid if one will still be a slave — subject to virtually the same amount of random theft and rape - as - needed — after the election is over .
Given that over 40 % of the voting - eligible U.S. population stays home on Election Day , I 'm evidently not the only one who realizes this .
Conclusion
Now , none of this means that all is lost and one must become cynical and negative .
Perish the thought !
There is a wide range of pursuits that become available when the smoke surrounding and generated by busy work such as voting is cleared away .
Enjoy them .
( Personally , I 'm looking forward to some great laughs as people like Tina Fey lampoon Sarah Palin . )
More importantly , as Woodson taught long ago , freedom begins in the mind .
Similarly , Rockwell opined just recently , " Real change comes from working in the world of enterprise and ideas . "
There is work to be done .
Hoppe has written extensively on why the consent of the stolen - from is required for the State to keep stealing .
In " On the Impossibility of Limited Government … " we find :
… It is necessary to recognize that the ultimate power of every government  whether of kings or caretakers  rests solely on opinion and not on physical force .
The agents of government are never more than a small proportion of the total population under their control .
This implies that no government can possibly enforce its will upon the entire population unless it finds widespread support and voluntary cooperation within the nongovernmental public .
It implies likewise that every government can be brought down by a mere change in public opinion , i.e. , by the withdrawal of the public ’s consent and cooperation .
Indeed .
It is vital to realize that " the ultimate power of every government rests solely on opinion and not on physical force . "
Voting illustrates both support and consent .
Withdraw them , please .

[ Link ] What do Rails Documentation and Carrot Juice Have in Common ?
I am presently looking for work , and fighting off a flu .
This , of course , means that I both need to interview and am unable to speak at the same time .
So , I 've been mostly sleeping .
Mostly .
I have also been trying to hack on Ruby on Rails 2.1 .
Please note the 2.1 , as it is not optional to note that , which is exactly what I 'm getting around to .
Read on ...
Rails is a lot like quantum mechanics .
It is extremely powerful , parts of it are deceptively simple , and if you look at anything , it changes .
You quickly become convinced that Rails might as well have a your application .
What 's going on ?
Well , here are the main reasons why learning Rails today , right now , October 19th , 2008 , sucks :
1 . The current version of Rails , Rails 2.1 , is hugely changed from Rails 1.x .
And not in a small way .
The problem is that Rails 1.x was still very exciting , generating a huge amount of interest , and a massive amount of chatter -- all of which will now function as total misinformation when you are attempting to do on - line searches for information .
Which , after you get frustrated with that , will bring you to my next point :
2. Practically all of the printed manuals available are for Rails 1.x .
I cannot overstate the damage this does .
You 're probably used to reading manuals that are not cutting - edge , and not minding that much .
Sure , you miss a few fancy new API functions -- sometimes you miss something that 's far , far better than the older options .
However , the older options are generally still available , and you can use them .
This is , incidentally , one thing that the Win32 APIs got right for a very long time , and one of the reasons the barriers to entry for new Windows programmers were so low .
It is extremely important .
However , Rails 2.x changes so radically from Rails 1.x-- for all the right reasons , admittedly -- that any documentation for Rails 1.x is not just incomplete , not even obsolete , it is actually dangerous .
If you are a new developer , you are far better off , as near as I can tell , never even opening a Rails 1.x manual .
I am not kidding .
Remember Direct3D Retained Mode ?
It 's like that .
One of the few books ( and , as of this writing , it is a stark landscape out there ) recommended for 2.x development is " Agile Web Development with Rails " .
While I respect the authors , and definitely recommend Dave Thomas in particular , there is something you should understand about this book , and most of the available texts .
As near as I can tell , there are no Rails reference books .
I mean that very literally .
" Agile " , in particular , is one of the worst - indexed texts I have ever seen .
It is intended to be read in a largely linear fashion , from cover to cover .
That may indeed be as intended , but at the moment , the practical upshot of this is that one of the few books that covers the current technology is extremely frustrating to try and use as a reference .
That said , if you have to buy something today , that 's probably what you need to buy .
Incidentally , Ruby itself is a different story -- there are a number of excellent books on Ruby itself , and that situation is mature and useful .
3 . The technologies most helpful for new developers are the ones that have changed the most .
If you are diving into Rails , the word you will come to both love and hate is scaffolding .
Scaffolding involves the automatic generation of code , yes , but it also automatically gives you directory structures that are consistent with Rails ( which is very important ) and a number of placeholders that wiil prove useful .
The problem is that you will be almost immediately tempted to use it as a huge crutch .
Initially , this is not bad .
But , like all code generators , you will wind up in situations where you either have to start maintaining things yourself , or re-run the generator -- which , yes , will stomp on some of your changes .
So early on , you will be critically interested in two things : how to make the scaffolding generators do things , and how to modify things manually in a meaningful way .
Some of this is extremely non-obvious , such as the fact that the structure of a " class " is , by modern standards , actually specified in a database migration .
The primary problem -- which I have absolute confidence is making prospective Rails programmers jump ship in droves -- is this :
Scaffolding has completely changed , and ActiveRecord / REST techniques have changed significantly , to the point that nearly all printed examples are grossly misleading ( and non-executable ) , and the vast majority of information available online is either in the same state , or worse , suggestions and experiments left over from the transitional period , written by experienced Rails 1.x programmers , and largely intended solely for consumption by other Rails 1.x programmers trying desperately to keep their applications running .
The closest thing I have for " advice " for you on this is to learn how to use the date range restrictions on Google , and restrict your search to the last year only , at the loosest .
Beware of reposts of old , outdated , and misleading information .
Shun " suggestions " to modify Rails ' own source code , but do n't be afraid to read it -- just beware that some of the comments and code in there are just as obsolete as the documentation .
Orphaned or legacy functions may not have been pruned -- do n't get confused by them .
4. Platform sprawl .
" Platform sprawl " is a term I 've used before to describe platforms that are reluctant to draw and observe a clear line between the base platform and its extensions .
It can cause some serious problems if it is not addressed reasonably early , and is the reason Cindy Hahn and I helped split wxBase out of wxWindows (
In Rails , platform sprawl is everywhere , and the result is that developers run screaming for plug-ins far more often than they solve " simple " problems that involve complex research .
This issue drives me bat - shit crazy , and if you want to see it in action , search for this phrase : " rails time zones " .
( Oh yes , we get to go through that again . )
I 'll save you some pain and suffering and inform you that this has largely been fixed , and it has been fixed in Rails - - but you will find next to nothing about that anywhere .
What you will find are a ton of extra plug-ins and libraries and god knows whats that are deceptively simple to install , maddening to configure , and , worst , totally obsolete .
As an example , one thing you will probably want to do at some point is a drag - and - drop sortable list .
It 's cool , it 's modern , it 's far faster than most other UI mechanisms for doing the same thing , at least for short lists , and it can be done in Rails and JavaScript ( " AJAX " , if you like , though strictly speaking this is simpler than AJAX ) .
It CAN be done this way , and you SHOULD do it this way , at least once , so that you understand how the hell it works .
However , there are approximately 50,000 " gems " ( installable Rails modules ) that will do this for you , and any time you spend trying to figure out how in the hell to get them to work ( because , after all , their example documentation wo n't have been adequately updated , either -- only their API docs , if that ) is time that goes down the plugin - specific drain .
An extremely frustrating percentage of the answers to even simple questions about how to do things using the nuts - and - bolts of Rails itself , and custom JavaScript , with or without Prototype , etc. , are met with " Oh , just use this plugin " .
Maddeningly , another large chunk turns out to be cobbled - together code chunks for old Rails versions that either no longer work properly for Rails 2.1 , or will take you off into the weeds , reading about techniques that , even if they still function , are totally obsolete , replaced by far more elegant and practical techniques -- which you will be completely unable to find documentation for , anywhere .
5. Context - free API documentation
Obviously , you should make the most of the content on the official Rails site .
The problem is that the only stuff on there that consistently has any kind of completeness to it is the API documentation , and because syntax in Ruby is so flexible , you really need to see larger examples to get the idea of how to use API elements in effective block structures for their typical use cases .
This is usually lacking in the API documentation , which is not exactly a problem , since in many cases it would be large enough that it should be elsewhere anyway .
The problem is that " elsewhere " is often a wiki page that does n't exist yet , or worse , one that has n't been updated since 1.x .
6 . The " Hail - Mary " wiki
Having used many wikis , and configured more than a few , let me observe that there are typically two situations in which an organization deploys one :
A . The organization has a large body of content that would either be difficult to organize hierarchically , or which benefits greatly from extensive cross-referencing .
Small experiments with a wiki show a huge and immediate increase in quality and productivity , and the wiki quickly becomes the primary mechanism for editing and retrieving information .
B . The organization realizes that it has no idea how to organize its information , or that the intended structure is proving to be largely ineffective .
As a result , a huge amount of information is effectively getting dropped on the floor ; worse , stale information competes with current information during search operations , and identifying the definitive version of a document is not straightforward .
With no other idea how to proceed , a wiki is rapidly deployed in the same way that a football team throws a " Hail Mary " pass -- under duress , with little time on the clock and no other options .
Because , like , wikis are fantastic .
I mean , gosh , have n't you used Wikipedia ?
Your humble analyst has deduced that the
So what are my conclusions ?
Ugh .
I do n't know .
Maybe that I 'd like to go into cryo for a few years and come out when all of this crap has sane documentation ?
I know -- let 's do a FAQ .
Because , like , FAQs are fantastic .
I mean , gosh , have n't you read the Rails FAQ ?
Q : Is Rails a mature technology ?
A : Maybe .
If you have at least a few top - notch developers who have lived and breathed Rails for the last few years , maybe .
Q : Is Rails deployable ?
A : Yes , provided you do NOT automatically update Ruby , Rails , or anything related to it without paying a lot of attention .
Q : Given all of this , is prototyping in Rails really that much faster ?
A : Believe it or not , yes , it is .
Once you figure something out in Rails , you will get a lot of leverage out of it , and the next project will be much easier .
However , the critical thing to understand is that while the learning curve is not always steep , the curve has discontinuities at the moment .
So it is difficult to say how often you will get stuck , but it is easy to say that when you do get stuck , you may have a hell of a time getting unstuck .
Q : I need to do something from scratch , right now .
Should I even use Rails ?
A : If you are already a mad PHP ninja , and you need to do something quickly , keep throwing shuriken for the moment .
If you are not , I think Rails has a better future ahead , but PHP may be a lot less hassle to learn at the moment .
If you are looking for employment , you may be thinking that technologies this hard to learn tend to be short on qualified developers , and you are correct , but this is the last technology you want to try to snow somebody on .
Hiring managers should likewise be damned sure that their Rails gurus shake and bake any potential hires claiming serious Rails skills .
Q : How well does Rails integrate with source - code control ?
A : Not in a straightforward manner .
It can and should be used , but expect this to take some research , thought , and design prior to deployment .
Q : How familiar should I be with Ruby before trying to learn Rails ?
A : So-so .
A novice Ruby programmer who has written a few object - oriented Ruby applications should have almost all of what they need .
You should understand block structure , iterators , and namespaces , in particular , as those have significant differences from most other languages .
Class and function definitions are similar enough to other modern object - oriented languages that you can pick them up .
One thing you need to know cold , though , are naming conventions -- capitalization , special prefixes , etc .
Rails takes those rules and adds a lot more ( like pluralization rules , which I am not even going to get into here ) so you really have to have them wired .
Buy Dave Thomas 's " Programming Ruby " ( the " pickaxe " book ) if you have n't already -- there is no substitute .
Q : Do you have any resources to recommend ?
A : Only a few .
First , for books , " Agile Web Development with Rails " , but see above .
For any printed reference , before you even read the back cover , open it and check the printing date .
If it 's more than a year old , put it back on the shelf .
For websites , check out that is a good thing , as it means that they are currently one of the only places that has both the ability to rapidly iterate new versions of their training materials and the financial incentive to do so .
Other than that , I could list a bunch of stuff , but you 're going to come across most of it on Google , and there 's very little I can recommend consistently .
Plus , half of it will be out of date by the time your Google search for " frustrated rails developers " lands you on this page , right ?
Finally , there are the Rails mailing lists , and probably a newsgroup or something somewhere .
Why am I waiting until the very end of this drawn - out monologue to even mention these ?
Because , quite bluntly , if your best resource for documentation is a mailing list , a newsgroup , or somewhere else where someone can ask a question and wait hopefully for a reply worth a damn , then you do not have adequate documentation -- and I hope that is the one thing that you , as a professional , walk away with .
That , and always state the date of authorship inside your work -- files are harder to smell than carrot juice .
If you said , " They both expire before you finish them , " you are CORRECT !
I am presently looking for work , and fighting off a flu .
This , of course , means that I bothandat the same time .
So , I 've been mostly sleeping .
Mostly .
I have also been trying to hack on Ruby on Rails 2.1 .
Please note the 2.1 , as it is not optional to note that , which is exactly what I 'm getting around to .
Read on ... Rails is a lot like quantum mechanics .
It is extremely powerful , parts of it are deceptively simple , and if you look at anything , it changes .
You quickly become convinced that Rails might as well have a no cloning theorem , because anything you copy from an existing example will behave completely differently when you put it inapplication .
What 's going on ?

You have platform sprawl when the typical " answer " to a " how do I do X with Y ? " question is , " install Z " , for almost all questions of that form .
When things get to that point , the ability of developers to meaningfully communicate is largely dependent on whether or not they happen to use the same set of plug-ins , a situation exacerbated by the plethora of different solutions to any given problem -- all from different points in time .

Other than that , I could list a bunch of stuff , but you 're going to come across most of it on Google , and there 's very little I can recommend consistently .
Plus , half of it will be out of date by the time your Google search for " frustrated rails developers " lands you on this page , right ?
Finally , there are the Rails mailing lists , and probably a newsgroup or something somewhere .
Why am I waiting until the very end of this drawn - out monologue to even mention these ?
Because , quite bluntly , if your best resource for documentation is a mailing list , a newsgroup , or somewhere else where someone can ask a question and wait hopefully for a reply worth a damn , then you do notadequate documentation -- and I hope that is the one thing that you , as a professional , walk away with .
That , and always state the date of authorship inside your work -- files are harder to smell than carrot juice .
From : garote Date : October 20th , 2008 05:36 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Both amusing and informative , and also confirming of a suspicion I have had for a while now .
And yeah , I just bet , there are at least A THOUSAND little modules out there claiming to be " AJAX " implementations of common modern UI widgetry , like drag - sortable lists and toolbars and embedded RTF / HTML editors and yadda yadda .
They 're gussied - up detritus from when their authors were learning how AJAX works , and their best use to you is as a scrapyard for ripping out clever pieces as you build a module of your own , to suit your own needs .
This is because in order to make anything in AJAX that does n't look like a post - transformation Tetsuo , you need to tear apart the existing implementation and digest the component parts .

The lack of a good Rails reference book is a valid complaint , but the platform is changing so much I doubt anyone wants to write one .
But good information is out there :
has excellent free screen casts covering basic to advanced Rails concepts ( I LOVE this resource )
has some good podcasts
usually covers really new Rails features
is a good resource for any developer , really .
And where google searches fail , searching delicious.com for what I 'm looking for has given decent results in the past .
Other points :
I think knowing Ruby before you know Rails can go a long way .
I tried to learn both at the same time ( Right when 2.0 came out , so yes , the scaffolding thing was very annoying ) and it got confusing trying to figure out which part was Rails , and which part was Ruby .
Also , I 'm not sure what you mean when you say it does n't integrate well with source control .
What 's so much more difficult about setting up git repository with a rails project than using another language ?
They 're both a folder full of files .
While I agree with you on some points , I think it 's just a matter of knowing where to look .
The changes between Rails 1.x and Rails 2.x are extreme , and do require some awareness when expecting to be able to copy and paste a working block of code from a google search .
But seriously , using google to search for working code is risky in any language .
I 'd argue that the pages of non-working , dead - wrong , poorly - written , uber - ugly code outweigh the good code 5 to 1 in any language , not just Rails .

Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : breakpoint Date : October 21st , 2008 11:54 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Hi Jeff -- thanks for the references , I 'll check those out .
I agree that Google should n't be your first choice -- the problem is , most people 's first choices ( decent texts or official documentation more comprehensive than an API ) simply are n't there , and , until you find some sites you gradually come to trust , most developers are going to run out of options and go to Google . \
Since , at that point , the information they find is going to conflict , they 're going to want to run the code samples so they can try and figure out which ones are actually current , and that 's when the fun starts .
As far as the source code control , ah yes , you used the one word that immediately strobe - lights the confusion : " git " .
Let me clarify :
I feel a technology " integrates well with source code control " when I do not have to switch to a different source code control package to use it .
I happen to use Subversion , and while it has its warts , they are related to branching and merging , not basic operation .
Using CVS or Subversion , a Rails project requires careful consideration of which files will be under revision control and which will not .
This happens at initial setup and continues to surface during development .
In a mixed development environment , you will get strong resistance from a team if you expect them to become proficient on multiple source - code control systems -- not unreasonably , in my view -- and you will also get some nasty mistakes , as people forget which quirks go with which system .
Thanks for your feedback !
Have any favourite gems to recommend ?

Hey ,
Did you have a look at http://guides.rails.info ?
Have a look at http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org/guide to see the idea behind guides .
We 're going to keep the guides inside Rails source and if any patch changes the relevant stuff , patch authors will be required to update the guides in order for the patch to be accepted to Rails .

n 1939 , employed in a small municipal library of Buenos Aires where the oafishness of his colleagues made him weep with daily frustration , the 40 - year - old ( and still largely unknown ) Jorge Luis Borges collected a few of the reading notes he had made on the streetcar to and from work , and pieced together a short text which , under the title " The Total Library , " he sent to the magazine Sur , where it appeared in the August issue .
The essay , which links the names of Democritus , Lewis Carroll , Cicero , and the forgotten German fantasy writer Kurd Lasswitz , was developed a couple of years later into another , slightly longer one , " The Library of Babel , " which Borges eventually included in his collection " The Garden of Forking Paths " ( later expanded under the title of " Ficciones " ) .
The end - paper pages of William Goldbloom Bloch 's " The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges ' Library of Babel " ( Oxford University Press , 192 pages , $ 19.95 ) reproduce the first and last pages of Borges 's manuscript , showing that it was written ( in what Borges called " the handwriting of a dwarf " ) on accounting sheets with the heading Haber , or " Credit , " in Gothic letters that magically make the " H " look like a " B " and the " r " like an " l . "
Kristofer Porter
Reading is an erratic craft .
Judging Borges 's book " an exotic and decadent work , " the jury for the Argentinean National Prize in Literature refused to give him a prize and , in spite of the support of a handful of intelligent friends , it was decades before the extraordinary importance of the work was recognized .
Several are the pieces in " The Garden of Forking Paths " ( later included in " Ficciones " ) that have attained the stature of classics ; " The Library of Babel " in particular has given rise to a small critical library of its own .
Barely nine pages long , " The Library of Babel " is nothing less than an attempt to describe the chaotic order and meaning of the universe , building on the ancient notion of the world as a book ( or a book itself divided into an almost infinite number of books ) in which we ourselves are written , and which we also attempt to read .
Mr. Bloch , professor of mathematics at Wheaton College , has woven an elegant , ingenious , scholarly interpretation of Borges 's text that contradicts the disingenuous " unimaginable " of his title .
In 1967 , Borges told the French critic Georges Charbonnier that he had kept two ideas in mind when writing " The Library of Babel . "
The first was a commonplace , an exposition of the combinatory art that has enthralled mathematicians from Archimedes onward , and a conceit amusingly described by Lewis Carroll in " Sylvie and Bruno " : that since the number of words in any given language is finite , their possible combinations  i.e. , books  are finite also , and that therefore , in the near future , writers will no longer ask , " What book shall I write ? " but , " Which book shall I write ? "
Borges confessed that , beyond this abstract idea , he was also describing the troubling feeling of being lost in the universe , and of not being able to understand it .
" In my story , " he told Charbonnier , " there is an intellectual component , and another , of greater importance , I think , that has to do with my sense of loneliness , anguish , uselessness , and of the mysterious nature of the universe , of time , and more importantly , of ourselves .
Or rather , of myself . "
Sensibly , Mr. Bloch has busied himself with the first idea , and left the second one to the empathy of each individual reader .
Mathematics was one of Borges 's lifelong passions ; he considered it , with theology , a branch of fantastic literature .
In his early childhood , Borges had been taught by his father the paradoxes of Zeno and the rudiments of algebra , and his writing abounds in references to magical mathematical imaginings , such as Leibniz 's binary notation or Brouwer 's map , which , as Guillermo Martinez demonstrated in his " Borges and Mathematics , " lent Borges a framework or scaffolding for many of his fictions , most notable among them " The Library of Babel . "
In Borges 's imagining , the Library of Babel itself is a building composed of an indefinite number of hexagonal galleries .
A ventilation shaft in the center of each allows the visitor to see the floors above and below , in endless sequence .
Each wall of each hexagon holds 32 books of identical size ; each book has 410 pages ; each page , 40 lines ; each line , approximately 80 letters .
All possible combinations of the 25 orthographic symbols make up the books ; therefore , every conceivable book must exist in the monstrous library .
In his story , Borges gives just a few examples of what might be found here : " the detailed history of the future , the autobiographies of the archangels , the faithful catalogue of the Library , thousands and thousands of false catalogues , the proof of the falsity of those false catalogues , the proof of the falsity of the true catalogue ... "
The numbers he chose for the shelves and books in his story , Borges later confessed , were simply those of the municipal library in which he worked  and which he himself found so horrible .
" Learned critics , " he noted later , with some evident pleasure , " studied these figures and generously lent them a mystical significance . "
Mr. Bloch , with similar generosity , and in an exercise he himself describes as " tedious , uninspired , but straightforward " if carried out in full , asks whether our entire universe could in fact contain this dizzying number of books .
Even if it could ( if the size of the library , as Borges suggests , coincided with that of the universe ) , the inconceivably vast space would make it impossible for a human librarian to even barely begin its exploration .
Walking 60 miles a day for 100 years , notes Mr. Bloch , our vigorous librarian would only travel a distance slightly less than that which light covers in two minutes .
" To cross our universe , which is incomprehensibly dwarfed by the Library , light would need to travel for a least 15 billion years . "
It would take a librarian , moving at the leisurely pace of a connoisseur , considerably longer  a mathematical certainty that mirrors the nightmarish vision Borges said he wished to convey .
Though I confess that my mathematical illiteracy made it difficult for me to follow many of his formulas and graphs , the lucidity of Mr. Bloch 's arguments enlightened me nevertheless , in conclusions such as this :
" The librarian 's life and the Library together embody a Turing machine [ a rudimentary computer ] , running an unimaginable program whose output can only be interpreted by a godlike external observer . "
This fits precisely with Borges 's intuition that the world is its own representation , a notion repeated many times throughout his writings :
As a map that coincides with the geography it surveys ( " The Cartographers ' Empire " ) , as a world encyclopedia whose entries already are the very world it describes ( " The Congress " ) , as a point of light in which everything in the universe is assembled ( " The Aleph " ) , and as the goings and comings of one man incarnated in that man ( the epilogue to " Dreamtigers " ) .
Mr. Bloch notes in his preface that the ideal reader of his book is Umberto Eco .
Unworthy as I am to aspire to the condition of the great polymath ( with whom I share nothing but the girth and the beard ) , I was delighted and instructed by the book 's wit and wisdom , and grateful for the guided tour through the mathematical foundations on which both the Library of Babel and its mirror , our universe , are so delicately balanced .
Mr. Manguel is a critic , translator , essayist , and author .
Among his many books are " A History of Reading , " " With Borges , " and " The Library at Night . "
We are living through two great meltdowns – the credit crunch , and the climate crunch .
The heating of the planet is now happening so fast it's hard to pluck a single event to fix on , but here 's one .
By the summer of 2013 , the Arctic will be free of ice .
How big an event it this ?
The Wall Street Crash had n't happened for 80 years .
The Arctic Crash has n't happened for three million years : that 's the last time there was watery emptiness at the top of the world .
The Arctic is often described as the canary in the coal mine .
As one Arctic researcher put it to me this week : the canary is dead .
It 's time to clear the mine , and run .
We now have higher levels of warming gases in the atmosphere than at any point in modern geological history .
The last time they were higher than this was during the ecocene , 50 million years ago .
Sea levels were 300 feet higher than today , and crocodiles swam at the poles .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
So it seems strange that even here in Europe – the continent that has taken the evidence about global warming most seriously – many of our leaders are trying to use the credit crunch as an excuse to drive us deeper into the climate crunch .
Last year , all the EU leaders agreed to carry out the bare minimum scientists say we need to prevent catastrophe .
By the year 2020 , they agreed to a 20 per cent cut in carbon emissions , a 20 per cent rise in energy efficiency , and to get 20 per cent of our energy from renewables .
This meant the EU could stroll into the talks for a successor treaty to Kyoto in the strongest position to pressure the world .
The continent that gave the world the Enlightenment and modern science was upholding those values – and offering our species the path out of a dead - end .
Until last week .
At the EU summit to bail out the banks , several leaders began to quibble about bailing out the climate .
The British Government has been trying to punch holes in it , demanding exemptions for aviation and other accounting tricks .
The eastern European bloc – led by Polish PM Donald Tusk – said the deal was " too much " during a recession , but they need a Western European country if they 're going to totally break the deal .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi took a break from finger - printing gypsies to say : " We do n't think this is the moment to push forward on our own like Don Quixote .
We have time . "
But time is exactly what we do n't have .
The key to understanding why lies in grasping the difference between a two - degree celcius rise in global temperatures and a three - degree rise .
At first glance , neither sounds like a big deal .
If you go out for a picnic and the temperature rises by three degrees , you take off your jacket .
But if your body heats up one or two degrees , you get sick and take to your bed .
If it heats by three degrees and does n't go back , you die .
The ecosystem is n't a picnic ; it 's more like your body .
Small variations in global temperatures have vast consequences .
The last Ice Age was only six degrees colder than today .
A global rise of just 0.8 degrees has melted the Arctic .
Soon , we will have belched so many warming gases into the atmosphere that a two - degree rise will be locked - in and certain .
That condemns Bangladesh and the islands of the South Pacific to drowning .
But if we choose , we can stop there , and stabilise the climate at this higher temperature .
But if we go beyond two degrees , the climate begins to unravel , and the brakes wo n't work .
At three degrees , almost all the world 's ice is gone , and so it stops reflecting a third of the Sun 's ray back into space – making the world hotter .
At three degrees , the Amazon rainforest burns down , releasing all its stored carbon – making the world hotter .
At three degrees , the Siberian peat - bogs melt and release vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere – making the world hotter .
So three degrees turns inexorably to four and five and six .
Screw the grandchildren and the polar bears : we 're on course to heat by three degrees in my lifetime .
I wish the deniers were right : I 'd be on the first plane to Honolulu .
But we can't live for long in an euphoric dream .
Two degrees is the point of no return , and we 're about to hit it .
The collision of these two crunches could be a boon .
Just as the banking system imploded when it was left unregulated , the current carbon - spewing economy is on course to ecologically implode .
The path out of both crunches is the same : concerted state action and re-regulation .
To get out of the credit crunch , we need a big package of job creation and economic stimulus .
To get out of the climate crunch , we need an army of millions of new workers – and billions in public spending – to insulate every home , construct millions of new renewable energy sources , and work on endless innovations that help us to decarbonise .
See any overlap ?
Europe would get a head - start in green technologies – the great boom - market of the 21st century , if the world sees sense .
The belief we can't deal with global warming because we need to pursue growth is pulverised by a Stern fact : global warming will smother economic growth .
When the British Government commissioned the economist Sir Nicholas Stern to study the economic impact of Weather of Mass Destruction , he found that warming could slash 20 per cent off the global economy in my lifetime – while it costs just 3 per cent of GDP to stop it now .
People who wo n't stop warming for the sake of growth are like a man who wo n't stop his house burning down because he makes a living toasting marshmallows on the flames .
Yes , we could choose business - as - usual .
Then , as the climatologist Professor Marty Hoffert says : " Somebody will visit in a few hundred million years and find there were some intelligent beings who lived here for a while , but just could n't handle the transition from being hunter - gatherers to high technology . "
Feeling pessimistic yet ?
Do n't be .
There is another way .
This is , perversely , a dazzling time to be alive : every human being who ever lives will deal with the decisions we make here .
If we disregard the voices of denial , Europe has a chance to do something extraordinary .
We could be the people who saw this threat to our species coming and remade our societies to stop it .
The story of Europe 's 2020 vision could be heroic , but only if we fight now to save it from the vandals .

At a rally today in Charleston , WV , Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden took aim at John McCain ’s recent criticism of the Bush administration , “ John McCain is now attacking the Bush budget and fiscal policies .
Folks , this is as crazy as the Sundance Kid attacking Butch Cassidy !
They were in this together . ”
Biden mocked the idea that John McCain is a candidate of change , “ John McCain voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time .
Until recently , he was bragging about it .
He said these policies produced “ great economic progress . ”
Look , I know Halloween is coming .
But John McCain as the candidate of change ?
That ’s one costume the American people are n’t going to buy . ”
He continued , “ So I know we ’re not running against President Bush .
But we are running against the very Bush economic policies John McCain is promising to continue .
John McCain and Sarah Palin call themselves mavericks … but to paraphrase your neighbor — Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania — you ca n’t call yourself a maverick when all you ’ve been is a sidekick . ”

I am starting to wonder if the McCain campaign is n’t trying to destroy their party .
I ca n’t think of a better way to shatter the morale of the base , then to have the presidential candidate attack the sitting president of his party .
McCain should have distanced himself from Bush months ago , but they won the nomination based on McCain ’s support of Bush , and they were too slow to react to the general election climate .
For Obama and Biden , this is like shooting fish in a barrel .
McCain ’s attacks on Bush opened up the door for them to deliver the exact message that they want to use to close this campaign .
They can link Bush to McCain at every event , every day until next Tuesday .
It is too late for McCain to distance himself from Bush .
Polling shows that voters have long ago made up their minds that McCain equals more Bush .
The big stunner in this story is that Joe Biden is campaigning in West Virginia , which until recently was thought to be a solid red state .
The fact that Biden has the luxury of campaigning in red states speaks volumes about the status of this race .

The prospect of an African - American president is bringing white supremacist subculture in the US out of the shadows
Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman , the two Tennessee neo -Nazis arrested for plotting to kill 102 African - American schoolchildren and then assassinate Barack Obama , clearly drew inspiration from a violent white nationalist group called the Order .
In the 1980s , members of the Order carried out a crime spree that included several high - profile murders .
The connection to the Order is evident in the numbers the two men scrawled on their car on Saturday shortly before they were arrested : 14 and 88 .
The so - called Fourteen Words is a slogan - " We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children " - coined by Order member David Lane , who also wrote an essay called 88 Precepts .
In white supremacist circles , 14 - 88 is a shorthand expression of allegiance to the beliefs put forth by Lane and the Order , who wanted to found a white homeland where they could preserve the " Aryan race " from being polluted by non-whites and enslaved by the " Zionist - occupied government " of the US .
Lane also advocated polygamy and a kind of European paganism he called Wotanism .
The plot by the two Tennessee men , grotesque as it may be , seems not to have got beyond the half - baked stage .
But in the early 1980s , the Order - also known as the Brüder Schweigen or Silent Brotherhood - was active , violent , and deadly .
In order to finance their mission , the gang robbed a series of banks and armoured cars and ran a counterfeiting operation .
Cowart and Schlesselman are also said to have planned a series of robberies to support their plot - another indication that they modelled themselves on the Order .
Order members were best known for the 1984 murder of Denver talkshow host Alan Berg .
The group 's leader , Robert Jay Matthews , was killed soon afterwards in a shootout with federal agents .
David Lane was arrested in 1985 and died in prison last year while serving a 190 - year sentence .
Both men have become heroes and martyrs to the white supremacist movement .
During the heyday of the racist far right in the 1980s , the Order was only one of the groups active across the US .
I wrote about that subculture for years , and made a film about it .
During that time , I visited one of the meetings that brought the various groups together , hosted on the Michigan farm of Bob Miles , the Grand Dragon of the local Ku Klux Klan ( and also a former finance chairman of the Michigan Republican party ) .
Miles sought to unite the divergent factions - the various Klans , the Aryan Nations , the National Alliance , the Posse Comitatus , the Order and others - into a serious revolutionary movement with an armed underground .
This would be built around leaderless cells and have an overground political presence .
In some cases , efforts were made to influence the most rightwing reaches of the Republican party .
Bob Miles 's dream of a united front never materialised .
And those who track the white power movement generally view it as having been in decline after the 1980s , floundering around without purpose or leadership .
Yet remnants of it have clearly survived .
They surfaced with horrific results in Oklahoma City in 1995 , and they can be found among today 's skinheads and their fellow travellers .
Some of these are part of biker gangs , including the Sons of Silence , who were implicated in a threat against Obama at the Democratic convention in Denver .
Some have joined the anti-immigrant vigilante movement , committing drive - by shootings of Mexican labourers .
Others are scattered around doing their own thing : picking fights in bars , beating up gay men .
Some are clearly being brought out of the dark corners by the prospect of an African - American man as president .
That 's the case with the subject of our video , the National Socialist Movement 's Steven Boswell , who talked to us in Columbia , Missouri .

( Reuters ) - Troubled financial giants getting cash infusions from the U.S. Federal Reserve owe their executives more than $ 40 billion for past year ’s pay and pensions as of the end of 2007 , the Wall Street Journal said in an analysis .
The sums owed are mostly for special executive pensions and deferred compensation , including bonuses , for prior years , said the paper .
The Journal also cited investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc , which owes its executives $ 11.8 billion ; JPMorgan Chase & Co , which has a payment of $ 8.5 billion pending ; and Morgan Stanley , which owes between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion to executives .
Criticism of executive pay has gained momentum this election year with presidential candidates from both major parties lashing out over rich payouts for CEOs of companies that have suffered big losses in the U.S. housing market bust and ensuing credit crisis .
As a result , the government has sought to rein in executive pay at banks getting federal money as part of the Bush administration ’s $ 700 billion bailout program .
But overlooked in these efforts is the total size of debts that financial firms receiving taxpayer assistance previously incurred to their executives , which at some firms exceed what they owe in pensions to their entire work forces , the Journal said .
For instance , nine banks paid out an estimated $ 50 billion of bonuses in 2007 , based on the total compensation expense for the companies and assuming that for investment banks about 60 percent of total compensation was allocated for bonuses , and for commercial banks about 20 percent went to bonuses .
Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
SIERRA BLANCA , Texas --
In a swampy corner of his desolate ranch , Bill Addington proudly flouts the law .
The Department of Homeland Security has demanded that he tear down a rickety footbridge from his land across the Rio Grande into Mexico .
Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , authorities have shut down nearly a dozen of these informal river crossings along the Texas border .
This is the last they know to be operating .
They want it gone .
Mr. Addington refuses .
He crossed that bridge countless times as a boy , darting into Mexico to buy candy or watermelon juice or to flirt with the girls at church - hall dances .
Mexicans crossed over , too , every day , to work the cotton fields for Mr. Addington 's father -- a U.S. Border Patrol agent .
After a hard season 's labor , they would all celebrate together with a night of bilingual poker , fueled by whiskey and calf - brain stew .
Mr. Addington , who is 52 , clings to those memories .
So when the Department of Homeland Security sent his family a letter this past summer warning that his bridge could allow " the illegal entry of terrorists , aliens , and / or drug traffickers , " he scoffed .

Macroeconomic model builders have finally realized what Henry Hazlitt and John T. Flynn ( among others ) knew in the 1930s : FDR 's New Deal made the Great Depression longer and deeper .
It is a myth that Franklin D. Roosevelt " got us out of the Depression " and " saved capitalism from itself , " as generations of Americans have been taught by the state 's educational establishment .
This realization on the part of macroeconomists comes in the form of an article in the August 2004 Journal of Political Economy entitled " New Deal Policies and the Persistence of the Great Depression : A General Equilibrium Analysis , " by UCLA economists Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian .
This is a big deal , since the JPE is arguably the top academic economics journal in the world .
" Real gross domestic product per adult , which was 39 percent below trend at the trough of the Depression in 1933 , remained 27 percent below trend in 1939 , " the authors write .
And " Similarly , private hours worked were 27 percent below trend in 1933 and remained 21 percent below trend in 1939 . "
This should be no surprise to anyone who has studied the reality of the Great Depression , for U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the official unemployment rate was still 17.2 percent in 1939 despite seven years of " economic salvation " at the hands of the Roosevelt administration ( the normal , pre-Depression unemployment rate was about 3 percent ) .
Per capita GDP was lower in 1939 than in 1929 ( $ 847 vs. $ 857 ) , as were personal consumption expenditures ( $ 67.6 billion vs. $ 78.9 billion ) , according to Census Bureau data .
Net private investment was minus $ 3.1 billion from 1930 – 40 .
Cole and Ohanian write as though they were surprised — even shocked — to discover these facts , not so much because they were bamboozled by The Myth of the New Deal , but because of their devotion to " neoclassical model building " as opposed to the study of economic reality .
They label as " striking " the fact that the recovery from the Great Depression was " very weak " ( a dramatic understatement ) .
And why is it so striking ?
Because " [t ] hese data contrast sharply with neoclassical theory . . . "
The neoclassical theory of depressions might well be thought of as a Frankenstein Monster theory .
As explained by Cole and Ohanian , " The weak recovery is puzzling because the large negative shocks that some economists believe caused the 1929 –33 downturn — including monetary shocks , productivity shocks , and banking shocks — become positive after 1933 . "
Thus , according to neoclassical theory , the economy during a depression is somewhat like a prostrate Frankenstein monster , with economists playing the role of mad scientists who " shock " the beast into becoming a living being once again .
They do this with various " injections " of government spending or easy credit that will supposedly cause a " roaring " recovery ( just as the rejuvenated beast roared as he left the laboratory to terrorize the townsfolk in the movie , " Young Frankenstein " ) .
" The monetary base increases more than 100 percent between 1933 and 1939 , " the authors write , making the case that such a " monetary shock " should have returned the economy to normalcy .
They invoke the authority of well - known macroeconomists Robert Lucas and Leonard Rapping , who once proclaimed that " positive monetary shocks should have produced a strong recovery , with employment returning to its normal levels by 1936 . "
But as Murray Rothbard showed in America 's Great Depression , it was the easy money policies of the early and mid 1920s that created all the malinvestment that was the trigger for the Great Depression .
The only wise thing to have done was to allow the liquidation of hundreds of overcapitalized businesses to occur .
Instead , the Fed increased the monetary base by 100 percent in five years , causing more of the same overcapitalization problems that were the source of the problem in the first place .
On top of that , virtually every single one of FDR's " New Deal " policies made things even worse and prolonged the Depression .
Austrian economists have known this for decades , but at least the neoclassical model builders have finally caught on — we can hope .
Cole and Ohanian apparently emerged from the rarified world of macroeconomic model building for a long enough period of time to discover that the so - called First New Deal ( 1933 – 34 ) was one giant cartel scheme , whereby the government attempted to enforce cartel pricing and output reductions in hundreds of industries and in agriculture .
This of course was well documented in John T. Flynn 's book , The Roosevelt Myth , first published in 1948 .
Henry Hazlitt had also written about it some fifteen years earlier .
" New Deal cartelization policies are a key factor behind the weak recovery , accounting for about 60 percent of the difference between actual output and trend output , " the authors write .
The fact that it has taken " mainstream " neoclassical economists so long to recognize this fact is truly astounding .
For generations their own neoclassical textbooks have taught that cartels " restrict output " to raise prices .
It has also been no secret that the heart and soul of the First New Deal was to use the coercive powers of government to prop up wages and prices by cartelizing the entire economy .
FDR and his advisors mistakenly believed that the Depression was caused by low prices , therefore , high prices — enforced by threats of violence , coercion and intimidation by the state — would be the " solution . "
Moreover , it is hardly a secret that if less production takes place , fewer workers will be needed by employers and unemployment will subsequently be higher .
Thus , the First New Deal could not possibly have been anything but a gigantic unemployment - producing scheme according to standard neoclassical economic theory .
FDR 's tripling of taxes , his regulation of business , and his relentless anti-business propaganda also contributed to a worsening of the Great Depression , but his labor policies were probably the most harmful to the employment prospects of American workers .
In this regard the most disappointing thing about the Cole - Ohanian article is that they do not even cite the pioneering work of Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway — Out of Work : Unemployment and Government in Twentieth Century America — first published in 1993 .
Indeed , it is somewhat scandalous that they do not cite this well - known work while making essentially the same arguments that Vedder and Gallaway do .
They recite many of the same facts about labor policy :
The NIRA codes established minimum wages for less - skilled and higher - skilled workers alike ; employers were told that they must bargain collectively with unions , which were given myriad legislated advantages in the bargaining process , all enforced by the newly - created National Labor Relations Board .
All of these policies made labor more expensive .
Consequently , as the economic law of demand informs us , the inevitable result had to be less employment .
Strike activity doubled from 14 million strike days in 1936 to 28 million a year later , and wages rose by about 15 percent in 1937 alone .
The union / nonunion wage differential increased from 5 percent in 1933 to 23 percent by 1940 .
Newly - enacted Social Security payroll and unemployment insurance taxes made employment even more expensive .
What all of this means is that during a period of weak or declining derived demand for labor , government policy pushed up the price of labor very significantly , causing employers to purchase less and less of it .
Vedder and Gallaway conducted an econometric evaluation of these labor cost - increasing policies and concluded that most of the abnormal unemployment of the 1930s would have been avoided were it not for these policies .
They estimated that by 1940 the unemployment rate was eight percentage points higher than it would have been without the legislation - induced growth of unionism and government - mandated employment costs .
They conclude that " The Great Depression was very significantly prolonged in both its duration and its magnitude by the impact of New Deal programs " ( p. 141 ) .
Cole and Ohanian reach the exact same conclusions , but express them in the somewhat convoluted language of the " top economic journals " : " New Deal labor and industrial policies did not lift the economy out of the Depression . . . .
Instead , the joint policies of increasing labor 's bargaining power and linking collusion with paying high wages prevented a normal recovery by creating rents and an inefficient insider - outsider friction that raised wages significantly and restricted employment . . . . the abandonment of these policies coincided with the strong economic recovery of the 1940s . "
This last conclusion — that the abandonment of FDR 's policies " coincided " with the recovery of the 1940s is very well documented by another author who is also ignored by Cole and Ohanian , Robert Higgs .
In " Regime Uncertainty : Why the Great Depression Lasted So Long and Why Prosperity Resumed after the War " ( Independent Review , Spring 1997 ) , Higgs showed that it was the relative neutering of New Deal policies , along with a reduction ( in absolute dollars ) of the federal budget from $ 98.4 billion in 1945 to $ 33 billion in 1948 , that brought forth the economic recovery .
Private - sector production increased by almost one - third in 1946 alone , as private capital investment increased for the first time in eighteen years .
In short , it was capitalism that finally ended the Great Depression , not FDR 's hair - brained cartel , wage - increasing , unionizing , and welfare state expanding policies .
It 's good to see that the Journal of Political Economy , the University of Chicago , and UCLA are finally beginning to catch up to the libertarian scholarship of Richard Vedder , Lowell Gallaway , Robert Higgs , Jim Powell ( author of FDR's Folly ) and such predecessors of theirs as Henry Hazlitt , John T. Flynn , Murray Rothbard , F.A. Hayek , William H. Hutt , Benjamin Anderson , and others associated with the Austrian School .
Better late than never .
Here ’s the deal :
You ’re smart .
You ’re creative .
You know what you ’re doing .
But you ’re scared as hell of failing and making mistakes .
Maybe it ’s because you ’ve been so damned good at whatever you ’ve done for your whole life .
Maybe it ’s because you quit a good thing to pick up something risky .
Maybe it ’s because you ’re scared of what happens when you do n’t fail .
I get that .
I do .
I could write all day about how you need to embrace failure and mistakes before you can really unleash your creative potential , but who am I to tell you this ?
So I ’ve enlisted the help of a few thousand years ’ worth of creatives to help me out with these tributes to failure :

Would you like me to give you a formula for success ?
It ’s quite simple , really .
Double your rate of failure .
You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success .
But it is n’t as all .
You can be discouraged by failure – or you can learn from it .
So go ahead and make mistakes .
Make all you can .
Because , remember , that ’s where you will find success .

Lights by Pamela Blalock with John Bayley Readers Digest Condensed Version : Get a Schmidt Dynohub and one of the new LED lights !
This article has evolved over time and received a major , well deserved rewrite in December 2011 .
History John and I have tried many different lighting systems over the years in search of the nirvana of lights , including bottom - bracket generators , sidewall mounted generators , hub generators , and all manner of disposbale battery powered lights and rechargeable lights ..
Like most everything else , bike lights have evolved over time , so we have a few boxes containing used and discarded lights .
We have lights mounted on almost every bike we own .
We use lights for commuting , tours , long unsupported rides like brevets and even occasional nighttime mountain biking .
For the sake of full disclosure , we get the standard club / good customer discount at our local bike shops .
We give our local shops lots of business in bikes , components , clothes , etc .
So I may have bought lights at a nominal discount .
In some cases , we have discovered lights elsewhere and then shared information with our local shops .
We are not in the bike business and we do n't sell lights .
We do not get free lights or clothes or bikes to review .
If we say we like or dislike something , it is because we like or dislike itt .
There is no financial reward for our appraisal .
And rest assured we have actually logged substantial distance with lights ( bikes , etc ) in real - world conditions .
These assessments are not theoretical .
Schmidt SON
The problem with battery lights :
They run out of steam long before we do , plus we have to actually remember to recharge or replace the batteries .
Then after recharging , we must remember to put the light or batteries back on the bike before riding to work !
Duh !
Generators eliminate this memory issue / hassle .
Prior to 1998 , generators tended to be a drag - not very effiecient , noisy , and not always compatible with our favorite tires .
In the winter of 1998 , we started hearing about the Schmidt generator hub .
We heard through the Internet that Chris Juden of the CTC had written a rave review of this 65 % efficient dynamo hub made by Schmidt .
Before we even received our copy of the magazine in the mail , we phoned the CTC shop and ordered two .
I believe Chris Juden is one of the best and most objective reviewers of all things bike related , and his recommendation alone was good enough to get us to mail - order two of these hubs from England .
Once the box arrived , we took our new hubs to Peter White to have him build up the two wheels that night .
We got in our first test rides later that night .
My first impression was WOW .
And many years later , it still is .
The drag is , for all practical purposes , unnoticeable .
The light was brilliant .
Prior to switching to the hub generator , we had been using the most efficient , at the time , sidewall mounted generators , which sometimes did n't work well with our preferred tires , and made a loud whine at high speed .
Now , we could use any tire we wanted , and the icing on the cake - no whine !
And let me just repeat , no noticeable drag .
In the years since , the SON hub has been improved and is even more efficient .
But I did n't notice drag then and do n't notice drag now .
Do n't email me and ask me about drag !
The Lumotec lamps that we got from the CTC in 1998 focused the light nicely on the road in front of the bike , and had a voltage regulator to prevent blowing out bulbs at high speed .
The lights were n't as bright as our battery powered lights , but these lights only ran out of steam when we did , where our bright battery lights might only last 1 or 2 hours .
Eventually we learned of a way to run two 3 watt lamps ( off the single hub ) with full brightness at moderate speeds .
This meant we could have one light aimed close and one aimed farther out for higher speed travel .
We used these lights on our tandem for both commuting and brevets , including some pretty fast descents at night .
We were so impressed with our new hubs and lights that we encouraged and convinced loads of folks in the US to mail order them from the CTC shop in England .
After hearing of some Americans reluctance to mail order from England , as well as our glowing reviews , Peter White slowly realized there was a market for these hubs in the USA .
His first order was for 5 , with us promising to take 1 .
He sold them all before they even arrived .
He has now sold many hundreds of these hubs to American randonneurs , tourists , and commuters , and became the North American importer for Schmidt .
We now have a fleet of wheels with Schmidt hubs as well as a recently acquired 16 inch wheel with a Shimano hub .
We have used our dyna - wheels for commuting , touring and many long distance events including several PBPs and BMBs .
In 1999 , the year after getting our first SON hubs , we rode PBP using the SON with dual 3 watt Lumotec headlamps on our tandem .
We took the 9:45 PM tandem and recumbent start and rode through the first night and well into the second night before taking a sleep stop in Brest .
We hit some pretty good speeds that first night and it was nice to have brilliant lights .
It was also great to have continuous light with no need to stop to change batteries .
Our original thought was to just have two wheels ( one for each of us ) and move wheels around to various bikes .
But different rim and tire sizes and preferences on various bikes made it more convenient just to build more wheels , and now we have too many to count .
Thanks to a commute into dowtown Boston , I also have a Bike Friday Tikit with 16 " wheels and a narrow spaced fork to make for a more compact fold .
Fortunately both Shimano and Schmidt make narrow versions of the hubs for Brompton , which conveniently fit my Friday .
I chose the least expensive Shimano wheel for this bike .
Among our fleet of SONs , we have 32 , 36 and 40 hole drillings , as well as different selections of rim widths and diameters , as well as some hubs with disc mounts .
The tandem and commuters have the beefier rims , while our single brevet wheels tnd to be a bit lighter .
Collecting wheels is n't a cheap hobby .
So I will emphasize that it is easy to move a wheel from bike to bike , if the wheel sizes are compatible , so you do n't have to go crazy like we have .
For the budget minded cyclist , Shimano now make dynamo hubs at a much lower cost than the Schmidt .
Shimano have also improved their design greatly over the years and have multiple offerings .
I understand the high - end model is very efficient .
My little 16 " wheel is built with the lower quality hub and I 'll admit to noticing the drag on this wheel .
If I 'm still using the folding bike in a couple of years , I may look at more efficient hubs ( both front and rear ) for it , or I may just get amazingly strong !
To see the article that originally inspired us to try the Schmidt , click here .
Where to get them Your friendly local shop can get Shimano hubs from their usual sources for other Shimano stuff .
They can get SON hubs and various lights from Peter White , the US Importer .
Then they can build the wheel for you or you can build the wheel .
If your local shop just does n't want to know , I recommend Elton Pope - Lance ( elton at harriscyclery .net ) and the other fine folks at Harris Cyclery , who learned quite a bit from the late Sheldon Brown , both about practical cycling equipment , lighting , fixed gears , etc .
As they are a few blocks from my home , I often meet Elton and others from Harris on the road , commuting with lights .
So they tend to know what they are selling because they actually use the stuff !
Also , St John 's Street Cycles in the UK carries a wide selection and variety of all types of lighting systems , including Schmidt hubs and many other types of dynamos .
They are able to handle shipping worldwide quite well .
( We have bought many things from them , including a bike frame , and shipping to the us in Massachusetts was as fast as getting things shipped here from the west coast . )
Their prices include VAT , most of which would be deducted for export .
We 've found their prices to be quite competitive .
There is a wealth of information on both the Schmidt web site .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Registered voters across the country continue to favor Barack Obama over John McCain for president , now by 50 % to 43 % in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Oct. 2 - 4 .
This is the ninth consecutive Gallup Poll Daily report showing Obama leading by a significant margin , tying Obama 's record frontrunner streak of nine days around the time of the Democratic National Convention in late August and early September .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Today 's result includes two full days of interviewing after the Oct. 2 vice presidential debate between Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen. Joe Biden , as well as after the news on Friday , Oct. 3 , that Congress had passed a revised economic rescue plan to help alleviate the Wall Street financial crisis .
The race has been slightly closer on both of these two individual days ( Oct. 3 - 4 ) than the previous two days .
Obama held particularly large leads over McCain from Oct. 1 - 2 , possibly resulting from Americans ' focus on the Wall Street financial crisis and congressional rescue plan dominating the news at that time .
Since then , support for Obama has remained about the same , at the 49 % to 50 % level , while support for McCain has increased slightly , with an associated decline in the percentage of undecided voters .
Monday 's report will be the first based entirely on interviews conducted after the vice presidential faceoff and , as such , will be an important indicator of whether Palin 's debate performance and , or any possible easing of public anxiety over the rescue package since Friday , may have benefited the Republican ticket .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 2 - 4 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,728 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Actress Minako
Inoue rehearses with her robot cast mate
First there were dancing robots , then house - sitting robots and now a new breed of acting robots is making its big debut on the Japanese stage .
The play , which had its premiere at Osaka University , is one of Japan 's first robot - human theatre productions .
The machines were specially programmed to speak lines with human actors and move around the stage with them .
Playwright Oriza Hirata says the work raises questions about the relationship between humanity and technology .
The play , called Hataraku Watashi ( I , Worker ) , is set in the near future .
It focuses on a young couple who own two housekeeping robots , one of which loses its motivation to work .
In the play , the robot complains that it has been forced into boring and demeaning jobs and enters into a discussion with the humans about its role in their lives .
So far , the play is only 20 minutes long but it is hoped to become a full - length production by 2010 .
The Wakamaru robot is manufactured by Mitsubushi but the software to train it for the stage was developed over two months at the university .
The 1 - m ( 3 - ft ) tall humanoid robot is best known as a mechanical house - sitter and secretary .
But soon they may be signing autographs or trying to roll away from paparazzi .
No word yet on whether they are pleased with the apparent job promotion .
My friend Andrew recently posted a teaser for a new project he ’s working on , but with part of the headline pixelated to obscure what the project actually is .
My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to do what any self - respecting geek would do : write a program to figure out what the censored text said .
Ultimately I failed to recover most of the censored text ( except “ to ” ) , so I had to cheat a little .
The following video is the program running on a very similar image I created .
This proves it works in ideal conditions , but needs some improvement to work in less than ideal cases .
( and no , as far as I know my friend ’s project has nothing to do with eating monkeys )
Applying a filter like Photoshop ’s “ mosaic ” filter obscures the original data , but does n’t remove it entirely .
If we can reconstruct an image with * known * text that looks very similar to original image , then we can be pretty sure the original text is the same as our known text .
This is very similar in principle to brute - force cracking a password hash .
For a more detailed explanation see this article .
Photoshop was an obvious choice since I needed to recreate the exact same fancy styling as the original image , then apply the exact same mosaic filter .
I figured I would have to write a script that tells Photoshop to generate images , then use an external tool to actually compare them to the original .
It turns out that Photoshop CS3 has all the features necessary to pull the whole thing off without any other programs or tools .
The most important feature is the JavaScript scripting environment built into Photoshop , which is far more powerful than the AppleScript environment ( and a * much * nicer language , in my opinion ) .
CS3 added two other features that are critical to this task : Smart Filters , and Measurements .
Smart Filters lets you edit a layer ( namely the text with effects applied ) * after * you apply a filter that would have previously require rasterization .
This lets us apply the censoring filter to our styled text , and later change the text without having to manually reapply the filter .
The “ measurements ” feature lets you record various statistics about an image or portion of an image : in our case we ’ll want the “ average gray value ” of the “ difference ” between the original and generated images .
First we need to prepare the environment .
Open the original image in Photoshop , and attempt to replicate the original un-censored text as closely as possible ( you need * some * uncensored text as a reference ) .
Place your text layer on top of the original and toggle between normal and “ difference ” blending modes to see how you close you are .
Ideally everything will be black in “ difference ” mode .
It ’s very important to precisely match the font , size , spacing , color , effects like drop shadows or outlines , and even the background .
If these are off even by a little bit it will throw things off .
I ended up having to cheat because I could n’t match the slick styling of the original text with my lame Photoshop design skills .
Once the text matches and is lined up perfectly , select the layer then choose “ Convert for Smart Filters ” from the “ Filter ” menu .
Now select the censored portion of the text and apply the same filter used on the original image , again matching it as closely as possible .
For the mosaic filter , you can line up the “ grid ” by adjusting the origin and size of the selection ( yeah , it ’s a pain ) .
Finally , make sure your layer is on top of the original , and the blending mode on your layer is set to “ difference ” .
Double - click the Smart Object layer to open it ’s source document , and adjust the variables listed at the top of the JavaScript to match the names and layers .
Also , in the menu “ Analysis ” : “ Select Data Points ” : “ Custom … ” make sure only “ Gray Value ( Mean ) ” is checked .
Code
Rather than attempting to explain it in detail here , just read the code and comments .
Here ’s a quick summary :
Start with the first character .
Try setting it to each of the possibilities ( a through z , and a space ) , and record the difference score between the original image and generated image .
Only look at the first half of the current character ( since the second half will be influenced by the * next * character ) .
Sort the results .
Lower scores are better ( less different )
Now try each of the top 3 characters along with every possibility for the * next * character .
This time record score for the whole width of the current character since we ’re checking the next character as well .
Pick the best choice , either the best permutation out of all 81 combinations ( 3 best * 27 possible ) , or out of the 3 averages for each best .
Repeat for the next character until done .

Issues
This problem is particularly tricky for proportional fonts , since if you get any character wrong and it ’s width is different than the actual character , then all subsequent characters will be misaligned , causing more incorrect guesses , compounding the problem even more , and so on .
I ’m not sure how to deal with this , other than improving the overall matching quality .
Ideally we would test every possible combination for the entire string , but that would require 27^n tests , where n is the number of unknown characters .
This is obviously not feasible .
With the simplistic method of iterating over each position and trying each possible character , it turned out that almost every single “ guess ” was for the letters “ m ” or “ w ” .
This was because for positions where the original was narrower characters , the “ m ” would “ bleed ” over into the * next * position , improving the score regardless of how well it actually matched the current character .
To get around this , we only look at the difference for the first * half * of the character ’s position .
Since looking at the first half of the character removes some valuable information , we then do a second pass using the top several guesses from the first pass , this time looking at the full width of the current character along with each of the possible next characters ( 27 tests + 3 runs times 27 tests results in 108 tests per character ) .
Further improvements could definitely be made , but I ’ve already spent several hours too many on this .
The current algorithm runs at about 3 characters per minute .
The overhead of Photoshop saving the Smart Object document on every individual test case is significant .
If this were a special purpose program manipulating images directly it would likely be much faster .
The tradeoff , of course , is you have all of Photoshop ’s flexibility at your disposal for matching the original document ’s font , size , style , spacing , and censoring effects , which is very important .
For small amounts of text speed is n’t a problem .
Conclusion
While my original goal of recovering the censored text on my friend ’s page was never achieved , the project was a success .
It works well on my test image , and I learned about 3 obscure but cool and useful features of Photoshop !
Oh , and * that ’s * why ██████████ uses black ink to ██████ their ██████ !

the key component of a gravy fountain is a gravy pump .
while there are a wide variety of commonly available
pumps based on impellers , these would at best cut up the giblets or even jam on thick gravy .
instead we
based our design on the peristaltic pump , used , for example , to move blood without damaging the blood
cells ( blood cells being analogous to giblets and blood being analogous to gravy ) .
six plastic rollers arrayed in a hexagon ( nature 's polygon ) roll against a large diameter flexible hose .
pockets of gravy trapped between two successive rollers are gently transported around the circumference
and squirted out the top .
the sheet metal backing plate ( leftovers from the previous thanksgiving ) was left intentionally springy to
assure a good seal without precise tolerances .
the tubing was glued to the backing plate with construction
adhesive providing a strong but flexible bond .
to power the pump , we used a cheap electric drill from harbor freight .
this is an incredibly easy way
to add a variable speed , high torque motor to any project which mates with a wide range of shaft diameters
thanks to the adjustable chuck .
we added a dimmer switch to provide better control over the motor speed
but it was ultimately run at a considerable clip .
like most ac motors , the drill had relatively little torque at low speeds and tended to stall out under the pressure of 10 gallons of delicious gravy .
A report by Maltby Capital , the company created to acquire and run EMI , reveals that the British music giant is still spending money like a drunken sailor .
A highlight of the out - of - control budget was £ 700,000 spent with just one London taxi firm .
" This was only slightly less than the bills of three investment banks , with 8 - 10 times more staff than EMI Music , " the report notes .
The 100 - page analysis is fascinating not merely because it provides a snapshot of a type of business in catastrophic decline , but because it shows an awareness of what EMI needs to do save itself .
" The business model [ is ] fundamentally flawed , " Maltby says of the classic major - label approach .
First the decline , and it's quite a dramatic reversal of fortune .
The EMI Group is two companies - Music and Publishing , and while one is successful and growing modestly , the other is falling off a cliff .
But look how far and how fast .
Just five years ago the group reported profits of £ 401 m on turnover of £ 2.1 bn .
Last year revenue had fallen to £ 1.458bn , and losses to an incredible £ 757m .
Despite cranking out another bestseller from Coldplay , EMI Music alone lost £ 164 m .
The publishing business , however , saw revenues grow by two per cent .
The report says that costs at EMI Music were out of control , and that reporting structures were so dysfunctional , management struggled to find out the true picture .
In addition , there were too many loss - making acts ( a model that needs examining , Maltby says ) , and that EMI Music was stuffing the channel with CDs that were then returned .
( For two months last year , returns amounted to half of sales . )
How much is EMI to blame in a brutal market ?
Quite a bit , the owners say , for EMI has fallen faster than average .
Between 2005 and 2007 , the market for sound recordings fell by an average of 23 per cent as CD sales crashed and licensed digital revenue failed to make up the shortfall .
However , EMI 's revenue from New Music fell by 36 per cent .
Maltby notes -
Maltby takes a hard look at EMI 's business in its annual report
" EMI Music ’s traditional way of working with artists – highly successful in the days of booming CD sales and a significantly simpler and less fragmented market – had become less fit for purpose .
As a result , EMI Music ’s creative performance , as well as its financial performance , had begun to slide . "
And the solution ?
Well , publishing offers some hope .
EMI owns the second largest music publisher in the world , and Universal only owns the top spot through acquisition ( it bought out Bertlesman last year ) .
EMI looks to regain the title this year .
Publishing is about marketing your rights - basically , persuading people to use your music rather than someone else's .
Maltby correctly notes that publishers often sign acts early - before they 've inked a deal with a record company .
And the report notes how much better the publishing division is at spotting talent ( Amy Winehouse ) than the music division .
Performance revenue from publishing has risen from 22 per cent to 29 per cent since 1999 , while sync revenue ( the licence fee paid to use a piece of music in a film , TV show or ad campaign ) doubled .
Music is n't about shifting units anymore .
EMI owner Maltby falls short of calling for the entire business to be turned into a digital licensing operation : but even if the throw - mud - against - a - wall approach to A&R is dead , that remains the way forward . ®
The package is dependant on Hungary reining in public spending Hungary has been granted a multi-billion dollar rescue package by the IMF , the EU and the World Bank .
The deal , worth $ 25 bn ( £ 15.6bn ) , is intended to help Hungary cope with the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis .
It follows similar measures taken by the IMF to prop up the economies of Ukraine and Iceland .
The fund is also in talks with Pakistan and Belarus about loans to help them through the crisis .
The package , which includes $ 16bn from the IMF , a further $ 8bn from the EU and $ 1bn from the World Bank , far exceeds the $ 16.5 bn ( £ 10.4 bn ) loan offered to Ukraine on Sunday .
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said it was " designed to restore investor confidence and alleviate the stress experienced in recent weeks in the Hungarian financial markets " .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said the package included measures to maintain " adequate domestic and foreign currency liquidity , as well as strong levels of capital , for the banking system " .
" These strong policies justify the exceptional level of access to Fund resources - equivalent to around 1,020 % of Hungary 's quota in the IMF - and deserve the support of the international community , " he said .
Foreign debt
The BBC's Central Europe correspondent , Nick Thorpe , says Hungary , like other emerging markets , has been badly hit by what has been called the second wave of the financial crisis - the severe shortage of foreign currency .
The Hungarian forint has lost almost 20 % of its value in the past month against the euro and the dollar .
The country has already borrowed more than $ 100 bn from abroad .
The European Commission said the rescue package depended on Hungary making a strong commitment to intensify efforts to cut its current account deficit .
Meanwhile , the World Bank has said it will support the implementation of reforms in areas such as the financial sector and fiscal management .
" These measures would support the country 's longer - term stabilisation and economic restructuring , " said Orsalia Kalantzopoulos , World Bank director for Central Europe and Baltic countries .
Last week , Hungary 's central bank raised interest rates by three percentage points to counter a sharp fall in the value of the forint , but the effects were not expected to be long - lasting .

I definitely think it is a fair deal .
The disks are more expensive to buy so their costs are going up as well .
I will not be paying for blu - ray yet though .
If even half of the movies I had in my queue came in blu - ray I 'd pay this .
As it is right now though only about 1 % of the movies in both me and my girlfriend 's queues are blu-ray .
There will be entire months where I do not get blu - ray so for me right now it 's back to dvd .
Baltimore Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs says he " misspoke " when he used the word " bounty " in a radio interview about the Ravens ' defense targeting members of the Pittsburgh Steelers during their Week 4 game .
The NFL has warned Suggs any further comments or on - field actions indicating participation in bounty activity could result in " significant disciplinary action , " a league spokesman told The Baltimore Sun .
The Ravens linebacker was notified in a letter Friday from Ray Anderson , the NFL executive vice president of football operations .
In an interview earlier this month on the " 2 Live Stews " nationally syndicated radio program , Suggs used the word " bounty " to describe how the Ravens were going to go after Steelers running back Rashard Mendenhall and wide receiver Hines Ward .
Mendenhall injured his shoulder on a hit by the Ravens ' Ray Lewis during the game , which the Steelers won , and is out for the season .
But despite Suggs ' comments on Wednesday explaining what he meant , the issue has not gone away .
The NFL , which does not allow bounties on players , said it would investigate the situation .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
An Iranian news agency said on Tuesday that a U.S. military aircraft had unintentionally violated Iranian airspace and been forced to land in Iran , but later allowed to leave .
The semi-official Fars News Agency did not say when the incident happened or give a source for the report , which comes at a time of tension between Tehran and Washington over Iran ’s disputed nuclear program .
The news agency said five senior U.S. military officials had been interrogated at an Iranian airport and released a day later after it became clear the plane had not entered Iranian airspace intentionally .
“ After it became clear that they unintentionally entered Iran ’s air space and their destination was Afghanistan , they were allowed to leave Iran for Afghanistan , ” Fars said .
In Washington , the Pentagon said it was unaware of any U.S. warplanes being forced to land in Iran and that all U.S. aricraft in the Gulf region were accounted for .
In an initial report , Fars described the aircraft as a warplane .
But later it simply called it a “ Falcon , ” giving no further details .

Big news just hit the fan for McCain .
I knew this was a bogus Drudge story when it came out that she refused medical treatment for her wounds .
I 've been through enough these last few years and know the pain would have been incredible and anyone of us would have begged for a doctor immediately .
Well , it looks like the McCain campaign has their fingers all over this phony volunteer attack story and that 's big trouble for him .
John McCain 's Pennsylvania communications director told reporters in the state an incendiary version of the hoax story about the attack on a McCain volunteer well before the facts of the case were known or established -- and even told reporters outright that the " B " carved into the victim 's cheek stood for " Barack , " according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions .
John Verrilli , the news director for KDKA in Pittsburgh , told TPM Election Central that McCain 's Pennsylvania campaign communications director gave one of his reporters a detailed version of the attack that included a claim that the alleged attacker said , " You 're with the McCain campaign ?
I 'm going to teach you a lesson . "
Verrilli also told TPM that the McCain spokesperson had claimed that the " B " stood for Barack .
According to Verrilli , the spokesperson also told KDKA that Sarah Palin had called the victim of the alleged attack , who has since admitted the story was a hoax ... read on
This should hurt McCain severely .
As FOX 's Executive VP , John Moody said :
If the incident turns out to be a hoax , Senator McCain ’s quest for the presidency is over , forever linked to race - baiting .
For Pittsburgh , a city that has done so much to shape American history over the centuries , another moment of truth is at hand .
Bozell 's operation ran with it and attacked the media .
" Obama Supporter Maims McCain Volunteer , Will Media Care ? "
Now I ask the question .
Since McCain 's camp was involved in trying to promote this race baiting attack story against Obama , will the media care ?
Let 's hope so .
UPDATE : If this does n't discredit Drudge also then what will ?
He was obviously fed this story by Republicans from either the RNC or McCain 's campaign .
And who told Sarah Palin to call Ashley Todd ?

The 4 Welding Types That Every Welder Should Know About
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , a welder earned on average $ 41,380 per year in 2018 .
With most Americans focusing on white - collar jobs , there are numerous possibilities and opportunities for budding welders .
The United States ’ economy looks up to Americans in the blue - collar sectors to steer growth considering the demand for technical skills .
Are you looking to pursue and excel in a career in welding ?
It would help if you were well - versed with the dynamics in the career .
To start you off , here are four of the leading welding types you ought to be aware of before kick - starting your career path .
Read on to get more information on the various welding types .
1. Shielded Metal Arc Welding
The shielded metal arc welding technique is the oldest and perhaps the most common approach to arc welding .
Welding was a common practice as early as the 1890s .
With this method , you ’ll learn how to use electricity charge that transcends through the coated electrode then touches the base of the metal .
In this approach , the arc is sustained after the electrode is withdrawn .
This allows the heat to melt the coating .
The melting coat becomes a shielding gas .
With the remainder of the metal melting into the weld pool , the process ends with the solidification of the alloys .
For most beginners , this process may appear complicated and hard to actualize .
But once you engage the practical application , shielding metal arc welding is perhaps the most straightforward form of metalwork .
Uses
The technique of shielded arc welding is useful in many sectors and fields .
If you are looking for an option that will ensure your marketability .
Then your eyes should be set on the opportunities in the pipeline , construction , and shipbuilding sectors .
For most technicians hoping to venture into the farm machinery and underwater welding options , they can also benefit significantly from a course in shielded arc welding .
The Pros of Working as a Shielded Metal Arc Welder
Well , of course , apart from the fact that you ’ll get to earn a living .
Shielded metal arc welding also presents other benefits .
For instance , considering the equipment used is portable , you never have to worry about transportation to the specific sites or the need for storage space for the welding equipment .
This welding method is useful when completing welding on a range of metal types .
Such an advantage makes it possible to use shielded metal arc welding across a diverse range of projects .
The method is best used outdoors , which enhances the aspect of safety for the welder .
2. Gas Metal Arc Welding is among the Common Welding Types
Opting for the GMAW method exposes you to the use of shielding gas as opposed to electricity in the course of welding .
In this option , the electrode used is a metal wire that passes through a welding gun .
The shielding gas heats the two metals tips to be joined , which requires constant high voltage heat .
You ’ll learn how to join two different metals during this process of welding using four primary approaches to metal transfer .
The methods include globular , short - circuiting , the spray method , and the pulsed - spray technique .
Under the GMAW , there are two subgroups , namely , Metal Inert Gas and the Metal Active Gas welding option .
Uses
Gas metal arc welding is useful across a range of industries .
If you pursue this option , you ’ll have the skills to undertake automotive production and maintenance .
You ’ll also thrive in the manufacturing and the railroad track installation and maintenance process .
Such opportunities are an indication of the broad - range of welder careers you can consider .
Other common uses of gas arc welding include pipe joining and underwater welding .
Advantages
Compared to other options , the gas - metal arc welding option is cost - effective .
Further , this approach is fast , which makes it useful in the long - term .
Compared to other options , the Gas Metal Arc welding method minimizes waste , which makes the approach environmentally friendly .
3. Flux - Cored Arc Welding
Flux - cored welding was introduced as an alternative to the shield welding approach .
The technique is among the few welding types which uses a machine , which feeds electrodes into the weld joints .
Using the flux - cored arc welding approach eliminates the risk of atmospheric contamination .
The technique is semi-automatic or automatic by design .
But there ’s a need to have a continuously - fed electrode containing a flux to ensure efficiency .
Flux - core welding offers a high deposition rate .
The “ all position ” process is among the most common welding methods in use today .
If you are looking for an in - demand welding career path , then the flux - cored wire welding course is worth your time .
As opposed to other forms of welding , the flux - cored will not blow off easily .
The approach gives you a clean welding process making it one of the techniques with uncontaminated outcomes .
Advantages and Uses
The most common applications of flux - cored welding are in pipeline welding .
You may also utilize the technique in shipbuilding and general repairs .
Flux - cored technology is quicker than the other two methods .
The use of flux - cored arc welding also offers an essential aspect of versatility .
With a semi-automatic process , the flux - cored technique is a more modern way of handling welding .
4. Plasma Arc Welding
You can also consider specializing in the plasma arc welding technique .
This approach is quite similar to the gas tungsten arc welding .
The arc in this method is formed between the electrodes by utilizing the temporary state of the gas furnace .
Most of the functionality of the Plasma arc welding approach depends on the ability by the plasma to transfer heat on the electric arc .
With a constant intense heat , the metal then melts and fuses at the desired point .
The temperature used is between 3000 and 7000 degrees , which may present a safety hazard to some extent .
Uses
The plasma arc welding technique is useful in most high - speed sheet welding projects .
You may also thrive with this technique in areas such as keyhole welding and welding coated steels .
The plasma arc welding method may also be used in the automotive and aerospace sectors when working on the bodywork .
You Have Unending Opportunities as a Welder
The demand for welding services will continue to grow steadily as the consumer market in the United States expands gradually .
A career in welding will , therefore , be among the most lucrative blue - collar options in the future .
Understanding these welding types and the welding types of jobs will give you leverage when it comes to information and career choices .

As I write this post , I ’m sitting in an office in Dublin , Ireland .
The weather is miserable outside … but we ’re warm and protected indoors .
The bad weather means that it ’s really dark , even early in the day … but we fix this by switching on the lights .
Even looking out the window makes me shiver … so I pull my comfy sweater a little closer around me .
If I feel thirsty … I can help myself to a drink from the fridge .
When lunchtime comes , we will all make our way down to the canteen for some food to keep us going for the few hours until we head home for dinner .
If you ’re reading this post , then the chances are that you , like me , are one of the lucky ones .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In recent weeks I have found myself worrying about my bank account , my savings , my mortgage , my job …
My mind has been filled with thoughts about unemployment , repossessions , stock markets plummeting , banks going bust …
As more & more bad news hit the headlines I began to wonder … can this get any worse ?
Then it hit me …
Yes .
Things could be an awful lot worse .
Despite the financial turmoil , despite the credit crisis , despite house prices falling , despite everything …
I AM one of the lucky ones .
I do n’t have to worry about feeding my family tonight .
I do n’t wonder where my next meal will come from .
I do n’t worry about my baby drinking dirty water .
I do n’t have to sleep outdoors tonight or any night .
I have access to food , shelter and warm clothing .
I have clean water on tap .
I can visit a doctor if I need to .
I have access to heat and electricity at the flick of a switch .
I have access to education and training .
I have job opportunities and leisure time .
I even have the privilege of having some savings to worry about in these economic times … while many people do n’t have even enough money to survive , never mind save .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The world ’s poorest people are n’t worried about the credit crisis .
They are worried about feeding their families and struggling to survive on a daily basis .
At the moment many of us are cutting our spending … this is leading to a fall in charitable donations … there is a real fear that this may result in many of the world ’s poorest people suffering even more than they already do .
So , despite the economic downturn , I have decided to make a small but determined effort in favor of those much less fortunate than me .
Out goes the weekly treat of Hot Chocolate with extra marshmallows & whipped cream … in comes an extra weekly donation to charity .
It may not be much , but it ’s a start .
If you think about it , by foregoing one tall latte , you could contribute $ 3 to someone in dire circumstances .
Could you sacrifice one trip to Starbucks per week ?

Plan Ireland ’s Work in Togo
Togo is a small country in West Africa .
Annual income per head is just $ 350 and the mortality rate for children under 5 is over 10 % .
Plan is currently working on various projects in this area including :
erecting clean water points
training teachers
building and modernising schools
establishing voluntarily manned crèches to release younger girls from the responsibilities of child minding so as they can attend school
Plan are also working to tackle the stigma and discrimination associated with disability by establishing and equipping community based rehabilitation centers .
It is hoped that , following this project , disabled children will no longer be locked away in homes , but instead be given the opportunity to be active participants in society with the opportunity to live their lives to their maximum potential .
Positive results are already emerging as communities are beginning to recognise that disabled children have an important role to play .
As one community leader put it ‘ this project has helped us re-find our children ’ .

This post is our contribution to Blog Action Day 2008 , a non-profit event aimed at changing the conversation on the internet to focus for one day on the mammoth issue of global poverty .
The demo was not going well .
Again .
It was a late morning in the fall of 2006 .
Almost a year earlier , Steve Jobs had tasked about 200 of Apple 's top engineers with creating the iPhone .
Yet here , in Apple 's boardroom , it was clear that the prototype was still a disaster .
It was n't just buggy , it flat - out did n't work .
The phone dropped calls constantly , the battery stopped charging before it was full , data and applications routinely became corrupted and unusable .
The list of problems seemed endless .
At the end of the demo , Jobs fixed the dozen or so people in the room with a level stare and said , " We do n't have a product yet . "
The effect was even more terrifying than one of Jobs ' trademark tantrums .
When the Apple chief screamed at his staff , it was scary but familiar .
This time , his relative calm was unnerving .
" It was one of the few times at Apple when I got a chill , " says someone who was in the meeting .
The ramifications were serious .
The iPhone was to be the centerpiece of Apple 's annual Macworld convention , set to take place in just a few months .
Since his return to Apple in 1997 , Jobs had used the event as a showcase to launch his biggest products , and Apple - watchers were expecting another dramatic announcement .
Jobs had already admitted that Leopard — the new version of Apple 's operating system — would be delayed .
If the iPhone was n't ready in time , Macworld would be a dud , Jobs ' critics would pounce , and Apple 's stock price could suffer .
And what would AT&T think ?
After a year and a half of secret meetings , Jobs had finally negotiated terms with the wireless division of the telecom giant ( Cingular at the time ) to be the iPhone 's carrier .
In return for five years of exclusivity , roughly 10 percent of iPhone sales in AT&T stores , and a thin slice of Apple 's iTunes revenue , AT&T had granted Jobs unprecedented power .
He had cajoled AT&T into spending millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours to create a new feature , so - called visual voicemail , and to reinvent the time - consuming in - store sign - up process .
He 'd also wrangled a unique revenue - sharing arrangement , garnering roughly $ 10 a month from every iPhone customer 's AT&T bill .
On top of all that , Apple retained complete control over the design , manufacturing , and marketing of the iPhone .
Jobs had done the unthinkable : squeezed a good deal out of one of the largest players in the entrenched wireless industry .
Now , the least he could do was meet his deadlines .
For those working on the iPhone , the next three months would be the most stressful of their careers .
Screaming matches broke out routinely in the hallways .
Engineers , frazzled from all - night coding sessions , quit , only to rejoin days later after catching up on their sleep .
A product manager slammed the door to her office so hard that the handle bent and locked her in ; it took colleagues more than an hour and some well - placed whacks with an aluminum bat to free her .
But by the end of the push , just weeks before Macworld , Jobs had a prototype to show to the suits at AT&T .
In mid-December 2006 , he met wireless boss Stan Sigman at a suite in the Four Seasons hotel in Las Vegas .
He showed off the iPhone 's brilliant screen , its powerful Web browser , its engaging user interface .
Sigman , a taciturn Texan steeped in the conservative engineering traditions that permeate America 's big phone companies , was uncharacteristically effusive , calling the iPhone " the best device I have ever seen . "
( Details of this and other key moments in the making of the iPhone were provided by people with knowledge of the events .
Apple and AT&T would not discuss these meetings or the specific terms of the relationship . )
Six months later , on June 29 , 2007 , the iPhone went on sale .
At press time , analysts were speculating that customers would snap up about 3 million units by the end of 2007 , making it the fastest - selling smartphone of all time .
It is also arguably Apple 's most profitable device .
The company nets an estimated $ 80 for every $ 399 iPhone it sells , and that 's not counting the $ 240 it makes from every two - year AT&T contract an iPhone customer signs .
Meanwhile , about 40 percent of iPhone buyers are new to AT&T 's rolls , and the iPhone has tripled the carrier 's volume of data traffic in cities like New York and San Francisco .
But as important as the iPhone has been to the fortunes of Apple and AT&T , its real impact is on the structure of the $ 11 billion - a - year US mobile phone industry .
For decades , wireless carriers have treated manufacturers like serfs , using access to their networks as leverage to dictate what phones will get made , how much they will cost , and what features will be available on them .
Handsets were viewed largely as cheap , disposable lures , massively subsidized to snare subscribers and lock them into using the carriers ' proprietary services .
But the iPhone upsets that balance of power .
Carriers are learning that the right phone — even a pricey one — can win customers and bring in revenue .
Now , in the pursuit of an Apple - like contract , every manufacturer is racing to create a phone that consumers will love , instead of one that the carriers approve of .
" The iPhone is already changing the way carriers and manufacturers behave , " says Michael Olson , a securities analyst at Piper Jaffray .
In 2002 , shortly after the first iPod was released , Jobs started thinking about developing a phone .
He saw millions of Americans lugging separate phones , BlackBerrys , and — now — MP3 players ; naturally , consumers would prefer just one device .
He also saw a future in which cell phones and mobile email devices would amass ever more features , eventually challenging the iPod 's dominance as a music player .
To protect his new product line , Jobs knew he would eventually need to venture into the wireless world .
If the idea was obvious , so were the obstacles .
Data networks were sluggish and not ready for a full - blown handheld Internet device .
An iPhone would require Apple to create a completely new operating system ; the iPod 's OS was n't sophisticated enough to manage complicated networking or graphics , and even a scaled - down version of OS X would be too much for a cell phone chip to handle .
Apple would be facing strong competition , too :
In 2003 , consumers had flocked to the Palm Treo 600 , which merged a phone , PDA , and BlackBerry into one slick package .
That proved there was demand for a so - called convergence device , but it also raised the bar for Apple 's engineers .
Then there were the wireless carriers .
Jobs knew they dictated what to build and how to build it , and that they treated the hardware as little more than a vehicle to get users onto their networks .
Jobs , a notorious control freak himself , was n't about to let a group of suits — whom he would later call " orifices " — tell him how to design his phone .
By 2004 Apple 's iPod business had become more important , and more vulnerable , than ever .
The iPod accounted for 16 percent of company revenue , but with 3G phones gaining popularity , Wi-Fi phones coming soon , the price of storage plummeting , and rival music stores proliferating , its long - term position as the dominant music device seemed at risk .
So that summer , while he publicly denied he would build an Apple phone , Jobs was working on his entry into the mobile phone industry .
In an effort to bypass the carriers , he approached Motorola .
It seemed like an easy fix :
The handset maker had released the wildly popular RAZR , and Jobs knew Ed Zander , Motorola 's CEO at the time , from Zander 's days as an executive at Sun Microsystems .
A deal would allow Apple to concentrate on developing the music software , while Motorola and the carrier , Cingular , could hash out the complicated hardware details .
Of course , Jobs ' plan assumed that Motorola would produce a successor worthy of the RAZR , but it soon became clear that was n't going to happen .
The three companies dickered over pretty much everything — how songs would get into the phone , how much music could be stored there , even how each company 's name would be displayed .
And when the first prototypes showed up at the end of 2004 , there was another problem :
The gadget itself was ugly .
Jobs unveiled the ROKR in September 2005 with his characteristic aplomb , describing it as " an iPod shuffle on your phone . "
But Jobs likely knew he had a dud on his hands ; consumers , for their part , hated it .
The ROKR — which could n't download music directly and held only 100 songs — quickly came to represent everything that was wrong with the US wireless industry , the spawn of a mess of conflicting interests for whom the consumer was an afterthought .
WIRED summarized the disappointment on its November 2005 cover : " YOU CALL THIS THE PHONE OF THE FUTURE ? "
The Apple Touch
Apple has created two music phones .
The ROKR , made with Motorola in 2005 , respected the traditional relationships between manufacturers and carriers .
The iPhone , released last summer , completely overturned them .
Rockr
Wo n't hold more than 100 songs , even if there 's memory left .
iTunes Music
Store purchases must be synced from a PC .
Clunky interface is sluggish and hard to navigate .
Design screams , " A committee made me . "
iPhone
Can hold about 1,500 songs — as much as its 8 - GB drive allows .
iTunes Music
Store purchases download wirelessly , directly to the phone .
Just tap and go ; no user manual required .
C'mon .
Look at it .
It 's gorgeous .
Even as the ROKR went into production , Jobs was realizing he'd have to build his own phone .
In February 2005 , he got together with Cingular to discuss a Motorola - free partnership .
At the top - secret meeting in a midtown Manhattan hotel , Jobs laid out his plans before a handful of Cingular senior execs , including Sigman .
( When AT&T acquired Cingular in December 2006 , Sigman remained president of wireless . )
Jobs delivered a three - part message to Cingular : Apple had the technology to build something truly revolutionary , " light - years ahead of anything else . "
Apple was prepared to consider an exclusive arrangement to get that deal done .
But Apple was also prepared to buy wireless minutes wholesale and become a de facto carrier itself .
Jobs had reason to be confident .
Apple 's hardware engineers had spent about a year working on touchscreen technology for a tablet PC and had convinced him that they could build a similar interface for a phone .
Plus , thanks to the release of the ARM11 chip , cell phone processors were finally fast and efficient enough to power a device that combined the functionality of a phone , a computer , and an iPod .
And wireless minutes had become cheap enough that Apple could resell them to customers ; companies like Virgin were already doing so .
Sigman and his team were immediately taken with the notion of the iPhone .
Cingular 's strategy , like that of the other carriers , called for consumers to use their mobile phones more and more for Web access .
The voice business was fading ; price wars had slashed margins .
The iPhone , with its promised ability to download music and video and to surf the Internet at Wi -Fi speeds , could lead to an increase in the number of data customers .
And data , not voice , was where profit margins were lush .
What 's more , the Cingular team could see that the wireless business model had to change .
The carriers had become accustomed to treating their networks as precious resources , and handsets as worthless commodities .
This strategy had served them well .
By subsidizing the purchase of cheap phones , carriers made it easier for new customers to sign up — and get roped into long - term contracts that ensured a reliable revenue stream .
But wireless access was no longer a luxury ; it had become a necessity .
The greatest challenge facing the carriers was n't finding brand - new consumers but stealing them from one another .
Simply bribing customers with cheap handsets was n't going to work .
Sigman and his team wanted to offer must - have devices that were n't available on any other network .
Who better to create one than Jobs ?
For Cingular , Apple 's ambitions were both tantalizing and nerve - racking .
A cozy relationship with the maker of the iPod would bring sex appeal to the company 's brand .
And some other carrier was sure to sign with Jobs if Cingular turned him down — Jobs made it clear that he would shop his idea to anyone who would listen .
But no carrier had ever given anyone the flexibility and control that Jobs wanted , and Sigman knew he'd have trouble persuading his fellow executives and board members to approve a deal like the one Jobs proposed .
Sigman was right .
The negotiations would take more than a year , with Sigman and his team repeatedly wondering if they were ceding too much ground .
At one point , Jobs met with some executives from Verizon , who promptly turned him down .
It was hard to blame them .
For years , carriers had charged customers and suppliers for using and selling services over their proprietary networks .
By giving so much control to Jobs , Cingular risked turning its vaunted — and expensive — network into a " dumb pipe , " a mere conduit for content rather than the source of that content .
Sigman 's team made a simple bet :
The iPhone would result in a surge of data traffic that would more than make up for any revenue it lost on content deals .
Jobs would n't wait for the finer points of the deal to be worked out .
Around Thanksgiving of 2005 , eight months before a final agreement was signed , he instructed his engineers to work full - speed on the project .
And if the negotiations with Cingular were hairy , they were simple compared with the engineering and design challenges Apple faced .
For starters , there was the question of what operating system to use .
Since 2002 , when the idea for an Apple phone was first hatched , mobile chips had grown more capable and could theoretically now support some version of the famous Macintosh OS .
But it would need to be radically stripped down and rewritten ; an iPhone OS should be only a few hundred megabytes , roughly a 10th the size of OS X .
Before they could start designing the iPhone , Jobs and his top executives had to decide how to solve this problem .
Engineers looked carefully at Linux , which had already been rewritten for use on mobile phones , but Jobs refused to use someone else 's software .
They built a prototype of a phone , embedded on an iPod , that used the clickwheel as a dialer , but it could only select and dial numbers — not surf the Net .
So , in early 2006 , just as Apple engineers were finishing their yearlong effort to revise OS X to work with Intel chips , Apple began the process of rewriting OS X again for the iPhone .
The conversation about which operating system to use was at least one that all of Apple 's top executives were familiar with .
They were less prepared to discuss the intricacies of the mobile phone world : things like antenna design , radio - frequency radiation , and network simulations .
To ensure the iPhone 's tiny antenna could do its job effectively , Apple spent millions buying and assembling special robot - equipped testing rooms .
To make sure the iPhone did n't generate too much radiation , Apple built models of human heads — complete with goo to simulate brain density — and measured the effects .
To predict the iPhone 's performance on a network , Apple engineers bought nearly a dozen server - sized radio - frequency simulators for millions of dollars apiece .
Even Apple 's experience designing screens for iPods did n't help the company design the iPhone screen , as Jobs discovered while toting a prototype in his pocket :
To minimize scratching , the touchscreen needed to be made of glass , not hard plastic like on the iPod .
One insider estimates that Apple spent roughly $ 150 million building the iPhone .
Through it all , Jobs maintained the highest level of secrecy .
Internally , the project was known as P2 , short for Purple 2 ( the abandoned iPod phone was called Purple 1 ) .
Teams were split up and scattered across Apple 's Cupertino , California , campus .
Whenever Apple executives traveled to Cingular , they registered as employees of Infineon , the company Apple was using to make the phone 's transmitter .
Even the iPhone 's hardware and software teams were kept apart : Hardware engineers worked on circuitry that was loaded with fake software , while software engineers worked off circuit boards sitting in wooden boxes .
By January 2007 , when Jobs announced the iPhone at Macworld , only 30 or so of the most senior people on the project had seen it .
The hosannas greeting the iPhone were so overwhelming it was easy to ignore its imperfections .
The initial price of $ 599 was too high ( it has been lowered to $ 399 ) .
The phone runs on AT&T 's poky EDGE network .
Users can't perform email searches or record video .
The browser wo n't run programs written in Java or Flash .
But none of that mattered .
The iPhone cracked open the carrier - centric structure of the wireless industry and unlocked a host of benefits for consumers , developers , manufacturers — and potentially the carriers themselves .
Consumers get an easy - to - use handheld computer .
And , as with the advent of the PC , the iPhone is sparking a wave of development that will make it even more powerful .
In February , Jobs will release a developer 's kit so that anyone can write programs for the device .
Manufacturers , meanwhile , enjoy new bargaining power over the carriers they 've done business with for decades .
Carriers , who have seen AT&T eat into their customer bases , are scrambling to find a competitive device , and they appear willing to give up some authority to get it .
Manufacturers will have more control over what they produce ; users — not the usual cabal of complacent juggernauts — will have more influence over what gets built .
Application developers are poised to gain more opportunities as the wireless carriers begin to show signs of abandoning their walled - garden approach to snaring consumers .
T - Mobile and Sprint have signed on as partners with Google 's Android , an operating system that makes it easy for independent developers to create mobile apps .
Verizon , one of the most intransigent carriers , declared in November that it would open up its network for use with any compatible handset .
AT&T made a similar announcement days later .
Eventually this will result in a completely new wireless experience , in which applications work on any device and over any network .
In time , it will give the wireless world some of the flexibility and functionality of the Internet .
It may appear that the carriers ' nightmares have been realized , that the iPhone has given all the power to consumers , developers , and manufacturers , while turning wireless networks into dumb pipes .
But by fostering more innovation , carriers ' networks could get more valuable , not less .
Consumers will spend more time on devices , and thus on networks , racking up bigger bills and generating more revenue for everyone .
According to Paul Roth , AT&T 's president of marketing , the carrier is exploring new products and services — like mobile banking — that take advantage of the iPhone 's capabilities .
" We 're thinking about the market differently , " Roth says .
In other words , the very development that wireless carriers feared for so long may prove to be exactly what they need .
It took Steve Jobs to show them that .

I had no idea these comparative views of length of rivers and heights of mountains were so popular – at least in the 1800s .
There seemed to be a fascination with placing rivers and mountains next to each other when normally , we ’re used to seeing them intertwined in a geographic landscape .
The above is actually just river lengths , but here ’s one that places rivers and mountains next to each other .
The results are pretty effective and nicely drawn .
I ’ve always wondered what maps looked like before computers .
Paper ?
Pencil ?
I do not understand what you are talking about .

Another element of the mystery is the deftness gap .
Inside the country , China ’s national leadership rarely seems as tin-eared as it is when dealing with the outside world .
National - level democracy might come to China or it might not —ever .
No one can be sure .
But from the national level down to villages , where local officials are now elected , the government is by all reports becoming accountable in ways it was n’t before .
As farmers have struggled financially , a long - standing agricultural tax has been removed .
As migrant workers have become an exploited underclass in big cities , hukou ( residence - permit ) rules have been liberalized so that people can get medical care and send their children to school without having to return to their “ official ” residence back in the countryside .
Whenever necessary , the government turns to repression , but that ’s usually not the first response .
The system prides itself on learning about problems as they arise and relieving social pressure before it erupts .
In this regard it learned a lesson earlier this year , when its reaction to the first big natural disaster of 2008 turned into its own version of Hurricane Katrina .
Unusual blizzards in central and southern China paralyzed roads and rail lines , and stranded millions of people traveling home for the Chinese New Year holidays ; the central government seemed taken by surprise and was slow to respond .
That did n’t happen with the next disaster , three months later .
When the Sichuan earthquake occurred , Premier Wen Jiabao was on an airplane to the stricken area the same afternoon .
So I return to the puzzle :
Why does a society that , like America , impresses most people who spend time here project such a poor image and scare people as much as it attracts them ?
Why do China ’s leaders , who survive partly by listening to their own people , develop such tin ears when dealing with the outside world ?
I do n’t pretend to have a solution .
But here are some possible explanations , and some reasons why the situation matters to people other than the misunderstood Chinese .
There is no politer way to put the main problem than to call it “ ignorance . ”
Most Americans are parochial , but ( surprise ! ) most Chinese and their leaders are more so .
American politicians may not be good at understanding foreign sensitivities or phrasing their arguments in ways likely to be effective around the world , as foreigners have mentioned once or twice in recent years .
But collectively they understand that America is part of an ongoing , centuries - long , worldwide experiment and discussion about political systems and human values , and that making their case well matters .
After the 9/11 attacks , America went through a round of “ Why do they hate us ? ” inquiry .
Whether or not that brought the United States closer to understanding its problems in parts of the Islamic world , it did represent a more serious effort to understand how the country was seen than anything I have heard of in China .
When the Olympic torch relay this spring was plagued by boos and protests over Tibet in places ranging from France to the United States , the reaction at every level of the Chinese system seemed to be not just insult but genuine shock .
Most Chinese people were familiar only with the idea that China has always been a generous elder brother to the ( often ungrateful ) Tibetans .
By all evidence , no one in command anticipated or prepared for this ugly response .
The same Pew survey that said most Chinese felt good about their country also found that they thought the rest of the world shared their view .
That belief is touching , especially considering how much of China ’s history is marked by episodes of its feeling unloved and victimized .
Unfortunately , it is also wrong .
In many of the countries surveyed , China ’s popularity and reputation were low and falling .
According to a report last year by Joshua Cooper Ramo of Kissinger Associates , most people in China considered their country very “ trustworthy . ”
Most people outside China thought the country was not trustworthy at all .
A stalagmite in a West Virginia cave has yielded the most detailed geological record to date on climate cycles in eastern North America over the past 7,000 years .
The new study confirms that during periods when Earth received less solar radiation , the Atlantic Ocean cooled , icebergs increased and precipitation fell , creating a series of century - long droughts .
A research team led by Ohio University geologist Gregory Springer examined the trace metal strontium and carbon and oxygen isotopes in the stalagmite , which preserved climate conditions averaged over periods as brief as a few years .
The scientists found evidence of at least seven major drought periods during the Holocene era , according to an article published online in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
“ This really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought , ” said Springer , an assistant professor of geological sciences .
Geologist Gerald Bond suggested that every 1,500 years , weak solar activity caused by fluctuations in the sun ’s magnetic fields cools the North Atlantic Ocean and creates more icebergs and ice rafting , or the movement of sediment to ocean floors .
Other scientists have sought more evidence of these so - called “ Bond events ” and have studied their possible impact on droughts and precipitation .
But studies to date have been hampered by incomplete , less detailed records , Springer said .
The stalagmites from the Buckeye Creek Cave provide an excellent record of climate cycles , he said , because West Virginia is affected by the jet streams and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean .
Other studies have gleaned climate cycle data from lakes , but fish and other critters tend to churn the sediment , muddying the geological record there , said study co-author Harold Rowe , an assistant professor of geological sciences at the University of Texas at Arlington .

“ ( The caves ) have n’t been disturbed by anything .
We can see what happened on the scale of a few decades .
In lakes of the Appalachian region , you ’re looking more at the scale of a millennium , ” Rowe said .
Strontium occurs naturally in the soil , and rain washes the element through the limestone .
During dry periods , it is concentrated in stalagmites , making them good markers of drought , Rowe explained .
Carbon isotopes also record drought , Springer added , because drier soils slow biological activity .
This causes the soil to “ breathe less , changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it , ” he said .
In the recent study , the scientists cut and polished the stalagmite , examined the growth layers and then used a drill to take 200 samples along the growth axis .
They weighed and analyzed the metals and isotopes to determine their concentrations over time .
The data are consistent with the Bond events , which showed the connection between weak solar activity and ice rafting , the researchers said .
But the study also confirmed that this climate cycle triggers droughts , including some that were particularly pronounced during the mid-Holocene period , about 6,300 to 4,200 years ago .
These droughts lasted for decades or even entire centuries .
Though modern records show that a cooling North Atlantic Ocean actually increases moisture and precipitation , the historic climate events were different , Springer said .
In the past , the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean also grew colder , creating a drier climate and prompting the series of droughts , he explained .
The climate record suggests that North America could face a major drought event again in 500 to 1,000 years , though Springer said that manmade global warming could offset the cycle .
“ Global warming will leave things like this in the dust .
The natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming , ” he said .
Though some climate and drought records exist for the Western and Midwest areas of North America , the eastern Appalachian region has n’t been studied much to date , Rowe said .
The research team plans to examine additional stalagmite records from West Virginia and Tennessee to paint a better picture of North American climate cycles .
Collaborators on the study also included Lawrence Edwards , Ben Hardt and Hai Cheng of the University of Minnesota .
As I hit a wall in my development of Project Fangorn on Google ’s App Engine platform I started looking around for alternative platforms .
While there are numerous providers that claim to provide a cloud very few of them actually have a distributed datastore and a hosting environment that automatically expands and contracts ( i.e. scale ) the resources allocated to the running of your app , so the service they provide is either utility computing somewhere in between utility computing and cloud computing .
True Clouds
There is Google App Engine of course , but they are n’t currently up to what I ’m trying to do .
Amazon has SimpleDB plus their Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) .
While EC2 requires you to manage virtual machines , there are a number of third party providers of VM managers for EC2 that fluff up EC2 into more of a cloud .
Two of these providers are Enomaly ( general VM scaling ) and Heroku ( rails specific scaling ) .
UPDATE 10/23/2008 : Amazon has announced a private beta for their own monitoring , load balancing , and automatic scaling service offering .
No mention of price and it seems likely to be simply included with EC2 service .
One particularly interesting EC2 third party provider is GigaSpaces with their XAP platform that provides in memory transactions backed up to a database .
The in memory transactions appear to scale linearly across machines thus providing a distributed in - memory datastore that gets backed up to persistent storage .
A lot of the docs reference Java , but the page returned by the aforementioned link states “ … deploy applications that use Java , . Net , C++ , or even scripting languages … ” so after a cursory investigation it is not clear what aspects of their platform is only accessible via Java and which aspectes are generally accessible .
Bears more investigation .
10gen has a service in alpha preview that has a distributed datastore called Mongo and a hosting environment called Bable that automatically scales the resources hosting your app to fit current demand .
Like Google 10 gen does n’t provide VMs that you can run just anything on .
Currently apps can be written in server side JavaScript , Python , and Ruby ( Update 10/21/2008 – it is only Jython and JRuby that are supported ) , so they are ahead of Google with respect the number of languages supported .
Cloud Processing but Utility Storage
The combination of Amazon ’s S3 , EC2 , and third party auto - scaling VM managers falls into this category .
FlexiScale and Mosso both look to provide services similar to Amazon ’s combination of EC2 with third party auto - scaling VM managers and Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) , as they make not claims to to have a distributed datastore , but just a SAN / NAS that can be accessed from the VMs .
Just Utility Computing
The combination of Amazon ’s S3 and bare EC2 ( i.e. no third party VM managers ) falls into this category .
GoGrid has persistent storage that backups your server image , but it appears to be limited to just backups and does n’t appear to be a persistent datastore .
AppNexus , Joyent , and Sun ’s Project Caroline all look to provide services similar to Amazon ’s combination of bare EC2 and Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) .
Future offerings
Sun also has Network.com but that site does n’t say much beyond “ Network.com is in transition … ” which is n’t very informative .
Microsoft is supposed to be announcing something in this space at PDC at the end of this month .
From what I remember ( ca n’t find the article now ) it will provide a .
Net only hosting environment but I do n’t recall if there was going to be any kind of distributed datastore or just MS SQL Server .
I came across mention of an MSFT project to distribute SQL Server so I would guess there will not be a distributed datastore at this time .
3 Tera is working on turning their AppLogic grid computing product into a cloud computing service offering but it does n’t appear that a preview is available yet and remains to be seen if it will really be cloud computing or just another utility computing provider .

we have seen a huge fall - off in donations from outside the EU and we 're wondering why this is ;
we are planning on giving two prizes this year so we are giving entries in the drawing based local currency ;
towards the end of last year we spent over € 2000 to send 12 people to aKademy ;
the project spent about € 1500 on technical and administrative items like server hosting , domain administration , develop resources ( books ) and hardware ;
in addition to aKademy , we spent over €3500 attending free software conferences around the world
each developer / contributor team member was given two t- shirts .
A small thank you for the large amounts of time put into the project by volunteers who are doing this for fun , not profit .
After some discussion , we have decided to extend Roktober since we are so far away from our goal and we think that maybe part of the problem is not enough promotion , so if we extend a few weeks maybe we can get this going .
Not everyone follows the developer blogs , so if anybody missed the blog entry put up by our treasurer regarding Roktober , here are some highlights ( or read the full entry ) : So we in total spent over €7500 , and we have bigger plans for next year in terms of moving the project forward , maintaining a presence during free software events and having additional developer meetings , which are extremely efficient in moving the software development forward .
Additionally , prices are rising , so overall things will cost more .
So if you have n't yet , please consider contributing .
A few weeks ago , we took a long , hard look at the state of the PSP .
Software , we mused , was in short supply and the future was rather bleak .
Luckily , E3 arrived to show us that the system was n't completely dead and that there were some prospects for Sony 's little wunderportable .
Perhaps more disturbing , however , was the relative lack of new info on the PS2 .
Sony touched on their plans for a new bundle for the system , but they almost spent more time talking about pushing into Latin America during their E3 press conference .
Japanese+support+helps+to+keep+the+PS2+going .
Action+fans+still+have+a+handful+of+games+to+look+forward+to .
Which got us thinking : is the PS2 finally on its way out ?
Lord knows the system has stood the test of time ; still rolling into its ninth year with plenty of steam , the system consistently manages to pull down impressive hardware numbers every month here in the States , due in no small part to what is arguably the best games library in history .
But we started wondering aloud just how much juice the PS2 has left .
The move to release just one version of the PS3 with no backwards compatibility obviously keeps the PS2 relevant -- at least in the short term .
There 's also the benefit of having the Wii out there , hardware that 's far closer to the PS2 than the HD systems .
First - party support may be drying up beyond trying to pump out some casual titles , but third parties are all too eager to throw their Wii - level games onto another system with close to a 140 million unit install base ; not only are the engines for the PS2 extremely mature , but sharing resources makes a whole lot of sense .
So for the time being , the PS2 does n't seem to be left in the lurch and seems destined to actually live up to the much - vaunted " 10 year lifecycle " that Sony keeps talking about .
Some developers , like Atlus and SEGA , are still supporting the system with new , exclusive games like Persona 4 and Yakuza 2 , respectively .
With no shortage of Guitar Heroes or Maddens , the system 's library is n't nearly as bleak as one would assume for a console entering the full decade stretch .
In a very real sense , Sony has become something of an underdog .
Whereas they commanded a nearly uncontested 70 % market share when the PS2 was at its prime ( a feat that would be all but impossible to repeat with two stronger , more aggressive competitors this time around ) , The Big S is now fighting on three fronts .
Each of its systems trails the nearest competitor : the PSP is doing what no other handheld has ever done in that it 's actually thriving next to competition from Nintendo , but software sales are another story ; the PS3 has been building constant momentum heading into 2008 and does n't show signs of stopping anytime soon -- but it still trails the 360 and Wii .
Lastly , the PS2 as of last year has been repositioned to duke it out for a stake in the casual market that the Wii has captured so well .
No company has had to fight a three - way tug - of - war with three different systems like Sony has .
Both Nintendo and Microsoft have serious linchpins in their casual - friendly and online offerings , respectively , so what does the PS2 have ?
Games , and lots of 'em , though obviously the release list has tapered off a little in recent years .
Rather than concentrating on what already hit , let 's look ... to the future :
In stark contrast to our release list on , say , the PSP , the PS2 is absolutely slammed with titles hitting through the rest of the year -- more than eighty of them in fact .
Now , if one were to take a look at both lists , one would notice quite a few similarities .
If ever there was a case for the PS2 and Wii being competition , a cursory glance at the release lists of both is really all it would take .
Both systems are home to more than a few games that we 'll call ... less than mind - blowing , but the PS2 is still being supported by both Pappa Sony and third parties to fantastic effect .
Nearly every genre is covered .
You 've got your action games like Mercenaries 2 : World in Flames LEGO Batman and Spider - Man : Web of Shadows bringing up the superhero side of things .
The success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band ensured the reign of little plastic guitars over the all - important rhythm action space ; Dance Dance Revolution X , Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World
Tour are all making stops on the PS2 while on the mass SKU train to next - gensville .
Even straight singing SingStar entries for Pop Vol. 2 , Legends and Country will arrive before the end of the year -- and that 's just the first - party stuff .
Still into sports but have n't felt the need to update to high - def yet ?
Cool , take your , pick : new versions of Madden , Tiger Woods , NHL 2K9/09 , NBA Live / 2K9 / '09 : The Inside and FIFA are all present and accounted for .
Nearly every sport is getting a new update if it has n't already ( and Pro Evo fans , your update is coming early next year ) .
Hell , even wrestling superfreaks are getting taken care of with TNA iMPACT ! and SmackDown vs. RAW 2009 .
For some of us around here , though , kicking , punting and dunking balls do n't quite do it .
We need fancy - pants stuff like a story and levels and experience and damage multipliers and magic missiles and ... well , you get the idea .
Role - playing / adventure games help us slake our thirst for an overall narrative and we 're covered there too : Yakuza 2 , Persona 4 and weird ass RPG / board game hybrid Dokapon Kingdom should help make the inevitable transition to next - gen a little smoother .
The bottom line is that the PS2 is hardly down and out .
It 's a little surprising , really -- even to us -- that the library has this much steam .
Chalk it up to plenty of familiarity with the hardware ( remember when developers were lamenting the difficulty in tapping it all those years ago ? ) , an absolutely epic install base that 's still growing and the fact that the PS2 is just plain awesome , and you can see why we 're still staring down another monster end of the year .
Only one question remains , however : when the PS2 does finally turn 10 , will the software be there ?
Will anyone still be playing it ?
We 'll see you in a year to find out .

Franken auctions off his drawings at the end of each fundraiser .
Is this a sign of desperation or genius ?
[ The idea ] stems from a bar bet Franken made some years ago in which he claimed to be able to name all fifty states .
When he got to the end , the count was only 49 , and there was no way to remember which state he had accidentally skipped .
So he decided to learn how to draw a map of all 48 states so he could keep track .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
World leaders , warning of a global economic downturn , pledged Saturday to work together to find solutions to what is unfolding as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
President Bush and finance officials from the Group of Seven , Group of 20 and the International Monetary Fund - gathering in the nation 's capital - vowed vigilance in helping economies around the world on the road to recovery .
Concerns about the solvency of banks and financial institutions in recent weeks " had pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown , " said Dominique Strauss - Kahn , IMF managing director .
Strauss - Kahn said steps taken so far by the United States and European nations had n't been fully effective and that more would be necessary in " the coming months . "
For his part , President Bush did not announce any new actions to stem the financial panic gripping the world , but reiterated measures world leaders are taking to strengthen financial systems .
" We recognize that the turmoil in the financial markets is affecting all our citizens , " Bush said early Saturday morning .
" All of us recognize this is a serious global crisis that requires a serious global response for the good of our people . "
Both Bush and U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson spoke about the latest step being contemplated by the United States - injecting much - needed capital into banks .
" In recent weeks , financial market turmoil intensified throughout the world and credit markets froze , causing a chain reaction resulting in non-financial companies experiencing difficulty in financing normal business operations . "
Paulson told an IMF meeting .
The Bush administration is considering whether to use the authority granted in the $ 700 billion rescue plan enacted on Oct. 3 to take ownership stakes in financial institutions to stabilize and restore confidence in them .
Other countries are also taking action to inject liquidity , protect citizens ' savings and strengthen financial institutions in their own nations , he said .
Finance leaders from the world 's top economies , the Group of Seven , pledged Friday night to take steps to keep leading institutions afloat , unfreeze credit , ensure banks have enough capital to kick start lending and safeguard depositors ' funds and restart the secondary markets for mortgages and other securitized assets .
Bush said that it is vital that countries work together so that their actions do n't undermine others .
He pointed to the emergency interest rate cut enacted this week as an example of a coordinated effort .
He plans to expand discussions beyond the G - 7 ministers - representing the United States , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , and Japan - to the leaders of the G - 20 emerging market and industrialized nations .
" We 're in this together , we 'll come through this together , " the president said .
But Bush warned that it will take time to see the results .
So far , all the measures world leaders have taken have done little to calm jittery markets .
" The benefits will not be realized overnight , " he said .
Bush made a surprise visit Saturday at a G - 20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers .
Officials of the G - 20 issued a statement late Saturday saying that the " global implications " of the crisis required international cooperation .
The G - 20 is made up of rich and emerging nations that produce 90 percent of the world 's economic output .
The meeting in Washington came at Paulson 's request .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was also in attendance .
IMF backs G - 7 commitment
The International Monetary Fund endorsed the G - 7's commitment to do everything possible to jumpstart the world 's economies .
The IMF 's Monetary and Finance Committee said in a statement that it " recognizes that the depth and systemic nature of the crisis call for exceptional vigilance , coordination , and readiness to take bold action . "
Strauss - Kahn of the IMF said the downturn could be worse than anticipated .
" The world economy is now entering a major slowdown as a result of the most severe shock to mature financial markets since the 1930s , adding to pressure on global economies from high prices for oil and other commodities , " Strauss - Kahn said .
The International Monetary and Finance Committee - the steering arm of the IMF - began its 18th fall meeting Saturday .
The 185 - nation IMF was created in 1945 to coordinate international financial stability efforts , aiming to avoid financial collapses .
The World Bank , which is a similar organization with a slightly different mandate , also started its fall meeting Saturday .
It focuses on longer - term aid for troubled countries , investing in such things as infrastructure development .
Week of fear
The meetings in Washington cap a week in which fear gripped financial markets worldwide .
The Dow Jones industrial average had its worst week ever , falling just over 1,874 points , or 18 % .
Wall Street lost roughly $ 2.4 trillion in market value during the week , according to losses in the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 , the broadest measure of the market .
Since the mid-September collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked the latest chaos in the financial markets , Bush has repeatedly tried to reassure the Americans .
" We can solve this crisis - and we will , " said Bush , in a speech at the White House Friday , his 27th commentary on the nation 's financial health .
" Here 's what the American people need to know : The U.S. government is acting , and we will continue to act , to resolve this crisis and return stability to our markets , " he said .
The government has started taking a number of steps to attack the crisis , Bush said Friday .
These include helping homeowners to refinance into more affordable mortgages ; cutting the target for the federal funds rate ; unveiling a plan to support the market for commercial paper ; and offering government insurance for money market mutual funds .
The plan will authorize the Treasury to buy bad mortgage - related investments from finance companies , unfreezing the credit markets by freeing up banks and finance firms to lend once again .

Lennon 's downfall :
Had it not been for one last touching act of love , he might still be alive today
Philip Norman - the world 's foremost Beatles authority - was given hours of astonishingly candid interviews by John Lennon 's widow , Yoko Ono , for his definitive new biography of the star .
The resulting book gives a fresh and detailed insight into the tormented genius of Lennon and his struggle to come to terms with his stardom .
Here , in this final extract , Norman reveals how a treacherous sailing trip to Bermuda inspired Lennon to start making music again , shortly before that tragic day in December 1980 ...
John Lennon sat down with his cassette recorder in the autumn of 1979 and announced : ' Tape one in the on - going life story of John Winston Ono Lennon . '
His intention was to recall childhood memories for the autobiography he had promised himself he would write .
He began with a description of the terrace house near Penny Lane in Liverpool where he lived as a toddler .
He pondered the first thing he could ever remember and decided it was ' a nightmare ' .
Then suddenly he complained : ' This is boring .
I can't be bothered . '
And that was that .
Final glimpse :
The last picture of John Lennon , posing with a fan on the day of his death
He was entering his 40th year , and the awful realisation was dawning on him that time no longer stretched ahead in unlimited quantities , that more of his life might be behind than ahead , that the weeks were starting to fly by like days , the years like months .
He began to fret that his son Sean 's childhood was passing too quickly and that before he knew it , he'd no longer be needed to supervise bathtime or sing lullabies , as he had happily been doing for the past four years as ' househusband ' in the Lennon / Yoko Ono family at their apartment in New York .
' He used to say : " When we 're 80 , we 'll be in rocking - chairs , waiting for Sean 's postcards , " ' Yoko remembers .
He even speculated about what the two of them might do to fill the void in their lives after Sean had gone away to university .
One idea was to return to Britain and join the famous artists ' colony in St Ives .
On other occasions he felt bleak about the future .
Sometimes ,
Yoko recalls , she would wake in the night and find him crying , smitten by terror that she would die before he did - a logical thought because she was seven years older .
He remained completely faithful to her - so far as she knew , or wanted to .
But it did n't mean he was n't as sexually ravenous as ever .
On that same tape where he started ( and finished ) his autobiography , he went on to discuss an interview he'd read with E.M. Forster , one of Britain 's greatest 20th - century novelists , who lived into his 90s but never became reconciled to his own homosexuality .
Forster always hoped that when he reached old age , his sexual urges would vanish - but , instead , he told his interviewer , Truman Capote , they seemed even more of a burden .
' Sh*t ! '
John commented , ' cos I was always waiting for mine to lessen .
But I suppose it 's gonna go on for ever . '
Nostalgia : John recorded a tape of childhood memories , beginning with a description of the terrace house hear Penny Lane where he lived as a toddler
As middle - age beckoned he became increasingly nostalgic about his homeland , pining for British institutions and values he had once spurned .
He loved watching classic BBC serials on the television such as I , Claudius or Daphne du Maurier 's Rebecca .
To his Aunt Mimi , the woman who had brought him up , he sent a stream of requests for mementoes of the old days .
He wanted the Royal Worcester tea service she had kept on display in the front hall of her suburban semi , never sullied by the tiniest speck of dust .
She even had to root out his once - hated uniform blazer from Quarry Bank High School and his black - and - gold striped school tie .
Thereafter , if ever obliged to wear a suit , he often set it off with the school tie half - unknotted and askew , as if baiting long - gone headmasters .
Though he pretended otherwise , it got to him that Paul McCartney 's post -Beatles group , Wings , were among the biggest concert attractions in the world and that Paul 's Mull Of Kintyre had sold more copies in the UK than The Beatles ' She Loves You .
Such insecurities struck coldest in the middle of the night and he would rouse
Yoko to listen as he endlessly fretted over just what magic facility it was that his old partner possessed and he did not .
' He 'd say : " They always cover Paul 's songs - they never cover mine , " ' Yoko remembers .
He complained too when George Harrison beat him in the autobiography stakes by publishing his reminiscences .
John was hurt and angered , feeling it barely mentioned all he had done for George .
' He remembers every two - bit sax player or guitarist , but I was left out as if I did n't exist . '
Actually , John receives 11 mentions , more than Paul , The Beatles , Eric Clapton or even George 's second wife , Olivia .
Regret :
When he turned 40 , John began to fret his son Sean 's childhood was passing too quickly
John had virtually retired from the music business when his son Sean was born , and , as the Eighties began , the scene had moved on from super - groups to punk rock .
But The Beatles were far from forgotten .
Newspapers full of tittletattle about the Sex Pistols still cleared headline space for any rumoured reunion of the Fab Four .
An American promoter , Sid Bernstein , took out full - page ads in the New York Times offering more and yet more millions for what , even after all these years , would still be the hottest ticket on earth .
Paul , George and Ringo were reportedly not unamenable ; the stumbling block was always said to be John .
The band had given the world their all for ten years , he argued - and anyway if they tried performing together now after so long they would be ' just four rusty old men ' .
As his 40th birthday loomed , he felt a desire , common to many men at that stage in life , for some great adventure outside all his previous experience .
He had learned to sail on Long Island , where he and Yoko had a weekend house .
Now he began discussing the possibility of a yacht trip into more challenging waters .
He chose Bermuda as his destination ( or , rather , Yoko 's astrologists , numerologists and psychics did ) and set off from the American seaboard on a 43ft sloop , the Megan Jaye , skippered by a bearded salt named Hank Halsted .
It would be a 700 - mile journey that crossed busy tanker routes and unpredictable weather zones and included the notorious Bermuda Triangle .
Mid-life crises : A bearded , 40 - year - old John Lennon with Yoko Ono at Palm Beach
A few days out to sea , they were in unbroken brilliant sunshine with flat seas and dolphins curveting off the bows .
John was exhilarated .
In the communal cabin with the four other crew , he found himself living in closer proximity to other people than he had since travelling around by van to gigs with The Beatles before they became famous .
Then , out of nowhere , a storm broke , with 65 mph winds and 20ft waves .
As the Megan Jaye heaved and corkscrewed , three of the crew went down with terrible seasickness and lay prostrate on their bunks .
Cap'n
Hank was unaffected - and so , amazingly , was John .
Cap'n
Hank stayed at the wheel for 48 hours , then , dazed with fatigue , shouted to John : ' I 'm gonna need some help here , big boy .
Come and drive this puppy .
I 'll tell you what to do . '
The inexperienced John felt out of his depth , as if The Quarrymen - his pre-Beatles schoolboy skiffle group - had been asked to back a veteran rocker such as Jerry Lee Lewis .
' Hey Hank , ' he protested , ' I 've just got these little guitar - playing muscles here . '
But the skipper would brook no shirking , and John gingerly took over as helmsman .
Cap'n
Hank barked out a few basic instructions and then went below to grab some desperately needed sleep .
John was at first almost paralysed with panic .
But gradually he connected with the boat and began to understand its responses , almost as if it had been some great silver - bodied guitar .
His fear passed and he began to enjoy himself , roaring out every obscene sea shanty he had ever heard around Liverpool docks to the screaming audience of wind and waves .

' When I came back on deck , this was a man who was just enraptured , ' Cap'n Hank would remember .
' It was stimulus worthy of this stimulus - addict of a guy . '
Cap'n
Hank was not surprised that John had risen to the challenge .
' I think on that journey he discovered the tremendously strong man who had always been there inside him . '
John had certainly discovered something , because the Megan Jaye adventure galvanised him into wanting to make music again , and he was suddenly seized with a desire to make another album .
' I was so centred after the experience at sea , ' he said .
' All these songs came , after five years of nothing , no inspiration , no thought , no anything , then suddenly voom voom voom . '
In fact , he had never stopped making music during his retirement , putting numerous song ideas on tape , but never perservering with them .
The tracks he wrote in Bermuda all dealt with the life he had been leading since Sean had been born and they testified that , by and large , it had been a happy and fulfilled one .
Beautiful Boy was a hymn of joy to his son , affording a peep into his warm , safe nursery world and tempering impatience to see him grow up with a poignant selfreminder to appreciate every moment ( ' Life is what happens to you while you 're busy making other plans ' ) .
Another song , ( Just Like ) Starting Over , signified that , whatever Bermuda Triangle his marriage had passed through , it was back on an even keel and sailing confidently forward .
It was a declaration to Yoko that ' our life together is so precious ' and ' our love is still special ' .
The dark clouds , it seemed , had all rolled away .
The news that John Lennon was back in business sent a tremor throughout the music industry , which had not heard a peep from him for so long .
But the sessions in the studio were nothing like those in his tumultuous past .
Shocking : John Lennon and Yoko Ono during the filming of a video to promote their album , Double Fantasy in 1980 .
During the film , they strip and simulate making love
The musicians did not include any old cronies who might lead him astray , and the studio atmosphere suggested a health spa more than a rock album .
Instead of cocaine and cognac , the band were served tea and sushi ; a plate of sunflower seeds and raisins stood beside every microphone .
Sean 's picture hung over the mixing desk , a constant reminder that sessions must end in time for John to get home and say goodnight to him .
The release of the new album threw John 's life back into the public arena again .
There had been rumours that his retirement had brought terrible physical changes , which might prevent his ever reappearing in public .
Some reports said he had gone completely bald , others that the septum of his nose had been destroyed by cocaine .
Yet here he was , the same old John , if a little thinner and more lined of face , his hair still almost Beatlishly abundant , his accent unchanged .
Here were the same articulateness , honesty and irresistible wit , but all somehow calmer and mellower , as if deep inside him a storm had finally blown out .
And - defying the heaped - up insults , defamations and curses of the past decade - here too was Yoko , still with him at every moment .
But any idea that the old , shocking John and Yoko had gone for ever and that they had turned into a staid , middle - aged couple , sipping Ovaltine and watching TV , was confounded when they shot a video for a music track .
As the camera turned , they undressed , climbed onto a bed , kissed each other , then simulated having sex .
Not even the wildest punks and post - punks had yet dared stage something like this .
John 's old friend , photographer Bob Gruen , remembered meeting up with him at about this time and was struck by how happy he seemed .
He was talking about putting a new band together and even going back on the road .
' He seemed to have such a positive vision and a sense of hope for the future .
He 'd discovered he could be grounded with his family and sober , and still put out a message people could relate to .
He seemed finally to understand what it was to be alive . '
Tragic :
Fans of the late John Lennon hold photos , candles and flowers outside the West Side apartment building where he was shot death two years later
John began seriously thinking about the return to Britain he had been promising his family there for years .
His nostalgia had increased to the point where he'd choke up if he so much as read the name Liverpool .
He told Aunt Mimi that at night he would look out of his window facing in the direction of his hometown .
He would see ships leaving the harbour and wondered if they were heading there .
' He was very homesick towards the end , ' Mimi said .
' He was wanting to come home , to sail up the Mersey on the QE2 . '
Nor was this a passing fancy just for Mimi 's ears .
He declared the same intention when he received a surprise transatlantic call from an old Liverpool friend he had not spoken to for 15 years .
His plan , John said , was to charter the QE2 , and the friend promised to help by finding out whether the Mersey could handle such a big ship .
To other people , John said that after his exploits on the Megan Jaye , he fancied sailing across the Atlantic .
He had a vague date in mind .
In a private tape of odd thoughts and musings found after his death , he could be heard promising himself he'd take Sean back home in 1981 , ' because that 's a good year to go ' .
It was a year he would never get to see .
For those who set store by such things , the great puzzle must be why the astrologists , numerologists and psychics
Yoko had on permanent watch for dangers did not send him away on a journey to the far side of the world .
Later ,
Yoko realised that she had received an oblique and ambiguous warning from one psychic who foresaw ' a woman and she 's crying like crazy .
I think she 's your sister because she looks very much like you .
She has a young son , and she 's holding him and she 's going to be devastated about something ' .
Yoko later concluded : ' That was me she was talking about . '
But no one could have foreseen Mark Chapman , an archetypal nerd , overweight and without distinction , whose main solace for the joylessness of his life was Beatles music .
The media reports of John 's emergence from retirement - and the revelation that he was a very wealthy man thanks to Yoko 's business brain - turned Chapman 's former fan - worship into ferocious hatred .
He felt that , by acquiring large houses and investments , John had betrayed the ideals of The Beatles - and therefore betrayed him personally .
' Voices ' in his head dictated that these grievances could be avenged only by blood .
The evening of Monday , December 8 , 1980 , John was in the studio working with Yoko .
He found time to telephone Aunt Mimi and talk further about his imminent homecoming to Liverpool .
When they stopped work , at around 10.30 pm , Yoko suggested going straight out to dinner , but John wanted to pop back to their home at the Dakota mansion block .
He had to give Sean his goodnight kiss .
' The last thing he had on his mind , ' Yoko remembers , ' was getting back and seeing Sean before he went to sleep . '
Chapman was waiting outside the Dakota with a .38 handgun .
He dropped into the two - handed combat stance familiar from innumerable cop movies , and fired the five shots that ended John 's life .
Sean Lennon has a recollection of getting up the next morning and not being able to make any sense of what was happening - the grim - faced strangers coming and going through the apartment ; his father 's unexplained absence .
He was summoned to Yoko 's bedside .
' I remember standing there and her telling me , " Your dad 's been shot and killed , " and I said to her , " Do n't worry , Mom , you 're still young .
You 'll find somebody else , " because at five years old it sounded like a very mature thing to say . '
He did his best not to cry as he walked slowly from her room ' and as soon as she could n't see me , I burst into tears and I cried for days ' .
From outside , he could hear the multitude in the street below and in Central Park , chanting his father 's peace anthems between their own tears as a wave of grief reverberated around the world .
Tony Blair becomes ' world 's highest - earning public speaker ' as he rakes in £ 12MILLION since leaving No.10
Tony Blair is estimated to have earned £ 12 million since leaving No 10 .
The former prime minister is believed to have agreed an advance of around £ 4.6 million for his memoirs to be published by Random House .
But his biggest income is said to be from the international public speaking circuit .
One source in the speaking industry put the figure at more than £ 5.3 million , adding : " He is now probably the highest - paid public speaker in the world . "
Washington Speakers Bureau has a two - year waiting list to book Mr Blair , according to an analysis of his earnings by The Times , with institutions prepared to pay up to £ 157,000 for a speech of around an hour and a half .
Reasons to be cheerful : Blair addresses the world 's political and business elite early this year - but most of his earnings come from private speeches
Private equity investor the Carlyle Group - whose board has included former prime minister Sir John Major and the two presidents Bush - is said to be keen to hire Mr Blair .
Events include a conference of business experts in Europe in Paris next month , and a meeting in Dubai in February .
As a senior adviser to Wall Street bank JP Morgan Chase , Mr Blair is believed to earn up to £ 2 million a year , while his salary from Zurich Financial Services to work as an adviser on international politics and climate change is put at £ 500,000 .
As a former prime minister , he is entitled to a pension of £ 63,468 a year , as well as £ 84,000 to fund a private office .
Mr Blair 's spokesman disputed some of the figures but declined to comment on Mr Blair 's personal finances .
The £ 12 million figure is six times more than he would have earned as an MP .
But questions are now being raised over whether Mr Blair 's money - spinning activities are distracting from his work as the Middle East representative for the quartet of America , the European - Union , the United Nations and Russia .
A UN official in Jerusalem said : " There is a general sense that he is not around . "
But Mr Blair 's spokesman stressed that no quartet officials had suggested he was not spending enough time working to bridge the divide between the Palestinians and Israel .
He added : " When Mr Blair took up the post , he said he would be spending at least a week a month in the region and that is exactly what he is doing . "
The value of the Blairs ' property portfolio has risen sharply over the years but will now be hit by the house price slump .
Their South Pavilion country estate in Buckinghamshire , bought for £ 4 million in May , is estimated to have fallen in value to £ 3.76 million .
Their Connaught Square house , bought for £ 3.65 million in 2004 , is still worth more - another house in the street went for £ 5.5 million a few months ago - but its price will be falling .
The Blairs are believed to have accepted £ 285,000 for one of the Bristol flats they bought six years ago for £ 265,000 .
Mr Blair 's house in his former constituency of Sedgefield is said to have dropped in value by £ 14,000 since last summer to £ 126,000 .

Oh , this has just GOT to work better than a Saint Christopher ; after all , having millions of medals out there did n’t prevent St. Chris from getting demoted from Saint Christopher to Just A General All - Around Nice Guy Christopher ?
This , instead , is something with real power behind the graven image , something worth far more than its melt or sentimental value .
Sling this around your neck and have geeks falling at your feet ( mind you , they do that now , but only because I claim I dropped “ the chip that Woz signed for me ” I ’m a big meanie , I am ) and maybe one of them will give you Friends and Family options .
Or at least grovel on the floor , chanting .
That ’s always impressive .

Because of the way solid tumors adapt the body 's machinery to bring themselves more oxygen , chemotherapy and radiation may actually make these tumors stronger .
" In a sense , these therapies can make the tumor healthier , " said Mark W. Dewhirst , D.V.M. , Ph.D. , professor of radiation oncology at Duke University Medical Center .
" Unless the treatment is very effective in killing many if not most tumor cells , you are shooting yourself in the foot . "
Dewhirst and colleagues Yiting Cao , M.D. , Ph.D. , of Duke Pathology , and Benjamin Moeller , M.D. , Ph.D. have introduced this counter - intuitive idea at recent conferences and in a review article featured in the June issue of Nature Reviews Cancer .
Radiation and chemotherapy do kill most solid tumor cells , but in the cells that survive , the therapies drive an increase in a regulatory factor called HIF1 ( hypoxia - inducible factor 1 ) , which cells use to get the oxygen they need by increasing blood vessel growth into the tumor .
Solid tumors generally have low supplies of oxygen , Dewhirst explained and HIF1 helps them get the oxygen they need .
The review article concludes that blocking HIF1 would provide a clear mechanism for killing solid - tumor cells , particularly cells that are proving resistant to radiation or chemotherapy treatments .
As a part of this work , Dewhirst 's team has been studying the phenomenon of rising and falling oxygen levels in tumors , called cycling hypoxia .
Oxygen levels have been found to naturally cycle up and down in individual blood vessels as well as large tumor regions .
This instability in the tumor 's oxygen levels can increase HIF - 1 production and cause radiation therapy to fail , Dewhirst said .
" It is my opinion that the whole tumor grows more aggressively because of this pulsation of oxygen at low levels , " Dewhirst said .
" Most people thought cycling hypoxia was caused by temporary stoppage of blood flow in single blood vessel in tumors .
In fact , however , oxygen levels cycle up and down virtually everywhere in the tumor , which is caused by fluctuations in blood flow rate .
It has been a challenge to convince people of this . "
Dewhirst and colleagues have made movies of oxygen transport in a tumor of a living animal that show the oxygen levels cycle up and down significantly , pulsing in waves seen as color changes in the movies .
( View these movies at the Nature Reviews Cancer site : http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v8/n6/suppinfo/nrc2397.html )
The Duke team argues that blocking HIF1 is the consistent answer to tumor growth problems .
Blocking HIF1 activity interferes with the tumor 's ability to undergo glycolysis ( energy production ) in low - oxygen conditions , which blocks tumor growth , the authors wrote .
Exactly how to accomplish chemotherapy or radiation treatment in the safest , most effective ways , in combination with HIF1 blockade , is still open for exploration , Dewhirst said .
For example , targeting HIF1 in the early stages of tumor growth , especially in very early cancer spread , may help , Dewhirst said .
" For a woman who has had a primary breast tumor removed , and who is at high risk for cancer spread , this might be a situation in which you 'd target HIF1 , " he explained .
" Blocking HIF1 makes sense during the early stages of angiogenesis , which is the accelerated phase of blood vessel formation .
In this way , you could keep the early metastasis sites inactive and prevent them from growing . "
The Duke team has completed a phase I trial with a HIF1 inhibitor .
" We are actively pursuing this clinically and will be moving this study into Phase 2 , " Dewhirst said .
" We are interested in other applications of HIF - 1 inhibition in combination with radiation and chemotherapy for different diseases . "

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
( CNN ) -- Frustrated parents are dumping their teenagers at Nebraska hospitals -- even crossing state lines to do it -- and the state Legislature has scheduled a special hearing to try to stem the tide .
A 14 - year - old Iowa girl was left Tuesday at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha , Nebraska .
Nebraska's " safe haven " law , intended to allow parents to anonymously hand over an infant to a hospital without being prosecuted , is n't working out as planned .
Of the 17 children relinquished since the law took effect in July , only four are younger than 10 -- and all four are among the nine siblings abandoned by a man September 24 at an Omaha hospital .
On Tuesday , a 14 - year - old girl from Council Bluffs , Iowa , was abandoned at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha , Nebraska , just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs .
The case marks the first time a parent has crossed state lines to abandon a teenager in Nebraska , authorities said .
" The few situations we 've seen so far demonstrate the need for a change in Nebraska 's safe haven law , " Gov. Dave Heineman said in a statement Monday .
" In the coming legislative session , I will advocate for changes that put the focus back on protecting an infant in danger .
That should be our priority . "
All 50 states have safe haven laws , but only Nebraska 's lacks an age limit .
Nebraska 's part - time Legislature is adjourned until January , but two state legislative committees will hold a joint hearing November 13 to discuss a remedy .
" They 've got a huge problem , " said Linda Spears , vice president for policy and public affairs for the Child Welfare League of America .
" It 's a pretty poorly constructed law to meet its original intent . "
When it was introduced in the Legislature , the bill had a presumed age limitation of 72 hours , said Todd Landry , director of the state 's Division of Children and Family Services .
" The original intent was to protect infants from the immediate danger of being harmed , " he said .
However , the law 's final language uses the word " child " and does not specify an age limit , leaving it open to interpretation .
Other states ' laws specify the maximum age at which a child may be relinquished , ranging from 72 hours in several states to 1 year in North Dakota , according to the National Center for State Courts .
" Clearly in these cases so far that we 've seen , none of these children were in any immediate danger of being harmed , " Landry said .
" It is our opinion that the law does need to be modified . "
The law is being abused , Heineman 's statement said .
" Safe haven laws were not designed to allow families having difficulty with older youth and teenagers to abandon their children or responsibilities as parents , " he said .
The parents may not always be to blame , the Child Welfare League 's Spears said .
" The original safe haven laws were created for young moms who are having babies who did n't know how to get help .
I think these are families with older kids who do n't know how to get help and who are in desperate need , " she said .
Most state laws fail to provide for research into who is abandoning babies and why , league spokeswoman Joyce Johnson said .
" Those are the kinds of things we 've been wondering about and saying we need to know more about , and you 'll never know if you just have a law that says you can anonymously leave a child somewhere , no questions asked , " Johnson said .
New Jersey , she said , is an exception .
That state 's safe haven law provides funding for research and evaluation as well as $ 500,000 a year for public awareness , according to a September 2007 report by a New Jersey safe haven task force .
A woman who dropped her 15 - year - old nephew at a Lincoln , Nebraska , hospital told CNN affiliate KETV last month that she and the boy 's guardian could no longer handle his behavior problems .
Watch woman explain why she left 15 - year - old at hospital »
The woman , Cathy Poulin , said she tried discipline and medication , but nothing worked .
The boy 's mother died several years ago , and his father left him , she said .
" We had to go to the next level , " Poulin said .
" He can be made to get help . "
The Omaha man who left his nine children , ages 1 to 17 , at Creighton University Medical Center was overwhelmed by the sudden death of his wife after the youngest child was born , he told KETV .
" I was with her for 17 years , and then she was gone .
What was I going to do ? " Gary Staton said .
" We raised them together .
I did n't think I could do it alone .
I fell apart .
I could n't take care of them . "
Staton is just the kind of parent whom safe haven laws fail to help , Johnson said .
" He was grieving , he did n't have a lot of money , and all those children -- he was trying to figure out how to feed them , how to clothe them , and deal with the grief of losing his wife .
He needed help , " she said .
Heineman and Landry urged Nebraska parents who are having trouble coping to call the United Way 's 211 resource line or Boys Town , a nationally known nonprofit child services organization based in Nebraska .
Other options include community and faith - based support groups , crisis hot lines , treatment centers and other services , Landry added .

Senator Barack Obama - October 27 , 2008
Canton , Ohio
One week .
After decades of broken politics in Washington , eight years of failed policies from George Bush , and twenty - one months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California , we are one week away from change in America .
In one week , you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of Wall Street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on Main Street .
In one week , you can choose policies that invest in our middle - class , create new jobs , and grow this economy from the bottom - up so that everyone has a chance to succeed ; from the CEO to the secretary and the janitor ; from the factory owner to the men and women who work on its floor .
In one week , you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election ; that tries to pit region against region , city against town , Republican against Democrat ; that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope .
In one week , at this defining moment in history , you can give this country the change we need .
We began this journey in the depths of winter nearly two years ago , on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield , Illinois .
Back then , we did n't have much money or many endorsements .
We were n't given much of a chance by the polls or the pundits , and we knew how steep our climb would be .
But I also knew this .
I knew that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics .
I believed that Democrats and Republicans and Americans of every political stripe were hungry for new ideas , new leadership , and a new kind of politics - one that favors common sense over ideology ; one that focuses on those values and ideals we hold in common as Americans .
Most of all , I believed in your ability to make change happen .
I knew that the American people were a decent , generous people who are willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations .
And I was convinced that when we come together , our voices are more powerful than the most entrenched lobbyists , or the most vicious political attacks , or the full force of a status quo in Washington that wants to keep things just the way they are .
Twenty - one months later , my faith in the American people has been vindicated .
That 's how we 've come so far and so close - because of you .
That 's how we 'll change this country - with your help .
And that 's why we can't afford to slow down , sit back , or let up for one day , one minute , or one second in this last week .
Not now .
Not when so much is at stake .
We are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
760,000 workers have lost their jobs this year .
Businesses and families can't get credit .
Home values are falling .
Pensions are disappearing .
Wages are lower than they 've been in a decade , at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher .
It 's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage , or fill up your gas tank , or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month .
At a moment like this , the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired , old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
The last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in Washington is watching anyone on Wall Street because politicians and lobbyists killed common - sense regulations .
Those are the theories that got us into this mess .
They have n't worked , and it 's time for change .
That 's why I 'm running for President of the United States .
Now , Senator McCain has served this country honorably .
And he can point to a few moments over the past eight years where he has broken from George Bush - on torture , for example .
He deserves credit for that .
But when it comes to the economy - when it comes to the central issue of this election - the plain truth is that John McCain has stood with this President every step of the way .
Voting for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed .
Voting for the Bush budgets that spent us into debt .
Calling for less regulation twenty - one times just this year .
Those are the facts .
And now , after twenty - one months and three debates , Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy .
Senator McCain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change , but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old Bush - McCain policies that have failed us for the last eight years .
It 's not change when John McCain wants to give a $ 700,000 tax cut to the average Fortune 500 CEO .
It 's not change when he wants to give $ 200 billion to the biggest corporations or $ 4 billion to the oil companies or $ 300 billion to the same Wall Street banks that got us into this mess .
It 's not change when he comes up with a tax plan that does n't give a penny of relief to more than 100 million middle - class Americans .
That 's not change .
Look - we 've tried it John McCain 's way .
We 've tried it George Bush 's way .
Deep down , Senator McCain knows that , which is why his campaign said that " if we keep talking about the economy , we 're going to lose . "
That 's why he 's spending these last weeks calling me every name in the book .
Because that 's how you play the game in Washington .
If you can't beat your opponent 's ideas , you distort those ideas and maybe make some up .
If you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run away from .
You make a big election about small things .
Ohio , we are here to say " Not this time .
Not this year .
Not when so much is at stake . "
Senator McCain might be worried about losing an election , but I 'm worried about Americans who are losing their homes , and their jobs , and their life savings .
I can take one more week of John McCain 's attacks , but this country can't take four more years of the same old politics and the same failed policies .
It 's time for something new .
The question in this election is not " Are you better off than you were four years ago ? "
We know the answer to that .
The real question is , " Will this country be better off four years from now ? "
I know these are difficult times for America .
But I also know that we have faced difficult times before .
The American story has never been about things coming easy - it 's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard .
It 's about seeing the highest mountaintop from the deepest of valleys .
It 's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose .
That 's how we 've overcome war and depression .
That 's how we 've won great struggles for civil rights and women 's rights and worker 's rights .
And that 's how we 'll emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before - as one nation ; as one people .
Remember , we still have the most talented , most productive workers of any country on Earth .
We 're still home to innovation and technology , colleges and universities that are the envy of the world .
Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities .
So there 's no reason we can't make this century another American century .
We just need a new direction .
We need a new politics .
Now , I do n't believe that government can or should try to solve all our problems .
I know you do n't either .
But I do believe that government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide a decent education for our children ; invest in new roads and new science and technology .
It should reward drive and innovation and growth in the free market , but it should also make sure businesses live up to their responsibility to create American jobs , and look out for American workers , and play by the rules of the road .
It should ensure a shot at success not only for those with money and power and influence , but for every single American who 's willing to work .
That 's how we create not just more millionaires , but more middle - class families .
That 's how we make sure businesses have customers that can afford their products and services .
That 's how we 've always grown the American economy - from the bottom - up .
John McCain calls this socialism .
I call it opportunity , and there is nothing more American than that .
Understand , if we want get through this crisis , we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right .
We do n't need bigger government or smaller government .
We need a better government - a more competent government - a government that upholds the values we hold in common as Americans .
We do n't have to choose between allowing our financial system to collapse and spending billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out Wall Street banks .
As President , I will ensure that the financial rescue plan helps stop foreclosures and protects your money instead of enriching CEOs .
And I will put in place the common - sense regulations I 've been calling for throughout this campaign so that Wall Street can never cause a crisis like this again .
That 's the change we need .
The choice in this election is n't between tax cuts and no tax cuts .
It 's about whether you believe we should only reward wealth , or whether we should also reward the work and workers who create it .
I will give a tax break to 95 % of Americans who work every day and get taxes taken out of their paychecks every week .
I 'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $ 50,000 and give homeowners and working parents more of a break .
And I 'll help pay for this by asking the folks who are making more than $ 250,000 a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the 1990s .
No matter what Senator McCain may claim , here are the facts - if you make under $ 250,000 , you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime - not your income taxes , not your payroll taxes , not your capital gains taxes .
Nothing .
Because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle - class .
When it comes to jobs , the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around America or allowing every job to disappear overseas .
The truth is , we wo n't be able to bring back every job that we 've lost , but that does n't mean we should follow John McCain 's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send American jobs overseas .
I will end those breaks as President , and I will give American businesses a $ 3,000 tax credit for every job they create right here in the United States of America .
I 'll eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start - up companies that are the engine of job creation in this country .
We 'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads , and bridges , and schools , and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country .
And I will invest $ 15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade - jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced ; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid ; jobs building the fuel - efficient cars of tomorrow , not in Japan or South Korea but here in the United States of America ; jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the Middle East in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain .
That 's how America can lead again .
When it comes to health care , we do n't have to choose between a government - run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now .
If you already have health insurance , the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums .
If you do n't have health insurance , you 'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress get for themselves .
We 'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families , businesses , and the entire economy .
And as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre-existing condition and did n't want to pay for treatment , I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most .
When it comes to giving every child a world - class education so they can compete in this global economy for the jobs of the 21st century , the choice is not between more money and more reform - because our schools need both .
As President , I will invest in early childhood education , recruit an army of new teachers , pay them more , and give them more support .
But I will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools .
And I will make a deal with every American who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college : if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford your tuition .
You invest in America , America will invest in you , and together , we will move this country forward .
And when it comes to keeping this country safe , we do n't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in Iraq .
It 's time to stop spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqi government sits on a huge surplus .
As President , I will end this war by asking the Iraqi government to step up , and finally finish the fight against bin Laden and the al Qaeda terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 .
I will never hesitate to defend this nation , but I will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century , and I will restore our moral standing , so that America is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
I wo n't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy - especially now .
The cost of this economic crisis , and the cost of the war in Iraq , means that Washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we can afford to do without .
On this , there is no other choice .
As President , I will go through the federal budget , line - by - line , ending programs that we do n't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less .
But as I 've said from the day we began this journey all those months ago , the change we need is n't just about new programs and policies .
It 's about a new politics - a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts ; one that reminds us of the obligations we have to ourselves and one another .
Part of the reason this economic crisis occurred is because we have been living through an era of profound irresponsibility .
On Wall Street , easy money and an ethic of " what 's good for me is good enough " blinded greedy executives to the danger in the decisions they were making .
On Main Street , lenders tricked people into buying homes they could n't afford .
Some folks knew they could n't afford those houses and bought them anyway .
In Washington , politicians spent money they did n't have and allowed lobbyists to set the agenda .
They scored political points instead of solving our problems , and even after the greatest attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor , all we were asked to do by our President was to go out and shop .
That is why what we have lost in these last eight years cannot be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits alone .
What has also been lost is the idea that in this American story , each of us has a role to play .
Each of us has a responsibility to work hard and look after ourselves and our families , and each of us has a responsibility to our fellow citizens .
That 's what 's been lost these last eight years - our sense of common purpose ; of higher purpose .
And that 's what we need to restore right now .
Yes , government must lead the way on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and our businesses more efficient .
Yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
But all of us must do our part as parents to turn off the television and read to our children and take responsibility for providing the love and guidance they need .
Yes , we can argue and debate our positions passionately , but at this defining moment , all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences and unite in common effort - black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American ; Democrat and Republican , young and old , rich and poor , gay and straight , disabled or not .
In this election , we cannot afford the same political games and tactics that are being used to pit us against one another and make us afraid of one another .
The stakes are too high to divide us by class and region and background ; by who we are or what we believe .
Because despite what our opponents may claim , there are no real or fake parts of this country .
There is no city or town that is more pro-America than anywhere else - we are one nation , all of us proud , all of us patriots .
There are patriots who supported this war in Iraq and patriots who opposed it ; patriots who believe in Democratic policies and those who believe in Republican policies .
The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America .
It wo n't be easy , Ohio .
It wo n't be quick .
But you and I know that it is time to come together and change this country .
Some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics .
A lot of you may be disappointed and even angry with your leaders .
You have every right to be .
But despite all of this , I ask of you what has been asked of Americans throughout our history .
I ask you to believe - not just in my ability to bring about change , but in yours .
I know this change is possible .
Because I have seen it over the last twenty - one months .
Because in this campaign , I have had the privilege to witness what is best in America .
I 've seen it in lines of voters that stretched around schools and churches ; in the young people who cast their ballot for the first time , and those not so young folks who got involved again after a very long time .
I 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see their friends lose their jobs ; in the neighbors who take a stranger in when the floodwaters rise ; in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb .
I 've seen it in the faces of the men and women I 've met at countless rallies and town halls across the country , men and women who speak of their struggles but also of their hopes and dreams .
I still remember the email that a woman named Robyn sent me after I met her in Ft. Lauderdale .
Sometime after our event , her son nearly went into cardiac arrest , and was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars .
Her insurance company refused to pay , and their family just did n't have that kind of money .
In her email , Robyn wrote , " I ask only this of you - on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people , think of us .
When those who oppose you have you down , reach deep and fight back harder . "
Ohio , that 's what hope is - that thing inside us that insists , despite all evidence to the contrary , that something better is waiting around the bend ; that insists there are better days ahead .
If we 're willing to work for it .
If we 're willing to shed our fears and our doubts .
If we 're willing to reach deep down inside ourselves when we 're tired and come back fighting harder .
Hope !
That 's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going when times were tough .
What led them to say , " Maybe I ca n't go to college , but if I save a little bit each week my child can ; maybe I can't have my own business but if I work really hard my child can open one of her own . "
It 's what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in America ; what led those who could n't vote to march and organize and stand for freedom ; that led them to cry out , " It may look dark tonight , but if I hold on to hope , tomorrow will be brighter . "
That 's what this election is about .
That is the choice we face right now .
Do n't believe for a second this election is over .
Do n't think for a minute that power concedes .
We have to work like our future depends on it in this last week , because it does .
In one week , we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates new jobs and fuels prosperity from the bottom - up .
In one week , we can choose to invest in health care for our families , and education for our kids , and renewable energy for our future .
In one week , we can choose hope over fear , unity over division , the promise of change over the power of the status quo .
In one week , we can come together as one nation , and one people , and once more choose our better history .
That 's what 's at stake .
That 's what we 're fighting for .
And if in this last week , you will knock on some doors for me , and make some calls for me , and talk to your neighbors , and convince your friends ; if you will stand with me , and fight with me , and give me your vote , then I promise you this - we will not just win Ohio , we will not just win this election , but together , we will change this country and we will change the world .
Thank you ,

Soldier : You see anything ?
Soldier : Where ?
Soldier :
Out there - on the time horizon !
Soldier : Nah .
Soldier : Yo , you think McCain would really keep us here until we win ?
Soldier : Sounds like it ...
Soldier : Count on it !
Mac sees Iraq as a chance to re-fight Vietnam , to show that we really can win an open - ended war regardless of cost .
If we gut it out and eventually win here , it proves we could have won in Nam if we 'd wanted to .
And if we could have won , it means we did n't really lose , which is the same as winning !
Soldier : Wow ... how cool would that be , Sarge ?
Soldier : What ?
Soldier : To finally win the Vietnam War !
That would rock !
Soldier :
It 'd sure mean a lot to my parents .
Soldier :
Then stay frosty , young dawgs - gotta win this one first !

It was a showdown to cherish for critics of Wall Street 's culture of enrichment .
The grim - faced boss of the bankrupt bank Lehman Brothers was left squirming yesterday as a veteran Democrat roasted him over his multimillion - dollar pay .
With the startled look of a man unaccustomed to sharp examination , Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld clashed bluntly with the chairman of the House oversight committee , Henry Waxman , on Capitol Hill .
Called on to explain why Lehman collapsed last month , Fuld began with a note of humility , saying he felt " horrible " over the demise of the 158 - year - old institution .
" I want to be very clear , " Fuld said .
" I take full responsibility for the decisions I made and for the actions I took . "
In a brief speech which was heard in silence , Fuld told legislators that if he could turn back the clock he would do many things differently .
As soon as he finished speaking , sparks began to fly .
The chairman of the committee held up a chart suggesting that Fuld 's personal remuneration totalled $ 480 m ( £ 276 m ) over eight years , including payouts of $ 91 m in 2001 and $ 89 m in 2005 .
" Your company is now bankrupt and our country is in a state of crisis , " said Waxman , a liberal from California .
" You get to keep $ 480 m .
I have a very basic question : Is that fair ? "
After a long pause , Fuld said the figure was exaggerated : " The majority of my compensation , sir , came in stock .
The vast majority of the stock I got I still owned at the point of our [ bankruptcy ] filing . "
Waxman cut him off , saying that even if the figure was slightly lower , it was " unimaginable " to much of the public .
" Is that fair , for a CEO of a company that 's now bankrupt , to make that kind of money ?
It 's just unimaginable to so many people . "
" I would say to you the $ 500 m number is not accurate , " said Fuld .
" I 'd say to you , although it 's still a large number , for the years you 're talking about here , my cash compensation was close to $ 60 m , which you 've indicated here , and I took out closer to $ 250 m [ in shares ] . "
Interrupting again , Waxman listed Fuld 's collection of property , including a $ 14 m ocean - front villa in Florida and a home in an exclusive ski resort .
" You and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings , " Waxman said .
" Your former president , Joe Gregory , used to travel to work in a helicopter . "
A pugnacious congressman with a bald head and military moustache , Waxman warmed to his theme : " You made all this money taking risks with other people 's money . "
Refusing to give ground , Fuld said his pay had been set by an independent compensation committee which spent " a tremendous amount of time " making sure executives ' interests were aligned with those of shareholders .
" When the company did well , we did well , " Fuld said .
" When the company did not do well , we did n't do well . "
Waxman disagreed : " Mr Fuld , there seems to be a breakdown , because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did well when the company was not doing well .
And now your shareholders who owned your company have nothing .
They 've been wiped out . "
Fuld 's evidence was his first public appearance since Lehman failed , sparking a chain of events which has sent shockwaves through the global financial system and prompted the US government to begin a $ 700 bn bail - out of the banking sector .
A lifelong Lehman employee who joined the firm as an intern in 1966 , Fuld has been blamed for the debacle by many of the bank 's 28,000 staff - including those in London who have accused senior management of filleting Lehman 's British operation of money in the bank 's final days .
Deadpan and emotionless , Fuld repeatedly frustrated congressmen by answering questions with lengthy , technical financial explanations .
Frustrated by his demeanour , a Republican congressman , John Mica , tried humour : " If you have n't discovered your role , you 're the villain today .
You 've got to act like a villain . "
Fuld stared back wordlessly , without a shadow of a smile .
Space is extremely cold , near absolute zero , and it is a vacuum , so no oxygen , plus there is the threat of lethal radiation from stars .
It is considered the most hostile of environments , where unprotected humans would last for a fraction of a second .
But research by Ingemar Jönsson and colleagues in Current Biology shows that some animals — the tardigrades , or ' water - bears ' — can do away with space suits and can survive exposure to open - space vacuum , cold and radiation just fine .
I do n't need no stinking spacesuit ...
This is the first time that any animal has been tested for survival under open - space conditions .
The test subjects were chosen with great care : Tardigrades — also known as water - bears — are tiny invertebrate animals from 0.1 to 1.5 m m in size that can be easily found on wet lichens and mosses .
Because their homes often fall dry , tardigrades are very resistant to drying out and can even resurrect after years of dryness .
Along with this amazing survival trick comes extreme resistance to heat , cold and radiation — so tardigrades seemed like an ideal animal to test in space .
The dried - up tardigrades were aboard the FOTON - M3 spacecraft launched by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) in September 2007 and were exposed to open space conditions — i.e. to vacuum , UV radiation from the sun and cosmic radiation — in a low Earth orbit of around 270 km altitude .
After their safe return to Earth , it turned out that while most of them survived exposure to vacuum and cosmic rays alone , some had even survived the exposure to the deadly levels of solar UV radiation , which are more than 1,000 times higher than on the surface of the Earth .
Even more so , the survivors could even reproduce fine after their space trip .
The tardigrades extreme resistance to UV radiation is perhaps most surprising .
UV rays consist of high - energy light particles that cause severe damage to tissue , as is evident when you get a sun-burn .
But more so , they can also damage the cell 's genetic material , causing for instance skin cancers .
For this reason UV is deadly for most organisms — it is even used as a sterilising agent .
As Jönsson and colleagues write : " How these animals were capable of reviving their body after receiving a dose of UV radiation of more than 7000 kJm - 2 under space vacuum conditions [ … ] remains a mystery . "
It is conceivable that the same cellular adaptations that let them survive drying out might also account for their overall hardiness .

Inside Obama 's Oval Office :
The plush furnishings awaiting the President Elect in his new HQ
The Oval Office has been the preserve of 17 US Presidents since it was built in 1909 .
Each new incumbent stamps his own style on the room in the West Wing – and Barack Obama ’s design choices will be closely analysed when he moves in next January .
1 Three 11ft 6in French windows flood the room with light .
In the Second World War they were fitted with bulletproof glass .
2 and 3 Just as every President has done before him , Barack Obama will be expected to keep the US flag and Presidential flag behind the desk .
4 The Gunlock chair has served nine Presidents and was specifically designed for John F. Kennedy , who suffered from chronic back pain .
5 Photos of President Bush ’s family are displayed on the side table .
6 The HMS Resolute Desk , carved from the timbers of a British frigate of the same name and a gift from Queen Victoria .
7 President Franklin D. Roosevelt commissioned this central desk panel to hide his leg braces .
8 A bust of President Eisenhower .
The Obamas will consult books on the White House collection to decide which
pieces of art and furniture they will display .
9 William Koerner ’s painting A Charge To Keep – showing a horseman charging up a steep trail .
10 President William Howard
Taft , the first to occupy the office , found the Philippine mahajua wood floor too cold and covered it with an olive - green shag pile rug .
Since then , successive Presidents have commissioned a bespoke rug and President Bush says one of Obama’s
first decisions will be choosing his .
John F. Kennedy ’s dazzling red rug was being fitted on the day he was assassinated .
Bill Clinton chose a £ 34,000 solemn dark blue design .
Bush ’s wife Laura chose this £ 40,000 rug with ‘ optimistic ’ sunbeam design .
11 The Presidential seal always stays in the middle of the rug .
12 The red Presidential buzzer button in a wooden box , used to call aides at a moment ’s notice .
It is said President Johnson installed it so the Secret Service could warn him when his wife was on her way .
13 The rosewood chairs either side of the President ’s desk have been a feature since Roosevelt .
With their backs to the room , they are used by secretaries taking dictation .

Great American Road Trip Rhett & Link
Two young men have been keeping me amused and entertained over the past few weeks .
Rhett and Link are part of the ever - growing and popular phenomenon of " intertainment " , as they have coined it .
Now I want you to start at speedysroadtrip.com , as this is how I found these guys .
On this site we see our hapless heroes taking a roadtrip across America to bring us the inside story from Los Angeles to Maine .
These videos are great entertainment , and actually somewhat informative .
I love the design and execution of the website .
Whilst it is sponsored by a brand , the advertising is handled in an understated way and does not dominate the content in any way .
When you finish the roadtrip , there is plenty more of these crazy boys to enjoy at rhettandlink.com , where you will find archives of previous shows and a weekly live broadcast .
It is already attracting something of a cult following on the internet .

For millions of years , Antarctica , the frozen continent at the southern end of the planet , has been encased in a gigantic sheet of ice .
Recently , the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) satellite has been taking sensitive measurements of the gravity for the entire Earth , including Antarctica .
Recent analysis of GRACE data indicate that the Antarctic ice sheet might have lost enough mass to cause the worlds ' oceans to rise about .05 inches , on the average , from between 2002 and 2005 .
The picture was taken on the Riiser - Larsen ice shelf in December 1995 .

LONDON , Nov. 1 ( UPI ) --
Temperature increases in Antarctica and the Arctic region are the result of man-made emissions of greenhouse gases , researchers in England have concluded .
The Independent reported Saturday that the study , published in the journal Nature Geoscience , marks the first time scientists have been able to prove a link between climate changes in both polar regions and human activities .

" We 're able for the first time to directly attribute warming in both the Arctic and the Antarctic to human influences on the climate , " said Nathan Gillett of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , who led the study .
The findings run counter to the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which found that Antarctica was the only continent where the human impact on the climate had not been observed .
" For a long time , climate scientists have known that Arctic areas would be expected to warm most strongly because of feedback mechanisms , but the results from this work demonstrate the part man has already played in the significant warming that we 've observed in both polar regions , " said Peter Stott of the Met Office Hadley Center , who took part in the modeling analysis .

In today ’s featured article the Brennan Center for Justice and the Advancement Project have reported that thousands of Florida voters may be disenfranchised by a last minute decision by the Secretary of State , Kurt Browning , to enforce a “ no match , no vote ” law .
“ No match , no vote ” essentially says that if a voters name or information on their registration does not exactly match their name or information on their ID they cannot vote or they can vote a provisional ballot and take the same ID to the county election office after the election to prove they are who they say they are .
" This 11th - hour decision is an ill - advised move to apply a policy the state has never enforced in its current form , at a time when registration activity is at its highest , " stated Beverlye Neal , director of the Florida State Conference of the NAACP , a plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenges Florida 's matching law .
" The Secretary 's decision will put thousands of real Florida citizens at risk due to bureaucratic typos that under the ' no - match , no - vote ' law will prevent them from voting this November , " said Alvaro Fernandez of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project , another plaintiff in the case .
" Voters who do everything right , who submit forms that are complete , timely , and accurate , will suddenly find themselves unregistered when they go to vote , just because someone somewhere punched the wrong letter on a keyboard , " said Myrna Pérez , counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice .
" The no match , no vote policy is unjust and unnecessary , and Florida voters will pay the price this fall , " stated Jean - Robert Lafortune , president of the Haitian - American Grassroots Coalition , another plaintiff in the lawsuit ...
Joerg Haider , the Austrian extreme rightist who died in a car crash while going twice the speed limit last week , spent the last moments of his life partying at gay hot spot Stadtkraeme , according to the German newspaper Bild .
Maybe European Neo -Nazis just like to dance ?
Haider 's evening began with a surprise appearance at the launch party of a new Austrian tabloid , where he was photographed in the company of a young local woman .
At the same party , Haider , 58 , gave what would become his last interview , speaking to a reporter about his passion for Italian wine , among other things .
However , contrary to previous reports , the evening of the charismatic leader did not end there .
Before heading home , Haider made a quick visit to Stadtkraeme , a local club famous for its gay night scene .
Haider was spotted leaving the place on his own shortly before 1 A.M. , fatally crashing his car half an hour later .
MANAUS , Brazil ( Reuters ) - Latin America ’s leftist leaders on Tuesday accused the United States of “ irresponsibility ” in its handling of the financial crisis that has pummeled markets and threatens economies around the world .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez warned the crisis over credit could slow economic growth across Latin America and took a stab at Washington , predicting that U.S. economic power is in dramatic decline .
“ This crash of capitalism and of neoliberalism will be worse than that of 1929 , ” Chavez told reporters at a meeting with the leaders of Brazil , Bolivia , and Ecuador in Brazil ’s Amazon city of Manaus .
“ The world will never be the same after this crisis .
A new world has to emerge , and it ’s a multipolar world , ” he said .
“ We are decoupling from the wagon of death . ”
Many Latin American countries depend heavily on exports of commodities , such as oil , soy , copper and bananas , and falling prices combined with tighter credit are raising fears of a sharp slowdown .
“ Financing will become more difficult , ” Chavez said .
“ Raw material prices could come down , starting with the price of oil , and including copper , minerals and food stuffs . ”
Still , much of the region ’s economies will grow above the global average this year , including Brazil at around 5 percent .
It was ironic that rich countries were in crisis and developing countries were sustaining global growth , said Brazil ’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
“ We did our homework and they did not , ” Lula said during a joint news conference with Chavez .
With world money markets in trouble , policymakers are hoping the U.S. Congress will quickly revive and approve a $ 700 billion rescue package that would allow the U.S.
Treasury to buy up bad debt from struggling banks .
But Bolivian President Evo Morales , who is a close ally of Venezuela ’s Chavez and has nationalized the natural gas industry as part of his socialist reforms , criticized the U.S. plan as a bail - out for the rich .
“ In Bolivia , we nationalized for the people to have money , while the United States wants to nationalize debt and a crisis of the wealthy , ” Morales said before meeting with Chavez , Brazil ’s leader and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa .
Correa , Morales and Chavez all promote socialist reforms and have been harsh Washington critics .
Lula , a former labor leader , has ties with all three but has been much more market friendly and has good relations with Washington .
I 'm working on a Django app that is getting gradually closer to some kind of release , but I want to be able to ramp things up slowly , starting with a few targeted users and iterating from there .
I 've previously been quite impressed with django - authopenid for supporting OpenID and traditional sign - up and sign - in , and wanted to continue using it , so I sat down to plot a devious scheme that would allow me to restrict user registration without tampering with the django - authopenid 's internals .
The cornerstone of my approach is the AppInvite model , which allows the creation of signup codes with a limited number of uses .
class AppInvite ( models .
Model ) : password = models .
CharField ( max_length = 10 ) max = models .
IntegerField ( ) current = models .
IntegerField ()
Then I modified the project 's urls .py to override django - authopenid 's signup page :
( r'account / signup / ' , ' views.restrict_signup ' ) , ( r'account / ' , include ( ' django_authopenid.urls ' ) ) ,
As mentioned , I did n't want to mangle django - authopenid 's internals , because this is only a quick fix to a temporary problem , not an integral piece of code that will stay around forever .
Next I needed to write the restrict_signup view :
from django_authopenid.views import signup from django . shortcuts import render_to_response from models import AppInvite def restrict_signup ( request ) : " If posting , pass it directly to signup . " if request .
method == ' POST ' : return signup ( request ) extra = {} if request .
GET . has_key ( " pw " ) : pw = request .
GET [ ' pw ' ] ai = AppInvite .
objects .
filter ( password = pw ) if len ( ai ) != 0 : ai = ai [ 0 ] if ai . current < ai . max : ai . current = ai . current + 1 ai . save ( ) return signup ( request ) else : extra [ ' error ' ] =
" The signup code ' %s ' has expired . " % pw else : extra [ ' error ' ] = " ' %s ' is n't a valid signup code . " % pw return render_to_response ( " restrict_signup.html " , extra )
It the request recieves a GET request , then it forces the user to authenticate with a signup code , but if it receives a POST request , then it proxies it forward to django_authopenid 's signup view .
The restrict_signup view has a couple of minor flaws :
it counts the number of times it present the blank registration form , as opposed to the actual number of users created .
it could be circumvented by manually sending a POST request instead of a GET request .
For my purposes , I 'm not overly worried if a few fewer people are let in , or if a couple of people circumvent the system to sneak in , so it is still a sufficient solution for me .
The last piece of the puzzle is the restrict_signup. html template .
{ % extends " base.html " %} { % block content %} < div class= " main " > < h2 > Please Enter Signup Code </ h2 > { % if error %} < p > {{ error }} </p > { % endif %} < form action= " " method= " GET " > < label for= " pw " > Signup Code : </ label > < input name= " pw " > < input type= " submit " value= " Check Code " > </ form > </div > { % endblock %}
I 'm sure it would be useful if this pattern could be abstracted ( and extended a bit ) into a pluggable application , but that would require a bit more thought about how to structure it .
My thoughts on that are :
Italian government imposes national state of emergency
By Marianne Arens
6 August 2008
On July 25 , the Italian government headed by Silvio Berlusconi proclaimed a national state of emergency due to the continuing inflow of refugees by boat from across the Mediterranean Sea .
This means that the state of emergency already imposed on Italy ’s three southernmost provinces —
Sicily , Apulia and Calabria — will be expanded to encompass the entire country .
In 2002 , during his second term in office , Berlusconi had already introduced a so - called “ refugee state of emergency ” in the south , which was continued in 2006 by the government led by Romano Prodi .
Prodi also imposed a “ water state of emergency ” in May 2007 and somewhat later a “ garbage state of emergency ” in Naples .
The current national state of emergency , however , has assumed new and alarming dimensions .
Since taking office three months ago , Berlusconi ’s government has systematically undertaken a series of harsh measures against immigrants and refugees , intensified security laws and decrees and facilitated assaults and acts of violence against what the government terms “ illegal immigrants ” .
This campaign has seen the burning down of a Roma camp in Naples while the local authorities looked on .
With its proclamation of a national state of emergency , the government has now made provisions for the introduction of extensive police - state powers .
The Italian parliament did not participate in the decision , but was presented with a fait accompli .
Deputies only learned of the newly imposed state of emergency from newspaper reports .
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni ( Northern League ) then explained the measure to deputies in the lower house last Tuesday .
The chairman of the house is Gianfranco Fini , the leader of the “ post - fascist ” National Alliance .
Maroni justified the state of emergency with reference to the “ continuous and unusual influx of non-European Union citizens ” .
He then cynically claimed that the government would use its powers to “ better assist the illegal immigrants by accommodating them in buildings rather than tents , and guarantee them more humane treatment ” .
Maroni ’s real plan is to incarcerate the largest possible number of refugees in the shortest period of time .
He confirmed a plan to double the number of internment camps and convert former barracks across the country into so - called “ identification and classification centres ” .
These prisons will serve to implement the newly introduced security laws , which make “ illegal immigration ” a criminal offence .
“ Offenders ” can be held for up to 18 months .
On the same day , Defence Secretary Ignazio La Russa of the National Alliance made clear that these camps will be guarded in the future by regular army soldiers .
Last Wednesday , he signed a decree which , beginning on August 4 , permits the use of 3,000 soldiers for domestic purposes .
One thousand soldiers are to be deployed at the internment camps .
An additional thousand are to be posted at sensitive public places ( train stations , embassies , St. Peter ’s Cathedral , etc. ) , and the rest assigned to street patrols alongside ordinary policemen .
The defence secretary declared that the soldiers will be allowed to arrest suspects “ caught in the act of committing a crime ” .
He added , “ I have imposed the foot patrols ...
The young soldiers are very experienced , they have been used in peace missions where they are confronted with situations which are more problematic than those to be found in our cities . ”
In other words , sections of the army are being deployed in the country ’s cities who have already served and been brutalised by combat and civil war situations in Afghanistan , Lebanon or even Iraq .
They are now being mobilised to serve in the cities of Milan , Rome , Naples , Padua and Verona .
The deployment of troops for the rest of this year will cost over 31 million euros .
Ignazio Maria La Russa , whose middle name , Benito , is the same as that of the former Italian fascist dictator , Mussolini , is both defence secretary and president of the National Alliance , which is part of Berlusconi ’s “ People of Liberty ” alliance .
Like his father , La Russa was active in the neo- fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano ( MSI ) before taking an active role in transforming the MSI into the National Alliance .
La Russa hit the headlines two weeks ago with his proposal to fingerprint all of Italy ’s inhabitants .
The Italian Interior Ministry had been sharply reprimanded by the European parliament because it had begun systematically gathering the fingerprints of Sinti and Roma — including children .
The European parliament called this measure an “ act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin ” .
La Russa then reacted with his cynical proposal .
“ Let ’s do it this way : we decide a law , which envisages taking all fingerprints ... in order to dissociate us from the slightest suspicion of racism .
In the course of implementation priorities will be established and it could be that we find the fingerprints of Roma children amongst the most urgent cases . ”
Although the recent government measures represent a threat to the rights of the entire Italian population , there has been a complete lack of principled resistance to the measures by the country ’s political opposition .
The Democratic Party , headed by former member of the Italian Communist Party Walter Veltroni , has said little about the government ’s measures .
Leading party members have merely noted that the presence of soldiers in the country ’s historical town centres at the peak of the vacation season could harm Italy ’s image amongst tourists .
Former public prosecutor Antonio di Pietro ( Italy of Values ) explained that the problems of public security were due to cuts in the police budget .
The recently approved measures , he said , were as likely to succeed as an attempt to “ wash one ’s face with dirty water ” .
Instead , Di Pietro would like to tackle the problem on the basis of previous police methods , without resorting to such drastic measures as the deployment of the army in public places and on the streets .
The leaders of Communist Refoundation also played down the issue and failed to exhibit any real interest in the fate of immigrants and refugees .
Paolo Ferrero , who recently succeeded Fausto Bertinotti and Franco Giordano as party secretary of Communist Refoundation , explained that the imposition of the state of emergency was “ a diversion to distract Italians from the consequences of government measures , which are crippling the country and its weakest layers ” .
For his part Nichi Vendola , president of the region of Apulia and prominent member of Communist Refoundation rejected the emergency measures in radical tones as “ a further piece of fascism ” .
What both men conceal is the fact that Communist Refoundation bears a large share of responsibility for the current situation .
For two years ( 2006 - 2008 ) , Communist Refoundation was part of the Prodi government , which issued its own decree for the deportation of all those who allegedly represented “ a danger to the public order ” .
It was the first administration to draw up lists of Romanian Roma for possible deportation .
At the time , Paolo Ferrero , a Communist Refoundation minister in the Prodi government , publicly defended the decrees against Sinti and Roma passed in November 2007 .
In order to take part in the government , Communist Refoundation supported a host of shameful measures implemented by the Prodi cabinet , including an austerity program aimed at rescuing the state budget , military missions in Afghanistan and Lebanon , the expansion of the American military basis at Vicenza , and increases to the country ’s defence budget .
Communist Refoundation agreed to every measure — reeling out its standard argument that supporting Prodi was the only way to prevent Berlusconi from returning to power .
The cost of all of these measures was footed by the working population .
This consequence of this policy was a historical debacle for the Prodi regime and Communist Refoundation .
In elections held in the spring of 2008 , Communist Refoundation lost over two and a half million votes and all of its seats in parliament .
The path was then clear for a return to power by the alliance of right - wing parties led by Silvio Berlusconi .
The measures of the Berlusconi government are directed not only against immigrants , but also against poor Italians .
This is made clear by an auxiliary motion regarding measures to “ combat poverty ” put forward by the Northern League , which is also part of Berlusconi ’s coalition .
The Northern League submitted a proposal whereby the basic social security supplement ( INPS ) of 400 euros given to all poor people be paid in the future only to those who have worked at least ten years in Italy and paid social security contributions .
The purpose of this measure is to exclude payment to immigrants .
When it was revealed that the proposal by the Northern League would also affect up to 800,000 pensioners , housewives , elderly monks and nuns and other Italian citizens , the press responded by declaring the suggestion was merely an embarrassing mistake .
In fact it reveals the class character of the government ’s policies , which are directed in the first place against defenceless layers of the population who lack any lobby , but also serve as preparation for a frontal attack against the entire working population .
The government can offer no solution to the problems that really affect the population : rising prices , pensioner poverty , youth unemployment , insecure living conditions , the garbage crisis , etc .
Contrary to the fulsome promises made by Berlusconi in his election campaign , the economic situation of the country has only worsened dramatically .
The country is on the brink of stagflation , or a combination of economic stagnation and inflation .
The Italian central bank has cut its economic growth prognosis for 2008 and 2009 to 0.4 percent , or virtually zero growth .
At the same time , July ’s inflation rate ( 4.1 percent ) was the highest in 12 years .
Average incomes in Italy are already 20 percent below the average of the industrialised countries of the OECD .
Under these conditions , refugees and immigrants , who are harshly exploited as domestic servants , caregivers for the elderly or seasonal crop pickers , have been selected as scapegoats in order to divert attention away from growing social polarisation .
The government , with its Mafia - style methods , unconditionally defends the interests of the country ’s super rich , first and foremost Italy ’s richest man : Silvio Berlusconi .
Through the passing of a custom - made immunity law the “ Cavaliere ” has even insured his impunity from the courts .
At the same time , the government is wracked by internal divisions : the separatist Northern League is striving for the independence of the economically stronger north at the expense of the country ’s poorer southern regions .
Meanwhile the National Alliance , which , as successor party to the fascist MSI , has its most powerful base of support in the south , defends the national central state .
The political crisis has also been exacerbated by the international financial crisis and high energy prices .
The move to introduce police state measures is an expression of these growing social and political tensions .
The means employed by the Berlusconi government to deal with refugees and immigrants must be seen as a warning to the whole working class .
By deploying troops for domestic purposes and drawing up a “ gypsy file ” based on a law similar to one passed by Mussolini ’s dictatorship in 1941 , the government is evoking the spirit of the country ’s fascist past while mounting an assault on the basic social and democratic rights of the entire working class .
It ’s the Hasids vs. the hotties in a Brooklyn bike war .
Leaders of South Wil liamsburg ’s Hasidic community said yesterday that bike lanes that bring scantily clad cyclists – especially sexy women – peddling through their neighborhood are definitely not kosher .
The red - faced religious sect is calling on city officials to eliminate the car - free lanes on Wythe and Bedford avenues , and to delay construction of a new one planned for Kent Avenue .
“ I have to admit , it ’s a major issue , women passing through here in that dress code , ” Simon Weisser , a member of Community Board 1 in Williamsburg - Greenpoint , told The Post .
“ It bothers me , and it bothers a lot of people . ”
The existing , one - way lanes are popular with North Williamsburg hipsters – many who ride in shorts or skirts .
The temporary lane planned for Kent Avenue would be a precursor to a 14 - mile greenway stretching from Newtown Creek in Greenpoint to Sunset Park .
Hasids are forbidden from looking at members of the opposite sex who are n’t fully dressed , said local activist Isaac Abraham .
Weisser and other Hasids said during a Sept. 8 community - board meeting that the lanes on Bedford and Wythe avenues should be eliminated if the neighborhood has to accept being part of the greenway .
The issue of dress – or lack of it – was n’t brought up at the meeting .
Weisser and the other Hasids instead complained publicly about bike lanes allegedly causing parking problems and traffic congestion .
Abraham later said another major concern is the safety of children , noting that cyclists “ are n’t obeying traffic laws .
Green lights and red lights are the same . ”
Hasids last month complained about a sexy billboard promoting the teen drama “ 90210 ” that could be seen from the Brooklyn - Queens Expressway and that featured swimwear - clad characters .
A few years back , some residents complained about billboards for “ Sex and the City . ”

The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund has signed on as a special consultant to the defense of Chistopher Handley , an Iowa collector who faces up to 20 years in prison for possession of manga .
The Fund adds its First Amendment expertise to the case , managed by United Defense Group 's Eric Chase , and will also be providing monetary support towards obtaining expert witnesses .
Handley , 38 , faces penalties under the PROTECT Act ( 18 U.S.C. Section 1466A ) for allegedly possessing manga that the government claims to be obscene .
The government alleges that the material includes drawings that they claim appear to be depictions of minors engaging in sexual conduct .
No photographic content is at issue in Handley 's case .
" Handley 's case is deeply troubling , because the government is prosecuting a private collector for possession of art , " says CBLDF Executive Director Charles Brownstein .
" In the past , CBLDF has had to defend the First Amendment rights of retailers and artists , but never before have we experienced the Federal Government attempting to strip a citizen of his freedom because he owned comic books .
We will bring our best resources to bear in aiding Mr. Handley 's counsel as they defend his freedom and the First Amendment rights of every art - loving citizen in this country . "
Mr. Handley 's case began in May 2006 when he received an express mail package from Japan that contained seven Japanese comic books .
That package was intercepted by the Postal Inspector , who applied for a search warrant after determining that the package contained cartoon images of objectionable content .
Unaware that his materials were searched , Handley drove away from the post office and was followed by various law enforcement officers , who pulled him over and followed him to his home .
Once there , agents from the Postal Inspector 's office , Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency , Special Agents from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation , and officers from the Glenwood Police Department seized Handley 's collection of over 1,200 manga books or publications ; and hundreds of DVDs , VHS tapes , laser disks ; seven computers , and other documents .
Though Handley 's collection was comprised of hundreds of comics covering a wide spectrum of manga , the governmen !
t is prosecuting images appearing in a small handful .
Putting the case into context , Burton Joseph , CBLDF 's Legal Counsel says , " In the lengthy time in which I have represented CBLDF and its clients , I have never encountered a situation where criminal prosecution was brought against a private consumer for possession of material for personal use in his own home .
This prosecution has profound implications in limiting the First Amendment for art and artists , and comics in particular , that are on the cutting edge of creativity .
It misunderstands the nature of avant - garde art in its historical perspective and is a perversion of anti-obscenity laws . "
Eric Chase and his team at the United Defense Group have been vigorously defending Handley , and scored a major First Amendment victory earlier this year when the judge found portions of the PROTECT
Act unconstitutional in his ruling on a motion to dismiss .
District Judge Gritzner of the Southern District of Iowa found that subsections 1466 ( a ) ( 2 ) and ( b ) ( 2 ) of 18 U.S.C. 1466A unconstitutional .
Those sections make it a crime to knowingly produce , distribute , receive , or possess with intent to distribute , " a visual depiction of any kind , including a drawing , cartoon , sculpture , or painting , " that " is , or appears to be " a minor engaged in sexual conduct .
Judge Gritzner found that those sections restrict protected speech and are constitutionally infirm .
Handley now faces charges under the surviving sections of 1466A , which will require a jury to determine whether the drawings at issue are legally obscene .
The material cannot be deemed obscene unless it meets all three of the criteria of the Miller test for obscenity : " ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest ; ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . "
The jury must answer all three questions in the affirmative in order to convict .
Eric
Chase recognized the importance of the case , and of the CBLDF 's contribution to it , in a statement to the CBLDF : " This case represents the latest in a string of efforts by the Department of Justice to encroach on free speech .
The United Defense Group is committed to fighting to maintain the protections guaranteed in the Constitution , and we appreciate the CBLDF 's support in this fight . "

Sold into slavery at the age of 12 , Hadijatou Mani says she was forced to labour for her master and his family for 10 years .
She quickly became one of several sexual slaves , or " sadakas " and was made to bear her master 's children .
She was subjected to regular beatings .
Now the former slave from Niger has won a landmark case against her government , which a regional West African court found had failed to protect her .
The court has ordered the government to pay her 10 m CFA francs ( £ 12,430 ; $ 19,750 ) in compensation .
" I will be able to build a house , raise animals and farm land to support my family .
I will also be able to send my children to school so they can have the education I was never allowed as a slave , " Ms Mani said afterwards .
The ruling could have broad implications for countries nearby where slavery is still practised , including Mauritania , Burkina Faso and Mali , according to observers .
Human rights organisations say more than 40,000 people are still in slavery in Niger , though the government says this figure is exaggerated .
Most live in conditions little changed over centuries , forced to look after animals or domestic work such as cooking and cleaning without pay .
Born into an established slave caste , they inherit a status from their mothers that it is almost impossible to shake off .
Romana Cacchioli , Africa Programme Coordinator for Anti-Slavery International , says this form of slavery began centuries ago when North African Berbers and Arabs raided the settlements of black Africans to the south and enslaved them .
Bigamy
Hadijatou Mani's case was different - she was sold by her Berber , Tuareg family to a master from the Hausa community .
She says he bought her for the equivalent of about $ 500 ( £ 315 ) .
" My master has four wives .
We , the slaves , were doing all the housework like cooking , fetching water and firewood and working on farms , " she told the BBC .
" I was beaten so many times I would run to my family .
Then , after a day or two , I would be brought back . "
But one day she heard that Niger had banned slavery , a decision that was announced in 2003 .
" One of the anti-slavery activists from the Timidria association went to see the local chief who summoned my master .
" He was told that slavery had now been abolished , that he had to free his seven slaves , but he denied having seven slaves - he said he had only three , including myself .
" They told him if he loved us and we agreed , he could marry us .
Otherwise he should just let us go .
When he came back home he did n't tell us what happened , he just took us to another location so that we could not hear the news .
" After a while we came back , and that was when I heard that slavery no longer exists .
I decided not to go back to my master but he kept going to the court saying that I am his wife . "
In 2005 , her master freed her and gave her a " liberation certificate " , reports Anti-Slavery International , which helped her bring the case .
But when she left him and tried to marry another man , her " master " said they were married .
A local court found in favour of Ms Mani and she went ahead with her new wedding .
But this was then overturned on appeal and she was sentenced to six months in prison for bigamy .
She took her case to the Court of Justice of the West African regional body Ecowas earlier this year .
Ms Mani accused the government of Niger of failing to protect her from slavery , which was criminalised five years ago .
" I was wrongly jailed , not because of anything I did but because of slavery , and today there is no more slavery so I wanted the court to vindicate me , to give my rights which I was denied some four years ago , to compensate me , " she said .
' Charm - offensive '
Ilguilas Weila , head of the local human rights group Timidria , said the situation in Niger had barely changed since the country announced that it was banning slavery .
" There has been a lack of political will , " he said .
" The law was only passed for Westerners .
It was a charm - offensive aimed at those who were asking why slavery had not been made illegal . "
Slaves are kept in humiliating and degrading conditions , he said .
They can be beaten , sold , or given away as wedding presents .
" They wake up before their masters , and they are the last to go to sleep .
During the day , the men look after the animals , the women collect water feed the family and gather wood . "
" Almost the whole of the slave 's day is spent working for their master . "
Mr Weila said his group had estimated that in 2002 about 8 % of the population in six of Niger 's eight regions were living in slavery .
Ms Cacchioli says Anti-Slavery International has helped free about 80 women in Niger over the past five years .
She says that leaving their master is more difficult for women , as this also means abandoning any children she has had with him .
And the deeply - rooted practice has persisted in some neighbouring countries .
Ms Cacchioli says there are no reliable figures for the number of slaves in Mali .
Mauritania has also officially abolished slavery , but Anti-Slavery International says 18 % of the population are estimated to be slaves .
The government there strongly disputes these figures .
Officials and some ordinary Mauritanians argue that it is difficult to define who is a slave - few records are kept , unlike during the trans -Atlantic slave trade .
They point out that abolishing slavery - and its scars - is not straightforward .
The practise is most widespread in remote , rural areas .
Few have been to school and so they not be aware that slavery has been abolished .
And if they do manage to leave their masters , without training and land , they could just add to the ranks of the unemployed in the cities .
The derangement has taken hold .
It has spread from McCain to his running mate and to senior staff .
McCain is actually campaigning in Iowa .
Yes , Iowa !
Where he only lags by 15 points , and it is 8 days to the election !.
The other state of delusion is PA , where McCain is behind by 13 points .
PA has the added benefit of being an expensive media market , draining what is left of the GOP money .
Why not accept reality and do what he can to salvage some Republican Senate seats ?
That is what Dole did in 1996 .
Why piss off the base by attacking Bush on the GOP party organ , the Washington Times ?
There is losing and there is taking down all your allies down with you .
Is this McCain 's final act of maverickyness ?
Is he getting even for all the insults , all the profanity , directed at him by the GOP stalwarts over the years ?
McCain is a proud man , never to forget a slight .
He bears the scars of fighting his own party , as he says himself .
This is McCain 's revenge .
If he can't win this one , he is taking them all down with him .
LONDON —
The novelist John le Carré was recalling an encounter from a decade or so ago , as the cold war was receding into history , giving way to a new system of shadowy threats and uneasy alliances .
Sir David Spedding , ill and retiring as head of the Secret Intelligence Service , or M.I. 6 , had come to visit him at his house in Cornwall , and they were talking about the changed realities of spying .
“ He told me , ‘ You ca n’t imagine how disgusting our world has become , ’ ” Mr. le Carré said .
“ And I accept that .
It is a disgusting world . ”
At 76 , Mr. le Carré is snowy - haired , droll and courtly , speaking in perfect paragraphs and exuding the air of quiet privilege and distinguished manner of a retired statesman .
If he chose to , he could still be producing crowd - pleasing books about his most famous spy , George Smiley , late of M.I. 6 , or easing into a gracious old age of playing with his grandchildren , lunching at his club and resting on his laurels .
But he is still sharp , still fizzing with ideas , and fueled by a new righteous fury .
He has become , if not exactly radicalized , then at least clearer about his political views and more willing to articulate them .
His latest book , “ A Most Wanted Man ” ( Scribner ) , speaks to one of his preoccupations : the excesses , as Mr. le Carré sees it , of American foreign policy and the immoral nature of the intelligence practices that underpin it .
The message in the book , his 21st , is embedded , as always , in an absorbing tale : of spies and maybe - spies , of divided loyalties , of corrupted innocence .
The title character is a young Muslim refugee named Issa , who suddenly and illegally surfaces in Hamburg and falls under the care of an idealistic young female lawyer .
But then he becomes the object of a nasty and ill - conceived tug of war among feuding factions of several Western intelligence agencies , which cannot agree on whether he is a broken man or a dangerous terrorist , or perhaps a bit of both .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney , who has a history of heart problems , was treated with an electric shock on Wednesday to resolve an abnormal heartbeat -- the second time in less than a year .
Cheney returned to his official residence and resumed his normal schedule after the procedure , said his spokeswoman Megan Mitchell .
“ An electrical impulse was delivered to restore the heart to normal rhythm , ” Mitchell said .
“ The procedure went smoothly and without complication . ”
Cheney , 67 , attended President George W. Bush ’s morning daily security briefings and stayed at the White House working until being treated at George Washington University Hospital , a visit that lasted just under two hours .
Because of the heart problem , Cheney canceled a campaign appearance in Illinois for a Republican congressional candidate but called into a reception to express his support , his spokeswoman said .
Cheney , one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history , had a similar heart problem in November and received an electric shock to restore a normal rhythm .
In July , he had his yearly routine physical examination and doctors gave him the all - clear .
Cheney has had four heart attacks , quadruple bypass surgery , two artery - clearing angioplasties and a procedure to implant a defibrillator .
He had his most recent heart attack shortly after the 2000 election but it was considered mild .
The vice president had the defibrillator implanted in his chest in 2001 to help regulate his heartbeat .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Bush told reporters while traveling in Michigan that he was confident Cheney would be fine .
He said the vice president told him he was undergoing the procedure .
“ He was confident , the doctors are confident , therefore I ’m confident , ” Bush said .
Cheney ’s latest problem was atrial fibrillation , in which the two upper chambers of the heart beat quickly and irregularly .
Because blood is not pumped completely from the heart ’s upper chambers , it can pool and clot , raising the risk of a stroke .
About 15 percent of strokes occur in people with atrial fibrillation , according to the American Heart Association .
Some 2.2 million Americans have this type of abnormal heart rhythm .
U.S. Installs 1,400 Megawatts of Wind Energy in 3rd Quarter – Heading for Another Record Year
November 4th , 2008 by Tom Schueneman
The American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) recently released their 3rd quarter market report showing the addition last quarter of another 1,389 megawatts of installed wind energy , bringing the total capacity in completed wind projects for 2008 to 4,204 MW .
With more wind projects under construction 2008 is expected to be another record year , reaching an estimated total of 7,500 MW ( enough to power about 2.2 million homes ) , surpassing the 2007 record of 5,249 MW installed .
In other good news , and in spite of a crumbling economy , the report shows an increasing manufacturing base for wind projects in the United States , with eight new wind turbine component plants opened , the expansion of nine facilities , and the announcement of 19 additional plants in the works .
As a result of this aggressive investment in manufacturing , AWEA reports that 9,000 new jobs have been added and the share of domestically made components has risen from 30 % in 2005 to 50 % today .
Slower growth for 2009
With 8,000 MW of new capacity under construction and scheduled for completion this year or next , industry growth is expected to remain strong .
Even so , the consecutive years of record growth is not expected to continue in 2009 , due to the late extension of renewable energy tax credits and the evolving economic crisis .
AWEA stresses the importance that the new administration places in promoting a long - term , stable policy for renewable energy development is crucial for stimulating job growth and addressing the country ’s economic and energy challenges .
The full 20 - page report from the American Wind Energy Association is available online ( pdf ) .

A few weeks ago , researchers announced the discovery of a “ dark flow ” of invisible matter tugging at distant galaxy clusters at the edge of the universe .
Now comes more evidence of unseen and unknown forces in the cosmos , but this time its closer to home .
A group of researchers have discovered that our particular part of the Universe — out to a distance of 400 million light years — is not expanding uniformly in all directions as expected .
To be exact , the expansion is faster in one half of the sky than in the other .
“ It ’s as if , in addition to the expansion , our ‘ neighbourhood ’ in the Universe has an extra kick in a certain direction , ” says Mike Hudson from the University of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada .
“ We expected the expansion to become more uniform on increasingly larger scales , but that ’s not what we found . ”
If confirmed , their findings will result in a new understanding of the origin of structure in the universe and possible revisions to the standard cosmological model .
Hudson and two other scientists have been conducting research on large - scale cosmic flows and the general expansion of the universe .
This expansion increases the distances between galaxies steadily with time , and is called the Hubble flow .
Deviations of the velocity of galaxies from the overall Hubble flow is called the “ peculiar velocity . ”
By examining the peculiar velocities of clusters and superclusters scientists can obtain estimates of local mass concentrations that may be responsible for causing any deviations from the Hubble flow .
In particular , these researchers were attempting to address a longstanding question about the origin of the approximately 600 km /s peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies , with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background .
Using several different surveys they discovered that about 50 % of the Local Group ’s motion is faster than anticipated .
To produce this motion , they believe there must be large unseen and unknown structures in the universe .
They write , “ The large value of the residual motion implies that there are significant velocities generated by very - large scale structures , ” and the structures lie beyond the Local Group .
Brian McNamara , a University Research Chair in UW ’s department of physics and astronomy , says Hudson is finding that much of the matter in the nearby universe moves as an ensemble with a surprisingly high speed .
“ If the work he and others are doing is confirmed , it will require a major revision in the way we think the universe came into being and how it evolved . ”
Hudson and his colleagues have submitted a paper to the Royal Astronomical Society , and a preprint version is available here .

Purposely and conveniently back logged by the present administration .
These machines gave them the 2004 election ... they need them in the 2008 upcoming election to stay in power .
Flaws in voting machines used by millions of people will not be fixed in time for the presidential election because of a government backlog in testing the machines ’ hardware and software , officials say .

2004 OHIO ELECTION FRAUD FIX IS IN ?
Brad , perhaps I missed it but why is there no mention of the following report at Brad Blog ?
Ohio Secretary of State Opposes Opening Lawsuit Alleging Theft of 2004 Election
As I pointed out to you in the " Who Is My Connnell thread " ...
https://bradblog.com/?p=6220
... Arnebeck 's interviews with you on the Collins show as well as his interview at Vote Rescue ( see that thread for links ) , showed that he was backing away from prior statements that the Ohio AG and Secretary of State Brunner were interested in criminally investigating 2004 Ohio Election fraud .
You disagreed .
Brad , look at the actual Motion to lift the stay , here is what Arnebeck said :
" Upon being advised in regard to the limited resources of the criminal division of the Ohio Attorney General 's Office , and its preference that their be involvement begin at the point where specific targets for indictment had been identified ... "
The interview Arnebeck gave and the press conference which was held subsequent to the motion being filed all made it seem as if the Ohio officials were interested in seeing Arnebeck do further discovery , but TOMORROW , according to the E Pluribus Media story quoted above , the Ohio officials are going to ask that Arnebeck 's motion to lift the stay be denied :
Taking plaintiff attorney ’s argument that they can resume activity in the case without disrupting the important work of state elections officials , Brunner disagreed .
In his motion to oppose , Conglianese wrote : “ She has limited personnel who are charged with elections administration .
These individuals have already worked with her on issuing 60 new directives for 2008 .
They are busily working on others which will be issued before the November general election .
Their attention is best served working on this instead of aiding defense counsel on charges concerning the 2004 election .
Likewise , the Secretary ’s statutory counsel , the Ohio Attorney General , also has limited resources .
Counsel for Secretary Brunner have been busy representing their client in this Court as well as others in Franklin County .
Their attention is also best served dealing with issues concerning the 2008 election and other matters of importance to the Secretary . ”
In closing , Coglianese said plaintiffs have “ simply failed to address why it is necessary to begin litigation at this point instead of waiting three months . ”
THE FIX IS IN
Here 's the legal deal in full technicolor for anybody paying any attention today .
ARNEBECK'S SUIT WILL FAIL AS TO STANDING OF THE PLAINTIFFS IF IT DOES NOT PROCEEED TO JUDGMENT BEFORE THE 2008 ELECTION .
First , CIVIL RICO will NOT work in this case .
I am really shocked that as a lawyer , Arnebeck and company have n't figured that out yet .
Civil Rico cases can NOT be brought UNLESS there is an injury to BUSINESS or PROPERTY .
For a a very thorough discussion about Civil Rico please see the book CIVIL RICO by Gregory P. Jospeh
This case was a civil rights case and will not survive a Motion for Summary judgment as to Civil Rico .
Civil Rico is a civil case and it does not allow a civil attorney to prosecute a criminal violation as some are making it appear .
CIVIL RICO is dead here .
You must remember that a law suit requires standing .
The 2006 election doesnt effect standing because plaintiffs here brought suit as to the 2004 " presidential election " ...
The only relief available to plaintiffs is Court ordered relief which protects the plaintiffs from similar civil rights abuses in the 2008 Presidential Election .
ONCE THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS OVER ALL STANDING WILL BE GONE ...
The same exact computer voting conditions exist today as they did in the 2004 election .
It 's those conditions plaintiffs are concerned with ... they need to be assured their rights will not be violated again .
The same players are running this election and no amount of vigilance form the Ohio AG will stop computer patches form switching votes if that is what happened in 2004 .
ARNEBECK MUST REQUEST A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER FORM JUDGE MARBLEY WHICH HALTS THE USE OF THESE VOTIING SYSTEMS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE HE MUST SEEK A TRO FOR THE 2008 ELECTION AS TO OHIO'S PARTICIPATION .
Once the election is over plainitffs will have no standing to sue .
Especially if Obama wins .
Also , Arnebeck must make a motion for Judge Marbley to hold those who didnt protect ballots in CONTEMPT because the Ohio AG and SOS are NOT cooperating .
They know that plaintiffs will lose standing after this election .
TOMORROW THE OHIO AG FILES HIS MOTION TO DENY THE STAY ... where is the reporting on all of this ?
There 's nothing about the Ohio AG requestion Arnebeck 's stay be denied at the Velvet Revolution site either .
People really need to understand that the Spoon is scaring the shit out of the RNC cabal .
There was a raid on Ohio Government officials by the FBI just after this .
Now the Ohio AG and Brunner are backing away from Arnebeck .
That FBI raid invovolved a case of " public corruption " and that 's all we know .
What the hell is going on here ?
The Spoon is trying to do the right thing and he 's the right man for the job .
But without court ordered discovery nothing is going to be resolved .
Arnebeck can request that Judge Marbley compel testimony as to evidence tampering in this case .
The Judge might have authority to issue an injunction demanding that the Ohio AG and SOS use their powers to investigate evidence tampering in this case .
It looks like Connell got protection by the Feds assuring him this would never come to a criminal investigation .
There are many ways justice can be compelled but so far Arnebeck is n't looking at the best options .
CIVIL RICO IS A DEAD DOG WHICH CANNOT BE USED HERE

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - YouTube , the largest video - sharing website , will show full - length television shows and films from Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer ’s archives in its latest step to boost advertising revenue by adding professional programing , the company told Reuters on Sunday .
The site , owned by Google Inc , plans to make the announcement about the new partnership on Monday .
MGM Studios will kick off the partnership by posting episodes of its decade - old “ American Gladiators ” program to YouTube on one channel .
On another channel , MGM will post full - length action films like “ Bulletproof Monk ” and “ The Magnificent Seven ” and clips from popular movies like “ Legally Blonde . ”
These will be free to watch , with ads running alongside the video .
YouTube in October forged a similar partnership with CBS Corp to run full - length archived shows , including “ Star Trek , ” “ Young and the Restless ” and “ Beverly Hills 90210 . ”
Many TV networks already run short clips on YouTube , which also offers millions of home videos uploaded by users .
But until now , YouTube videos were predominantly short clips of ten minutes or less .
The company has been experimenting with full - length shows for some months with Time Warner Inc ’s HBO and CBS ’s Showtime cable networks .
The new partnerships put YouTube in more direct competition with Hulu , the online video site owned by News Corp and General Electric ’s NBC Universal .
Hulu features up - to - date full - length shows from News Corp ’s Fox networks , NBC and CBS .
It also has a YouTube channel which features short - clip versions of its shows .

Blackwater Machine Gun Found in Raid on Iraqi Insurgents
The incident was kept secret and raises more questions about the security firm .
October 2 , 2008  --
An M4 machine gun sent to Iraq by the Blackwater private security firm somehow disappeared from the company 's storage facility in Baghdad and was later discovered during a US military operation , apparently against suspected insurgents , people familiar with the situation have told ABC News .
The incident , in 2006 , has been kept secret until now but it raised more questions about Blackwater 's operations in Iraq .
Allegations that Blackwater shipped weapons and silencers to Iraq without proper licensing are already under investigation by a federal grand jury in North Carolina , according to people familiar with the case .
Blackwater says all of its weapons " are shipped in accordance with U.S. export control regulations . "
A separate federal grand jury in Washington , D.C. is investigating a shooting incident involving Blackwater guards that led to the deaths of 17 civilians .
Indictments in that case could come as soon as next week , officials say .
Blackwater says it is cooperating with the grand jury investigation and has said that its guards acted in self - defense during the incident .
The State Department renewed Blackwater 's one - billion dollar private security contract earlier this year , despite the grand jury investigations .
In the case of the missing machine gun , Army investigators said the " Bushmaster M4 " was discovered in March 2006 by US troops during an unspecified military operation .
Blackwater apparently had no idea the machine gun had gone missing and possibly ended up in the hands of insurgents fighting US troops , according to documents reviewed by ABC News .
In a statement , Blackwater said " equipment has been stolen by insurgents " in some instances , but that " every loss has been reported to the relevant U.S. authorities . "
But that was not the case with the M4 , according to internal documents .
Blackwater 's inventory records showed no transfer of the weapon after it arrived in Baghdad , and it was listed as still in the weapons pool .
US soldiers reportedly found the weapon was in surprisingly good condition when it was recovered .
Criminal investigators for the US Army turned the weapon over to Blackwater .
A spokesman for the Army CID said no further investigation was conducted as to whether the weapon had been stolen or sold on the black market by someone with access to the Blackwater facility .
The Bushmaster , according to the company 's website , is one of the " world 's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models . "
It is outfitted with a flash suppressor and , in military models , can fire three round bursts or fully automatic .

Strong opposition to the candidacy of Barack Obama in Arkansas may have helped conservatives pass a measure blocking the adoption of children by unmarried couples .
The measure , which voters overwhelmingly approved Tuesday and which prevents unmarried cohabitating couples from adopting or fostering children , won strong support from conservatives , exit polls found .
The ban affects all unmarried couples but was written with the intent of preventing gay couples from raising children in Arkansas .
Unlike most states , Arkansas shifted to the right politically in this election .
Senator John McCain won the state by 20 points compared with President Bush ’s nine - point victory in 2004 .
“ I think white Arkansas Democrats felt cross-pressured in this race , ” said Jay Barth , a political science professor at Hendrix College , in Conway , Ark .
“ They did n’t want to vote for what they viewed as Bush ’s third term , but they also could n’t bring themselves to vote for Barack Obama .
Voters across the country had difficulties casting their ballots in the federal election Tuesday .
According to an Elections Canada official , many people were unaware of a new rule that requires voters to present either one piece of identification showing their name and address or two pieces of ID , each of which shows their name and at least one of which shows their address .
Elections Canada official Dana Doiron said people have been turning up with passports or other pieces of ID that do not contain an address .
He said that in most cases , voters eventually got the proper paperwork or they were vouched for by someone else .
( In lieu of proper ID , an elector can take an oath and be vouched for by another elector whose name is on the list of electors for the same polling division and who has the necessary ID . )
But voters across the country — from Nova Scotia to the Northwest Territories — have still been reporting problems .
At Dalhousie University in Halifax , almost two - thirds of the students showing up to cast ballots on campus were turned away because they did n't have the necessary signed form from their university residence stating their address or were off - campus students , said Mark Coffin , vice - president of education on the Dalhousie student council .
The form is the only way for some students to prove they live in the area , as many of them have IDs with an address from another region .
He said he feared students who were turned away did n't go back to vote .
" You know , 1.4 million young Canadians did n't vote in the last election , " Coffin said .
" Well , these new rules are n't making it any easier for students to vote . "
In Vancouver , polling station representative Pendra Wilson said she saw several voters turned away after they arrived without proper identification .
" I think every Canadian should be able to vote , " Wilson told CBC News .
" It made me sick to see so many conscientious Canadians not allowed to vote today . "
People turned away in North
In the Yukon and Northwest Territories , election officials told CBC News Tuesday that they have had some problems with the new rules regarding proof of identity .
" The new rules regarding addresses and address changes have created some difficulty with some electors , " said Seann Springfield , a supervisor at a Whitehorse polling station .
" Some people have been turned away . "
Whitehorse resident Angel Hall said she was turned away because the identification she brought was not sufficient .
Being turned away upset Hall , who said she works with young aboriginal people and had been trying to encourage people to vote .
" I was … really rallying people to come vote . …
People who are , like , the toughest demographic to get to come out and vote , " she said .
" I had to come back and say , ' I can't vote ! ' "
The new rule was passed by Parliament last year but was highlighted in a $ 9.3 million advertising blitz during the 37 - day election campaign .
Doiron said Elections Canada got a sense of how widespread the lack of awareness was at the advance polls when people failed to show up with the proper ID .
Other problems emerge at polls
Voters across Canada reported other problems at the polls as well .
In Wild Rose riding in Alberta , Janice Tanton said she was turned away from her local polling station when she arrived at 7:25 p.m. local time .
" They were n't going to let us in , and I raised my voice that it was n't 7:30 yet , and how were working families supposed to be able to exercise their right to vote in this country , " Tanton wrote in an email to CBCNews.ca .
" She let us in . "
In Montreal , Beth Blackmore told CBCNews.ca that wait times were a major issue , saying she had to wait more than an hour to cast her vote in her riding of Outremont .
In Vanderhoof , B.C. , Patricia Crosby said that confusion over the hours of her polling situation prevented her from voting .
She told CBC News that she struggled to find a convenient polling station after she received a notice notifying her that the hours at her own local poll had changed .
" A country like Canada who send representatives to far - off lands to ensure foreigners ' right to free elections would do well to safeguard their own country , " Crosby wrote .
Last night I was reading another article in the New York Times about the economic chaos going on in the world .
I could feel myself getting anxious , and depressed .
I do what I often do when I feel myself going into a funk – I called a friend .
Iâ€™m lucky to have some amazing friends .
She reminded me that my life purpose is helping people and that this is what I should be focusing on .
Anything that causes anxiety might not be a good thing to continue doing .
Thereâ€™s not much I , or most of you , can do about whatâ€™s going on in the world .
I want to encourage you to spend time in silence and with loved ones .
Itâ€™s a great time to remind each other of whatâ€™s really important .
Stay away from people , places and things that cause you turmoil .
The news right now is breeding fear .
The truth is that your life is probably a lot like mine .
I have money in the stock market and I chose to leave it there .
Thatâ€™s the only decision I really have to make – get in or get out .
Once thatâ€™s done , my life is pretty much the same this week as it was weeks ago .
The financial markets are in chaos , but our economy hasnâ€™t really changed much .
That is an important distinction .
You can consider this a horrible thing , or you can look at it as an opportunity .
This is a time for us to focus on the way we want our lives to play out .
Iâ€™m part of an incredible community .
We take care of one another .
Reach out to your community .
I was at a meeting on Sunday about the unraveling thatâ€™s happening .
There was a woman there who was beaming as she spoke about whatâ€™s happening .
Someone commented on how , when a hurricane happens , the eye of the storm is amazingly still .
How can you maintain that sense of equanimity and peace amidst the chaos ?
This is an opportunity to stand for what really matters to you .
Living in fear has big consequences to our physical and mental health .
We are the change we yearn for .
For me , it includes supporting local merchants and farms , maybe even growing your own herbs , fruits and vegetables .
If you do believe things are going to get worse , stock up .
The local markets usually only have food for 72 hours worth of shopping – and thatâ€™s when thereâ€™s not a panic .
So , having canned foods , preferably organic , and water stocked up is a great idea .
I canâ€™t tell if the government knows something we donâ€™t , or if they are trying to stir up more fear , but there was a commercial on the radio last night talking about stocking up on food for an emergency .

Haul out the anti-' Happy Holidays ' holly
by Jeremy Hooper
Is it just us , or does the " War on Christmas " season begin earlier and earlier every year ?
Whoa , it does n't even feel like time to put out " Halloween is an evil pagan celebration " decorations yet , and yet they 're already talking about focusing the December holidays solely on one faith ?
Geez , AFA -- at this rate you 'll be burning up ( just like the Hannukah candle that many American consumers light each December ) before we even reach Thanksgiving dinner !
The same Thanksgiving , incidentally , from which countless gay people will be disinvited , thanks to the propagation of anti-gay rhetoric by groups like your own .
The holidays are such a magically contentious time !
“ It ’s OK to say Merry Christmas ” [ AFA ]
Your thoughts
Christians can also take a stand and proclaim to their communities that saying " happy holidays " or " seasons greetings " is not a slam on them or a threat to Christ .
It is rather a way to give good wishes in a manner that is considerate to all people .
Something I am sure Christ gives his full approval to .
Posted by : Steve - Geneva , IL | Oct 15 , 2008 7:44:01 PM
Christians have no sense of history , or more properly , they have a grand tradition of rewriting history to suit themselves .
They blatantly lie when they suggest that the merry band of Diests who founded this country were all Christians .
As much as they would like to believe that they were all Baptists , they were n't .
The modern evangelical movement started about 125 years ago , and the very earliest break from the Catholic Church by the Lutherans was n't until the late 16th century .
And , those Pilgrims !
They landed on Plymouth Rock because they were running out of Beer !
They started growing crops specifically for the purpose of making more beer !
Everything that came after that is mostly incidental .
But , the Christians long tradition of rewriting history now ignores the fact that the earliest December 25 celebrations of Winter Solstice actually were dedicated to the Son of Isis ( goddess of Nature ) , and they even mirrored the current tradition of gluttonous eating and drinking with gift giving .
Christians usurped the winter solstice celebration and called it Christmas as a way to appeal to pagans by ensuring them that they would n't have to give up all of their traditions .
I think it is perfectly fitting that the rest of the world is now rightfully reclaiming the tradition and turning it back into a much more inclusive event .

Oh no !
I am in turmoil .
I find myself agreeing with these people !
I am not a Christian at all but I think Happy Christmas really no longer refers to the birth of Christ for many people but merely to a time of year .
So people who are actively offended by ' Happy Christmas ' should really get a life in my opinion .
Fine if you prefer to use something else instead but to make a big point about being offended if others use it ?
We have to accept that many ( most ? )
Western countries were founded on Christian beliefs , hence Happy Christmas .
I bet the people who are offended by Happy Christmas and happy Easter are not offended by the fact that they get time off work on those days .
I am now off to wash my brains out for having a thought in common with nutcases like this , even if the basis of my agreement has nothing to do with loving Christ .
Ugh !

Is there ANYTHING these people are n't paranoid over ?
Do they feel the holiday less belongs to them , if people are n't saying " Merry Christmas " ?
How 's about be happy whether somebody tells you " Happy Holidays " , " Merry Christmas " , " Feliz Navidad " , " Season 's Greetings " , or " Go Fuck Yourself with a Christmas Tree " - it 's all the same .
Posted by : Scott | Oct 16 , 2008 5:40:55 AM
I 'm convinced that this is a way to steer some of that holiday cash to the collection plates of fear - based charities .
There is no attack on Christmas .
Far from it .
Here 's an example .
Let 's say that a store long ago put up a sign that said " white women welcome ! "
And that over the years they rolled with changing minds and attitudes and now put up a sign that says " Everyone Welcome " .
Some white women might say , " I 'm a white woman , I want to be welcomed as a white woman ! "
They might even say " they 're trying to de- feminize their welcome ! "
And what many fundamentalists white women end up saying is " This is an attack on women !
If your company does n't want to welcome women , then we wo n't spend money there , you misogynistic bastards ! "
Now , just replace " white women welcome " with " Merry Christmas " and " white women " with Christians , and " Everyone Welcome " with " Happy Holidays " and you 'll see my point .
" Merry Christmas " is not an insult , and we all know that .
However between now and February we have Hannukah , Kwanzaa , Diwali , Winter Solstice , Samhain , Imbolic , Dong Zhi , Eid ul Adha , Sadeh , Saturnalia , New Years , Thanksgiving , and even Festivus .
" Happy Holidays " is not a sanitary way of saying " Merry Christmas " it 's a lazy way of saying " Whatever Holiday (s ) you celebrate , I hope it is ( they are ) happy . "
Even if you do n't know about all those special holidays , " Happy Holidays " stuff goes up around Thanksgiving and does n't come down until after New Years , so at the very least it covers those mainstream ones .
But like any nearsighted and anglo - centric person , they do n't know these other holidays exist , and the ones they do know about they do n't think anyone * really * celebrates them .
And those who do know about the other holiday are * sigh * mostly pissed off because they do n't get their white , straight , christian priveleges anymore .
" waaaaaah , I want things to stay the same , where mainstream society caters to me and validates me at every turn , telling me I 'm normal and part of the ruling class , WAAAAH "

I wonder what these religious extremists would do if they ever found out that Xmas is a Pagan Holiday .
Posted by : libhomo | Oct 16 , 2008 8:07:39 PM
For most of my life I 've lived within a couple of miles of a Baptist church , an Episcopal church , a Unitarian church , a mosque ( Beautiful architecture ! ) , two Buddhist temples and a handful of synagogues .
Sending neighbors holiday cards instead of Christmas cards is something people around here do without even thinking about it .
I guess if you live in a place where folks go to either the Baptist church on the west side of town or the Baptist church on the east side of town , saying anything other than " Merry Christmas " must seem hopelessly strange .
I can't even imagine living like that .
JasonD : Your assessment is a morsel of flawless sagacity .

What do you get when you cross a patio heater , a toy light saber and one of those machines that pops out numbered balls in a lottery draw ?
If you happen to be electronistical artist Jean - Michel Jarre , then you get this rather odd looking iPod dock / speaker combo .
The AeroSystem ( even the name is from the 1980s ) is currently available only in France , and costs € 450 ( $ 580 ) , complete with iPod - inspired remote control .
Jarre is on a mission to improve music .
Not the music he plays , but the music we listen to .
He thinks that our MP3 player and notebook computers sound terrible :
In recent years , there has been , particularly for music , a growing gap between the high quality hi-fi systems sophisticated and expensive audiophile speakers and often poor for laptops to listen to music as mp3 .
I am convinced that because of the remoteness of growing public support for some physical music ( and sometimes the image ) is because people have forgotten what the quality of reproduction should be .
How has he remedied this ?
By making yet another set of iPod speakers , ready to amplify the same crappy MP3 files he was just complaining about .
At least he 's not trying to get us to return to the Compact Disc .
This is , after all , the man whose music was made for the shiny silver platters , back when they were a sparkling glimpse into the future .

Use Creative Marketing to Increase Sales
Searching for new customers and having a difficult time finding them ?
Perhaps you ’re looking in the wrong place .
Increasing sales requires creative marketing and creative marketing requires thinking outside the box .
Business owners tend to reach for the tried and true when sales start going south , but they should look for creative and innovative ways to boost sales .
Change is the name of the game during an economic downturn .
“ Why , ” you ask ?
From your customers to your suppliers , your employees to your competitors , everyone is changing to meet the economic pressure of the downturn .
Creative marketing is easier said than done .
Creative marketing requires intestinal fortitude , you have to be willing to take calculated risks and , more importantly , you have to be willing to embrace change and innovation .
Think of the economic downturn as a time for correction , a time to create and innovate .
Ok , so you ’re looking for new customers , now what ?
Remember you have to think outside the box , be an innovator and not a procrastinator .
Some of the suggestions I am making may require you to move outside of your comfort zone .
But remember , staying in your comfort zone is not the goal ; increasing your sales is .
Expand Your Range of Products and Services
You are probably saying to yourself , “ I do n’t want to bring on any more employees with different skill sets to expand my services .
Nor do I want to tie up more dollars to diversify my product line . ”
Well , you have to do neither .
You have a customer base currently buying from you that buys complementary products and services elsewhere .
You can partner with another company to offer their complementary products or services to your customers and receive a percentage of the sale .
If you ’re a manufacturer and retailer of kitchen and bathroom cabinets , for example , you can develop an alliance with a ceramic tile and countertop retailer to sell each other ’s product as a complete package to the customer .
North American Bancard Agent
You may also have the product and the other company the distribution system .
I knew a small manufacturer that sewed private label merchandise for a much larger company .
In their downtime the small manufacturer begin manufacturing one size fits all sweat suites .
Rather than bring on a full sales force to go out and sell the sweat suites to retail buyers , they established a mutually beneficial agreement with hair salons to sell the sweat suites .
The manufactured had the product and the small hair salons the target customer to distribute the merchandise .
The manufacturer placed the goods in the salons at no cost to them and when the item sold , the manufacturer took the lion ’s share of the retail price .
Dancing with the Stars just got a lot uglier .
Julianne Hough says this season - which ended Tuesday night when her and partner Cody Linley were eliminated from the competition - was likely her last .
" I wo n't be on Dancing this spring season .
I do n't know about the fall .
Maybe , maybe not .
We 'll see , " Hough wrote on her blog .
" I 'm definitely going to focus on the music .
My first album was a learning experience , and I can't wait for the next one .
I feel like the writing and producing will be even better , really awesome . "
We know , guys .
We were hoping she 'd leave to focus on a career posing for Playboy , too .
Anarchy and Morality
Another paradox that anarchy brings into uncomfortable view is the contradiction between coercion and morality .
We all in general recognize and accept the principle that where there is no choice , there can be no morality .
If a man is told to commit some evil while he has a gun pressed to his head , we would have a hard time categorizing him as evil ' particularly compared to the man who is pressing the gun to his head .
If we accept the Aristotelian view that the purpose of life is happiness , and we accept the Socratic view that virtue brings happiness , then when we deny choice to people , we deny them the capacity for virtue , and thus for happiness .
There is great pleasure in helping others '
I would certainly argue that it is one of the greatest pleasures , outside of love itself , which encompasses it .
Helping others , though , is a highly complex business , which requires detailed personal attention , rigorous standards , a combination of encouragement , sternness , enthusiasm , sympathy and discipline ' to name just a few !
Using coercion to drive charity is like using kidnapping to create love .
Not only does the use of coercion through state programs deny choice to those wishing to help the poor ' and thus the joy of achievement , and the motivation of happiness ' but it corrupts and destroys the complex interchange required to elevate a human soul from its meager surroundings and its own low expectations .
If we believe that violence is a valid way to achieve moral ends ' of helping the poor , for instance ' then there are two other approaches which would be far more logically consistent than the forced theft and transfer of taxation .
If violence is the only valid way to create economic ' equality , ' then surely it would make far more sense to simply allow those below a certain level of income to steal the difference from others .
If we understand that state welfare agencies skim an enormous amount of money off the top ' they represent a truly savage expense ' then we can easily eliminate this overhead , and have a far more rational system besides , simply by eliminating the middleman and allowing the poor to steal from the middle and upper classes .
If the prospect of this solution fills you with horror , that is important to understand .
If you feel that this proposal would degenerate into armed gangs of the poor rampaging through wealthier neighborhoods , then you are really saying that the poor are poor because they lack restraint and judgment , and will pillage others and undermine the economic success and general security of society in order to satisfy their own immediate appetites , without thought for the future .
If this is the case ' if the poor really are such a shortsighted and savage band ' then it is clear that they do not have the judgment and self - control to vote in democratic elections ' which are essentially about the forcible transfer of income .
If the poor only care about satisfying their immediate appetites , without a care for the long term , then they should not be at all involved in the coercive redistribution of wealth in society as a whole .
Ah , but what if taking the right to vote away from the poor fills you with outrage ?
Very well , then we can assume that the poor are rational , and able and willing to defer gratification .
If a man is wise enough to vote on the use of force , then he is certainly wise enough to use that force himself .
Indeed , the barriers to using force personally are far higher than voting for the use of force in a democratic system .
If you have to pick up a gun and go and collect your just property from richer people , that is quite a high ' barrier to entry . '
If , on the other hand , you simply have to scribble on the ballot once every few years , and then sit back and wait for your check to arrive , surely that will drive the escalation of violence in society far more rapidly .
If you still feel that this solution would be disastrous , because the poor would act with bad judgment , then you face a related issue , which is the quality of the education that the poor have received .
Anarchy and Education
If the poor lack wisdom , knowledge and good judgment , but they have been educated by the government for almost 15 years straight , then surely if we believe that the poor can be educated , we must then blame the government for failing to educate them .
Since the poor cannot afford private schools , they must surrender their children to government schools , which have a complete and coercive monopoly over their education .
Now , either the poor have the capacity for wisdom and efficacy , or they do not .
If the poor do have the capacity for wisdom , then the government is fully culpable for failing to cultivate it through education .
If the poor do not have the capacity for wisdom , then the government is fully culpable for wasting massive resources in a futile attempt to educate them ' and also , they cannot justly be allowed to vote .
Again , although I know that this must be uncomfortable or annoying to read through , I am willing myself to refrain from providing the clear and moral anarchistic solutions to these seemingly intractable problems .
There is no point trying to give society a pill if society does not even think that it is sick .
If your appendix is inflamed , and I offer to remove it for you , you will doubtless cry out your gratitude .
If I run up to you on the street , however , and offer to remove an appendage that you believe to be both necessary and healthy , you would be highly inclined to charge me with assault .
Given that anarchism represents a near complete break with political society ' although , as described above , a highly moral and rational expansion of personal society ' it remains in no way attractive if nothing is seen to be particularly wrong with political society .
Churchill once famously remarked : ' Democracy is the worst form of government , except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time . '
Anarchists believe this to be true , but would add that no form of government is better than no government at all !
This is not to say that democracy is not a better form of government than tyranny .
It certainly is ' my problem is that we have in the West achieved democracy over the past few hundred years , and now seem to be eternally content to rest on our laurels , so to speak .
I spent almost 15 years as a software entrepreneur , which may have colored my perspective on this issue to some degree .
The software field reinvents itself almost from the ground up every year or two , it seems , which demands a constant commitment to dynamism , continual learning , and the abandonment of prior conceptions .
The swift currents of perpetual change quickly sweep the inert away .
Thus I fully appreciate the significant step forward represented by democracy ' but the mere fact that a thing is ' better ' in no way indicates that it is ' best . '
When medieval surgeons realized that a patient had a better chance of surviving gangrene if they hacked off a limb , this could surely be called a better solution ' but it could scarcely be called the best possible solution .
Recognizing that prevention is always better than a cure does not mean that all cures are equally good .
I have no doubt whatsoever that the first caveman to figure out how to start a fire shared his knowledge with his tribe , and they all sat in a cave , with their feet pointed towards the flickering flames , warm in the midst of a winter chill for the first time , and grunted at each other : ' Well , it ca n't possibly get any better than this !'
No doubt when , a thousand years later , someone figured out that it was easier to capture and domesticate a cow rather than to continually hunt game , everyone sat back in front of their fire , their bellies full of milk , and grunted at each other : ' Well , it ca n't possibly get any better than this !'
These things are genuine improvements , to be sure , and we should not ever fail to appreciate the progress that we make ' but neither should we automatically and endlessly assume that every step forward is the final and most perfect step , and that nothing can ever conceivably be improved in the future .
Democracy is considered to be superior to tyranny ' and rightly so , I believe ' because to some degree it imitates the feedback mechanisms of the free market .
Politicians , it is said , must provide goods and services to citizens , who provide feedback through voting .
It would seem to be logical to continue to extend that which makes democracy work further and further .
If I find that , as a doctor , I infect fewer of my patients when I wash one little finger , then surely it would make sense to start washing other parts of my hand as well .
Really , this is what my approach to anarchism is fundamentally about .
If voluntarism and feedback ' a quasi - ' market ' ' is what makes democracy superior , then surely we should work as hard as possible to extend voluntarism and feedback ' particularly since we have the example of real markets , which work spectacularly well .
Anarchy and Reform
There is a great fear among people ' or a great desire , to be more accurate ' with regards to abandoning this system , when the perception exists that it can be reformed instead .
Democracy is messy , it is said ' politicians pander to special interests , court voters with ' free ' goodies , manipulate the currency to avoid directly increasing taxes , create endless and intractable problems in the realms of education , welfare , incarceration and so on ' but let 's not throw the baby out with the bathwater !
If you have good ideas for improving the system , you should get involved , not sit back in your armchair and criticize everything in sight !
One of the rare privileges of a living in a democracy is that anyone can get involved in the political process , from running for a local school board to prime minister or president of the entire country !
Letter - writing campaigns , grassroots activism , blogs , associations , clubs ' you name it , there are countless ways to get involved in the political process .
Given the degree of feedback available to the average citizen of a democracy , it makes little sense to agitate for changing the system as a whole .
Since the system is so flexible and responsive , it is impossible to imagine that it can be replaced with any system that is more flexible ' thus the practical ideal for anyone interested in social change is to bring his ideas to the ' marketplace ' of democracy , see who he can get on board , and implement his vision within the system ' peacefully , politically , democratically .
This is a truly wonderful fairy tale , which has only the slight disadvantage of having nothing to do with democracy whatsoever .
When we think of a truly free market ' otherwise known as the ' free market ' ' we understand that we do not have to work for years and years , and give up thousands of hours and tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars , to satisfy our wishes .
If I want to shop for vegetarian food , say , I do not have to spend years lobbying the local supermarket , or joining some sort of somewhat ineffective advisory board , and pounding lawn signs , and writing letters , and cajoling everyone in the neighborhood ' all I have to do is go and buy some vegetarian food , locally or over the Internet if I prefer .
If I want to date a particular woman , I do not have to lobby everyone in a 10 block radius , get them to sign a petition , make stirring speeches about my worthiness as a boyfriend , devote years of my life attempting to get collective approval for asking her out .
All I have to do is walk up to her , ask her out and see if she says ' yes . '
If I want to be a doctor , I do not have to spend years lobbying every doctor in the country to get a majority approval for my application .
Neither do I have to pursue this process when I want to move , drive a car , buy a book , plan for my retirement , change countries , learn a language , buy a computer , choose to have a child , go on a diet , start an exercise program , go into therapy , give to a charity and so on .
Thus it is clear that individuals are ' allowed ' to make major and essential life decisions without consulting the majority .
The vast majority of our lives is explicitly anti-democratic , insofar as we vehemently reserve the right to make our own decisions ' and our own mistakes ' without subjecting them to the scrutiny and authority of others .
Why is it that we are ' allowed ' to choose who to marry , whether to have children , and how to raise them ' but we are violently not allowed to openly choose where they go to school ?
Why is every decision that leads up to the decision of how to educate a child is completely free , personal , and anti-democratic ' but the moment that the child needs an education , a completely opposite methodology is enforced upon the family ?
Why is the free anarchy of personal decisions ' in direct opposition to coercive authority ' such a moral imperative for every decision which leads up to the need for a child 's education ' but then , free anarchic choice becomes the greatest imaginable evil , and coercive authority must be substituted in its place ?
There is a particularly cynical side of me ' which is not to say that the cynicism is necessarily misplaced ' which would argue that the reason that there is no direct interference in having children is because that way people will have more kids , which the state needs to grow into taxpayers , in the same way that a dairy farmer needs his cows to breed .
Those who profit from political power always need new taxpayers , but they certainly do not want independently critical and rational taxpayers , since that is fundamentally the opposite of being a taxpayer .
Thus they do not interfere with having children , only with the education of children ' just as a goose farmer will not interfere with egg laying , but will certainly clip the wings of any geese he wishes to keep alive and profit from .
Anarchy and Exceptions
At this point , you may be thinking that there are good reasons why political coercion is substituted for personal anarchy in particular situations .
Perhaps there is some rule of thumb or principle which separates the two which , if it can be discovered , will lay this mystery bare .
If I break up with a girlfriend , for instance , I do not owe her anything legally .
If I marry her , however , I do .
When I take a new job , I may be subject to a probationary period of a few months , when I can be fired ' or quit ' with impunity .
We can think of many examples of such situations ' the major difference , however , is that these are all voluntary and contractual situations .
The justification for a government ' particularly a democratic government ' is really founded upon the idea of a ' social contract . '
Because we happen to be born in a particular geographical location , we ' owe ' the government our allegiance , time , energy and money for the rest of our lives , or as long as we stay .
This ' contract ' is open to renegotiation , insofar as we can decide to alter the government by getting involved in the political process ' or , we can leave the country , just as we can leave a marriage or place of employment .
This argument ' which goes back to Socrates ' is based upon an implied contract that remains in force as long as we ourselves remain within the geographical area ruled over by the government .
However , this idea of the ' social contract ' fails such an elemental test that it is only testament to the power of propaganda that it has lasted as a credible narrative for over 2,000 years .
Children cannot enter into contracts ' and adults cannot have contracts imposed upon them against their will .
Thus being born in a particular location does not create any contract , since it takes a lunatic or a Catholic to believe that obligations accrue to a newborn squalling baby .
Thus children cannot be subjected to ' or be responsible for ' any form of implicit social contract .
Adults , on the other hand , must be able to choose which contracts they enter into ' if they cannot , there is no differentiation between imposing a contract on a child , and imposing a contract on an adult .
I cannot say that implicit contracts are invalid for children , but then they magically become automatically valid when the child turns 18 , and bind the adult thereby .
It is important also to remember that there is fundamentally no such thing as ' the state . '
When you write a check to pay your taxes , it is made out to an abstract quasi - corporate entity , but it is cashed and spent by real life human beings .
Thus the reality of the social contract is that it ' rotates ' between and among newly elected political leaders , as well as permanent civil servants , appointed judges , and the odd consultant or two .
This coalescing kaleidoscope of people who cash your check and spend your money is really who you have your social contract with .
( This can occur in the free market as well , of course ' when you take out a loan to buy a house , your contract is with the bank , not your loan officer , and does not follow him when he changes jobs . )
However , to say that the same man can be bound by a unilaterally - imposed contract represented by an ever - shifting coalition of individuals , in a system that was set up hundreds of years before he was born , without his prior choice ' since he did not choose where he was born ' or explicit current approval , is a perfectly ludicrous statement .
We can generally accept as unjust any standard of justice that would disqualify itself .
When we are shopping , we would scarcely call it a ' sale ' if prices had been jacked up 30 % .
We would not clip a ' coupon ' that added a dollar to the price of whatever we were buying ' in fact , we would not call this a coupon at all !
If we examine the concept of the ' social contract , ' which is claimed as a core justification for the existence of a government , it is more than reasonable to ask whether the social contract would justly enforce the social contract itself !
In other words , if the government is morally justified because of the ethical validity of an implicit and unilaterally imposed contract , will the government defend implicit and unilaterally imposed contracts ?
If I start up a car dealership and automatically ' sell ' a car to everyone in a 10 block radius , and then send them a bill for the car they have ' bought ' ' and send them the car as well , and bind their children for eternity in such a deal as well ' would the government enforce such a ' contract ' ?
I think that we all know the answer to that question '
If I attempted to bring a social contract to an agency that claims as its justification the existence and validity of the exact same social contract , it would laugh in my face and call me insane .
Are you beginning to get a clear idea of the kind of moral and logical contradictions that a statist system is based upon ?
Many times throughout human history , certain societies have come to the valid conclusion that an institution can no longer be reformed , but must instead be abolished .
The most notable example is slavery , but we can think of others as well , such as the unity of church and state , oligarchical aristocracy , military dictatorships , human or animal sacrifices to the gods , rape as a valid spoil of war , torture , pedophilia , wife abuse and so on .
This does not mean of course that all of these practices and institutions have faded from the world , but it does mean that in many civilized societies , the essential debate is over , and was not settled with the idea of ' reforming ' institutions such as slavery .
The origin of the phrase ' rule of thumb ' came from an attempt to reform the beating of wives , and restrict it to beating your wife with a stick no wider than your thumb .
This practice was not reformed , but rather abolished .
However well - intentioned these reforms may have been , we can at best only call them ethical in terms of halting steps towards the final goal , which is the elimination of the concept of wife beating as a moral norm at all .
In the same way , some reformers attempted to get slave owners to beat their slaves less , or at least less severely , but with the hindsight of history and our further moral development , we can see that slavery was not fundamentally an institution that could ever be reformed , but rather had to be utterly abolished .
We can find encouragement in such ' reforms ' only to the degree that they reduced suffering in the present , while hopefully spurring on the goal of abolishing slavery .
Any moralist who said that getting rid of slavery would be a criminal and moral disaster of the first order , but instead encouraged slaves to attempt to work within the system , or counseled slave owners to voluntarily take on the goal of treating their slaves with less brutality , could scarcely be called a moralist , at least by modern standards .
Instead , we would term such a ' reformer ' as a very handy apologist for the existing brutality of the system .
By pretending that the evils inherent in slavery could be mitigated or eliminated through voluntary internal reform , these ' moralists ' actually slowed or stalled the progress towards abolition in many areas .
By holding out the false hope that an evil institution could be turned to goodness , these sophists blunted the power of the argument from morality , which is that slavery is an inherent evil , and thus can not be reformed .
The finger - wagging admonition , ' Rape more gently , ' is oxymoronic .
Rape is the opposite of gentle , the opposite of moral .
This is how many anarchists view the proposition that the existing system of political violence should be reformed somehow from within , rather than fundamentally opposed on moral terms , as an absolute evil , based on coercion and brutality , particularly towards children ' with the inevitable consequence that its only salvation can come from being utterly abolished '

Steve Paul Jobs was born on February 24th , 1955 .
He is known to be the Chairman , co-founder as well as the CEO of the Apple Inc .
He was also the former CEO of well known Pixar Animation Studios .
He was also represented among the Board of Directors of the Walt Disney Company .
Not bad !
He completed his studies in California and later he did his frequent after - school lectures in Palo Alto at the Hewlett Packard Company .
In a few months time , he was hired in the same place and from there his career started to accelerate .
The great personality exhibited by Steve Jobs was told and appreciated far and wide .
He was referred to as one of Silicon Valley ’s leading egomaniac by Fortune Magazine .
It was in the year 1976 when he founded the company he named Apple Inc.
Presently , Jobs is referred to as the single largest shareholder in the Walt Disney Company and also one among its Board of Directors .
His presence and appreciation in both the computer as well as entertainment field is remarkable .
With his fame , he is well known for whatever came out from his mouth and was thus noted to be quoted .
In casual conversation , Steve Jobs seems to come up with earth - moving quotes .
The mastery of this is that most of his quotes can be applied to the the jobs we all have , the careers we all seek , and the lives we all want to lead .
Let ’s take a look at some of the great quotes of this modern day tech and media leader .
To Build up Confidence
“ We do n’t get a chance to do that many things , so every one should be really excellent .
Because this is our life .
Life is brief , and then you die , you know ? ”
Steve Jobs is confident in whatever decisions he makes and he talks about what has taken him to great heights .
He also insists all of us to be good to the heart as our lives are short and death can arrive at any time .
On Confidence and Creativity
“ That happens more than you think , because this is not just engineering and science .
There is art , too .
Sometimes when you ’re in the middle of these crises , you ’re not sure you ’re going to make it to the other end .
But we ’ve always made it , and so we have a certain degree of confidence , although sometimes you wonder . “
People are terrified at times .
However , those that make choices based on real criteria , regardless of the conceptual nature of them , can confidently stand behind them and are able to shake off the uncertainties that arise .
On the Experience as a User
“ Our DNA is as a consumer company – for that individual customer who ’s voting thumbs up or thumbs down .
That ’s who we think about .
And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience .
And if it ’s not up to the par , it ’s our fault , plain and simple . “
User satisfaction is not just for business owners .
Your boss could be considered as a user of your output .
By mastering your trade and ensuring a complete and accurate output ( albeit a report , a design , an article , etc. ) , your ‘ users ’ will be happy and reward you with continued business .
On Focus
“ People think focus means saying yes to the thing you ’ve got to focus on .
But that ’s not what it means at all .
It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are .
You have to pick carefully . ”
The real meaning of focus is not the simple yes .
Instead , it is all about the ideas which are imparted by picking and sorting the best out .
Careful detection and estimation of your plans and the ideas and strategies taken to implement them are what Steve Jobs is talking about .
On Passion
“ When I hire somebody really senior , competence is the ante ; they have to be really smart .
But the real issue for me is , are they going to fall in love with Apple ?
Because if they in love with Apple , everything else will take care of itself . ”
This comes down to passion .
When you have passion for what you do , good results and dedication are sure follow .
Identifying your passion is difficult but once there , work is no longer work .
As a worker , find and live your passion .
As an employer , get employees to really see the vision and their role in taking the company there .
On Leadership Qualities
“ So when a good idea comes , you know , part of my job is to move it around , just see what different people think , get people talking about it , argue with people about it , get ideas moving among that group of 100 people , get different people together to explore different aspects of it quietly , and , you know – just explore things . “
Cisco Systems had a great motto at one point that read , “ We are stronger together than we ’ll ever be apart . ”
Many times , good ideas are made great by seeking input from others .
By surrounding yourself with people that you ’d admit are smarter than you , greatness has a chance .
On Product Tactics
“ It ’s not about pop culture , and it ’s not about fooling people , and it ’s not about convincing people that they want something they do n’t .
We figure out what we want .
And I think we ’re pretty good at having the right discipline to think through whether a lot of other people are going to want it , too .
That ’s what we get paid to do . ”
This is about legitimacy .
Getting paid is great but executing on a long term vision based on demand is a true art .
On Succession Planning
“ I mean , some people say , ‘ Oh God , if [ Jobs ] got run over by a bus , Apple would be in trouble . ’
And , you know , I think it would n’t be a party , but there are really capable people at Apple .
My job is to make the whole executive team good enough to be successors , so that ’s what I try to do . ”
The real work of a CEO is to lay pipe ( sort of speak ) .
A good CEO is laying the groundwork for an organization to succeed on its own – today and tomorrow .
Much of this has to do not only with the people that surround you , but letting go of the ego .
On LayOffs
“ We ’ve had one of these before , when the dot - com bubble burst .
What I told our company was that we were just going to invest our way through the downturn , that we were n’t going to lay off people , that we ’d taken a tremendous amount of efforts to get them into Apple in the first place – the last thing we were going to do is lay them off . ”
When you make a concrete effort to only hire the best employees , releasing them may cost more than keeping them around .
Sure .
Unproductive employees need to go but mass layoffs versus a strategic realignment that moves expertise , is a clear alternative .
Choices like this , short term gain versus long term impairment , are critical ones to make .
On the job of Recruiting
“ Recruiting is hard .
It ’s just finding the needles in the haystack .
You ca n’t know enough in a one - hour interview .
So , in the end , it ’s ultimately based on your gut .
How do I feel about this person ?
What are they like when challenged ?
I ask everybody that : ‘ Why are you here ? ’
The answer is n’t very important , it ’s the meta - data . “
The recruiting job is tough indeed and not as easy as you ’d think .
If you , as a hirer , get to someone ’s core , you have a chance at understanding them .
This is what Steve Jobs would love to say about the entire process of hiring people for work .
He also finds it similar to looking out for the needles in the haystack which is simply as impossible as it should be .
There are plenty more quotes given out by Steve Jobs .
However , these form a decent foundation that you can take to you life in the effort to find great success , for attaining hopes , and building up a real huge empire !
The GOP 's attack on the integrity of voters , carried out by party leaders -- a sitting president included -- on the eve of an election , is unprecedented .
The day after John McCain charged the community - based organization Acorn ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) with planning " one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , " Sarah Palin told a boisterous crowd in Bangor , Maine : " In this election , it 's a choice between a candidate who wo n't disavow a group committing voter fraud , and a leader ...
Internet Explorer is no longer the default browser for Windows and users received the new Edge browser .
While it is a major improvement it still is n’t the best browser out there .
Therefore it is understandable if you may want to remove it from Windows 10 .
However , if you already did this and you want Edge browserr back today we will show you how .
Microsoft Edge errors
Microsoft Edge errors can be one reason why you might have uninstalled the browser .
Many users experienced various issues .
Sometimes Edge crashed , other times it failed to launch .
The only wat to fix these problems was to uninstall the browser .
Here is how you can get it back .
Reinstall the Microsoft Edge browser
Luckily for you it is very simple to get back your Edge browser .
However , your bookmarks , your favorites and your browser history might be gone forever .
First of all you should close Microsoft Edge browser if it is running .
Open File Explorer , select “ View ” and chem the “ Hidden items ” options .
You will now see all the hidden folders that are hidden by default in Windows 10 .
Replace “ Username ” with your username and go to the following location by pasting it in the Run command box :
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Packages
Look for a folder named “ Microsoft. MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe ” and right click and delete it .
You will be asked if you want to “ permanently delete this folder ” , click yes .
You may have to wait a couple of minutes until the folder is finally deleted .
Close all your running applications and restart your computer
Run “ Windows PowerShell ” as an administrator and type the following command ( replace yourusername with your actual username ) :
cd C:\users\yourusername

Sony Worldwide Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida is disappointed at the lack of third - party support for the PSP .
He pointed to first - party games such as God of War : Chains of Olympus , Buzz !
Brain Bender and Resistance Retribution as examples of strong , existing IP that had been manipulated for PSP - something he 's disappointed third - parties are not emulating .
" What we 'd like to see more is for third - parties also - there is so much great IP that they have , " Yoshida told IGN .
" It 's really , really disappointing , and it's a lost opportunity for the third - parties .
They should look at what the PSP can do for their titles and the potential for the business that their IP has . "
Yoshida promised Sony has " many more " unannounced PSP games planned for next year , and said leading by example was the best way to get third - parties involved .
Capcom's Japanese Monster Hunter phenomena was used as an example , whereby developers and publishers could visibly see groups of friends playing the game in public places .
Perhaps the PSP - 3000 , with its brighter , more colourful screen , will prompt more activity when it launches here in mid-October .
The first PSP - 3000 bundle will arrive in the UK on 17th October and cost GBP 149.99 .

Oregon to Build One of World 's Largest Wind Farms by 2012
October 29th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Utility company Southern California Edison ( SCE ) has confirmed plans to build a massive 909 MW wind farm in Oregon .
When completed , the facility will be one of the largest fully permitted wind power sites anywhere in the world .
The installation will be located in Morrow and Gilliam counties in North - Central Oregon , and will consist of 303 3MW wind turbines spread across a 30 - mile radius .
The project , called Caithness Shepherd ’s Flat , will generate around two billion kWh of energy , roughly 10 per cent of SCE ’s total alternative energy portfolio .
According to Stuart Hemphill , SCE Vice President , Renewable and Alternative Power , “ This contract is a crown jewel in our renewable energy portfolio .
The project is attractive to SCE because of its size , near - term delivery and its competitive price . ”
The wind - rich area of Oregon has become known as one of the country ’s ‘ bread - baskets ’ of wind energy .
When completed , the project will mean that the state joins others such as Texas and California as one of the nation ’s leading producers of renewable energy .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
There is a new press release up at the Fed on its latest loan to troubled insurer AIG ( hat tip Dealbreaker ) :
The Federal Reserve Board has authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to borrow securities from certain regulated U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the American International Group ( AIG ) , under section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
Under this program , the New York Fed will borrow up to $ 37.8 billion in investment - grade , fixed - income securities from AIG in return for cash collateral .
These securities were previously lent by AIG ’s insurance company subsidiaries to third parties .
As expected , drawdowns to date under the existing $ 85 billion New York Fed loan facility have been used , in part , to settle transactions with counterparties returning these third - party securities to AIG .
This new program will allow AIG to replenish liquidity used in settling those transactions , while providing enhanced credit protection to the New York Fed and U.S. taxpayers in the form of a security interest in these securities .
How much this means depends on the price at which the Fed takes the collateral from AIG .
It appears AIG is unable to sell certain instruments at prices it likes , and so is parking them at the Fed .
Ahem , do we believe the prices the Fed is using to value this paper ?
If AIG ca n’t unwind them , one must wonder what they are really worth ( although in this credit crunchy environment , it is possible that decent paper is n’t fetching very good prices .
But when will more favorable markets return , pray tell ? ) .
Another not - so - pretty aspect of this development is more obvious : $ 85 billion was n’t enough ?
Did AIG misrepresent its cash needs , or not have a good enough grasp of its near term liquidity requirements ?
Or was this simply something a tad more defensible , that the market seized up on paper that would normally be salable ?
And reader Marshall had another reason to take a dim view :
That they ’ve got a new loan just tells me that we ’ve truly crossed the Rubicon .
No restraints any longer .
Just stuff everything with money , money , money and forget about how much debt you have .
It ’s going to be like this until after the election I think .
No deliberations , it just gets done .
When I read of the loan , I had assumed it was a parent company loan to cover AIG ’s credit default swaps exposure .
Tomorrow is settlement day on Lehman CDS .
AIG was a major protection writer , and unlike investment banks , which claim to have hedged their positions ( although offsetting swaps are the only means to do so , since the underlying cash bonds are , in the vast majority of cases , illiquid ) , there is no reason to think AIG did so , or at least did so consistently .
The Lehman settlement is expected to require dealers who wrote guarantees to pay out between 80 and 85 cents on the dollar .
Lehman had $ 128 billion of bonds as of its last balance sheet , but CDS written are typically a big multiple of the value of the underlying bonds .
That ’s a long winded way of saying AIG could be writing some very big checks very soon .
But this is a different issue .
Tomorrow , as they say , is another day .
Underscoring the severity of a new class of vulnerability known as clickjacking , a blogger has created a proof - of - concept game that uses a PC 's video cam and microphone to secretly spy on the player .
The demo , which is available here , appears to be a simple game that tests how quickly a user can click on a series of moving targets .
Behind the scenes , it combines a generic clickjacking attack with weaknesses in Adobe 's Flash technology to record the player using the PC 's video camera and microphone .
The proof of concept is a powerful demonstration of the spooky implications behind clickjacking .
The vulnerability allows malicious webmasters to control the links visitors click on .
Once lured to a booby - trapped page , a user may think he 's clicking on a link that leads to Google - when in fact it takes him to a money transfer page , a banner ad that 's part of a click - fraud scheme , or any other destination the attacker chooses .
It plagues every major browser , Adobe Flash , and many other browsing technologies , according to Jeremiah Grossman and Robert " RSnake " Hansen , the researchers who first sounded the clickjacking alarm .
The pair was scheduled to detail the threat two weeks ago at at OWASP 's AppSec 2008 Conference in New York , but canceled the talk at the request of Adobe .
The unnamed blogger behind the game said his proof of concept used Flash , but the writer went on to say that the same thing could have been achieved using Java , SilverLight , or Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language .
In our tests , the the proof - of - concept did n't work until after we enabled our video cam in the Windows XP Device Manager .
Even then , we had trouble getting it to work with Firefox , possibly because we had the NoScript extension running ( but disabled ) .
But we had no such problems when using Internet Explorer .
Within 40 seconds of pressing start , there we were playing the game .
The words " Your camera was clickjacked " appeared in red .
Doubting Thomases will say the answer is to disable cams , mics , and other devices that can be misused or to simply uninstall Flash .
But this is to miss the larger point :
Right now , unknown web masters throughout the world can control the links you click on simply by luring you to their page .
The list of ways this can be abused - we 're thinking government spying , corporate espionage , cyber stalking , click fraud , and even creepier things we wo n't bother to mention - is limited only by the imagination .
Turning off the webcam may limit the damage , but it does n't remove the underlying threat .
" I had doubts about publishing this , but , if I could have understand [ sic ] it so are the bad guys , so it 's better to know about it , " the blogger writes .
After an earlier version of this story was published , Adobe issued this advisory giving step - by - step instructions for working around the threat while a fix is pending .
The company also said it expected to patch the vulnerability by the end of October .
So far , makers of Internet Explorer , Firefox , Java , Safari , SilverLight and the horde of other programs vulnerable to clickjacking have been mum . ®
The men were taken to Guantanamo after being detained in 2001 An US federal appeal court has blocked a judge 's order that 17 Chinese detainees at the Guantanamo Bay camp should immediately be released .
A district court had said it was wrong for the Bush administration to continue holding the Chinese Muslim Uighurs , as it had no evidence against them .
The White House then appealed , saying the original ruling - the first of its kind - could set a dangerous precedent .
Captured in Afghanistan in 2001 , the group has been held without charge .
Under the original ruling , they were to be brought to court on Friday , and then freed to stay with members of the Uighur community in the Washington area .
The appeal court ruling puts a temporary halt to the release to allow lawyers for both sides to present further arguments over the coming week .
' Sworn enemies '
The Uighurs had been cleared for release in 2004 but the US says they may face persecution if returned to China .
The White House said if they were released it could set a precedent that would allow " sworn enemies " to seek US entry .
CHINA'S UIGHURS Ethnically Turkic Muslims , mainly in Xinjiang Made bid for independent state in 1940s Sporadic violence in Xinjiang since 1991 Uighurs worried about Chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture
The government says the 17 also pose a security risk if released into the US .
But in the original ruling , District Judge Ricardo Urbina said there was no evidence that they were " enemy combatants " or a security risk .
Lawyers for the Bush administration have argued that federal judges do not have authority to order the release into the US of Guantanamo detainees .
Beijing demand
Some detainees at the military prison fear torture or persecution if they return to their home countries , according to the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights .
The Bush administration has maintained that if they cannot be returned home and no other country will take them , they should stay at Guantanamo .
In 2006 , five Chinese Muslim men released from Guantanamo Bay were flown to Albania for resettlement .
The 17 Uighurs involved in the current case had been living in a camp in Afghanistan during the US - led military campaign that began in October 2001 .
They fled into the mountains and were held by Pakistani authorities who handed them over to the US .
Beijing has demanded that all Uighurs held at Guantanamo be repatriated to China .
Many Muslim Uighurs from Xinjiang in western China want greater autonomy for the region and some want independence .
Beijing has waged a campaign against what it calls their violent separatist activities .

Soda manufacturer
Dr Pepper promised a free soft drink to everyone in America if Guns N' Roses releases its long - awaited Chinese Democracy album before the end of 2008 .
Now that Axl and company have set a release date of November 23 , Dr Pepper says it will make good on the offer .
Those who want to claim a free soda can go to the Dr. Pepper website on November 23 , enter some personal information and get a coupon for one 20 - ounce drink that should arrive within the following 4 to 6 weeks .
( The offer strangely said no free soda for former GNR members Slash and Buckethead . )
The freebies expire in February 2009 .
The band did n't know about the promotion until it was announced in March 2008 .
When he heard about the proposed giveaway , Axl Rose explained : " We are surprised and very happy to have the support of Dr Pepper withour album Chinese Democracy , as for us , this came totally out of theblue .
If there is any involvement with this promotion by our recordcompany or others , we are unaware of such at this time .
And as some of Buckethead 's performances are on our album , I 'll share my Dr Pepperwith him . "
The " Chinese Democracy " single went online yesterday ( you can listen to the whole song here and then rate its rockingness in our poll ) .

Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has confirmed there have been 11 cancer cases at a school north of Brisbane .
The Government says it will evacuate Deception Bay State High School if investigations confirm there is a cancer cluster on the site .
It is understood that three people have been diagnosed this year , but Ms Bligh says there have been other cases .
" There 's about 11 cases of cancer , but two of those were diagnosed before the staff came to the school , " she said .
Earlier Education Minister Rod Welford said a number of staff at Deception Bay State High School had developed various types of cancer in the past few years .
" Staff at the school have raised with us a number of incidents of cancer amongst female teachers at the school , " Mr Welford said .
" The cancers involve various types of cancers , including breast cancer and thyroid cancer and we 've asked my Department to team up with Queensland Health to undertake some preliminary investigations . "
Mr Welford says the investigation is urgent .
" We will keep staff informed at every step of the way should it emerge that there is any connection between these cancer incidents and contamination of some kind at the school , then immediate steps will be taken to protect all staff and students , " he said .
Teachers and staff are being offered support .
Queensland Health Minister Stephen Robertson says he wants the matter investigated quickly .
" The issue is I think is that you do n't ignore statistical anomalies , " he said .
" You investigate them thoroughly to determine whether there is a trend or whether you can dismiss it we want to be able to put peoples minds at ease as early as possible .
" We have been keeping a watching brief on it but now that it has got to a particular level , we have offered our service to work with Education Queensland to look at undertaking whatever study is necessary to determine whether there is a broader issue or whether there is not . "
Queensland Teachers Union spokesman Steve Ryan says the investigation must be carried out as soon as possible .
He says similar concerns have been raised elsewhere in the past .
" The few that have occurred have not indicated a particular fault of the location but that 's not to say it can't occur , " he said .
" We need to treat them very seriously - Milpera [ State School in Brisbane ] had an issue I think last year or the year before .
" Full reports were done and no contamination or problems with the site were actually found in that particular case . "
An elderly , wheelchair - bound amputee from northern NSW allegedly stabbed to death his 86 - year - old wife before telling a Triple - 0 operator he thought she was dead , police say .
Police have charged the 87 - year - old man with his wife 's murder after arresting him at their Hillcrest Avenue home in Goonellabah , near Lismore , sometime after 11 am yesterday .
He allegedly stabbed his wife in the chest and neck before calling Triple - 0 at 11.10 am to report the incident .
I ’ve never studied Python , but I ’d quite like to at some point in the future .
It seems very much like Perl with a different set of design criteria .
Yeah ,
there are differences , but compare with C , Lisp , COBOL , and you can see why
Perl and Python are clustered together in the “ P languages ” ( Perl / Python / P^HRuby etc. )
Actually , that ’s one of the main reasons I ’ve not expended signifant effort
into learning Python – I can hurt my brain far more by trying to learn C or
Haskell .
But I ’m sure it would be a good thing to do at some point .
Here
are a few notes on first impressions : these are just that , impressions ,
and may not be factually accurate : if you want to know full and correct
details about Python , there are many excellent blogs that will clarify .
2008-09 - 25
Thanks for the excellent comments , I ’ll fold
in corrections below !
Whitespace
This is the one wart that Perl programmers fairly consistently bring up .
I ’m coming around to the idea that it ’s a good idea , but I do think that :
it ’s not entirely necessary , as most good code is indented anyway Haskell does it better , with some excellent whitespace inferencing rules , but
the possibility to drop back to an explitly { braces ; and ; semicolons }
style if you need it
Things that you miss out on include multiline strings ( 2008 - 09 - 25 : Bill Mill points that “ ” ” syntax ” ” ” does indeed allow multiline strings , thanks ) , and multiline well , anything ,
for example lambdas , but that ’s OK because …
Functional Programming
Python has likened to an easy version of Lisp , and it has the same kind of
functional goodies as Perl .
At some point Guido wanted to remove ( I think )
reduce , grep , map from the core language , and there was much gnashing of
teeth .
I think he backed down , but the idea that he suggested it is interesting .
He also wanted to get rid of lambdas , which seems utterly crazy , as even the
Java people are now thinking about adding them .
But lambdas are still
deprecated , and are considered not the “ pythonic ” way of doing things .
Hence they are discouraged and restricted to single lines .
Hmmmm .
( 2008-09 - 25 : Bill Mill points out that map remains ; reduce got moved to Standard Lib , as comprehensions already do the right thing ; and grep does n’t exist .
Is that called “ filter ” in Python ?
Of course comprehensions can already to map / grep too )
On the other hand , python has list comprehensions which work equally well
on lazy generators !
Very nice indeed .
It also has a much fuller destructuring
bind than Perl ’s ( which only works on single - level lists ) .
So some good , some
bad , and some interesting syntax and features .
I doubt there ’s a clear
“ winner ” , some more discussion on Perl / Python ( via Lisp of course ) in Paul
Graham ’s Revenge of the Nerds
post .
Oh , and Python has continuations !
With a builtin yield command .
Perl has
the Coro module , which is a fantastic piece of work , but rather
complicated with confusing documentation .
The yield command itself is in
Coro :: Generator but it has a number of limitations , like not
being able to clone a continuation .
There was a lovely post on creating
monadic “ do - notation ” using continuations only , and I ported it to Perl
with much swearing only to find that though it worked great for simple
monads , it failed utterly for the List monad ( important as it ’s
what list comprehensions are built on ) precisely because of this .
Apparently the Perl internals do n’t really mesh with this , so it ’s
unlikely that we ’ll be getting it for Perl 5 any time soon .
Point to
Python .
( 2008 - 09 - 25 : dolio points out I ’m confusing generators and coroutines .
Yup , I do that , sorry !
I think one can be implemented in terms of each other ( and
vice - versa ? ) , and that some literature does also blur the distinction , but could be wrong about that too ?
And yes , Ruby has callcc , but apparently the Monad example I was reading ca n’t be easily ported to Ruby because the continuations / coroutines / thingies generated by yield are n’t clonable )
OO
Python ’s OO looks serviceable enough , and method prototypes and so on are nice .
Perl is really catching up here though with projects like Moose , which
truly does deliver on being a “ postmodern object system ” .
Sure , the syntax
could do with some work in places , but the new buzz around
Devel :: Declare and Method : : Signatures means that this
is coming on well too .
Will on Geekup posted some nice examples of “ declarators on attributes ” ,
which I think are similar to lvalue tied methods , but look rather better
designed .
( From Damian Conway ’s talk Contextual : : Return may
fix the problems
Perl has with this kind of nice syntax .
I say may
as with Damian ’s talks it ’s hard to tell whether they truly are a massive
advance in usability and functionality or crack - fueled insanity ) .
Actually , declarators deserve their own section :
@ Declarators
These are really nice syntax for modifying subroutine declarations .
Of course , there ’s nothing you ca n’t do in Perl , but it ’s prettier
than direct symbol table hacking .
And less hackish than bloody : attributes .
Still , nothing a bit of Devel : : Declare or similar sugar could n’t
fix :-)
But talking about declarators , I have to ask :
Is Python really more readable ?
One of the Python slogans is something like “ executable pseudocode ” ,
as if you can just write out readable summaries of code which are readable
but compile .
From the python examples I was looking at ( admittedly , these
may have been complex , with features like @declarators ) I could n’t make
head or tail of it .
Now I ’m not trying to suggest that Python is naturally
unreadable , or that Perl is naturally readable .
But I would say that
If you know language X but not language Y , then you may find X more readable than Y .
This may hold even if X happens to be Perl , or Y happens to Python :-)
This may be a good time to pimp my
Readable Perl
slides up , for those people that insist on joking that the phrase is oxymoronic .
Community
Both Perl and Python communities seem to be vibrant , productive ( of modules , apps ,
blogs , and conferences ) , and to have a mix of helpful and friendly , and snobbish and
trollish .
So pretty much situation normal for perhaps underrated “ scripting ” languages :-)
Some differences I ’ve heard mentioned include ( with no figures or such to back them up … ) :
Python conferences are apparently full of people talking about cool projects they ’ve done .
At Perl conferences , people often talk about syntax and technical problems and … oh , yeah , I used this to do this project but I do n’t have time to talk about it now …
At Perl conferences , people often talk about syntax and technical problems and … oh , yeah , I used this to do this project but I do n’t have time to talk about it now …
I ’ve very rarely heard Perl programmers talk badly about Python .
Well OK , we always whine about the whitespace , but I know that jerakeen and
Dean
have said generally positive things about it .
I ’ve had Python people telling me bad things about Perl , despite not knowing anything about modern Perl , which I think is fairly silly , unless they are doing it only for postmodern ironic reasons
( which is an excuse apparently ) .

Of course this may be because Perl programmers pick on PHP and Java instead .
But that ’s OK because we ’re being postmodern and ironic .
I have an ( utterly uninformed ) hunch that Python conferences are better attended , but that this
may be in part due to there being fewer of them .
may be in part due to there being fewer of them .
Python has Guido .
Perl has @ Larry ( in the plural ) .
( I ’m not sure that this is n’t overrated ,
$ Larry probably gets the deciding vote ) .
There is a constant meme that href = " http://greenokapi.net/blog/2008/09/24/italian-perl-workshop-2008/#comments "
>
Python
is somehow more “ modern ” than Perl .
This is almost never qualified , I remember in this interesting book on programming language design that it was mentioned that the fact that
Python ’s regular expressions lived in an external module was a more modern design that Perl’s ,
which had them as builtins .
Perhaps
Perl not building in support for declarators and list
comprehensions is more modern too ?
I ’m sure if I say this often enough , it ’ll be a good
substitute for actually making sense :-)
But Python does seem to get more buzz , with things like Google ’s AppEngine supporting
Python before Perl .
Hey ho .
I still think that there are many more Perl jobs going ,
for what that ’s worth .
Modules
CPAN is a big advantage for the Perl community , and I believe that Python ’s module ecosystem
is somewhat less complete .
But it looks very impressive nonetheless :
Off the top of my head , there ’s Twisted , Python ’s equivalent to POE ; Django ( Catalyst ) ;
and PyGame ( possibly comparable to SDL_Perl ? ) as fairly high - profile complex libraries
that show , to be honest , that both languages are pretty healthy with regards to module
support .
( 2008-09 - 25 : Bill Mill points out PyPI
link , and admits it ’s “ still no CPAN , but it ’s coming along ” , which is more or less what I
was trying to suggest ;-)
So …
Python looks like a great language , with many of the same strengths of Perl .
If you ’ve
looked at Perl and it did n’t really click , try Python .
And vice - versa .
If you ’ve not used
a dynamic language and want to try , then use one .
Honestly , you ’ll love it .
( And if you
do n’t , try the other one .
Or Ruby .
Or go crazy and learn Haskell . )
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential nominee John McCain said on Friday an Ohio man dubbed “ Joe the Plumber , ” who raised questions about Democrat Barack Obama ’s tax plan , was being smeared by Democratic attacks .
McCain spent the day campaigning in Florida , trying to fend off a strong challenge from Obama in a state the Republicans have taken in the last two presidential elections but is up for grabs on November 4 .
Obama was in Roanoke , Virginia , a traditionally Republican state that is also tilting more Democratic this year .
The Illinois senator attacked McCain ’s health care plan .
Leading national opinion polls and surveys in key battleground states , Obama picked up the endorsements of The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times .
The Post said both Obama and McCain are “ unusually talented and qualified ” candidates , but it questioned McCain ’s choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate because she is “ not ready to be president . ”
Speaking at a lively rally in Miami , McCain said Joe Wurzelbacher , of Holland , Ohio , was being punished for asking Obama a legitimate question .
“ Last weekend , Sen . Obama showed up in Joe ’s driveway to ask for his vote , and you know what Joe did ?
He asked Senator Obama a tough question .
I ’m glad he did ; I think Senator Obama could use a few more tough questions , ” McCain said .
“ He was n’t recruited or prompted by our campaign .
He just asked a question .
And Americans ought to be able to ask Senator Obama tough questions without being smeared and targeted with political attacks , ” he said .
Democrats have been sharply critical of Wurzelbacher in the days since “ Joe the Plumber ” questioned Obama ’s plan to tax Americans making more than $ 250,000 a year .

MCCAIN : ‘HOLD ONTO YOUR WALLET ’
The tax question prompted Obama to say he wanted to “ spread the wealth around , ” a comment that McCain and Republicans have jumped on as a sign that the Democrat would pursue income redistribution policies if elected .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Obama and McCain brought up Joe the Plumber more than two dozen times at a debate on Wednesday night .
Wurzelbacher ’s brush with fame has come at a cost .
The New York Times reported that Wurzelbacher does not have a plumber ’s license and owes back taxes .
The Arizona senator ridiculed Obama ’s remark about spreading the wealth , saying , “ When politicians talk about taking your money and spreading it around , you ’d better hold onto your wallet . ”
Obama , trying to blunt McCain ’s appeal in retiree - haven Florida , told about 8,000 supporters that McCain ’s health care proposal to give Americans a $ 5,000 tax credit to help pay for health insurance would require taxing health benefits , and cutting the Medicare insurance program for seniors by $ 882 billion .
“ If you count on Medicare , it would mean fewer places to get care , and less freedom to choose your own doctors .
You ’ll pay more for your drugs , receive fewer services , and get lower quality care .
I do n’t think that ’s right , ” Obama said .
McCain economic adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin charged that Obama has “ consistently lied ” about McCain ’s health care plan .
Holtz - Eakin said McCain ’s tax credit “ will not only shield millions of families from a tax increase , but will actually give them more dollars to invest in their health care needs . ”
“ The McCain plan does not tax medical expenses like the cost of a procedure or medication , ” he wrote in an e-mail memo .
WASHINGTON 
The day before Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s birthday last week , Barack Obama surprised him after lunch with candlelighted cupcakes .
Within hours , the photograph of the president - elect and his running mate , smiling over the dessert , was on the evening news .
The photograph , circulated by Mr. Obama ’s office , was meant to project unity , confidence and camaraderie .
But while Mr. Obama has moved quickly to assemble his White House staff and the beginnings of a cabinet , he is lagging behind even the chronically late President Bill Clinton in bringing clarity to the role his vice president will play .
So far , Mr. Biden has not been given a defined portfolio , the way Al Gore was given the environment and technology in 1992 .
And Mr. Obama ’s aides say they do not expect Mr. Biden to assume the kind of muscular role that Vice President Dick Cheney has played over the last eight years , although he is expected to put out a number of fires .
“ I ’m sure that there will be discrete assignments over time , ” said David Axelrod , a senior adviser to the president - elect .
“ But I think his fundamental role is as a trusted counselor .
I think that when Obama selected him , he selected him to be a counselor and an adviser on a broad range of issues . ”
Temporal Anomalies in Time Travel Movies
unravels
Problems in Time
Time travel has been a staple in Science Fiction since H.G. Wells .
Unfortunately , much of what passes for intelligence in this area is poorly considered .
Anomalies
For example , it is not possible to return to the past without changing the past in some way ; nor is it possible to change the future based on information from the future .
Doctor
Who realized early on that changes to history were hazardous , and avoided them assiduously .
Movies built on a time travel theme frequently become dissatisfying when the thread of time is closely examined .
In Millennium , once the era in which the time machine exists is destroyed , are n't all of those rescued survivors returned to their own times ?
In The Twelve Monkeys , does n't it appear that the disaster which the main character was to prevent
Sci-Fi Weekly
Site of the Week would not have happened had he not interfered ?
In Timecop , would any of that have happened had it not happened ?
Even the venerable Back to top of page .
would not have happened had he not interfered ?
In Timecop , would any of that have happened had it not happened ?
Even the venerable StarTrek has created numerous anomalies which it has failed to resolve .
Pasts which are dependent upon futures dependent upon those pasts should make us cringe .
However , from time to time something works .
This web page has long attempted to examine some of the best , worst , and other examples of these .
Movies
This section once listed and briefly described all the movies analyzed in the order in which they were analyzed .
Maintaining that has become prohibitive .
The full list , with links , is to the right .
It should be clarified concerning the movie analyses that they are not really in a random order , but the order is not always entirely consistent , either .
The first analysis published was Terminator , the then - two - part Schwarzenegger thriller in a single page .
On its heels we posted Back to the Future in three parts , and continued in very much the order you see on the list to the right .
However , we received a letter from a reader and so included the addendum to Terminator , listing it with the original film , and when , sometime later , we added an analysis of Terminator 3 : Judgment Day , we listed it with its predecessors .
Thus the system has continued much on that order , that each new analysis was added at the bottom of the list unless it was a sequel to a previously analyzed film .
We did not always do it that way , but more recently decided that those sequels which were listed further down ought to be moved up with their prequels .
There is some logic to this methodology , and it works in both directions .
On the one hand , many points that were fundamental to understanding what was eventually named Replacement
Theory were first presented in the earlier movies , and even later as new significant points were recognized they would first appear in newly posted film analyses .
That meant analyses of later films were assuming that you had read the analyses of earlier films , and you would need to know which ones were the earlier films .
We made an effort to link from the later films to the earlier films , citing the previous explanations , but it still helps to have read the early material first .
On the other hand , the more of these we did the more details we noticed .
Early analyses did not often address whether a film worked under a theory other than replacement theory ( fixed time or multiple dimension ) , as the point was to present how replacement theory resolved those films .
The genetic problem was not discussed for quite a few years .
Similarly , problems with recall devices , solutions to predestination paradoxes -- a lot of the theory stuff -- appears later .
We were learning while we were writing .
Of the early materials , all were written exclusively by me ( although sometimes I bounced ideas off of others , most commonly Kyler C. B .
Young , who is perhaps the best analyst I know in this subject , sometimes others ) except for Final Countdown , which was done by John " A1 Nut " Cross , who had been one of the most dedicated readers of the site and asked many questions .
I did take something of an editorial / oversight position on that , raising issues I was not sure he had addressed adequately and helping get it in shape for publication , but the work , and its solutions , is his .
It should also be noted that beginning with Primer , that is , immediately after Deja Vu , there was a format change .
Up to that time , all analyses were done as single articles , some very long ; Primer was the first analysis written to be published at The Examiner .
Because of that site 's emphasis on many shorter articles , our analyses were serialized , and from that point up through Project Almanac the " sections " of the present web pages were , with some edits , the original articles as they appeared there .
That makes them somewhat more independent , although some of the " last time we wrote " material has been excised in many cases .
Terminator Genisys was being analyzed at the time of the transition back to this site , so it retains some of the formatting of that approach .
There is also a page of other films , movies of which I am aware are time travel films but were not treated here for a long time , some of which are now analyzed , others which might be , and others which probably will not be .
Preliminary comments on each are given .
I attempt to update it , adding films as I become aware of them and removing them as pages are created for them , but some films will probably stay on that list for quite some time .

The section Discussing Time Travel
Theory has been greatly expanded thanks to our work at The Examiner .
The old articles are still here ( and are still worth reading and often cited in our analyses ) , but during our tenure at the other site we were called upon to do a " Theory 101 " series .
This was followed by answers to questions and a " Theory 102 " series addressing some of the same and some new issues .
You will find everything here from what happens if you kill your grandfather to the Novikov Self - consistency Principle , Schrödinger 's Cat , and the Butterfly Effect .
Nearly all of these are items that have arisen frequently in letters .
All the web pages are linked in the column to the right at the top of this page , the section on theory appearing below the list of movies analyzed .
Again , all the articles in the theory section are written by me except one , A Critique of the Spreadsheet Theory by Sergiy Koshkin , which I agreed to post to my site at the time .
Sergiy wrote another response , which was published at Gaming Outpost , a site which quite sadly is no longer available .
I still answer letters , at MJYoung@MJYoung .
Net , although I should caveat that I have become notoriously bad at checking my e-mail .
I do answer everything when I get to it , but I often get to it only once or twice a month .
It is fastest to reach me through my Facebook account , and I have other social network site presences linked from the M. J. Young Net home page .
For what it 's worth , material on this site has been recommended reading in college courses on metaphysics , and I have been consulted on a number of scripts for various time travel productions .
I 'll let you know when any of them are produced .
I should also say what I find myself explaining to people : I am a proponent of Replacement Theory , and my work here is primary aimed at showing how it works and why it is the best theory of time for resolving time travel issues yet devised .
I understand Fixed Time Theory and various forms of Multiple Dimension Theory , all of which are presented and discussed in the theory section and sometimes referenced in the movies and other pages .
Do n't confuse me for an impartial source , though : I have examined the theories and come to a conclusion , and my analyses of movies are primarily asking how the events would work under Replacement
Theory , not what theory the authors are trying to use ( although I do consider that in most cases , particularly in later analyses ) .

Other Pages
Several other pages of interest appear on the site , worth your attention .
There is a section of correspondence , renamed communication and including in addition to a few of the many letters written about pages on this site some materials that appeared on other web sites , all with answers from me .
You will find those indexed in that right hand menu column above .
A collection of miscellaneous pages arose while I was writing for The Examiner .
These included time travel movie news items , anticipated release dates of films , and other rather " dated " materials , but also included a few " best of " articles in which I attempted to identify time travel movies I thought were worth watching for various reasons .
That , too , is indexed in that column .
The Perpetual Barbecue is a short story by the author of this site , originally published in the defunct RPG Review , in which time travel causes a day to repeat itself , for better and for worse .
There was a guestbook which you are invited to read ; regretably , Yahoo !
discontinued support for signing these when they bought GeoCities ( one of many reasons we are no longer at GeoCities ) -- but you get a faster response from me if you use e-mail anyway .

SANTA MONICA , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
The harsh reality of the economic fallout is n't that Joe the plumber can't buy his business or that people 's retirement funds are being lost or that unemployment is rising ; the harsh reality is that people will die .
Already , since food prices began to rise 100 million more people have been pushed into poverty , according to the World Bank , with as many as two billion on the verge of disaster .
Almost half the world 's population , let 's remember , live on less than $ 2.50 per day .
Millions die annually of hunger and starvation , and more than a billion do not have access to fresh water .
These numbers are poised to rise dramatically with population growth , dwindling natural resources and higher consumer prices across all goods and services .
So as the stock market tumbles and the world economy falters , it 's important to remember that it 's more than financial losses we are talking about , it 's the loss of life .
And increasingly it is n't just people in far - off places around the world who are succumbing to such extreme hardships .
Note this : Job losses in the state of Indiana have caused the child poverty rate there to spike 29 % since 2000 .
The wealth gap in the United States and around the world is at record levels -- and it has serious consequences .
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported this week that the gap between the rich and the poor is getting bigger around the world , and that the U.S. is experiencing the biggest dichotomy .
We are experiencing the largest wealth gap in history .
Further erosion of the economic floor will only send more people plunging into destitution .
This is why it 's so important to fix the economic crisis -- now .
We 're all linked
Wealthy nations are trying mightily to correct the daily economic woes plaguing the world .
An emergency economic summit has been called .
Brash measures have been taken .
Interventions of all sorts have been enacted .
Developed nations realize that they are intricately tied to one another 's economies because of sophisticated financial instruments .
When one nation loses so do the others , as we are finding out these days from as far away as China and Korea .
But there 's another link that has n't been much talked about : the emerging markets .
The emerging markets rely on the strength of the bigger economic powers to grow , more so even than bigger economic powers rely on each other .
The capital - markets erosion has yet to be fully felt in these countries as the trickles they rely on may stop coming down .
And here is the sad end game of the ripple effect : it takes food out of the mouths of children , it shuts the water taps and it sends hordes of people into lives of despair .
We need to solve the world 's economic crisis not only for ourselves so we can continue to live at the standard to which we are accustomed , but also so people can continue to live -- period .
The economic crisis we are facing today and likely tomorrow is about more than numbers .
There are faces to go along with every digit of value lost .
And that is something we will never be able to quantify .
However , we should recognize the losses we are incurring daily before our eyes -- every five seconds a child dies because of a lack of food or water -- are a matter of life and death .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - European shares fell more than 4 percent on Monday as global recession fears hit banks and energy shares , with Volkswagen a rare exception as Porsche disclosed its increased stake in the carmaker .
By 7:33 a.m. EDT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 4.3 percent at 794.28 points , adding to Friday ’s decline of 4.9 percent , although it was off a session low of 784.29 .
“ It is all following from the panic seen in the Far East .
The whole thing has gone well beyond what is deemed as sensible .
There is probably a lot of distressed selling , hedge funds or mutual funds having to meet redemptions , ” said Mike Lenhoff , strategist at Brewin Dolphin .
“ The market seems to be discounting a severe recession and is focusing on the prospect of a downturn which is longer and deeper than expected , ” added Lenhoff .
Japanese stocks tumbled to 26 year closing lows on Monday and most other Asian markets fell heavily in chaotic trade as investors feared a flurry of central bank moves would not be enough to stave off a global recession .
Banks took the most points off the European index .
HSBC , BNP Paribas , Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank were down between 8.9 and 15.7 percent .
“ Financials are down a lot .
I do n’t think there will be much let up until we are basically well into the recession and investors feel there is going to be an end to it , ” added Lenhoff .
Energy shares were also lower .
Crude fell by 3 percent as an emergency production cut by OPEC was shrugged off by traders anxious about the onset of a deep recession .
BG Group , BP , Royal Dutch Shell and Total were down between 6.6 - 10 percent .
Pharmaceutical stocks were also in the doldrums as European drugmaker Merck trimmed its full - year operating margin target .
Roche , Sanofi - Aventis and AstraZeneca were down between 1.7-4.9 percent .
VOLKSWAGEN JUMPS ON PORSCHE STAKE NEWS
Volkswagen jumped 86.6 percent after sports carmaker Porsche said on Sunday it had raised its VW stake to 42.6 percent of votes and controlled a further 31.5 percent via cash - settled options .
Analysts said the news would intensify a short squeeze in VW shares .
British bank HBOS also bucked the downtrend , up 2.5 percent .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in the Financial Times over the weekend the proposed merger between LloydsTSB and HBOS was the right step to save the bank as no other bidders had come forward .
National Bank of Greece gained 8 percent .
Greece ’s big banks , which have agreed to a 28 billion euro government rescue plan , said the scheme will enable them to get state funding if and when needed and be on a par with European peers .
Underlining worries on the macroeconomic front , the German Ifo index which measures indications about German business sentiment fell to its lowest level since May 2003 on expectations the export sector will take a big hit from weakened foreign demand .
“ The Ifo business expectations were consistent with the view that prospects are not good and that a recession is taking shape , ” added Lenhoff .
At 10 a.m. EDT U.S. new home sales data will give the latest snapshot of the state of the U.S. housing market .
Across Europe , the FTSE 100 index was down 3.8 percent , Germany ’s DAX slipped 3.2 percent and France ’s CAC 40 index was 5.3 percent lower .
Ethiopia sent troops into Somalia as part of a US and British - backed bid to topple the Shabaab 's more moderate allies , the Islamic Courts Union , and replace them with internationally - backed transitional federal government .
Although the courts union had managed to impose order on the lawless nation , which has been without a functioning government since 1994 , it was suspected by Washington of harbouring foreign al - Qaeda fighters .
Since the invasion , however , the country has reverted into all - out anarchy and clan warfare , with the increasingly brutal anti-Ethiopian insurgency costing thousand of lives and sparking a refugee crisis that has spilled into neighbouring Kenya .
In the sanctuary of his Capitol office with an audio recorder rolling , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger describes Republican legislators as the “ wild bunch ” and , referring to a Latina lawmaker , casually says that “ black blood ” mixed with “ Latino blood ” equals “ hot ” -- a fiery personality .
The governor is heard on a six - minute recording , obtained by The Times , of a meeting with some members of his inner circle last spring .
At the time , Schwarzenegger was struggling to persuade Republican lawmakers to embrace his plan to place billions of dollars in borrowing on the November ballot .
It ’s unclear why the session was taped , but Schwarzenegger occasionally records private meetings so that speechwriters , in particular , can keep a record of his thoughts and cadence .
This audio recording mainly consists of relaxed banter among Schwarzenegger and a few aides , and it offers an unusually candid look at his administration when the doors are closed .
On the recording , Schwarzenegger ’s Democratic chief of staff , Susan Kennedy , says Assembly Republican leader George Plescia of San Diego resembles a startled deer .
That draws a chuckle from the Republican governor , who a moment earlier had referred to Plescia ’s predecessor , Assemblyman Kevin McCarthy , as “ Bakersfield boy . ”

But Kennedy offers praise for Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia , the lone Latina Republican in the Legislature .
The governor and Kennedy debate her ethnicity , and Schwarzenegger opines that whether she is Cuban or Puerto Rican does n’t matter much .
“ I mean , they are all very hot , ” the governor says .
“ They have the , you know , part of the black blood in them and part of the Latino blood in them that together makes it . ”
He goes on to recall a former weightlifter and competitor , Cuban - born Sergio Oliva .
“ He was like that , ” Schwarzenegger says .
Garcia and McCarthy called the conversation irrelevant , even funny , when contacted by The Times on Thursday .
Plescia had no comment .

Garcia said the conversation did n’t bother her in the least .
She called herself an “ unpolished politician ” and said Schwarzenegger had shown nothing but respect for her .
“ I love the governor because he is a straight talker just like I am , ” Garcia said .
“ Very often I tell him , ‘ Look , I am a hot - blooded Latina . ’
I label myself a hot - blooded Latina that is very passionate about the issues , and this is kind of an inside joke that I have with the governor . ”
Margita Thompson , a spokeswoman for Schwarzenegger , issued this statement : “ This is a small part of a long conversation that is taken totally out of context .
The governor respects every member of the Legislature and holds them in the highest regard .
It is not uncommon for him to have fun and joke with the members while they ’re working , especially during very tense negotiations . ”
The meeting probably took place in the Ronald Reagan Cabinet Room , the governor ’s de facto office that adjoins his smaller official quarters .
The conference room faces east toward lush Capitol Park and has a long conference table that serves as a giant desk .
The sword from Schwarzenegger ’s movie “ Conan the Barbarian ” rests on a nearby table .

Participants were Kennedy , who was Cabinet secretary under former Gov. Gray Davis ; Gary Delsohn , a former Sacramento
Bee reporter and author who recently became Schwarzenegger ’s chief speechwriter ; and Walter Von Huene , a former TV director who is a close friend of the governor .
Von Huene , a fellow cigar smoker and chess partner of Schwarzenegger , also serves as an informal speech coach .
Schwarzenegger ’s voice is heard first on the recording .
He teases Delsohn and lavishly praises Kennedy as the conversation begins , suggesting that he knows the recording device is on .
He calls Kennedy a “ major , major champion . ”
“ Got that on tape ? ” Kennedy says .
“ It ’s on tape , ” Delsohn answers .

The free - flowing conversation took place amid negotiations over the governor ’s proposals for a giant public works package .
At the time , Schwarzenegger ’s own party was resisting the sheer size of the plan -- the largest in state history -- which entailed tens of billions of dollars in borrowing .
They eventually settled on a package worth $ 37 billion , placed on the November ballot .
On the recording , Kennedy and Schwarzenegger review an exchange between Kennedy and McCarthy , the Central Valley lawmaker who was then the lead negotiator for the Assembly ’s Republicans .
“ You really pissed him off , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ But you know something ?
You pissed him off because it hit home .
That ’s why it pissed him off .
People always get irritated ; always when you hit something that is the truth , that ’s when people flame out . ”
Schwarzenegger says he had to control himself , and tried to be “ really gentle ” in the day ’s negotiations with his fellow Republicans .
He calls it “ dancing the dance . ”
Advertisement
But he says to Kennedy : “ Anyway , so you hit him , you hit Bakersfield boy hard today , ” referring to McCarthy , who had warned against upsetting the Legislature ’s minority Republicans .
The governor goes on to describe the negotiating session :
“ And then all of a sudden she comes in out of nowhere .
She says , ‘ Yeah , but you are f------ the governor .
Everything that means something to us , you ’re not including . ”
Kennedy replies : “ I could n’t help it .
I could not stay quiet . ”
Advertisement
Schwarzenegger : “ I stayed quiet . ”
Kennedy then says that McCarthy , who is leaving the Assembly this year , ignored the governor ’s specific requests on transportation funding .
“ He does n’t care .
There ’s no price , ” Kennedy says .
“ Anyway , do n’t get me started again .
I am glad he ’s running for Congress . ”
McCarthy , who in June won the GOP primary for the 22nd Congressional District , said Thursday that the conversation was typical of the honest back - and - forth that was occurring at the time .
Advertisement
“ I thought it was funny , ” McCarthy said when told of the exchange about him between Schwarzenegger and Kennedy .
“ What is on that tape is no different than what we said to one another ” during private negotiations , he said .
On the recording , someone then asks about Plescia , who had been elected Assembly Republican leader but ceded negotiations on the infrastructure bonds to McCarthy .
Kennedy dismisses him .
“ Plescia looks like the deer that keeps getting caught in my yard when I leave the gate open , ” said Kennedy , who owns a home in Marin County .
Kennedy then apparently makes a face , and the governor laughs .
Advertisement
“ Great look .
I love it , ” Schwarzenegger says .
“ There was the Academy Award right there . ”
Kennedy says Plescia has “ big eyes that just kinda like stare like a Stepford wife .
He ’s a good - looking guy .
Happy .
Perky . ”
Schwarzenegger then turns to analyzing whether Plescia can “ control that wild bunch upstairs ” -- the Assembly ’s Republicans -- “ because that is like a very , uh , unique , uh , unruly bunch of guys and girls . ”
They move on to Garcia , a Cathedral City lawmaker who is the daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants .
On her website , Garcia is described as “ born on the Lower East Side of New York to teen parents . ”
Advertisement
“ Bonnie Garcia is great , ” Kennedy says on the recording .
“ She ’s a ball - buster .
She ’s great .
Is she Puerto Rican ? ”
“ She seems to me like Cuban , ” Schwarzenegger says .
“ She ’s not Mexican , ” Kennedy replies .
“ No , ” the governor agrees .
Advertisement
“ But she said something , ” Kennedy says , “ and I thought , I thought she was Puerto Rican . ”
Then Schwarzenegger offers a theory .
“ She maybe is Puerto Rican or the same thing as Cuban .
I mean , they are all very hot .
They have the , you know , part of the black blood in them and part of the Latino blood in them that together makes it . ”
Schwarzenegger then drifts off into a conversation about Oliva , who once was one of Schwarzenegger ’s great rivals .
Advertisement
As Schwarzenegger waxes nostalgic about Oliva , Kennedy abruptly says in the background : “ I ’m leaving . ”
Conversation trails off , and the recording ends .

It was created by a 22 - year - old programmer going by the online handle Sigvatr , who says on his website that he is from Brisbane and works part - time as a service station attendant .
Sigvatr , who claims the game is " fun and funny " , is also responsible for the website spreekillers.org , which ranks real - world killing sprees based on the number of victims .
In an email interview , Sigvatr , whose real name is Eric Vaughan , said he had not been contacted by anyone in police or Government over the game , which had been downloaded " over a hundred thousand times " .
" People will think I am a terrible person , but I believe that Muslims ' regard in society is now just that little bit more accepting because of what I have done , " Vaughan said .
In his letter , Trad said he believed Muslim Massacre was a breach of the sedition provisions of counter terrorism laws and laws that prevent the incitement of violence against sections of Australian society .
He cited the case of Belal Saadallah Khazaal , 38 , from Lakemba , who was found guilty in September of making a " do it yourself terrorism guide " knowing it could be used to assist a terrorist act .
Khazaal had compiled the online manual , which included an assassination hit list of prominent political figures , based on information sourced from the internet .
But the response to Trad from the Attorney - General 's department was little more than a two - page explanation of Australia 's content classification and racial discrimination laws and the government bodies tasked with administering them .
The response noted that the game 's creator " has voluntarily taken the game down from the internet " .
However , the game is still freely available to download from muslimmassacre.com .
Trad said the letter looked like a standardised form response and accused the Government and police of selectively applying counter - terrorism laws .
He said the Khazaal case had set a precedent that should be applied to Muslim Massacre and its creator .
" I could imagine what would have occurred if the game had been developed , God forbid , by a Muslim with Western people as the targets .
The people would have been immediately subjected to criminal prosecution , " Trad said .
The Attorney - General 's Department said it was up to the Australian Federal Police to investigate whether the game breached sedition laws .
Trad said he received a response from the federal police " telling me that I can complain to the Australian Communications and Media Authority if I wished " .
But it is unlikely ACMA can do anything to have the game removed from the net as it is not hosted on Australian servers .
Trad said he felt he was being " palmed off " to bodies such as the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission , which took years to investigate claims .
" I do not have faith in ACMA .
You may note that even though they found a certain radio station to be in breach of the code prior to the Cronulla riots , all they did was ask them to get some cultural training , " he said .
British Muslim youth organisation the Ramadhan Foundation has also called for the game to be banned , saying it was " unacceptable , tasteless and deeply offensive " .
" When kids spend six hours a day on violent games , they are more likely to go outside and commit violence , " the group 's chief executive , Mohammed Shafiq , said .
In September , Queensland Police Minister Judy Spence said police were investigating the game to see whether it breached any legislation .
No announcements relating to the case have been made since then .
A Queensland Police spokesman said the game had been examined and " no offence was detected " , but police had referred the matter to Canadian authorities as this is where the game is being hosted .
In 2006 , the Government was powerless to remove from the internet a racist board game based on the Cronulla riots .
It was eventually removed by the US - based web host , Angelfire , following extensive lobbying by anti-racism groups .
Similarly , in 2007 a game based on the Virginia Tech massacre , developed by a Sydney man , was removed by its web hosting service after the Federal Government failed to come up with a way of using its powers to have the game blocked .
However , this sort of content could be blocked in future if the Government proceeds with its controversial plans for mandatory ISP - level filters of " illegal " material .
Yes , it ’s free code time again .
I ’ve been neglecting the blog for some time so hopefully this will make up for it .
Think of it as that conciliatory heart - shaped box of chocolates used as a sorry way to make up for forgetting about your birthday , after which , I go back to my old ways of sitting on the couch all day watching sports , ignoring you .
In version 2.2 of Hazel , I added mini AppleScript and shell script editors so that people could enter scripts inline without having to go to another program and saving it to an external file .
I ’ll admit , I did n’t set out to make an uber - editor since it was intended for small scripts .
Nonetheless , a user recently pointed out that when a line wraps , it ’s hard to tell if it ’s a continuation of the previous line or a new one .
One of his suggestions was putting line numbers in the left gutter .
If you do n’t know what I ’m talking about , look at TextMate ( the example he cited ) or XCode ( you need to turn it on in preferences ) .
I thought it might be overkill for a script editor that will mostly be used for scripts less than ten lines long .
I ’m instead considering doing an indented margin for continuation lines .
Less visual clutter and addresses the problem at hand .
Nonetheless , I was curious about implementing line numbers .
Poking around , I found some tips on how to do it but it seemed like there were odd problems implying it was n’t as straightforward as one would think .
So , snatching some free time in between other things , I decided to tackle the problem .
I looked into subclassing NSRulerView .
The problem is that NSRulerView assumes a linear and regular scale .
Now , to make it clear , I am talking about numbering logical lines , not visual ones .
If a line wraps , it still counts as one line even if it takes two or more visually .
The scale is solely dependent on the layout of the text and ca n’t be computed from an equation .
Despite these limitations , I went ahead and subclassed NSRulerView .
If anything , NSScrollView knows how to tile it .
I had this notion that NSRulerView was a view that synced its dimensions with the document view of the scrollview .
With a vertical ruler , I assumed it would be as tall as the document and the scroll view just scrolls it in tandem with the document .
Not so .
It ’s only as tall as the scrollview .
That means you have to translate the scale depending on the clipview ’s bounds .
I added some marker support via an NSRulerMarker subclass that knows about line numbers .
The line number view will draw the markers underneath the labels a la XCode ( with the text inversed to white ) .
The sample project uses another subclass which will toggle markers on mouse click .
While NSRulerView usually delegates this to its client view it made more sense to just do it in a subclass of NSRulerView .
You have to subclass something to get it to work and it made more sense to subclass the ruler view since the code to handle markers never interacts with anything in the client view anyways .
Personally , I find it an odd design on Apple ’s part and would have preferred a regular delegate .
The project is linked below .
The main classes are NoodleLineNumberView and NoodleLineNumberMarker .
Some notes :
To integrate : just create the line number view and set it as the vertical ruler .
Make sure the document view of the scrollview is an NSText View or subclass .
Depending on the order of operations , you may have to set the client view of the ruler to the text view .
The view will expand it ’s width to accommodate the widths of the labels as needed .
The included subclass ( MarkerLineNumberView ) shows how to deal with markers .
It also shows how to use an NSCustomImageRep to do the drawing .
This allows you to reset the size of the image and have the drawing adjust as needed ( this happens if the line number view changes width because the line numbers gained an extra digit ) .
Note that markers are tied to numerical lines , not semantic ones .
So , if you have a marker at line 50 and insert a new line at line 49 , the marker will not shift to line 51 to point at the same line of text but will stay at line 50 pointing at whatever text is there now .
Contrast with XCode where the markers move with insertions and deletions of lines ( at least as best as it can ) .
This is logic that you ’ll have to supply yourself .
More details , including performance notes , can be found in the Read Me file included in the project .
I ’m putting this out there because I ’m probably not going to use it and it seems like a waste of some useful code .
Also , my apologies to the user who asked for this feature .
I feel like somewhat of a jerk going through the trouble of implementing the feature and not including it .
It was more of a fun exercise on my part but I still feel it ’s not suitable for Hazel .
That said , I may consider adding it and having it available via a hidden default setting .
Votes for or against are welcome .
In the meantime , you can use the code however you want .
MIT license applies .
Please send me any bug reports , suggestions and feedback .
Enjoy .

Could the days of becoming half - man , half - machine be getting closer ?
Cyberdyne , a company just outside of Tokyo , has manufactured a robotic suit designed to help the elderly and disabled walk and go up stairs .
Cyberdyne says even partially - paralyzed individuals are able to move around slowly with this device .
YOSHIKAZU TSUNO / AFP / Getty Images
The " hybrid assistive limb , " HAL for short , attaches to a user ’s waist , thigh , and calf .
Cyberdyne says brain signals that tell HAL to help a person walk are captured through the skin .
HAL calculates how much energy the person will give towards the movement then it compensates with the right amount of assistance .
Even though HAL weighs 22 lbs , the user does not have to carry around that weight as HAL is supported through its exoskeleton .
The battery charge should last five hours under normal use .
HAL is currently available only in Japan .
Users can choose between three different sizes .
It can be rented monthly for $ 2,200.00 for two legs or $ 1,500.00 for one leg .
Cyberdyne has also designed a full robotic suit that includes assistance for the arms , allowing users to lift and hold objects they normally would n’t be able to .
A release date for this has not been announced .
One question - can't help but wonder why the company chose the names " Cyberdyne " and " HAL " - names that have less - than - stellar reputations from the Terminator movies and 2001 , A Space Odyssey .

Lack of transparency got us in to this mess , lets not let lack of transparency keep it messy .
The government needs to immediately setup an exchange , it could be ebay.
gov with more in depth description fields , for all I care .
However they do it , EVERY asset the government will buy or sell as part of this buyout needs to be shown and described with the price the government is willing to pay or sell the asset for .
Why ?
To keep government honest .
Not that anyone in our government would ever put their own personal self interest first and over or under pay for an asset .
Nor would they ever take those assets and then sell it for less than market value in exchange for “ personal considerations ” .
I know it could never happen , but just to make sure it doesnt , we need to post the assets involved in the bailout and the prices paid .
When the assets are sold , they need to post those prices as well
In addition , by posting the assets in an ebay like auction / sales environment , it would enable independent buyers to come in and buy the assets using private money rather than government money .
The benefit of course is obvious .
By adding liquidity to the process , the government could be responsible for less and sellers could get more .
This is the only way I can think of to get true transparency .
Without it , i promise you that it will be IMPOSSIBLE to account for how much money was spent on the assets and how much cash was generated from the sales process and what the net cost or benefit to taxpayers is .
Without transparency , we wont have any idea how this all played out .
None .
Which creates the real problem of allowing it to happen again , but with the government needing the bailout .
One last note on Senator Dodd ’s proposal to extract shares from companies that the government buys assets from as part of the bailout , all i can say is HELL YES .
As a shareholder in the USA Treasury and USA Inc , if you want to borrow money from me or sell assets to me that you cant sell anywhere else , then I want stock / warrants or options as my vig .
You got to pay to play .
In the real world , if you want mezzanine financing , you pay in kind , and provide warrants .
This should be no different .
if you dont like the deal , find someone else to buy the assets .
On the subject of executive compensation , if they need government bailout money , take away 100 pct of exit pay and any bonuses .
Let them quit if need be .
If you think you cant find someone else to take the current CEOs place , think again .
No matter what number they pick for the CEOs compensation , its more than a lot of very smart people are getting paid elsewhere and those people would be more than happy to take a raise and replace the CEO who just took about his / her company
Let me put this a different way .
The most powerful person in the world today is Sec Treasury Paulson .
There is the very real possibility he will be replaced in January .
The person replacing him will be paid a government salary of I think , no more than 400 k .
if they can find a replacement for him , they can find a replacement for any CEO running any company for a reasonable amount

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Monday night 's broadcast .
Campbell Brown says McCain gave limited access to his records and Obama has only given a doctor 's statement .
( CNN ) -- On Monday , Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden released his medical records .
Overall , he 's in good health .
But the records detail his 1988 treatment for two brain aneurysms , a very serious condition .
My question tonight , though , is for all the candidates :
Why are you all being so cagey and so careful with this information ?
This is stuff voters really need to know and it is time for the presidential and vice presidential candidates to be a lot more forthcoming .
Let 's start with Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain .
At 72 years old , if he wins this election , he will be the oldest man sworn in for his first term as president .
Watch Campbell Brown state her case »
He has survived four bouts of melanoma .
In the spring , his campaign invited a handful of reporters to view some 1,100 - plus pages of medical records .
Reporters were only given three hours to go through more than 1,100 pages of documents and some of that information raised new questions .
Now , to McCain 's credit , he has been more forthcoming than any of the other candidates , but it is not enough .
Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama has released almost nothing -- just a one page note from his doctor saying he's in excellent health and some basic test results from past checkups .
Sure , he 's a young guy and he looks healthy , but so did John F. Kennedy and he had serious health issues .
Voters have a right to a full and thorough vetting .
Sen .
Biden today gave us a lot more information than Obama , but he , too , left out some important details that raise questions about his health .
As for McCain 's running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin , she has released nothing .
No medical information at all .
So , from Gov. Palin , anything , frankly , would be helpful .
Look , I get why they would n't want to release this information .
It 's intrusive .
It is personal , very intimate stuff .
If it were me , I would n't want my medical records made public .
But I 'm not running for anything and the American people should have the right to know everything there is to know about the health and personal vitality of our next president and vice president .
We are expecting these people to not only be around for at least the next four years , but to be at the top of their game .
To all the candidates , you may all be in great shape , in the best of health , but based on how little you have been willing to tell us , how can we be sure ?
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .
All About Joseph Biden • Sarah Palin • John McCain • Barack Obama
SCRATCH the surface of free - market capitalism and you discover something close to visceral fear .
Recent events provide a good example : the US treasury ’s extraordinary $ 800 billion rescue package was an enormous comfort blanket designed to restore confidence in the ailing financial markets .
By forcing the taxpayer to pick up the “ toxic debts ” that plunged the system into crisis , it aims to protect our ability to go on behaving similarly in the future .
This is a short - term and deeply regressive solution , but economic growth must be protected at all costs .
As economics commissioner on the UK ’s Sustainable Development Commission , I …
Sheryl Crow Rescues Wild Mustang
Breast cancer survivoris truly an advocate for many great causes .
Last night she sang at the " Save Lives " concert , in L.A. which promotes breast cancer awareness .
Not only is Sheryl busy singing and standing up for all she believes in , but she also has come to the rescue of a wild mustang and would like other horse and or animal lovers to do the same .
When the star learned of the government 's plan to do away with these beautiful horses she took action .
" There 's legislation going on right now about exterminating these great wild mustangs ... ( They 're ) truly one of the great representatives of our native culture here in America .
Wild mustangs are really true to the heritage of this country ; they help us to remember who we are ...( and ) the government is trying to have them run off cliffs and things . "
While Crow is currently touring she has close friends taking care of her mustang but is making provisions to have the horse stay at her ranch in Tennessee .
In May of 2007 Crow adopted a 2 - week old son , Wyatt Steven Crow .
The two live on a 154 acre ranch in Nashville .
Crow dated cyclist Lance Armstrong for several years and the two had plans to marry but in the end went their separate ways .

Barack Obama and the Democrats are stealing the election .
Massive voter fraud is being carried out , even as we speak , by their henchmen , known by the innocuous sounding Association for Community Organisations for Reform Now , or Acorn .
Clever bastards .
The only problem ?
Despite the screaming wall - to - wall coverage of " Democratic voter fraud in 11 swing states " as seen on Fox News and even the once - respectable CNN , none of it 's true .
None of it .
In just the last week , we 've had a phoney stunt raid in swing state Nevada ( where Acorn had been cooperating with officials for months , concerning problem canvassers they 'd long ago fired ) ; a Republican election official in swing state Missouri tell Fox News that she 's being beseiged with fraudulent registration forms from Acorn ( in a county where they 've not done any registration work since August ) ; a Republican sheriff in swing state Ohio , who , the very next day , suddenly requested the names and addresses of hundreds of early voters ( with evidence of exactly zero wrong doing , but lots of Democratic - leaning college student in the particular county , and John McCain 's state campaign chair as a partner in the investigation ) ; and a screaming front page headline in Rupert Murdoch 's New York Post about a guy who claims he was somehow tricked by Acorn into registering 72 times ( but read the article closely to note he says he registered at the same address each time , which , even if true , would allow him - you guessed it - precisely one legal vote . )
It 's an old Republican scam , but it 's never been carried out with more zeal than this year .
The Republicans have been putting so much time , money and resources into the propaganda leading up to this over the last four years , we should have expected no less .
As luck would have it , the Democrats have a man who , as an attorney years ago , actually had the temerity to join the US department of justice in representing Acorn in a successful lawsuit , forcing the state of Illinois to follow the law by allowing citizens to register to vote at the department of motor vehicles .
What a scoundrel .
That , of course , was before the department of justice , under George Bush 's corrupt command , would itself become politicised by the very Republicans so desperate to keep low - income voters from voting , that they were willing to fire their own US attorneys for failing to bring phoney charges of voter fraud in key swing states like Nevada and Missouri .
So what are the crimes that have caused all the Sturm und Drang on US television and talk radio , and in several otherwise respectable newspapers and even by the McCain campaign itself ?
The only actual crime here is that Acorn managed to register some 1.3 m low - income ( read : Democratic - leaning ) voters over the past two years .
The rest is , pretty much , just made up .
But in the bloody and desperate trenches of the Republican war on democracy , that 's more than enough to kick in a last minute surge of lies that may - with the help of a compliant and lazy corporate US media - wreak enough havoc , scare enough voters , confuse enough people and plant enough seeds to call an Obama victory into doubt on November 4 .
If you can't win it , steal it .
If you can't steal it , claim the other guy stole it .
If you can't claim the other guy stole it ( yet ) , say they 're about to and then kick up smoke that maybe someone will believe you .
( Heckuva job , CNN . )
Here are the facts .
Acorn verifies the legitimacy of every registration its canvassers collect .
If they can't authenticate the registration , or it's incomplete or questionable in other ways , they flag that form as problematic ( " fraudulent " , " incomplete " , et cetera ) .
They then hand in all registration forms , even the problematic ones , to elections officials , as they are required to do by law .
In almost every case where you 've heard about fraud by Acorn , it 's because Acorn itself notified officials about the fraud that 's been perpetrated on them by rogue canvassers .
Most officials who run to the media screaming " Acorn is committing fraud " know all of the above but do n't bother to share those facts with the media they 've run to .
None of this is about voter fraud .
None of it .
Where any fraud has occurred , it 's voter registration fraud and has resulted in exactly zero fraudulent votes .
You 'll hear that Donald Duck , Mary Poppins , Dick Tracy , Mickey Mouse and ( new this year ) the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys football team have all had fraudulent registrations submitted in their names .
That 's true .
And we know this , why ?
Because Acorn told officials about it when they followed the law and turned in those registrations , flagged as fraudulent .
What you wo n't hear is that federal law requires anybody who does not register to vote in person at the county office to show an ID when they go to vote the first time .
So , unless Donald Duck shows up with his ID , he wo n't be voting this November .
You need n't worry , no matter how much even John McCain himself cynically and dishonourably tries to mislead you .
If it quacks like a duck , in this case , it 's likely another Republican Acorn voter fraud lie .
They haul it out every two years .
Just days before the 2004 presidential election , rightwing whack job Michelle Malkin claimed that Acorn was registering terrorists to vote in swing state Ohio .
Problem was , that was a lie .
In 2006 , again just days before the election , the new US attorney in swing state Missouri ( recently appointed , since the one before him refused to bring such charges ) , filed voter fraud indictments against Acorn workers in the state .
Problem was , bringing election - related indictments that close to an election was a violation of the department of justice 's own written policy .
And Acorn had nothing to do with it , other than turning in the employees to officials .
Getting the picture ?
It 's a hoax .
All of it .
But it 's been an effective one , as it's served to distract from very real concerns about tens of thousands of voters who have been illegally purged from the voting rolls in dozens of states , as the New York Times reported in a remarkable front page investigative story .
That story followed a report the week before from CBS News detailing still more wholesale purges of voting rolls in some 20 states .
That will be the November surprise , when thousands , if not millions show up to vote only to find they are no longer welcome to do so and are forced to vote on a " provisional ballot " which may or may not be counted .
These real concerns of election fraud , such as voting roll purges , electronic voting machines that do n't work and so much more that actually matters , have been obscured by the smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand of the Republican party 's phoney Acorn voter fraud charade .
And where they can , they 'll parlay it all into new photo ID restrictions at the polls ( knowing full well that some 20 m , largely Democratic - leaning voters do n't own the type of ID they 'd need to jump over that next Republican hurdle . )
Yet , with all of the unsubstantiated , wholly bogus claims of voter fraud being carried out by Democrats , there remains at least one case of absolutely ironclad , documented , yet still - unprosecuted case of voter fraud that , for some reason , Republicans do n't much like to talk about .
We can only wonder why .
Chris Carroll speculates :
RGE - Capitalism and Skepticism :
Why does the economy perform so badly under Republican Presidents ?
The facts are hard to dispute ; indeed , the historical record is now so stark that diehard Republicans are probably starting to wonder if there is a curse ....
Democrats have outperformed Republicans by almost any measure of economic achievement ( GDP growth per capita , unemployment , inflation , budget deficits ) ....
Thanks to the profligacy of the current administration ... average Federal spending as a fraction of GDP ... under Republican Presidents now exceeds that under Democrats over the measured period ....
The pattern holds up when the span of historical analysis is extended farther back in time ... using stock returns to measure economic performance ....
( Data are available on my web page , at http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/opinion/CapitalismAndSkepticism.)
An economist ’s natural inclination is to say that there ’s no point in pondering why Republican performance has been so dismal , because the question cannot be answered with the rigor demanded by professional respectability .
But as the tenure of George Herbert Hoover Walker Bush shudders to a calamitous close , history seems to require that we try to give an answer .
That answer ca n’t be found by drilling down ( so to speak ) into the specific policy proposals of the two parties , which over the years have evolved in ways too arbitrary to permit any meaningful generalization .
Nor are there any clearly identifiable differences in doctrine that should translate into a reasonable expectation of better economic performance under one party or the other ....
Maybe capitalism works better when its excesses are restrained by skeptics than when true - believers are writing , interpreting , judging , and executing the rules ....
Maybe ... capitalism works better when it is being held accountable to some external standard .... [ F ] or better or worse , the defining manifesto of the latter part of the age was Milton Friedman ’s Capitalism And Freedom .
But that book ’s power derived partly from its fierce independence from the orthodoxies of its time ....
The book for the new epoch has not been written yet , but I have a proposed title : Capitalism and Skepticism ...
' Joe the Plumber ' endorses McCain He says Obama would turn U.S. into socialist nation

Joe the Plumber endorsed Republican John McCain for president on Tuesday .
Samuel J. Wurzelbacher gained national attention when Democrat Barack Obama told him during a campaign stop that he wanted to " spread the wealth around . "
Their exchange about Obama 's tax plan aired countless times on cable news programs , and McCain repeatedly cited Joe the Plumber in their third and final debate and again at campaign events .
McCain points to Wurzelbacher as an example of the middle - class worker who would be hurt economically by an Obama presidency .
However , Wurzelbacher likely would fare better under Obama 's tax plan because it calls for no tax increase for working couples earning less than $ 250,000 a year - Wurzelbacher himself earns far less - and provides for a middle - class tax cut .
In a McCain rally at a flag store , Wurzelbacher said he feared that Obama would turn the United States into a socialist nation .
When a McCain supporter asked him if he believed " a vote for Obama is a vote for the death of Israel , " Wurzelbacher replied , " I 'll go ahead and agree with you on that . "
He did n't elaborate on how Obama , who has said his commitment to Israeli security is " nonnegotiable , " would be caustic for the Jewish state .
Fame brought media scrutiny to Wurzelbacher , who turned out to be an unlicensed plumber with unpaid back taxes .
Renewable energy —
By Stephanie on October 16 , 2008 at 11:49 am
Turn on the news these days and all you ’ll hear about is the economy – stock market losses , banks failing , unemployment on the rise .
Surely there are tough times ahead .
Some skeptics say that the current economic crisis is no time to talk about alternative energy and related investments .
But the real experts advise that a green economy can and should be based on building and inventing our way out of a recession by focusing on solar power , wind energy and geothermal exploration .
First of all , the obvious .
Thousands of jobs will be created by the expansion of green industry .
Just check out this article which reviews career opportunities in a green economy , state by state .
Long term , as we work to secure our energy independence , we can start to chip away at our tremendous national debt which is due in large part to the purchase of foreign oil supplies .
National security ?
Surely that will be beneficial to an improving , green economy .
As we extract our troops from unstable Middle Eastern countries , we no longer need to fight to protect our “ addiction to oil . ”
We will literally be clean and sober , living with the fresh abundant energy supplies from the sun , wave movements , wind , and geothermal .
Recently , the movement towards a green economy took hold on September 27 with a National “ Green Jobs Now ” day .
People all over the country held signs , organized rallies and took photographs of their efforts to bring the importance of a green economy to the politicans through this Day of Action .
As shown on the following video , green jobs will help pull people out of poverty and address the serious issues of global warming – two most important issues facing the world right now .
Over 700 communities and 50,000 people directly participated in Green Jobs Day , making the inaugural effort to jump start a green economy a huge success .
As organizers point out , there is much that can be done to increase renewable energy options , which will provide jobs for millions of people .
For example , technical assistance is needed for installation of solar panels and wind turbines .
Laborers can help weatherize existing buildings .
Engineers and electricians are needed for public transit improvements and grid upgrading .
Did you miss the Green Jobs Day celebration last month ?
No worries – the effort continues !
You can sign the petition and still make your voice heard so that our elected officials recognize the importance of a green economy and do something about it !
I urge our elected officials to invest in creating millions of green jobs and a Clean Energy Corps .
We ca n’t drill and burn our way out of the current crisis .
We can invent and invest our way out .
We can create new pathways out of poverty and curb global warming at the same time .
We will do this by retooling our factories , rebuilding our communities , and repowering America with 100 % clean and renewable electricity .
It ’s time to build an inclusive green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty .
This is not the answer to our economic crisis :
DIGG THIS
In the midst of highly unpopular bailouts of Wall Street , many justifications have been given about why Washington feels the need to act .
Some claim that capitalism and the free market are to blame , but we have not had capitalism .
If you compare our financial capital to our aggregate debt , this would be obvious .
In the same way , we have not had a truly free market .
The monetary manipulations of the Federal Reserve , a complex tax code , the many oversight agencies and their mountains of regulations show that we are far removed from a free market economy .
Another unsatisfying argument is that certain entities have to be bailed out because of their economic importance .
Supposedly , some entities can be so big , so important , that no matter what they do , citizens must perpetually sustain them .
Even limited government has a basic duty to defend against force and fraud .
Some argue that force is somehow permissible just because the entity engaging in it is " economically significant . "
But one could use this reasoning to prop up slavery .
It could be deemed unfortunate but economically beneficial , and indeed these arguments have been used historically to deprive people of their liberty .
But slavery should never be tolerated regardless of any economic benefit , just as systemic fraud should not be tolerated .
Some banks on Wall Street should fail .
Fannie and Freddie should fail .
They are perpetrating fraud against the people .
Yet , government insists on rewarding behavior which should instead be investigated , prosecuted , and punished .
There has been much evidence of fraud at Fannie and Freddie , but when one man , Franklin Raines , defrauded the organization out of millions of dollars through illegal accounting tricks , and ends up agreeing to pay back just a fraction , one could argue that it was well worth it to him .
Fannie went on to only get more deeply involved in subprime mortgages after this investigation .
Several organizations are suffering right now precisely because the free market is trying to work and punish mismanagement , if only the government would get out of the way and let it .
Perhaps banks are not lending to each other because they know that complicated accounting standards , created in part to defend against confiscatory tax policy , enables false fiscal pictures to be presented , which erodes trust .
But this is not a time for the government to step in with more burdensome and complicated regulations , or more foolish liquidity injections .
This is a time for some banks to fail , and remaining banks to deal honestly and transparently once again .
More regulations will only result in more lies .
Just as economies that turned away from slave labor had a transition period , our economy would transition as well , but in the end , if we turned to honest , sound money and a truly free market , we would end up with a more just society , founded on truthfulness and decency , not subject to the violence of force or the whims of fraudulent institutions .
Unfortunately , it seems we are headed into a new era of slavery , however , where all taxpayers will be forced to render to the Fed and big banking interests the bulk of the fruits of their labor , possibly through higher taxes but definitely through the eroding force of inflation .

A man in Tuscaloosa , Alabama claims that the bar Catch 22 had kicked him and his friends out for being " too gay " .
The video below was on the local news and Joseph describes his alleged treatment .
Joseph : " I was in the back of the bar , Catch 22 , and we were picking music by the jukebox and the female owner of the bar just kicked out my friends for dancing ' too gay ' ... She proceeded to tell me that she was the owner of the bar and that if I 'm to continue coming to her bar , that it 's not OK to be open because it 's not a gay bar and it never will be .
And then she added that gay people disgust her . "
The bar owner denies any wrongdoing and says the incident did not occur .
She says Joseph and his friends are welcome back anytime .
The ACLU says nothing can be done legally because Alabama does not protect people on the basis of sexual orientation .

Taser guns have been rolled out to general duties police officers across New South Wales .
The State Government yesterday distributed 229 of the weapons and is planning to give two to each local area command .
Only the riot squad and the tactical response units previously had Tasers , which have been used about 50 times in the state since they were introduced almost five years ago .
The weapons have been fitted with video cameras to record their use .
Police Minister Tony Kelly says senior officers are being trained to use the weapons as part of the first stage of the roll - out .
" They 'll be used by specially trained officers .
They 'll be used by the sergeant , the supervising sergeant and the duty officer , " he said .
" We 've trained over 400 police and we 'll train another 1,000 police over the next few months to use these guns . "
NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione says
Taser use will increase as a result of the roll - out but believes lives will ultimately be saved .
" The use of Tasers in any situation in NSW is primarily to give police a less - than - lethal option to subdue violent offenders , " he said .
" It 's just all about saving lives , particularly those violent drug addicts , those that might be mentally unstable .
It simply gives us another option , rather than just a gun . "
The State Government announced in May that it would spend more than $ 1 million on 229 Tasers for general duties police .
It said 2,000 supervisors would be trained to operate the weapons .
A report by the NSW Ombudsman into the safety of Tasers is expected to be tabled before State Parliament later this month .
Sarah Palin had this to say of Senator Barack Obama as far as this presidential campaign goes , " There is a time when it 's necessary to take the gloves off and that time is right now . "
In reference to her smear campaign of Obama when she said he had “ palling around with a terrorists ” namely , Bill Ayers , a former member of the Vietnam - era militant Weather Underground organization .
But before I get to taking off the gloves with Sarah Palin , America just does not have the tolerance or the time to be dredging up a fleeting acquaintance that Obama had with Ayers .
I state that we do not have this tolerance or time to be using this smear - tactic directed towards Obama because of the dire times we are all facing as a nation .
Just last week , the government had to bailout Wall Street where the taxpayers are angry .
In fact the reason for this bailout was because of John McCain who did not believe in regulation , and now does .
His economic advisor Phil Gramm wrote many of the laws that brought this financial house of cards down to their very foundations .
Americans do not have time or patience to care about this as they look at their investments all but disappear in front of their eyes .
America does not have the patience to engage in smear - tactics when over 47 million still go without health insurance .
I still think of child up late at night with a terrible cold and his parents fraught with fear in whether or not to take him to a doctor because of this lack of health insurance .
Newsday reported this past week where donations to food pantries are slowing due to an increasing need by many who are falling behind and cannot afford food which is a basic necessity .
Helping Hand Rescue Mission in Hunting Station , NY has reported , " There are no canned green vegetables , cereal , peanut butter , jelly , tuna or fruit juice .
Beans , pasta sauce , canned tomatoes and the basic cost - saving one - pot meals such as Rice - a - Roni and macaroni and cheese are scarce .
Coffee , tea and hot chocolate are a rarity . "
Does Palin think those who are going without food care who Barack Obama once had a fleeting acquaintance with when they cannot feed their families ?
Well shame on her for forgetting these people .
A few weeks ago , Hurricane Ike basically leveled the town of Galveston , Texas where little is being reported of the devastation that horrific storm had on it .
People lost their homes .
Does Palin even get that an entire town was leveled ?
Does she think that those affected by Ike care ?
When Palin had this to say , " Our opponent though is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country , " Sarah Palin does not have a full understanding of what that era was like .
It was an angry time in our history where many did not like our government which is similar to today ’s sentiment regarding this present war which we are embroiled in namely the Iraq War .
Also , palling around means a deep friendship where in this case they were not .
Second , there are some who would think of doing this , but do not actually do it .
There is a difference between thinking and doing .
Our country is far from being perfect , but at least there are people like Barack Obama who are trying to make it better as he did as a community organizer , a state senator , a U.S. senator and hopefully as our next president .
To Ayers credit , at least he saw that the way to change things was to engage people through the use of their minds since he is now a university professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
Now if we are going to take off the gloves , Gov. Palin as it relates to terrorism , I do suspect that innocent animals such as wolves and bears do see you as being their terrorist .
According to the Anchorage Daily News , they reported , “ The 180 volunteer pilots and aerial gunners who are the backbone of the program can get $ 150 in cash for turning in legs of freshly killed wolves , Gov. Sarah Palin 's office announced Tuesday . ”
Words cannot adequately describe my contempt for Palin to promote this hunting of wolves and handing out an extra bounty by having hunters turn in their legs .
Palin has actually sanctioned the killing of these beautiful animals .
The Anchorage Daily News even reported in a separate article , “ Opponents of the state 's predator control program are blasting lawmakers and the governor for approving a $ 400,000 appropriation to educate Alaskans about the aerial shooting of wolves and efforts to reduce bears in some areas . ”
When our education system coast - to - coast is failing our citizens especially our children , she chose to educate people on how to kill animals .
Perhaps that money could have been best used to promote sex-education in Alaskan public schools .
I will leave it there .
While I have only watched these video ’s once and can’t bring myself to watch again , here are heinous videos of bear hunting which Sarah Palin does support .
If you have small children around , I am strongly cautioning you not to let them see this massacre .
This country just does not have time for Swift - boat tactics coming from the McCain campaign through Sarah Palin .
In fact the AP reported , “ And though she may have scored a political hit each time , her attack was unsubstantiated and carried a racially tinged subtext that John McCain himself may come to regret . ”

Economic Woes Edge Obama Over McCain Stephanopoulos :
No candidate over 50 % support in Sept. has lost since ' 48 .
Sept. 24 , 2008  --
The economic turmoil on Wall Street and fear among voters about the nation 's economy has boosted Democrat Barack Obama 's presidential candidacy , giving him his first clear lead over Republican John McCain in the presidential race .
Obama now leads McCain among likely voters by 52 percent to 43 percent , according to the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll .
That is a significant swing from the most recent ABC / Washington Post poll earlier this month that gave McCain a slight 49 - 47 point edge .
" It is all about the economy , " ABC 's chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos told " Good Morning America " today .
" People are angry and shocked and worried about the economy and that is all helping Barack Obama right now . "
The latest poll finding marks the first time that the Illinois senator has surpassed 50 percent support among likely voters in the presidential campaign -- a key coup for the Democratic candidate .
" You have to go back to 1948 for the last time when a candidate having this kind of a lead in late September lost , " Stephanopoulos said .
Neither of the last two Democratic nominees , former Vice President Al Gore in 2000 or Sen.
John Kerry in 2004 , broke the 50 percent mark in pre-election ABC News / Washington Post polls .
Obama More Trusted to Handle Economy
Obama has squashed McCain 's convention gains by convincing voters that he can better address the nation 's economic crisis and is more in tune with the economic troubles voters now face .
An earlier ABC News / Washington Post poll on Sept. 7 found that on trust to handle the nation 's economy , Obama led McCain by about five percentage points .
" Now it 's up to a 14 - point lead for Obama on trust to handle the economy , " Stephanopoulos said .
On the question of which candidate voters feel understands the Americans economic problems better , Obama now has a 24 percentage point lead over the Arizona senator .
" Barack Obama is blowing away John McCain on that point , " Stephanopoulos added .
" They say he gets it . "
Obama Erased McCain Edge Among White Women Voters
Two weeks ago , McCain came out of the Republican Party convention with his new running mate , Sarah Palin , at his side along with a substantial advantage among white voters and newfound strength among white women voters .
However the latest ABC / Post poll finds Obama has narrowed the gap to within five percentage points among white voters overall , and the two candidates now run about even among white women .
" He 's only getting 77 percent of Hillary Clinton voters , but he 's doing far better with Democrats overall getting 88 percent of Democrats , " Stephanopoulos said .
The poll also found the governor of Alaska has some of her luster among voters .
" There was a big Sarah Palin effect coming out of the Republican convention , " Stephanopoulos said .
" She had high favorable ratings .
She 's coming back down to earth a little bit .
Her favorable rating has gone from 58 [ percent ] on Sept. 7 down to 52 percent now , so a little bit of a deflation there . "
The ages of the presidential candidates have also become an issue for voters , according to the ABC / Post poll .
McCain is 72 while Obama is 47 .
" More and more people are worried about age , " Stephanopoulos said .
" Forty - eight percent of voters say they see that age is an issue .
And if you think age is an issue , those 48 percent of voters , they break heavily for Barack Obama by 30 points . "
McCain Holds Key to Bailout on Capitol Hill
Obama and McCain face a key test this week on how they handle the administration 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan for Wall Street .
Both presidential candidates agree that the administration 's plan should include caps on executive compensation , or golden parachutes .
But it is McCain who may ultimately hold the fate of the massive bailout plan in his hands .
" The big factor may be John McCain .
I was talking to top Republicans and Democrats yesterday , they both say that if John McCain does n't vote for this package , it is going to go down , " Stephanopoulos said .
" So he is facing a huge choice , a huge gamble also for McCain , " he added .
" McCain aides say he has n't made up his mind yet .
He 's laid out his own conditions as well but they want him to be seen and he wants to be seen as a champion of the little guy , " Stephanopoulos said .
" The Democrats say they 're not going to give John McCain a free chance to break away from President Bush , " Stephanopoulos said .
" The Republican members of Congress say that if he votes ' no ' that they 're not going to be at odds with him . "
Stephanopoulos said the Bush administration 's massive $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout package is n't a done deal on Capitol Hill .
Administration officials are pressing to get the bill passed by this weekend .
" Top officials tell me in Congress that ' It 's not soup yet . '
There is no deal yet .
They 're pushing to improve , they say , improve the bailout plan saying it has to do something to constrain executive compensation .
Something to give taxpayers equity in this deal .
Something to help homeowners facing foreclosure , " he said .
" It 's tough to see right now .
There is still a lot of negotiating going on right now , " Stephanopoulos said .
At the G - 8 summit , President Bush grabs German Chancellor Angela Merkel from behind and gives her a quick massage before rushing off .
Chancellor Merkel is not amused .
While the Middle East burns , our fearless leader is busy with his frat boy pranks .
